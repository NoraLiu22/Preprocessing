<p>The <a href="https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan">Strategic Plan</a> (agreed in 2015 at GB22) established five priorities for GBIF’s work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Implementation Plan presented here in this document identifies 22 activities which GBIF must undertake to address these priorities during the five-year period (and a set of specific tasks under each activity).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each year, GBIF reviews progress against these activities and available resources (including Secretariat staff and other uses of core and supplementary funding, as well as resources committed by GBIF Participants). Using this information, an Annual Work Programme is defined for the following year. Each Annual Work Programme identifies a prioritized set of tasks for work during the year. Annual Work Programmes in the second and subsequent years also report on progress against the plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Implementation Plan is reviewed and refined each year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Implementation Plan is presented here with updates reflecting progress during 2019 and planned activities for 2020 (the 2020 Annual Work Programme).</p>

<h3 id="_financial_situation"><a class="anchor" href="#_financial_situation"></a>Financial situation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat estimates a carry-over of €992,558 at the beginning of 2020. This amount is smaller than the carry-over from 2018 (€1,556,714) due primarily to Governing Board requested increase spending in 2019 on external contracts and workshops (€719,000) in the work programme. Given the level of capital held by GBIF and the uncertainty of contributions, the 2020 budget includes a smaller allocation (€413,000) for contracted activities in the work programme expenditure (i.e. non-salary costs allocated to calls, workshops, contracts, etc.) than proposed for 2019 at GB25, and €300,000 less than the actual 2019 spend after budget revisions. Staffing levels do not change in the 2020 budget. The planned expenditure for 2020 is €471,806 greater than the income projected in the budget. This is considered to represent a responsible balance between advancing GBIF’s mission and reserving some funds against future risks (€520,752 net capital forecast for the end of 2020).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This budget narrative also includes a second scenario that considers a brighter financial situation. It outlines priority areas of spending on contracted and workshop activities that would be submitted in subsequent 2020 budget revisions, should conditions allow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario 2 differs from the submitted budget in the following ways.  It also assumes an additional €300,000 in external funds or increased contributions from voting participants. This budget includes €660,000 for contracted and workshop activities in the work programme expenditures. The planned expenditure under scenario 2 for 2020 is €397,940 greater than the income projected in the budget. This is also considered to represent a responsible balance between advancing GBIF’s mission and reserving some funds against future risks (€594,618 net capital forecast for the end of 2020).</p>

This includes approximately €120,000 in funding for work by GBIF Secretariat staff in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fifth call for proposals under the Biodiversity Information Fund for Asia (BIFA) programme will be issued in late 2019 or early 2020, using €131,395 supplementary funds received from the Ministry of Environment, Government of Japan. Subject to agreement by the BIFA Steering Committee, we anticipate that €20,000 of this supplementary funding is to be allocated to Secretariat staff coordination costs during 2020.</p>

<li>
<p>Lastly, the European Commission has funded the SYNTHESYS+ project “to unify European natural science collections, effectively transforming them into an integrated data-driven pan-European research infrastructure”. GBIF is funded for €50,000 in 2020 (as well as €20,000 in 2021 and €20,000 in 2022) to advance joint planning for infrastructure components.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF is the result of work by thousands of people in agencies and institutions worldwide. This network’s long-term sustainability depends on demonstrating the value of such contributions and justifying continued investment of effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat can enhance efforts to develop capacity within the network and build an effective distributed help desk system that acknowledges and showcases relevant skills and experience that people across the network possess. Users of GBIF data products would also benefit from showcasing the network’s indispensable human resources and their impact on assessing and improving biodiversity data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these reasons, the next round of improvements to GBIF.org should enhance the network’s capacity to serve as a hub for the GBIF community by identifying its active contributors, integrating information on their relevant GBIF activities, and supporting broader knowledge exchange and skill development.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key task is to enhance GBIF.org to connect and display information on its contributors and other users of the site. This may include contact details (subject to individual control), formal roles (e.g. within participant delegations; in connection to publishing/improving datasets; based on training experience) and online participation in help desk discussions. Whether through the use of existing social or commercial platforms or through custom web application development, GBIF.org should absorb activity currently handled through the separate GBIF community site. GBIF should also build on experience during 2015–2016 in using digital badges to identify skills held by individuals. Such community functions will support the operation of GBIF Task Groups, externally funded projects like BID, and engagement of expert groups to curate GBIF data.</p>

<h4 id="_2019_progress_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_2019_progress_2"></a>2019 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat continues to improve current and develop new training materials as well as standardized arrangements for setting up training workshops based on re-usable curricula in key skills related to GBIF participation. This work is accomplished in close collaboration with trainers and mentors from the GBIF community, who contribute their time and expertise at little or no cost to GBIF’s core budget. The capacity enhancement programmes (e.g. BID, BIFA and CESP and GBIF involvement in other externally-led projects) are major motivating factors for the Secretariat to improve materials and support a growing community of practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two ways to measure the value of this investment in generating training materials are, first, the increased number of volunteer mentors and trainers across the network, which now stands at 93 in total, with 58 involved in the BID programme. Second, these programmes have sparked a sharp increase in both the number of data publishers and the amount of data from countries and regions not previously engaged in biodiversity data sharing, with the BID programme adding 90 new publishers from sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Together, with organizations in these regions that previously shared data, the new publishers introduced through the BID programme have added nearly 1.3 million occurrence records, filling critical knowledge gaps by increasing in the percentage of data for a country being published within that country and adding records for 1,194 species listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple training events involving the Secretariat and community mentors and trainers occurred or are planned in 2019, including the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>‘Train the mentors’ event to support data mobilization training within the BioDATA project covering Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia (Belarus, February)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training course on data skills within the BioDATA project (Tajikistan, June)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training sessions on establishing a GBIF Participant Node, including a focus on the benefits of GBIF participation, at the BID regional meetings in the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, June), Pacific (Fiji, August) and Africa (Cameroon, September)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacity enhancement workshop on data mobilization for projects selected under the Biodiversity Information Fund for Asia (BIFA), as well as for GBIF nodes in Asia (Viet Nam, July)
&amp; Training on development of GBIF Participant Nodes, offered to all node managers as part of the GB26 series of meetings (Netherlands, October)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacity enhancement workshop on data use for decision making for participants in GIZ-funded project to improve biodiversity information management in southeast Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, November/December to be confirmed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BioDATA project focused on developing skills in biodiversity data management and data publishing for undergraduate and postgraduate students from Tajikistan, Belarus, Ukraine, and Armenia. The project is run by the University of Oslo and GBIF Norway and exceeded expectations, with more than 8 mentors and 40 students trained on the GBIF publishing and data skills in two events that took place in Belarus and in Tajikistan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As well as these training events directly involving the Secretariat, a large number of replicated workshops based on the same materials have been carried out in association with various funded projects as well as node activities. For example, BID participants have already replicated the data mobilization and data use workshops 66 times, extending the impact of the BID programme to nearly 1,500 new students within the corresponding regions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat has continued to update training materials for data mobilization, decision making, for use in on-site training and in development of online modules. For the data use curriculum, GBIFS has been working with IUCN to refine guidance on the use of species occurrence data in species Red List assessments. This is one of the areas of collaboration included in a Memorandum of Cooperation between IUCN and GBIF Secretariat, finalized and signed in July 2019.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat has established a community-based Documentation Editorial Panel, aimed at prioritizing, developing and updating a core set of electronic guidance documents to support participation in the GBIF community. The panel includes membership from four global regions, and it will have held three meetings by August 2019. A consortium led by the VertNet team is producing an initial package of new and updated documentation in 2019, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<h4 id="_rationale_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_2"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strengthening of personal skills through international collaboration has been one of the great successes of the GBIF global network. During this implementation period, GBIF must build on this past experience (including the support mechanisms developed for the BID programme) to reinforce efficient training and capacity enhancement across the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Central to this is the development of a collaborative help desk capability and the alignment of relevant aspects of national training initiatives with a global curriculum to facilitate direct reuse of resources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_2"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To strengthen key skills, GBIF needs to develop and maintain a comprehensive set of clear reference information and training materials that support all GBIF audiences. Since 2016, the Secretariat has been upgrading documentation to deliver this comprehensive resource, first via concise explanatory text materials (including numerous translations by network members into French, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Russian). Some of these text materials will be supported by short videos that present key functional and operational aspects of GBIF. The aim is to deliver a structured set of short, clear, current and complete documents that enable GBIF stakeholders to gain an understanding of relevant aspects of GBIF’s work quickly, including formal Participation, establishing a national or thematic node, planning digitization, mobilizing data, discovering and using data, citing data, among others. This work complements significant activity among Participants to produce information and training materials relevant to particular audiences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF will organize all these materials to form a curriculum that builds and supports the skills and activities identified in GBIF’s self-assessment tools for nodes and data holders. A core set of these resources should provide new stakeholders with an effective introduction to GBIF’s structure, roles, approaches and solutions. Other more technical resources will provide the additional detail needed by those working in specific areas like digitization, data publishing and use of GBIF-mediated data. The Secretariat will coordinate ongoing maintenance and updates to this curriculum with contributions and translations from the network.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on discussions alongside the GB25 meeting in Ireland in 2018, the Kilkenny Accord developed a roadmap towards an open governance and funding model for the Living Atlas community. GBIFS established and has overseen contracts with an Administrative and Technical coordinator to support the community (€40,000) in 2019. GBIFS assisted in the ALA Advanced Workshop in Paris to help adopters move towards Spatial Portal capabilities. The Secretariat informatics team held a technical meeting with the ALA at Canberra in March to explore possibilities to collaborate, with the Registry/Collectory and a hosted data indexing process identified as an opportunity to reduce the costs of operation for Australia and show the value proposition of GBIF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2019 the Secretariat started exploring the potential for a lightweight portal solution that has been requested by several participants to lower the technical threshold. A concept of the simple hosted solution (static site generator and occurrence search) has been demonstrated to the Science Committee and Nodes Steering Group, and a visual design is in development for GB26. A showcase portal containing data generated through projects funded by the BID programme in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific has been chosen as the initial project in 2019.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The informatics team opened the <a href="https://registry.gbif.org">GBIF Registry administration</a> and piloted editing by external users (starting with GBIF Norway node staff). The administration console provides editing and registration capabilities of the core entities (institutions, datasets, etc.) and also provides oversight and control of the dataset crawling infrastructure and diagnostics. This is part of a strategy to progress towards becoming a more open platform for others to use by lowering the technical threshold through enabling infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A global nodes meeting and training event is taking place in conjunction with GB26 in Leiden, Netherlands in October (see 1b above). The training is a two-day course focused on the functional capacities involved in node development: positioning a node in the broader landscape, identifying key stakeholders, developing strategic and implementation plans and running effective training workshops. The online materials are being made public by the end of the 2019.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF network has initiated a programme creating a new role, the Biodiversity Open Data Ambassador, aimed at supporting a corps of experts who promote free and open access to biodiversity data. During its initial development phase without significant promotion, 42 professionals from 19 countries, representing each of GBIF’s six regions, volunteered to become Biodiversity Open Data Ambassadors. The programme is intended to recognize and support the active role that ambassadors have alongside the network’s node managers and staff, formal delegates, committee members and Secretariat staff. The GBIF Secretariat continues to develop resources to help ambassadors’ efforts, including presentation slides, talking points, posters, and support materials in both digital and print formats.</p>

<p><strong>Norway</strong>: GBIF Norway contributes as mentor to the regional GBIF network meeting in the Pacific in August 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spain</strong>: We have contributed to translations of training modules on managing a GBIF Participant Node, and we have hosted the online activities for these workshops. We have been mentors in the training activities on managing a GBIF Participant Node carried out in Trinidad. We will be mentors in the Global Nodes Meeting training in Leiden. We have been supporting GBIF Zimbabwe in establishing its GBIF Node. We have supported the development of the Living Atlases (LA) community. We are part of the LA interim committee and we have been active with the LA communication and outreach, promoting LA in different forums and conferences. We have supported and assisted new LA coordinators that will be helping the nodes that intent to use the Atlas tools. We have worked together with Nodes from UK, Australia, France, Sweden, Portugal and Canadensys to create video tutorials and online exercises for LA users around the world. We have supported other data managers of other Living Atlases installations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sweden</strong>: Reiterated capacity self-assessments have been made and the result added to the European nodes regional report (and we do well!). Additional ALA platform tools are being developed and offered to the Living Atlases Community. Apart from data publication (see below) the latter is probably the most significant contribution from GBIF-Sweden to the global biodiversity informatics  community.</p>
</li>

<h4 id="_rationale_3"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_3"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By coordinating national, regional and thematic networks, Participant nodes play an essential role in helping GBIF engage the broadest possible community of institutions, initiatives and individuals engaged in biodiversity informatics. GBIF must provide learning materials and tools to support nodes efficiently as they work to mobilize biodiversity data, promote the reuse of available data and support users by improving data management and quality. Preferred approaches enable any one node to invest in developing tools and capacity that others can easily leverage for the benefit of the whole community. The skills and experience of the node managers and other team members are recognized as uniquely valuable in helping new Participants establish their nodes and allowing the community to develop together.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_3"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_3"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF promotes capacity self-assessment as a tool to help nodes with planning and tracking progress at all stages in the development of national biodiversity information facilities. The results of these assessments can also identify important capacity needs to address with learning materials, tools and collaborative projects. The reuse and adaptation of the Atlas of Living Australia’s open-source software tools by a growing community of nodes between 2013 and 2016 is an example of successful collaboration based on the mutual needs of the countries involved. Additional support for this international partnership will allow still more nodes to benefit from the collective resources and expertise to build websites that provide biodiversity data and services to a range of national and regional user communities. The nodes’ teams will also engage in collaborative helpdesk activities to enable them to share knowledge across the scientific and technical domains handled by the nodes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is being maintained to deal with bug fixes, translations etc., and version 2.4 was released in 2019. Review of requirements for a revised IPT is on hold until there is greater clarity on how broad a data model for GBIF should be (see Activity 2a). With a new model in place, GBIF will design appropriate tools to map and publish data. The cloud-based IPT infrastructure maintained by the Secretariat continues to provide a fall-back solution for publishers unable to host their own installation or to find a third-party hosting option. As of June 2019, this option was being used by nine publishers associated with the BID programme and one publisher associated with the BIFA programme, sharing a total of 100 datasets. Cloud-hosted IPTs are expected to become more widely used in the coming months, especially with the use of volunteer mentors to provide help desk support for users of this option.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_4"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_4"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data publishers are an essential component of the GBIF network as they share their content through the common infrastructure. More than 800 data publishers actively distribute datasets through GBIF.org, and their ranks increase steadily. Publishers from different parts of the world often face unique challenges, though common themes emerge. These problems range from lack of data publishing experience or skills, lack of equipment, language barriers, difficulties in managing data hosting facilities, and the inability to publish high-quality data or curate data into the future. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) requires ongoing improvements and enhancements, including the establishment of hosted instances that reduce the technical burden on data publishers.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_4"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_4"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the model of the self-assessment tool for node managers, the Secretariat has developed a self-assessment tool for data publishers as part of the support for the BID programme, which will guide the work with collection managers and other data holders to assess and prioritize areas for capacity enhancement or investment. The Secretariat already operates instances of the IPT that data publishers lacking their own infrastructure may use, and Participants are encouraged to deploy instances of the IPT or other GBIF-compatible data publishing software to support data holding institutions. Planned enhancements to the IPT will simplify publishing pathways using spreadsheet templates as an alternative for the less advanced data publishers. GBIF will improve reporting to data publishers on both quality aspects of their data and uses of data documented through download DOI citations.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_5"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_5"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF’s national membership has remained largely static in recent years. Active participation in the network is confined to a limited number of regions, with the most dynamic activity in node collaboration and data publication focused in Western Europe, North America, Latin America, Oceania, increasingly sub-Saharan Africa and limited parts of Asia. Thus, significant parts of the world have little or no direct involvement in GBIF’s activities, which poses a risk to the long-term credibility of GBIF as a global collaborative network. Secretariat staff and existing Participants constantly engage potential new members through ad hoc contacts, but the situation calls for a more strategic approach to expand membership.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_5"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_5"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat will compile and maintain an up-to-date register of the status of GBIF engagement and relevant contacts in all countries, providing the Governing Board with an annual review that analyses progress and remaining gaps in membership across each region. Following the development of a coordinated engagement plan for each region, Participants and regional groups with strong contacts to relevant agencies in other governments may take the lead in engagement. The Secretariat will continue to develop strategic engagement through the CBD and other intergovernmental networks, as well as through the BID programme and other capacity-related activities. Adapting the GBIF.org interface to support key content in multiple languages will seek to address language barriers to national expansion, with targeted translation carried out both through external contracts and in-kind services provided by Participants.</p>

<p>The initial five-year phase of the BID programme reached its final year with a flurry of activity, closing all of the 63 projects in sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific supported by the European Union-funded programme. The Secretariat organized closing meetings and training events in all three regions focused on showcasing the achievements of BID, planning regional coordination of future biodiversity data mobilization and use,  highlighting the benefits of GBIF participation and establishing a GBIF Participant Node (see Activity 1b). A review of the impacts of BID in terms of data mobilization and use, capacity enhancement and sustainable outcomes, was commissioned following a competitive call and will be finalized later in 2019. An event to close the first phase of BID is being held in Brussels in late 2019, with the aim of summarizing the programme’s results to the funders and other stakeholders, as well as setting priorities for future biodiversity informatics development using the model of BID to strengthen and expand data availability in all global regions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on the success of the first phase of BID, the Development and Cooperation Directorate of the European Commission (EU DEVCO, or EuropeAid) expressed interest in extending the programme with additional funding. Details of this extension are nearly complete, but it is expected that GBIF will have flexibility to expand the geographic scope of the programme beyond the three regions targeted in the first phase. The BID event of the first phase of BID will include engagement with other providers of overseas development assistance to explore the potential to supplement the funding from EU DEVCO for future phases of the programme.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the April 2019 budget revision, €22,000 was added to hire an external consultant to identify potential funding streams from philanthropic organizations, and to help the Secretariat develop a strategic plan for a funding stream for these programmes. This work commences in late 2019.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_7"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_7"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among its other roles, the GBIF Secretariat coordinates efforts to expand the scale and scope of GBIF activity beyond the levels achievable using only annual core Participant contributions. GBIF Participants commit to establish and operate nodes which serve as significant centres for GBIF activity. Some nodes have sufficient resources to contribute skills and developments which advance GBIF’s work, while others may require external support to become fully active. A limited amount of funding has been allocated each year under the GBIF work programme to support capacity enhancement for GBIF nodes. GBIF or individual Participants may also secure supplementary funds to contribute to particular areas of GBIF work. Improved coordination of these various resources will assist GBIF to advance more rapidly at all scales.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_7"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_7"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Implementation Plan itself provides a framework for organizing information on Participant and supplementary fund resources to complement GBIF’s core funding. The GBIF Secretariat seeks information from all Participants on planned activities and commitments which may help to advance the work of other Participants or GBIF globally – examples may include funding for workshops; committed resources to develop tools, standards or best practices; mentoring actions; etc. These will be recorded as part of the overall GBIF Work Programme and updates will be presented in the GBIF annual report. A shared Implementation Plan also offers the opportunity for GBIF (either the Secretariat or Participants) to develop concept notes to seek supplementary funding to target currently unfunded or underfunded areas. The annual Capacity Enhancement Support Programme budget includes only limited funds, but existing supplementary funds (in particular BID and BIFA) align with these funds and leverage CESP tools and processes. Future supplementary funds should follow a similar model.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_8"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_8"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF network participants are able to reliably exchange data thanks to their adherence to a set of standards. As GBIF looks to grow in capability, enable exchange of richer content and improve the quality of data, the standards must be revised and evolve accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current standards adopted by GBIF are not yet adequate to accommodate the needs expressed by many potential and existing data publishers. Weaknesses in the model have led to ambiguous or over-complex data representations and unclear documentation, leading to difficulties in data integration and use. The main issues relate to uncertainties around the use of Darwin Core record types, the basisOfRecord element, and the use of Core and Extension vocabularies. Reviewing and updating the core domain model, tightening up the vocabularies and documentation and adopting more robust exchange standards will result in an easier to use, and a wider reaching GBIF data exchange network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_8"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_8"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF will work with TDWG and other key stakeholders to review existing solutions for a common domain model, working towards agreement on a model to adopt with key partners. This conceptual model should cover the main components of biodiversity information (the domain “classes” such as Specimen, Collection, TaxonName, TaxonConcept, Publication, Sequence) and document the mandatory and recommended properties expected for each component and the vocabularies that should control the properties. A review of existing vocabularies and their current uses will be undertaken and revisions and new vocabularies will be proposed where necessary. A revision of the Darwin Core Archive mechanism and supporting tools, such as the publishing toolkit (IPT) and the data validator, will be undertaken to accommodate the richer content model and the new recommendations from the W3C CSV on the Web working group. GBIF should continue discussions with other key global biodiversity data infrastructures to develop comprehensive catalogues to support discovery and normalization of instances of the most critical domain classes (particularly TaxonName, TaxonConcept, Collection, Specimen, TaxonOccurrence).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to completing this knowledge graph, GBIF should be equipped to link between people, datasets, cited use and funding agencies through the correct attribution chains using e.g. Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) as potential mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Species 2000</strong>: The Catalogue of Life + steering committee consists of the following parties: Barcode of Life Data Systems, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Encyclopedia of Life, Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and Species 2000 / ITIS / Catalogue of Life, and Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Recently the Distributed System of Scientific Collections joined the steering committee and discussion with Lifewatch to join are ongoing. The steering committee will become part of the Board of Directors of Species 2000 to jointly govern the new Catalogue of Life Infrastructure.
The COL+ project team consists of representatives of Species 2000, GBIF Secretariat, Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the Illinois Natural History Survey. In 2019, the new tooling for the assembly of the Catalogue of Life will go in production by the 4th quarter. The monthly editions will be resumed in the new Catalogue of Life infrastructure and persistent, unique identifiers for names will be part of the new infrastructure. By the end of 2019 all functionality of the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy will be integrated in the new Catalogue of Life infrastructure. A new public portal will be in beta version by the end of 2019. The infrastructure will be hosted by GBIF.
In 2019, the requirements for scientific names and taxonomic services of all COL+ consortium partners as well as other important stakeholders will be captured. Also the use of the COL in scientific publications will be analysed. GBIFS and Species 2000 had discussions with the European Environmental Agency concerning taxonomic backbone services, and in the context of the Synthesis+ project will continue these discussions together with DiSSCo.
GBIF and Species 2000 are working together with the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin to organize a workshop to gather the taxonomic expertise to build the best global resource for Lepidoptera taxonomic data. Together with the Conservatory and Botanical Garden of the City of Geneva and the World Flora Online Consortium a workshop is planned to gather the taxonomic expertise to build the best global resource for plant taxonomic data.
Species 2000 and GBIF are organizing a symposium on getting towards a joint global names and taxonomic infrastructure at the Biodiversity_Next conference in October in Leiden, The Netherlands.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_9"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_9"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most significant challenge to improving the quality of aggregated occurrence data is the continuing need for a comprehensive checklist of known species, and even for a comprehensive list of published scientific names. Interpreting and mapping names depends on the quality and completeness of these resources. Even in cases where names in occurrence records are incorrect or misspelled, better names infrastructure can assist by increasing confidence that fuzzy match algorithms or human intervention is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Delivering these resources is the focus of a number of GBIF Participants and other stakeholders, including the Catalogue of Life partnership, WoRMS, nomenclators (IPNI, Index Fungorum, ZooBank) and many national, regional or taxonomic databases. A comprehensive resource for scientific names and taxon concepts organized at least as a workable reference classification (but with support for additional classifications as appropriate) would also benefit other infrastructures, including Encyclopedia of Life, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Barcode of Life and GBIF nodes, and improve interoperability between data from these infrastructures. It would also be beneficial to accommodate vernacular names, informal names for undescribed species and other identifiers such as Barcode Index Numbers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_9"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_9"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF and many other partners have worked on this challenge and much progress has been made, but we are still far from a comprehensive shared solution. GBIF has been in discussion with Catalogue of Life, EOL, BHL, BOLD Systems, nomenclators and others about pooling resources to deliver the best possible complete nomenclator and catalogue of all species, along with improved tools to enable the taxonomic community to own and maintain these resources more effectively. The challenges are not primarily informatics issues. The most important requirement is to understand the constraints and needs of existing content holders and the features that are required from an infrastructure that can be embraced by the majority of taxonomists. The solution must build on existing initiatives and give sufficient credit and benefit back to those who have invested in developing data. It must be flexible enough to accommodate existing well-managed datasets without disrupting their activity and to accommodate more open mechanisms to support wide community input for taxa which need more work. In the longer term, it should support evolution towards ownership of curation responsibilities by international taxonomic societies or other bodies recognized by researchers for each group. The infrastructure should include processes to review and interpret unrecognized name strings found by GBIF and others in aggregated data. Once these requirements have been resolved, implementation must rapidly follow to offer these resources as open public datasets for use by all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Netherlands has coordinated a significant commitment for 2017 and 2018, led by NLBIF and including resources both from Species 2000 and Naturalis. This funding will enable GBIF and partners to direct significant effort to this area over the period.</p>

<p>In 2019 the <a href="https://gbif.org/grscicoll">Global Registry of Scientific Collections database</a> (GRSciColl) was migrated to a public website managed by GBIF and editing capabilities provided through the enhanced, and open, registry administration console. The migration and resurrection of GRSciCol identified that there are several other catalogues (CETAF, IndexHerbariorum) that need consideration; GRSciCol needs to evolve to synchronize with authoritative catalogues such as Index Herbarium and collection management systems directly. Therefore, GBIF continues involvement in the TDWG task group on the development of a collections description data standard (TDWG CD).

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Natural history collections are the largest source of data on biodiversity outside nature itself. Collectively the worlds natural history collections number about 3 billion specimens and document over 300 years of active human exploration of biodiversity on earth. In addition the fossil remains provide us with glimpses into the very far past before humans existed. The collections and their ancillary materials (images, collectors’ notes, sequences, measurements, etc.), contain colossal amounts of data that should be digitized and shared. Only about 10% of the world’s collections have been digitized and only a portion of digitized collections are shared publicly through the internet. A large number of current GBIF publishers comprise natural history museums and herbaria. The Secretariat will work with Participants to deliver the most comprehensive catalogue possible of collections, including metadata to publicize undigitized collections as a first step towards their digitization and mobilization.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_11"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_11"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF has a range of tools, including fitness-for-use groups, other community consultations, feedback channels, direct communication with authors of scientific studies, and societal demands, to identify and collect data needs. The Ebbe Nielsen Challenge for 2016 focuses specifically on tools and algorithms to identify significant gaps. These gaps may relate to different facets of the data, including geography, taxonomy, time periods, and coverage of particular ecosystems or land units. Addressing these gaps may require focus on gaining additional occurrence records, targeting data areas missing from published records, or getting additional metadata elements. By consolidating and prioritizing demands for data content, in the context of already accessible data and knowledge of resources which are not yet available as open data, GBIF will be positioned to inform collection and data holders, funding institutions and political decision makers of the most worthwhile and cost-effective ways to extend the available knowledge base.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_11"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_11"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat will harmonize and document data mobilization demands from different sources. Simple tools are required to support needs capture, including informative documentation and justification for such demands. Automated assessment and reporting of gaps will be included where this proves possible and valuable. This combined information can support transparent decision making and target setting for gap-filling efforts, allowing all interested actors to step in at appropriate levels. GBIF will coordinate with efforts through the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to identify and address significant knowledge and data gaps, including outreach and funding strategies for gap-filling . A thorough, regularly updated overview of data coverage in gbif.org both makes it easier to identify gaps, and to monitor progress and efficiency of mobilization efforts over time. GBIF should offer (e.g. annually) a brief report of significant gaps which need to be addressed. Such a report may be valuable to Participants and funding bodies to stimulate and evaluate digitization and mobilization options.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_12"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_12"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF serves as an integration point for any source of evidence of the recorded occurrence of species in time and space. A primary role for the GBIF infrastructure is to serve as a comprehensive single point of access for discovery, access, use and curation of all such evidence. Several classes of data are already well-supported within the GBIF network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These include collections data, observations from field research, and many categories of citizen science data. However, there are other new and developing streams of data which should be accommodated if GBIF is to serve as the platform for supporting comprehensive data assessment and modelling (e.g. for GEO BON Essential Biodiversity Variables, IPBES assessments, Red List assessments, etc.). These include efforts to mine historical data records from literature, genomics activities and particularly barcode-driven surveys, and potentially species-level data from remote-sensing systems. More work is also still needed to engage with the full spread of research activities delivering sampling event data of various kinds. GBIF needs to ensure that it provides simple, effective and beneficial ways for researchers to share these and other streams of Darwin Core compatible data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_12"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_12"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Existing GBIF models include support for occurrence records and for sampling-event datasets which organize occurrence records as sets of observations deriving from a single field sample (which make provision for GBIF to accommodate “absence data” from surveys which did not record a particular species despite searching). These approaches are core to all potential streams of data to be added. GBIF therefore needs to ensure that existing tools and documentation are clear and usable for relevant research communities and that GBIF sufficiently understands existing data management by these communities to avoid proposing unnecessary additional work. During 2016, GBIF is coordinating a consultation which builds on past engagements with genomics activities such as the Global Genome Biodiversity Network. Recommendations from this consultation are expected to guide improvements in GBIF tools, documentation and communications to support publishing of molecular data in formats which can be integrated within GBIF. Several projects are working on automated or human mining of data records from literature. GBIF needs to learn from these initiatives and ensure that its tools support integration in a simple way. GBIF should also seek exemplar projects for bringing occurrence records from remote sensing into the network.</p>

<p>GBIF has tools and support mechanisms in place to enable publication of several categories of biodiversity data. The key requirement is for increased engagement with, and support for, the communities of institutions and individuals who hold these data. Such engagement is normally most effective at the national level, although international networks also have an important role to play.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_13"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_13"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary need is for national Participants to engage with the broadest possible spread of data holders within their countries, for organizational Participants to share relevant data and for the whole GBIF network to promote the importance and value of sharing data. The GBIF Secretariat will focus on enhancement to documentation and tools and on highlighting priorities for complementing existing data and addressing gaps. Data holders should be encouraged and assisted in sharing data in the richest form appropriate for the data in question (sampling event data where relevant elements are available, occurrence data for other spatially explicit data, checklists otherwise) and with the most open data licences possible. As well as natural history collections, Participants should identify opportunities to build partnerships with citizen science groups and promote the value of open access to data from environmental impact assessments and monitoring. GBIF should argue the case for open data as part of the policy for funding agencies, research councils, industry bodies, licensing authorities, development banks and other stakeholder groups.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many researchers hold potentially valuable data which are not yet in a suitable digital format for integration into GBIF. Historical publications are a similar source of valuable data which remain inaccessible. This offers an opportunity to establish a community platform to capture information on such datasets where the researcher or owner lacks the time or capability to make the data available as a GBIF-compatible dataset, and to enable interested individuals to volunteer time to collaborate with the owner to publish a dataset, potentially in conjunction with a data paper credited to all parties. Such a model may address a key bottleneck in bringing valuable data online.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_14"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_14"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat, or an interested Participant, should develop a test environment to explore this model. The model should support identification of basic information on datasets which may be rescued, including details of ownership, etc. Volunteers may be required to undergo some training or demonstrate some knowledge of GBIF data publishing and the taxa concerned prior to adopting a dataset for mobilization. Mobilization should be include consultation or partnership with the owner and should deliver quality metadata and a valid mapping of the original information. Opportunities should be explored for publication of resulting datasets as data papers as an incentive to all parties.</p>

In order to benefit from data disseminated through journals, the Secretariat will lead or coordinate activity to engage directly with publishing houses, journal editors and authors to promote GBIF-compatible approaches to publication and the use of GBIF-operated repositories as accepted or preferred destinations for supporting data.</p>

<p>There exists a significant portion of data available through GBIF.org that is not actively curated by a data host. In some cases, there are no resources or desire to make further edits to the datasets. These datasets are effectively orphaned and the GBIF.org version of the dataset is often the last remaining version available on the internet. As GBIF develops mechanisms to provide feedback to data publishers and support curation of datasets, we need to consider that these orphaned datasets will not be updated with corrections or migrated to adhere to modern data standards.</p>

<p>The task is to ensure that all datasets have a primary version available on the internet which acts as the source for GBIF.org to index. Orphaned datasets will be identified, extracted from the GBIF.org index and loaded into the most suitable data repository supporting versioning: either run by a GBIF participant or a central cloud installation of an IPT. As issues are identified anyone will be able to volunteer to correct the source data, upload a new version into the data repository, document the changes applied and follow editor guidelines. Once republished GBIF.org will reflect the updated data, and the provenance of changes will be traceable through the repository versioning system. Policies for editors, including attribution and the settlement process for disputes will be documented. This entire activity could be led and implemented by a GBIF Participant.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assessing data quality includes applying data validation tools to capture and monitor suspected and confirmed errors and ambiguities in data, highlighting useful areas for additional information (metadata and qualifiers) that would improve usability and enhance processing options, and documenting completeness and standardization of information both within a dataset and within aggregated data. A number of validation tools exist in the wider community, and should be brought together to mutually profit from investments and to more efficiently plan future distributed development efforts. This will benefit data publication frameworks as well as individual data holders, giving concrete feedback on best gains in data management.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_17"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_17"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consolidation requires an overview of existing data validation tools, their goals and application areas, building on existing community work to produce an annotated tools catalogue (including work by TDWG and the GEO BON “Bon in a Box”). To make best use of development resources, GBIF will support collaboration between networks to bring those developments together and harmonize efforts, so that further development can more efficiently concentrate on new priority areas. Consistent tests and reports will both inform users of the suitability of data for their use, provide feedback to publishers on their holdings, provide a measure for the overall state of the network, and help to prioritize improvement options. Ideally, the most common reporting measures and formats are agreed and unified to a degree that allows publishers an easy cross-walk between and integration of data quality reports supplied by different services and aggregators.</p>

<p>In a global network, curation of the shared data pool is increasingly becoming a joint responsibility of aggregators, publishers, experts and data users. The goal is to integrate corrections, improvements, additional information and analysis results in a timely manner, with better visibility to all network participants and data users. Expanding the existing knowledge base requires improved communication channels and workflows for collaboration between all actors, tools to capture and rapidly display new or improved information, commentary and data, and not least tools, credit systems and support to engage expert activities.</p>

Building on existing data filtering and data improvement workflows in the community, GBIF tools and mechanisms are to support the identification of relevant data, their cleaning and preparation for specific purposes, and the sharing of the results of such processes with the wider community. Input collected through existing feedback mechanisms  is to be raised to a visibility level that supports and drives the usefulness of the published data.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most significant user community for GBIF is academic researchers. Even policy-related uses of GBIF often derive from the work of such individuals. It is accordingly important for GBIF to understand the needs of researchers and academic societies and to communicate clearly regarding the tools and services GBIF can deliver. Communication should include information and support materials for students and early-career researchers, on both publication and use of data, including citation, use tracking and data papers. University faculties and libraries may be important channels for this information. In addition, GBIF needs to engage more closely with taxonomic societies and other academic bodies which could be key collaborators in curating and improving data. Achieving such an outcome depends on understanding how GBIF can become a more central tool for their work, so that work on digital knowledge directly benefits those who contribute.</p>

Particular focus should be given to opportunities to explore models for such communities to assist GBIF with data curation. Few university programs include clear guidance and promotion for open data sharing. GBIF should make use of its own documentation materials and of curriculum materials from throughout the GBIF community to engage with biological science faculties and university libraries to share information on GBIF tools and resources and practices.</p>

<p>GBIF data are aggregated from many sources and are consequently heterogeneous, varying in fitness for various uses. During 2015–2016, GBIF established three task groups on data fitness-for-use, in agrobiodiversity research, in distribution modelling and in research on invasive alien species, to document how these communities use GBIF data and to understand their data quality demands. The resulting reports inform data mobilization, data processing and improvements to GBIF.org. During 2020, GBIF will expand this work to incorporate more key areas of use, provisionally focusing on: 1) Phylogenetic and (continuation from 2016 work) DNA evidence for names and occurrences, 2) human health and vectored diseases and 3) marine biodiversity. Depending on resources, these groups will operate through a combination of face-to-face meetings and online or remote collaboration.</p>

Participants are encouraged to organize working groups in additional areas to review the state of GBIF data relevant to particular domains and themes and to provide recommendations on critical gaps, improvements in recommended metadata or data elements, minimum criteria for usable data, etc. The GBIF Secretariat will compile these recommendations and, where possible, develop query profiles to support rapid access and monitor progress by the network in delivering data suited for the needs of these domains.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_21"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_21"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of GBIF’s key roles is as organizer or global evidence for species distribution, based on point records for species in time and space. Expansion of data publishing to accommodate sampling event data enables this evidence base also to mobilize and organize basic data on species populations and abundance. As a result, GBIF is positioned to serve as a critical resource for supporting biodiversity assessment at all scales. In particular, GBIF should serve as the data foundation for GEO BON to deliver Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) for species distribution and population abundance. These EBVs represent a continuum from modelled representation of species occupancy (presence-only) in defined units of space and time through to richer assessment of species abundance in those units. GEO BON should serve as a forum for addressing the challenges of modelling such variables and interpolating sensibly between existing data points. This includes determination of appropriate scale at which modelled variables are adequately supported by current data. GBIF needs to ensure that it delivers the data foundations required for these activities, thereby supporting the requirements of IPBES, species Red Listing through IUCN and national authorities, the CBD and the Aichi Targets and Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_21"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_21"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This activity depends on the activities defined for all goals, in order to improve the comprehensiveness, coverage and quality of data accessed through the GBIF network. An additional area for enhancement will be GBIF.org search interfaces and presentation (via maps and other visualizations) of sampling event data. Such interfaces should ensure that researchers can properly evaluate and assess data suitable for biodiversity assessment activities. Additionally GBIF needs to be active within GEO BON to ensure that there is close alignment and evolution between the concepts and implementation of EBVs and the data and services offered by GBIF.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_22"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_22"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF Participants require clear evidence of the benefits arising from investments in national- scale content mobilization and from GBIF global activity. At present, the main source of evidence presented derives from monitoring of published literature to identify uses of GBIF within research. This activity has been reported through annual GBIF Science Reviews and clearly demonstrates growing use of GBIF in research. Monitoring the literature in this way is time-consuming, and becomes more so as the relevant literature increases. A sustainable approach is required for future monitoring of this kind. GBIF now issues and promotes Digital Object Identifiers for data downloads and expects that these can be used both to simplify discovery and to improve the detail offered to Participants and data publishers on some uses of data. Participants also require more information on non-research uses of GBIF infrastructure, particularly in various kinds of government or industry assessments. A broader review of costs and benefits arising from GBIF investment would be valuable for Participants arguing continued engagement within GBIF and other countries considering Participation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_22"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_22"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat will lead a consultation with Participants on the level of detail desired from literature tracking and possible approaches to maintain this as a shared task across the network. GBIF.org will be enhanced to present known uses of GBIF DOIs and to ensure that data publishers receive information on such uses. Within the BID programme, GBIF is already seeking reports from funded projects on non-research applications of data. A general model is required to enable Participants easily to contribute examples of such uses and for these to be integrated into GBIF’s overall reporting on usage. Several countries have requested information on known costs and benefits from GBIF investment. The Secretariat wishes to identify one or more Participants interested in leading case study investigations to value GBIF benefits at national scale and to assist with developing general recommendations for a suitable way for GBIF to track and report this value.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Strategic Plan 2017–2021 presents five broad overlapping priorities for the GBIF network. Each of these priorities sets a direction and guides activities for the coming period. This document here presents an Implementation Plan to enable the GBIF community as a whole to make significant progress in each priority area. It establishes the framework for GBIF’s Annual Work Programmes over the period of the Strategic Plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following notes provide context for the activities outlined here.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_delivery"><a class="anchor" href="#_delivery"></a>Delivery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some activities in this plan will be led or coordinated by GBIF Secretariat staff, using core or supplementary funds. Other activities may be led or coordinated by GBIF Participants with particular interest or expertise in the areas in question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Combining energies across the whole network within the framework of this plan will enable GBIF to progress the set of activities identified in this document more rapidly. Each Annual Work Programme in the period 2017 to 2021 will build on progress in past years and will focus available resources on remaining priorities identified in this document.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_structure_of_gbif"><a class="anchor" href="#_structure_of_gbif"></a>Structure of GBIF</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF operates on three primary levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Global</strong> – GBIF is an international activity and works at the global level to increase standardization and adoption of best practices, to facilitate sharing of expertise and resources and to offer an integrated global dataset and associated informatics infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participant</strong> – GBIF Participants, including the nodes that they establish, have primary responsibility for engaging stakeholder communities, mobilizing and curating data, providing support and training, and ensuring that national researchers and agencies gain maximum benefit from GBIF. GBIF regional networks provide a framework for national and organizational stakeholders to collaborate more closely, particularly when addressing challenges and opportunities they share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Publisher</strong> – Data-holding institutions, agencies and individual researchers are the foundations on which GBIF depends. GBIF has a responsibility to ensure that data publishers have access to the tools and support that they need and that they receive recognition for their work and contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Implementation Plan seeks to address needs at all three of these levels while aiming to reinforce the value of GBIF for stakeholders at each level. It is highly desirable to increase coordination and feedback between these levels. The 2019 version of the document includes reports from a few GBIF Participants on their 2018 activities and 2019 plans. It would be most beneficial to receive inputs from a wider range of Participants to give a clear picture of everything occurring in the network and to assist the Secretariat and all Participants with better alignment and reuse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A particular requirement is for the GBIF network to maintain and coordinate software to support each of these levels and to ensure that the publication, integration, management and use of data are as efficient as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the global level, GBIF focuses on delivery of GBIF.org as a software platform to support both human users and tools (via web services). Many of GBIF’s goals depend on being able to deliver a fully integrated view of all data from all sources in the best possible forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the data publisher level, GBIF maintains the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) as its default tool for sharing GBIF-compatible data. Ongoing enhancements are required to increase both the usability of this tool and the value that its services provide to data publishers. At the same time, GBIF seeks to support GBIF-compatible data publishing via other tools such as collection management systems and citizen science platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the Participant level, several efforts have been made to deliver generic portal tools to assist node managers in their work and to deliver value at the national level. The most significant roles for such a platform would be to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable national- or regional-level integration and curation of datasets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance data records to reflect national administrative units and national species lists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide tools that meet the requirements of national or regional researchers, policymakers and the general public</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the last few years, a growing number of GBIF Participants have collaborated to leverage Australia’s investment in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and to customize these tools to deliver their own portals. The Implementation Plan responds to this with a focus on increasing community development and support to deliver a reusable and sustainable portal toolkit based on the ALA tools. This approach not only benefits Participants already committed to using these tools, but also provides a solution for rapid adoption by other Participants at national, regional, or even thematic levels. In addition, Belgium has indicated an interest in exploring the potential for an alternative lightweight solution based on repository tools such as CKAN.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The vision for the technical aspects underlying this Implementation Plan is that the components developed and offered by the GBIF network at each scale should combine to deliver a robust solution to support GBIF data management and that together they should continue to evolve to support a leading international data infrastructure. One aspect of this will be to ensure that all users can share and reuse common components such as data validation tests and that GBIF promotes and fosters wider activity around open projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF is more than just a technical network, and this Implementation Plan also addresses the capacity enhancement, networking, communication and reporting activities necessary to advance GBIF’s work in these areas. Since it is impossible for GBIF to support all aspects of its network using core funds, this plan focuses on resources which will support the work of GBIF Participants and data holders everywhere, coordinating the skills, expertise and investment of the whole network to maximize benefits to all stakeholders.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_timeline"><a class="anchor" href="#_timeline"></a>Timeline</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of the priorities, or the more specific goals identified for each priority, can be achieved in a single year; each will require coordinated effort across multiple annual work programmes. This document describes the set of activities currently recognized as important to deliver the Strategic Plan over the five-year period. It will be revised and expanded as required each year to address changes in the landscape in which GBIF operates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Implementation Plan was presented for approval by the Governing Board at GB23. It was accompanied by the Annual Work Programme for 2017. Both components were approved at the meeting.</p>

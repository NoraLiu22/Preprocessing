  <div class="text"> In 1933 there were discussions with Marconi about machines 
    of a new design to replace the Blattnerphones. The BBC required a fast run-up 
    time, a direct motor drive, quieter running and high speed rewind. Marconi 
    was to be responsible for the mechanical design of the system and the BBC 
    Research Department for the electronics. Marconi isolated the constant speed 
    drive from the spools by adding a tape reservoir either side of the drive. 
    The tape was transported horizontally through the double-pole heads and, like 
    the later Blattnerphones, duplicate record and play heads were fitted.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    The first of these new Marconi-Stille machines was delivered to Maida Vale 
    in March 1935, two more were operational in May and the fourth arrived in 
    July. A further two machines, ordered in June, were delivered in September. 
    <div class="atR"><img src="ms/marconi_stille_5.jpg" width="400" height="352" class="atright" border="2" alt="Maida Vale" title="Recording channel at Maida Vale" /></div>
    The machines were installed in pairs in each of three recording channels. 
    Each channel occupied two rooms, one for the machines and apparatus and the 
    other for monitoring. Two engineers were employed to operate each channel. 
    A further two machines were acquired during the war.<br />
    <br />
    The Marconi-Stille machines proved to be more reliable than the Blattners, 
    with most problems caused by tapes breaking at the joints and some amplifier 
    and electrical faults. The frequency response was +/-2dB from 100Hz-6kHz and 
    a signal to noise ratio of 35dB or better could be achieved. The final machine 
    was withdrawn from service around 1950.<br />
    <br />
    The tungsten steel tapes were of Swedish manufacture, 3mm wide and 0.08mm 
    thick. Three 1000m lengths were silver-soldered together to give a spool which 
    played for about 32 minutes and weighed 25lbs. A tape and spool cost about 
    &pound;21. The tapes were re-used so the average cost worked out at about 
    6d (2.5p) a minute. They could be edited, each joint being soldered or welded, 
    though when there were about a dozen edits in a tape it was scrapped because 
    of the increased risk of damage to the head pole pieces caused by the lapped 
    joints.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    The diagram above shows a couple of the heads. These consisted of two small 
    hinged 'boxes' which closed together around the tape. A slot guided the tape 
    past the two pole pieces which touched the tape at right angles. A screw and 
    spring arrangement controlled the pressure of the heads on the tape. The pole 
    pieces were not directly opposite one another but slightly staggered - about 
    1.5mm for the erase (or wiping) head and 3mm for the record one. A lateral 
    adjustment screw controlled the offset. The erase pole pieces were made of 
    Stalloy and had a flat contact surface with the tape. The record ones were 
    also of Stalloy but had a knife edge to improve high frequency performance. 
    The replay pole piece was made of Permalloy and also had a knife edge. <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    A small coil of wire was wound around each of the pole pieces. The first head 
    had a direct current of about 20mA passed through its coils which magnetised 
    the tape to saturation, thus erasing any previous recording. The record head 
    was fed with a direct current opposite in polarity to that on the erase head 
    onto which was superimposed the alternating current of the signal to be recorded. 
    The play head had a pole piece on only one side of the tape. The presence 
    of separate record and play heads allowed 'off-tape' monitoring while recording.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    The machine used three motors. An A.C. synchronous motor was used to draw 
    the tape past the heads. A second motor drove the feed pulley which pulled 
    tape off the left hand spool. This ran slightly fast allowing a loop of tape 
    to build up in the reservoir no.2 to the left of the heads. When the loop 
    was large enough it touched contact strips inside the reservoir and thus removed 
    the bias from the grid of a thyratron. A relay in the anode circuit operated 
    and switched a resistance into the motor circuit, thus slowing the feed pulley. 
    As soon as the loop reduced in size the motor returned to normal speed. Using 
    a thyratron required only small currents to pass through the tape - the larger 
    currents that using a relay directly would have required might have put clicks 
    onto the recording. The third motor, driving the right hand spool, was controlled 
    in a similar way. It ran slightly slow allowing the tape to build up in reservoir 
    no.1. The contact strip at the bottom of the reservoir operated another thyratron. 
    These arrangements prevented any extra load being put onto the constant speed 
    motor and thus slowing it down.<br />
    <br />
    The tape could be rewound at about double speed, a loop forming on the left 
    of reservoir no.1 being used to control the relative speed of the motors. 
    The constant-speed drive system was disconnected by an automatic release clutch 
    during the rewind. <br />
    <br />
    The replay amplifier was a standard BBC type A, modified to provide the required 
    equalisation. A power output stage fed the monitoring loudspeaker. The head 
    driving amplifier was specially designed.<br />

    Here's a contemporary view of the machine, from 'Modern Wonder', September 
    1937: <br />

    The magazine wrote:<i> 'One of the wonderful machines in use by the BBC is 
    the Marconi-Stille magnetic recorder-reproducer. This instrument enables broadcast 
    speeches and music to be &quot;stored&quot; on a long steel ribbon by magnetism 
    so that they may be re-broadcast at any time.....The machine comprises two 
    large drums on which special steel tape is wound by means of an electric motor. 
    Between the drums, electro-magnets are arranged, and the tape passes between 
    the pole-pieces of these magnets. The impulses in the coils of the electro-magnets 
    cause the tape to be magnetized in larger and smaller amounts, and when the 
    tape has been treated, it forms a highly accurate record of speech and music.'</i><br />

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 127]]</font> The portion 
        of New Guinea with which trade is regularly maintained from the Eastern 
        Archipelago extends from the eastern extremity of the great Geelvink Bay 
        on the north coast in about long. 137º E. to very nearly the same longitude 
        on the south coast, a little beyond the river Utan&aacute;ta. Besides 
        this coast-line of more than 1200 miles it embraces also the large island 
        of Jobie and the smaller ones of Biak and Sook to the north of it, the 
        islands of Waigio&uacute;, Batant&aacute;, Salw&aacute;tty, and Mysol 
        at the north-western extremity, and the islands of K&eacute; and Aru in 
        the southern portion. These islands are all inhabited by portions of the 
        same great Papuan race, and are (with the single exception of the K&eacute; 
        Islands) geographically and zoologically a portion of New Guinea.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only articles of commercial value procured 
        from the interior of New Guinea are Mussoi bark and wild nutmegs. From 
        the coasts and islands tripang or b&ecirc;che-de-mer, mother-of-pearl 
        shell, and tortoise-shell are all produced in abundance; and as they are 
        all articles which command a ready sale, and at high prices, the trade 
        is a very important one. The articles of less importance are pearls, birds 
        of Paradise, sago (raw and in cakes), mats, palm-leaf boxes, and rice 
        in the husk, or paddy.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination of these articles is various, 
        and but few reach Europe. The Mussoi bark, which contains an aromatic 
        oil of a rather pungent odour, is sent to Java, where the natives buy 
        it at a high price to rub on the skin as a remedy for rheumatic and many 
        other diseases. It is probably from a tree of the cinnamon family. The 
        tripang or sea-slug is all bought up by the Chinese, who are the only 
        consumers of this repulsive article. The tortoise-shell is mostly bought 
        by the Manilla traders, and I presume much of it is manufactured in the 
        Philippines into combs and ornaments. Finely-spotted shells with much 
        white in them are very highly esteemed, and command high prices. These 
        the richer natives often keep in their houses as ornaments, and as articles 
        always convertible into cash. Some tons of tortoise-shell must be produced 
        annually on the coasts of New Guinea, and, as it is worth here 12<em>s</em>. 
        to 20<em>s</em>. per pound, it becomes of itself an important trade. The 
        pearl-shell and the wild nutmegs go all to European markets. Of the less 
        important articles, the birds of Paradise are dispersed over the world; 
        the greater part, I believe, now go to China. The pearls--which are few, 
        and seldom fine--are also mostly bought by the Chinese. The sago and rice 
        being very local productions, and the former being the staple food of 
        the <font color="990000">[[p. 128]]</font> surrounding districts, they 
        are a great medium of exchange over all the Papuan countries, a little 
        being also taken to Ternate. The mats and palm-leaf boxes are in great 
        demand all over the Moluccas.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods with which these various products are 
        purchased are not very diversified, the principal being bar-iron, calico, 
        and thin red cottons from England, choppers made in Singapore or Macassar, 
        Bugis cloths, cheap German knives and Chinese plates and basins, brass-wire, 
        white and coloured beads, and silver coins. Arrack is indispensable in 
        some districts, opium in others; but these are not in such general demand 
        as the preceding.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade is mainly carried on in native prahuws, 
        a few small schooners only being now engaged in it from Ternate, Menado, 
        Amboyna, and Macassar. They, however, form quite an unimportant feature 
        in the trade of New Guinea, which is essentially native.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Malay prahuw is a vessel so unique as to deserve 
        a brief description. It is a short vessel with bow and stern nearly alike. 
        The deck (when it has one) slopes down towards the bows. The mast is a 
        triangle, and consequently wants no shrouds, and, being low, carries an 
        immense yard much longer than the vessel itself, which is hung out of 
        the centre, and the short end hauled down on deck, so that the immense 
        mainsail slopes upwards to a considerable height. A full-rigged prahuw 
        carries a smaller similar sail abaft, and a bowsprit and jib. It has two 
        rudders, one on each quarter, with a window or opening on each side for 
        the tillers considerably below the deck. These vessels can only sail 8 
        points from the wind (so that it is impossible to make any way by tacking 
        when the wind is ahead), and make their voyages only with the favourable 
        monsoon--accomplishing, therefore, generally but one voyage a year. They 
        are of all sizes, from l to 100 tons' burden, and are built--some with 
        regularly nailed planks, some fastened only with rattans--but so ingeniously 
        and securely as very well to stand a sea-voyage. When I first went from 
        Macassar to New Guinea, a distance of 1000 miles, a small prahuw of about 
        10 tons which had not a single nail in its whole structure kept company 
        with us all the way. The largest prahuws are from Macassar and the Bugis 
        countries of Celebes and the island of Boutong. Smaller ones in great 
        numbers sail from Ternate, Pidore, East Ceram, and Goram, which I shall 
        have occasion again to allude to.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give a short notice of the chief districts 
        of New Guinea and its islands, with the most important particulars relating 
        to the trade carried on there, and the condition and character of the 
        inhabitants.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great Geelvink Bay</em>.--The centres of 
        trade for this district are <font color="990000">[[p. 129]]</font> Dorey 
        and the little island of Roen. The inhabitants of the mainland and of 
        the island of Jobie are very ferocious. At Jobie vessels at anchor have 
        been attacked, and sailors on shore have been frequently murdered. A schooner 
        from Ternate comes every year to Roen and the district of Wandamen, at 
        the head of the bay, to load Mussoi bark, which is found here only. One 
        or two prahuws from Ternate also go along the coast of Jobie and round 
        the bay, buying tortoise-shell and tripang. The natives of Dorey, in small 
        boats, visit Mafor, Sook, and Biak, and the west end of Jobie, buying 
        tortoise-shell, birds of Paradise, and crown-pigeons, which they sell 
        to the traders who touch at Dorey. The inhabitants of Dorey, Roen, and 
        some of the other coast villages have a little sprinkling of Malay blood, 
        are beginning to use clothing, and thus make the first step in civilization. 
        Jobie is celebrated for its birds of Paradise, the only product of its 
        interior. Dorey produces rice, which the natives take to Salw&aacute;tty 
        and exchange for sago. The Dorey people also go to Amberbaki, 100 miles 
        westward, to buy vegetables and birds of Paradise, for which that village 
        is celebrated.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Salw&aacute;tty and Waigio&uacute;</em>.--Salw&aacute;tty 
        is a great sago country, supplying all the neighbouring districts with 
        this necessary of life. It is the centre of the trade of the western extremity 
        of New Guinea, a Bugis trader having an establishment in the chief village 
        of Semeter, and most of the trading prahuws and schooners touching there. 
        Tortoise-shells, pearl-shell, and tripang are produced in great abundance 
        on the shoals and islands round about, and the coast of New Guinea to 
        the eastward produces the greatest number and variety of birds of Paradise.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waigio&uacute; possesses but few inhabitants, 
        and no true indigenes. It is remarkable for its deep inlets and narrow, 
        rocky channels, but imperfectly represented on the charts. The village 
        of Waigio&uacute; is situated at the head of the deepest inlet, and, being 
        the only part of the island producing sago, is much resorted to. Pearl-shell 
        is also found there.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The productions of Waigio&uacute; are taken either 
        to Salw&aacute;tty or to Tidore, few trading prahuws visiting it. The 
        inhabitants of all this part of New Guinea may be divided into two classes: 
        the coast people, who have more or less mixture of Malay blood, are mostly 
        nominal Mahometans, build their houses on stakes in the water, and occupy 
        themselves almost entirely with fishing; and, secondly, the inland people, 
        commonly known as Alfurus, who are of more pure Papuan blood, live on 
        the mountains, cultivate vegetables, and catch birds of Paradise. They 
        are considered as inferiors, and almost as slaves, by the coast people, 
        and have in almost every district a distinct language, while the coast 
        people from Dorey and the islands of the Great Geelvink Bay to Salw&aacute;tty, 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 130]]</font> Waigio&uacute;, and Mysol, all 
        speak the same language--or so nearly the same that they can understand 
        one another. In their villages one always finds some people who can speak 
        Malay, which is generally quite unknown to the Alfurus. The inhabitants 
        of Waigio&uacute; have slaves who cultivate their vegetable grounds, but 
        they have been originally brought from the mainland of New Guinea, and 
        are not true indigenes. They now speak the same language as the coast 
        people.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The districts south-east of Salw&aacute;tty and 
        the coasts of McLuer Inlet produce abundance of wild nutmegs, and a schooner 
        comes annually from Ternate, and generally obtains a full cargo of them. 
        The natives of this part are dangerous.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Mysol or Misool</em>.--This island produces 
        a great deal of sago and Mussoi bark, and abundance of tripang, with tortoise-shell, 
        pearls, and birds of Paradise. A number of Goram and Ceram prahuws visit 
        it annually to load sago, which they take to Ternate. The largest village 
        is Lilinta, on the south coast, in the chief sago district. The inhabitants 
        of the coast are Mahometans, governed by native rajahs, and speaking the 
        common North Papuan language. In the interior are true indigenes, having 
        a very distinct language.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This island is mountainous, but not very lofty. 
        The rocks are sandstones and limestones. One of the latter much resembles 
        hard chalk, and contains flints and belemnites. If geologically contemporaneous 
        with the Cretaceous formation, it is the only instance I am acquainted 
        with of true secondary strata occurring in the Moluccas or New Guinea. 
        I have before only met with highly crystalline rocks, volcanic, coralline, 
        or alluvial formations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Coast South of McLuer Inlet</em>.--The peninsula 
        south of McLuer Inlet is known to the native traders by the name of Papua 
        Onen. The people of Goram chiefly trade there; but the natives are very 
        treacherous, and, when not satisfied with the barter offered them, will 
        frequently attack and murder the traders. On the coast are a few villages 
        of Mahometans, who are also subject to constant attacks of the indigenes 
        of the interior. The productions are wild nutmegs and Mussoi bark, in 
        small quantities, with the usual tortoise-shell and tripang on the coasts.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther south from Adie Island to Utan&aacute;ta 
        is the Papua Kowiye&iacute; of the traders. The Goram and Bugis traders 
        have almost the monopoly of this district, which produces much Mussoi 
        bark, with the other usual products, and is celebrated for the number 
        of lories, cockatoos, and other birds procured there. Even these are not 
        of trifling value, as every prahuw returning from any part of New Guinea 
        is sure to bring some dozens or scores of them, and they all sell readily 
        in the ports of the Moluccas at from 2<em>s</em>. to 10<em>s</em>. each, 
        or even more. Many hundreds--I might perhaps say <font color="990000">[[p. 
        131]]</font> thousands--are brought from the Papuan countries every season, 
        yet the supply seems never equal to the demand. The natives of many parts 
        of this coast are also very dangerous.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was at Goram (in May, 1860), the crews 
        of two prahuws, including the Rajah's son, were attacked in this part 
        of New Guinea, in open day, while bargaining for some tripang, and all 
        murdered except three or four, who escaped in a small boat and brought 
        the news. The shrieks and lamentation in the village when the news was 
        brought were most distressing, almost every house having lost a relation 
        or a slave.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther east than Uta, as well as the eastern 
        parts of the Geelvink Bay, go by the name of Papua Talanjong, or &quot;Naked 
        Papua,&quot; because the natives are absolutely without clothing, or any apology 
        for it. These parts, however, are seldom visited.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Aru Islands</em>.--Of all parts of the 
        New Guinea district, the Aru Islands are the most productive. Ten or twelve 
        of the largest-sized Macassar and Bugis prahuws go there annually, and 
        generally get a full cargo of pearl-shell, tripang, and tortoise-shell. 
        Besides these, scores of smaller boats flock there from Goram, East Ceram, 
        Banda, and Amboyna; while the natives of K&eacute;, of Temimber, of Babber, 
        and of some parts of New Guinea, come there as to a fair to dispose of 
        their products, or to fish for the supply of the traders.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village of Dobbo, on one of the western islands, 
        is the centre of the trade, where the large prahuws are hauled up and 
        repaired, smaller ones being sent among the islands to collect produce. 
        The village is situated on a narrow spit of sand, on which are crowded 
        three streets of rude thatched houses, while a larger population live 
        in their boats or under mats on the beach. In the height of the season 
        I calculated that Dobbo contained 1000 inhabitants--some from almost every 
        chief island in the Archipelago. Chinamen from Macassar opened stores, 
        tempting the motley population with gaudy china, glass, and trinkets. 
        Even the European luxuries of sugar, biscuit, preserved fruits, and wine, 
        were to be obtained in small quantities, but at very moderate prices, 
        and there was generally no advance made on the Singapore or Macassar rates, 
        the dealers trusting to the profit obtained on the produce taken in exchange 
        from the native buyers. Cockfighting and football-playing (in which the 
        Bugis are very expert) took place almost every evening in the widest part 
        of the street; and though quarrels sometimes occur and creeses are drawn 
        and used, yet, considering there is no government, and the mixture of 
        races and religions crowded together, all eager for gain, order and harmony 
        generally prevail. This is in part due, however, to a Dutch official, 
        who makes an annual visit for a few days to hear and decide disputes and 
        punish offences.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aru is one of the places in which arrack is indispensable 
        to <font color="990000">[[p. 132]]</font> purchase produce. A native who 
        has accumulated a good lot of tripang or pearl-shell, besides the cloth, 
        crockery, and ironware, will always have one or two cases of arrack (of 
        about 7 gallons each) in payment. He then calls together his particular 
        friends and has a grand drinking bout, which continues day and night till 
        the whole is finished. During these orgies they frequently break or burn 
        half their scanty moveables, or even pull their own house down about their 
        ears, of course fighting occasionally; but, as the women remove all weapons, 
        lives are seldom lost.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives with whom I resided in the interior 
        boasted of these exploits, saying they did not do things by halves, and 
        that they would rather have no arrack at all than not enough to get thoroughly 
        well drunk while they were about it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the great competition in Aru, articles 
        are sold very cheap, and a high price given for all native produce. It 
        thus happens that these remote and savage islanders obtain calicoes, handkerchiefs, 
        and other articles, which are to them more ornament than clothing, at 
        a far cheaper rate (estimated in labour) than the inhabitants of the towns 
        where they are made, or the workmen who produce them. This is one of the 
        anomalous results of that immense commercial and manufacturing system 
        of which we are so proud, and whose continual increase we look upon as 
        an unmixed blessing to mankind.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade of Aru is perhaps more considerable 
        than that of any other part of the Papuan district. In the year 1857, 
        when I visited the islands, there were 15 large prahuws from Macassar, 
        and more than 100 small ones, of various sizes, from Ceram, Goram, and 
        the K&eacute; Islands. The Macassar cargoes were worth about 200,000 rupees 
        (15,000<em> l.</em>), and the small boats about 50,000 rupees more. The 
        great bulk of this consists of pearl-shell and tripang, all other articles 
        of produce being in much smaller quantities. The Goram and Ceram men bring 
        cargoes of sago-cakes, which the natives of Aru eagerly buy; and there 
        are many natives of the island of Babber who devote themselves to fishing, 
        while the inhabitants of the interior bring large quantities of sugar-cane, 
        plantains, and other vegetables. Dobbo, therefore, is well supplied with 
        provisions, and is on that account a much more agreeable residence than 
        any other part of the Papuan district, where provisions are very scarce, 
        and the obtaining anything to eat is a daily-recurring problem.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of the villages of Aru are Christian, 
        and have native schoolmasters from Amboyna: others are Mahometan; while 
        the natives of the interior have nothing that can be called a religion. 
        As is generally the case in the far east, the latter are the most industrious 
        of the three, and are therefore the least miserable, and by far the most 
        pleasant to reside with.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 133]]</font> <em>K&eacute; 
        Islands</em>.--The natives of K&eacute; are the boat-builders of the far 
        east. Several villages are constantly employed in this work, in which 
        they are unequalled in the Archipelago. Their forests produce excellent 
        timber of many different kinds; and the workmen are so expert in the use 
        of the axe and adze, that with these alone they produce vessels of admirable 
        form and most excellent workmanship. In a good K&eacute; prahuw the model 
        is perfect; the planks are as smooth as if planed, and fit together so 
        exactly that from end to end a knife cannot be inserted between them. 
        The planks are all cut out of the solid wood, with a series of projections 
        left on the inside, to which the inner timbers are attached by rattans. 
        The planks are all pegged together along the edges with pins of hard wood, 
        so that it is impossible they can spring. After the first year the rattan-tied 
        ribs are generally replaced by new ones, fitted to the planks and nailed, 
        and the vessel then becomes fully equal to those of the best European 
        workmanship. The Papuan traders and the natives of Goram and Ceram all 
        buy their prahuws and small boats at K&eacute;, and lately several fine 
        schooners have been built there. Very excellent ship-building timber may 
        be purchased here at cheap rates--muskets, gongs, and cotton cloths being 
        the principal articles taken in exchange: good carpenters' tools are also 
        much appreciated. Besides boats and timber, cocoa-nut oil is the chief 
        export of the K&eacute; Islands. The original inhabitants of Banda have 
        emigrated to K&eacute; since the Dutch took possession of that island, 
        and they now inhabit separate villages, having preserved their language, 
        and are known as K&eacute; Banda people.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between K&eacute; and Ceram are a range of islands, 
        inhabited by natives of Papuan race, but becoming lighter in colour as 
        we approach Ceram. About midway is Teor, a small hilly island inhabited 
        by a fine race of brown-skinned frizzly-haired people, who cultivate vegetables 
        and seek tortoiseshell, which they bring in their little open boats to 
        Goram and Ceram. The Matabello Islands are raised coral reefs, 300 to 
        400 feet high, covered with fruit-trees and cocoa-nuts, from which the 
        natives' manufacture oil, which is the principal article of trade. They 
        are wealthy, the women all wearing massive gold earrings, and the chiefs 
        dressing on state occasions in flowered satin gowns and scarfs. In their 
        villages, too, are dozens of small brass guns, which must have cost a 
        great deal of money; yet their houses are most miserable and filthy, and 
        their food most precarious and scanty. Cocoa-nuts and oil-refuse, with 
        an occasional sago-cake, form their principal subsistence, and cutaneous 
        diseases, as the necessary result, everywhere abound.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little farther to the north-west is the Goram 
        group, consisting of three islands, and very thickly inhabited by a race 
        allied to the Ceram Malays. They are the great traders of the far east, 
        visiting all the coasts and islands of New Guinea, and selling the product 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 134]]</font> of their voyages to the Bugis and 
        Chinese traders, who have their general &quot;rendezvous&quot; at Kilwaru, in the 
        Ceram Laut Islands. In their voyages they are most enterprising; in other 
        respects very inactive and lazy, depending for food almost entirely on 
        the labours of their Papuan slaves. Many of the inhabitants are much addicted 
        to opium-smoking. The only manufactures of Goram are coarse mat sail-cloth, 
        a little cotton, and ornamental boxes made of sago-pith and pandanus-leaves, 
        which are much esteemed all over the Moluccas as clothes-boxes. The Goram 
        men visit Banda, Amboyna, and Ternate; but seldom extend their voyages 
        farther, as the Bugis traders give them a good price for their tripang 
        and tortoise-shell.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great &quot;rendezvous&quot; for the New Guinea traders 
        is Kilwaru, a little island scarcely 50 yards across, situated between 
        Ceram-laut and Keffing. On both sides of it is a good anchorage in all 
        weathers, which is probably the reason why it has been chosen. Though 
        scarcely raised above high-water mark, and with not two acres of surface, 
        it possesses wells of very good drinking water--a fact which I could hardly 
        have believed had I not examined it myself. When I visited Kilwaru there 
        were a native schooner from Baly, and several Chinese and Bugis prahuws 
        from Macassar, in the harbour; and there were stores open on shore, in 
        which almost every article requisite for New Guinea trade could be procured. 
        Sugar, tea, coffee, rice, arrack, and wine were also to be purchased here, 
        and a large assortment of cotton-cloths, both of European and native manufacture, 
        as well as muskets, gunpowder, china, crockery, German knives, opium, 
        and tobacco.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sago being so intimately connected with the trade 
        of New Guinea, and forming the staff of life for so large a portion of 
        the natives engaged in it, a short account of its growth and manufacture 
        may be appropriately given.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sago-tree is a palm, thicker than the cocoa-nut-tree, 
        but not so tall, with immense spiny leaves, which completely cover the 
        stem till it has arrived at a considerable age, when the lower ones rot 
        and fall off, leaving the bare stem. It has a creeping root, or rhizoma, 
        like the Nipa palm, and bears an immense terminal spike of flowers at 
        about ten or fifteen years of age, after which the tree dies, being thus 
        allied to our annual and biennial plants, and to the aloe. It grows in 
        swamps or in swampy hollows on the rocky slopes of hills, where it appears 
        to thrive equally well as when exposed to the daily influence of salt 
        or brackish water.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midribs of the leaves form one of the most 
        useful products of these lands, supplying the place of bamboo, to which, 
        for many purposes, they are superior. These midribs are 12 or 15 feet 
        long, and often as thick as one's leg at the base. They are very light, 
        consisting entirely of a firm pith, covered with a hard brown <font color="990000">[[p. 
        135]]</font> skin. Entire houses are built with them. They form admirable 
        roofing poles for thatch; split and well supported, they make flooring; 
        and when chosen of equal size and pegged together, they form excellent 
        walls and partitions to framed wooden houses; carefully split and shaved 
        smooth, they are formed into boards, with pegs cut out of the hard skin, 
        and are the foundation of the leaf-covered boxes of Goram and New Guinea. 
        All the insect-boxes I have used in the Moluccas are thus made in Amboyna; 
        and when covered with paper inside and out are quite strong enough, exceedingly 
        light, and carry insect pins remarkably well. The leaflets of the sago 
        folded and tied side by side on the smaller midribs, or to strips of bamboo, 
        form the &quot;attap,&quot; or thatch, in universal use; while the product of the 
        stem is the daily food of some hundred thousands of men.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sago is to be made, a full-grown tree is 
        cut down and cleared of leaves, and a broad strip of bark on the upper 
        side is taken off, exposing the pith, which is of a rusty colour near 
        the base, but pure white higher up, as firm as a dry potato, but with 
        woody fibres running through the substance and branching in every direction, 
        about a quarter of an inch apart. The pith is beaten into powder by means 
        of a hard and heavy piece of wood, with a bit of quartz or flint fixed 
        into the end. At each blow this cuts away a narrow strip of pith, which 
        falls down into the hollow cylinder formed by the trunk, and is packed 
        into baskets, made of the sheathing bases of the leaves. It is then carried 
        to the nearest water, when a washing-machine is constructed, composed 
        entirely of the tree itself, with strainers of the cloth-like sheaths 
        of the cocoa-nut leaves. Successive washings dissolve and carry away all 
        the starchy matter, which settles in large hollows formed in the water-troughs. 
        This is packed cylindrically in sago-leaves, and is the raw sago of commerce.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raw sago, simply boiled with a little water, 
        forms a thick starchy mass, called &quot;pap&eacute;da,&quot; eaten with chop-sticks, 
        in the Chinese fashion. More commonly, however, it is baked into cakes, 
        in small clay ovens, containing six or eight vertical slits, side by side, 
        about three-quarters of an inch wide, and forming cakes six or eight inches 
        square. This is thoroughly heated over a clear fire, and the</p>
       
        <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S065fig1.jpg" width="25%" height="auto" />
      </p><p align="left"> sago, first dried, powdered, and finely sifted, is filled into it. It 
        is covered with a piece of flat sago-bark for a few minutes, and the cakes 
        are baked. The hot cakes, with the addition of a little sugar or grated 
        cocoa-nut, are very agreeable, something resembling maize-bread. When 
        required to be kept, however, they are dried for <font color="990000">[[p. 
        136]]</font> several days in the sun, and tied in bundles, of 20 to 50 
        each, when they can be kept for years. When thus dried they are very hard, 
        and taste rough, like sawdust-bread; but the people are used to them from 
        infancy, and little children may be seen gnawing them as contentedly as 
        our own with their bread and butter.</p>
      
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is truly an extraordinary sight to see a whole 
        tree-trunk, perhaps 20 feet long, and 5 in circumference, converted into 
        food, and with no more preparation or labour than is required to make 
        flour from wheat or maize. A good-sized tree will produce 30 tomans, or 
        bundles of 30 lbs. each; and these when baked will give 60 cakes, of 3 
        to the pound. Two of these cakes are a meal for a man, or about 5 a day; 
        so that, reckoning a tree to produce 1800 cakes, weighing 600 lbs., it 
        is food for one man for a year. The labour to produce this is as follows:--Two 
        men working moderately will finish a tree in five days, and two women 
        will bake the whole in about five days more; but the raw sago can be kept 
        any time, and baked as wanted, so that we may estimate that in ten days 
        a man may produce food for the whole year. This is, however, if he possesses 
        trees of his own, for all are now private property, and poor men have 
        to buy a tree for 5 or 6 rupees (about 9<em>s</em>.). The ordinary price 
        of labour here is 25 doits, or 4<em>d</em>., a day; so that the total 
        cost of 1800 cakes, or a year's food for one man, is about 12<em>s</em>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This excessive cheapness of food is, contrary 
        to what might be expected, a curse rather than a blessing. It leads to 
        great laziness and the extreme of misery. The habit of industry not being 
        acquired by stern necessity, all labour is distasteful, and the sago-eaters 
        have, as a general rule, the most miserable of huts and the scantiest 
        of clothing. In the western islands of the Archipelago, where rice is 
        the common food of the people, and where some kind of regular labour is 
        necessary for its cultivation, there is an immediate advance in comfort, 
        and a step upward in civilization. This limited observation may be extended 
        with the same results over the whole world; for it is certainly a singular 
        fact that no civilized nation has arisen within the tropics. That rigour 
        of nature which some may have thought a defect of our northern climes 
        has, under this view, been one of the acting causes in the production 
        of our high civilization. We may, indeed, further venture to suppose that, 
        had the earth everywhere presented the same perennial verdure that exists 
        in the equatorial regions, and everywhere produced spontaneously sufficient 
        for the supply of men's physical wants, the human race might have remained 
        for a far longer period in that low state of civilization in which we 
        still find the inhabitants of the fertile islands of the Moluccas and 
        New Guinea.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These scanty notes on the commerce of a very 
        remote and little- <font color="990000">[[p. 137]]</font> known region 
        have been collected during three voyages to various parts of New Guinea 
        and its islands. They are offered to the Royal Geographical Society in 
        the belief that no authentic and connected information on the subject 
        has yet been published, and with the hope that their crudeness and deficiencies 
        will be pardoned.</p>

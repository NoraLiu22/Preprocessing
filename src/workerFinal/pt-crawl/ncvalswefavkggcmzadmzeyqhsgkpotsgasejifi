"Recent arrivals at Melbourne Zoological Garden are three young Tasmanian
wolves (Thylacine).&nbsp; These marsupials were brought from the island
State by Mr James Harrison of Wynyard; who obtained them from a trapper.&nbsp;
The Tasmanian wolf is hated by farmers and others who own sheep because
it preys on the animals.&nbsp; The war against the sheep killer has been
waged for long, and to districts where it was once numerous the wolf is
becoming rare.&nbsp; It roams over the colder parts of Tasmania.&nbsp;
The mother of the three young animals at the zoo was found dead in a snare
with one of her offspring.&nbsp; A careful search resulted in the discovery
of the other cubs.&nbsp; The parent was not killed by the snare, but drowned.&nbsp;

drowned in ditch, and three cubs alive in nearby snares.&nbsp; To test
the theory that Tigers have a stiff back, the mother was skinned, and the
carcase left to rot where it was caught.&nbsp; It was observed that the
vertebrae were just the same as any other animal.&nbsp; The carcase is
still probably there.&nbsp; The skin was sent to a Mr Popowski to be tanned,
but unfortunately he chopped off the carefully dried tail and paws.&nbsp;
An adult male was observed several times in the vicinity at the time, circling
people on the track, but departing as soon as it was observed.&nbsp; The
three cubs were kept in a large cage (about 12 foot by 15 foot) on Rowe's
farm for 3 to 4 months, waiting for a good price to be obtained for them.&nbsp;
Eventually they were sold to James Harrison for &pound;5 each.&nbsp; Everyone

The Daily Telegraph of the 8th June 1914 (p. 4) reports on the Rowe capture:</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Tasmanian Wolves: Last week Mr James Harrison, of Wynyard, received word
that some Tasmanian wolves had been trapped at Smithton.&nbsp; He immediately
went down, but found that a full grown was killed, but three cubs were
secured unhurt.&nbsp; These Mr Harrison took to Melbourne by the s.s. Oonah,
and a wire was received on Friday stating that the animals have been purchased
for the Melbourne Zoological Gardens.&nbsp; Mr Harrison is a strong advocate
of protecting marsupials for a period of seven years, as at the rate they
are being killed now they will soon be extinct".</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bushman Adye Jordan captured a juvenile thylacine at West Takone in June
1929.&nbsp; The animal was purchased by Harrison, who then sold it to the

18th July of the following year.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Harrison was further charged with the task of obtaining two additional
thylacines for the zoo in 1934, as noted in an article entitled <i>"Fauna
Board"</i>, published in the Examiner on the 22nd August 1934 (p. 11):</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The Director of the Zoological Gardens, Melbourne, wrote thanking the
board for permitting his council to obtain one pair of Thylacines in addition
to other specimens of Tasmanian fauna for inclusion in the new Australian
section of the zoo.&nbsp; The condition imposed by the board that the Thylacines
should be returned on demand was accepted.&nbsp; An order for two specimens
of Thylacine, in addition to other Tasmanian fauna, has been placed with
Mr. J. Harrison, of Wynyard, who has been granted a permit by the board
to forward specimens to the mainland".</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prior to Melbourne Zoo's instruction to Harrison to source the thylacines,
the zoo had attempted to purchase them independently by advertising in
the Tasmanian press:</font></font>

young.&nbsp; Liberal price.&nbsp; Zoological Gardens, PARKVILLE, MELBOURNE".</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even for a man with Harrison's extensive contacts and resources, he was
unsuccessful in obtaining any further thylacines for the zoo.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An article entitled
<i>"Tasmania's Beasts"</i>, published in the Muswellbrook
Chronicle of the 29th March 1934 (p. 5), refers to James Harrison snaring
a dozen "tigers" and "devils" near Cradle Mountain in 1934:</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Working in the dense forest near Cradle Mountain, in Tasmania, early this
year, J. Harrison snared about a dozen "tigers" (a species of marsupial
wolf) and "devils" (an animal resembling a large dog).&nbsp; Last month
he took a pair of each to the curator of the Melbourne Zoo, who paid him
&pound;30 for them".</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Despite the journalist's reference to the marsupial wolf, the "tigers"
that Harrison snared were in fact Tiger quolls (<i>Dasyurus maculatus</i>).</font></font></td>

	<h3>Concept</h3>
	<p>The sailing vessel shown here is 26 meters long on deck 
	(85'), and intended for all steel construction. With full 
	displacement, there is quite a lot of room inside and on deck.  This is 
	a smaller sister to the much larger 55 meter (180')
	<a href="lady_destiny_55.htm">Lady Destiny</a> prototype, and except for its 
	size and accommodations, the following description is much the same as for 
	the larger vessel.  </p>
	<p>The inspiration for this 
	vessel is drawn from two cultures: Indonesian and Chinese, both having a 
	long maritime history.</p>
	<p>The hull form is 
		inspired by the traditional Indonesian 'kapal layar mesin' types 
	- the present-day wooden cargo vessels which can be seen throughout 
	Indonesia, and very much along the lines of the KLM-Yachts that we have 
	developed for construction in wood.  In the case of the Lady Destiny 
	shown above, we can see however that the stem is more upright, the hull is 
	multi-chine for ease of construction, there are four junk rigged masts, and 
	the keel has greater depth for the sake of improved sailing performance.  </p>
	<p>The <a href="junk_rig.htm">Junk Rig</a> is 
	strictly that of a Chinese sailing junk.  The more upright stem profile 
	is also a styling queue taken from traditional Chinese junks and from the 
	Lorcha of the region around Macau. </p>
	<p>Preliminary dimensions are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>25.9m Length on Deck (85')</li>
		<li>23.5m DWL (75')</li>
		<li>7.62m Beam (25')</li>
		<li>2.65m Draft (8.6')</li>
		<li>Displacement:  150 metric tons
		</li>
	</ul><br />
	<h3>Lady Destiny</h3>
	<p>Although the aesthetics, the rig, and the hull form of the <strong>
	Lady Destiny</strong> are highly traditional, we have taken advantage of 
	modern technology wherever possible in order to provide a vessel of the greatest strength and 
	seaworthiness.  For example, we have specified that the construction be all
	<strong>steel</strong>, primarily in order to achieve a vastly lighter, stronger and 
	more durable structure as compared to wood.  The masts as well are 
	tubular steel, for high strength, light weight, and extreme ruggedness.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this vessel is that of expeditionary sailing with an 
	extended family or with charter guests on voyages 
	of adventure and discovery.  Comfort and privacy have been our primary goals throughout. Given the overall size, 
	even with all the amenities the interior layout is not at all crowded. </p>
	<p>Given 
	that the vessel could be sailing anywhere from the tropics to the arctic the 
	priorities are directed toward creature comforts... In terms of climate 
	control, they include maximum insulation, heat pump technology and excellent ventilation 
	throughout.  In terms of creature comforts, each cabin is its own 
	private 'apartment' with head, shower, desk, entertainment, and service 
	provided by the crew.
	 <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>Interior Layout</h3>
	<p>Using the images above as a guide, a walk-through of the interior is as 
	follows:</p>
	<p>Right forward is a generous fo'c's'l to house the fenders, lines, spare 
	anchors... basically the ship's bosun's locker.  Aft of the forward 
	bulkhead below, a luxury master suite plus four luxury guest suites have been provided, 
	each with en-suite head and shower.  Ample fuel and water tankage is 
	located below the main sole.</p>
	<p>Aft of the accommodation spaces below is a large engine room (aft of 
	amidships), with a machinery room on either side having fuel tanks below.  
	Right aft below is a crew space which can accommodate four to six crew 
	members.</p>
	<p>On deck forward is a wide open fore deck, planned for seating at a 
	built-in long table.  Amidships on deck begins the deck house, with a 
	pilot space / wheel house right forward.  Aft of that is a captain's 
	cabin to starb'd and a day head to port.  Aft of that is the ship's 
	galley, and right aft in the deck house is a large lounge space with table 
	and sofas available to all for viewing and entertaining.  On the aft 
	deck is planned a large day-bed right aft..<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>More Information...?</h3>
	<p>If the <strong>Lady Destiny</strong> or a similar luxury expeditionary 
	yacht for family voyaging or luxury charters is of 
	interest, we offer a thorough custom design service.  We can modify this 
	design or create a new design to suit a variety of requests. 
	As an example of this kind of possibility, please see the much larger
	<a href="lady_destiny_55.htm">55m Lady 
	Destiny</a> prototype (180'), also junk rigged but with four masts.</p>

1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width.

3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author exhibited a diagram of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit and the precession of
the equinoxes, from which he deduced certain important views as to the climates of past
geological ages and the changes of organic life. During the past three million years the
eccentricity has been almost always much greater than at present, on the average twice as great,
and for long periods more than three times as great. It was shown that when the eccentricity was
greatest the heat received from the sun at the greatest and least distances was as 3 to 4; and,
owing to the precession of the equinoxes, the winters of the northern hemisphere would be
rendered intensely cold and much longer for periods of 10,500 years, while during the alternate
periods the winters would be mild and short, the summers cool and long, leading to an almost
perpetual spring. We thus have cold or glacial epochs for about 10,000 years, alternating with
mild epochs for the same period, whenever the eccentricity was high, and this was the case for
fully the half of the last three million years; and, as such alternations must have occurred during
every glacial epoch, the fact of intercalated warm periods and the migrations consequent on
them, which have been detected by geologists, must be looked upon as the normal condition of
things. But during the last 60,000 years (probably the whole time elapsed since the close of the
last glacial epoch) the eccentricity has been very small, and the alternations of climate and
consequent migrations very slight; and as Mr. Darwin holds that alternations of climate are, by
means of the consequent migrations, the most powerful cause of modifications of species, there
must have been a comparative stability of species during that period of time, from which alone
we obtain our idea of the rate of specific change. This idea will therefore be erroneous; and the
rate of change during past geological ages may have been, and probably was, much more rapid
than has hitherto been thought possible. During three million years before and one million after
the recent epoch, no less than 130 alternations of climate occurred (each of 10,000 years'
duration), when the eccentricity was more than double what it is now; and these incessant
changes were thought, on Darwinian principles, to supply a <em>vera causa</em> for a rapid change of
species, and thus enable us considerably to reduce the duration of geologic periods, which had
heretofore been measured by data derived from the period of organic stability since the last
global epoch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent meeting of the British Association, Mr. A. R. Wallace read a paper on the
&quot;Earth's Eccentricity and the Precession of the Equinoxes,&quot; illustrating their relation to
geological climates and the rate of organic change. The paper was illustrated by a diagram
constructed by means of the tables published by Mr. Croll in the <em>Philosophical Magazine</em> of
August, 1868, and covered a period of 3,000,000 of years before A.D. 1800, and 1,000,000 years
after that date. Mr. Wallace stated that with the existing amount of eccentricity the earth was
nearer the sun in winter than in summer in about the proportion of 90 to 93, and received,
therefore, about one-seventeenth more heat in December than in June, but the difference was
neutralized by the peculiar distribution of land and sea. When the eccentricity of the earth was
great it would cause an enormous difference in the climates, causing the winter to be lengthened
and the summer to be correspondingly shortened; but, on the other hand, during the periods of
low eccentricity the climate would change but little. The conclusion drawn in regard to the
glacier epochs was that it was evident that, if these causes had had any important share in
producing them, then the indications that geologists had found of intercalated warm periods
represented not an unusual or abnormal event, to be speculated on as something extraordinary
and difficult to account for, but the normal state of things; and that a consequent migration of
species, of which evidence was also found, must have occurred, not once only, but over and over
again during the whole continuance of the glacier period. A full appreciation of this would,
perhaps, assist in the interpretation of many well-known anomalies of distribution. A still more
important conclusion was to be drawn from the almost endless succession of migrations of
animals and plants that must have been caused by these often-repeated changes of
climate--migrations that would take place whenever the change of climate was considerable,
even though no glacier epoch appeared. These migrations being interrupted in various directions
by seas, mountains, or other obstacles, would inevitably lead to the crowding together of animals
and plants before separated, and thus lead to a complex and often renewed struggle for existence,
and give wide scope for new and favourable variations to establish themselves. One of Mr.
Darwin's great principles was that &quot;the relation of organism to organism was the most important
of all relations,&quot; and, &quot;that though a change of climate may produce a considerable direct effect
in modifying species, it induces far greater indirect effect by favouring the increase or diminution
of enemies and competitors of the species.&quot; He also assured Mr. Wallace that there was no cause
so powerful in inducing specific changes as mutations of climate through the consequent
migrations. He also found from the diagram that we live, and have done for the last 60,000 years,
in a period of small eccentricity. During the past 4,000,000 years there were only nine occasions
when the eccentricity was so little or less than it is now, while the average is nearly twice as
great; for considerable periods it was three times as great. It happened that for the last 60,000
years there had been but little mutation of climate each 10,000 years--the periods into which he
divided the 4,000,000--and, therefore, in Mr. Darwin's own words, &quot;the most powerful cause in
inducing specific changes&quot; had been in abeyance. Any estimate we might form of the rate of
specific change from the stability of species during that period would therefore be fallacious. The
period of about 10,000 years of alternate changes of climate would seem to be one well adapted
to favour rapid changes of species, as the change would be sufficiently gradual to allow of any
possible amount of migration. There would be sufficient time for the appearance of abundant
variation, and for the increase to any extent of species adapted to the changed conditions, whilst
there would also be time for the new and complete relations into which they would be thrown to
become adjusted and balanced. If we are adequately impressed with the highly complex relations
which subsist between each organism and all around it--which Mr. Darwin has done so much to
elucidate--and if we further accept his views that all changes in these relations, however brought
about, necessarily cause the modification of some forms and the extinction of others, it seems
hardly possible to conceive a state of things better adapted to promote the increasing growth and
change of the organic world than that which he presents to us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. A. R. Wallace read a paper on the earth's eccentricity and the precession of the equinoxes, illustrating their relation to geological climates and the rate of organic change. The paper was illustrated by a diagram constructed by means of the tables published by Mr. Croll in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; of August, 1868.

The paper at the outset stated that with the existing amount of eccentricity the earth was nearer the sun in winter than in summer in about the proportion of 90 to 93, and received, therefore, about one-seventeenth more heat in December than in June, but the difference was neutralised by the peculiar distribution of land and sea. When the eccentricity of the earth was great it would cause an enormous difference in the climates, causing the winter to be lengthened and the summer to be correspondingly shortened; but on the other hand, during the periods of low eccentricity the climate would change but little during periods stated in the diagram. The conclusions drawn from the paper in regard to the glacier epochs was that it was evident that, if these causes had had any importing share in producing them, then the indications that geologists had found of intercollated warm periods represented not an unusual or abnormal event, to be speculated on as something extraordinary and difficult to account for, but the normal state of things; and that a consequent migration of species, of which evidence was also found, must have occurred, not once only, but over and over again during the whole continuance of the glacier period.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some discussion followed the reading of Mr. Wallace's paper, more or less favourable, in which Mr. Boyd Dawkins took occasion to object to the attempt to correlate geological periods with historical times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section adjourned about three o'clock, several papers being held over till to-day.</p>

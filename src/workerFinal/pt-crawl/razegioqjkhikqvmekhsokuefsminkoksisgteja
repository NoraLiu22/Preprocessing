Although its pacesetters were masterful virtuosoes, many of the followers <br soft>sacrificed feeling for precision, emotion for speed. Charlie Parker &nbsp;and Dizzy Gillespie were nearly <br soft>impossible musical role models and they certainly could not be topped at the music they had originated.<br><br>When cool jazz emerged in the late '40s, some of the qualities of swing that had been de-emphasized <br soft>(arrangements, a use of space and more of an emphasis on tone) were restored to jazz. However other <br soft>young musicians wanted to utilize a wider range of emotions than was to be found in cool jazz, and they <br soft>sought to infuse jazz with elements of spiritual and gospel music (ie: soul). Hard bop gradually developed <br soft>and by the mid-'50s it had become the new modern mainstream.<br><br>Although based in bop, hard bop had a few differences. Tempos could be just as blazing but the melodies <br soft>were generally simpler, the musicians (particularly the saxophonists and pianists) tended to be familiar with<br soft>(and open to the influence of) rhythm &amp; blues and the bass players (rather than always being stuck in the <br soft>role of a metronome) were beginning to gain a little more freedom and solo space. Due to the soulful nature <br soft>of some of the solos and the occasionally catchy rhythms, hard bop was nicknamed &quot;funk&quot; for a time. By the <br soft>early '60s soul jazz (which relied more on a groove) had developed out of hard bop although the two styles <br soft>frequently overlapped. As the '60s evolved, hard bop players started to incorporate aspects of both modal <br soft>music (staying on one chord for longer periods of time) and avant-garde into their music.<br><br>The beginning of hard bop on record is difficult to determine since its development from bop was a gradual <br soft>process. A good starting point is Miles Davis' Blue Note sessions of 1952-54; Davis seemed to be at the <br soft>start of a half-dozen styles! His Blue Note sides featured such important young hard bop stylists as altoist <br soft>Jackie McLean (whose sound was much different than the cooler-toned Paul Desmond and Lee Konitz), <br soft>tenor-saxophonist Sonny Rollins (a hard bop extension of Coleman Hawkins), trombonist J.J. Johnson, the <br soft>highly influential pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey.<br><br>Another important series of recordings were made by the Max Roach/Clifford Brown Quintet of 1954-56, a <br soft>unit that featured either Harold Land or Sonny Rollins on tenor. While Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis were <br soft>important influences on other trumpeters, Clifford Brown took his main inspiration from Fats Navarro (who <br soft>partly derived his style from Howard McGhee), a short-lived and fiery bop player whose warm tone and <br soft>logical ideas were easier for brassmen to follow than Gillespie's angular flights. Brownie, before his tragic <br soft>death in a car accident at age 25 in 1956, became jazz's brightest new trumpeter and his huge influence on <br soft>other trumpeters (and the entire hard bop movement in general) continues to this day. Since his time, Lee <br soft>Morgan, Freddie Hubbard and Woody Shaw to a large extent based their early styles on Clifford's.<br><br>With the gradual decline of West Coast Jazz during the mid-to-late '50s, hard bop essentially took over. A <br soft>whole generation of top young modernists developed in the wake of the innovations of Parker and <br soft>Gillespie, eager to develop their own voices. The development of the Lp in the late '40s had made <br soft>recordings not only lengthier (individual songs could now reach 20 minutes rather than the previous three) <br soft>but much more numerous. While many labels opted for inexpensive jam sessions, Blue Note (under the <br soft>direction of Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff) paid musicians for rehearsals and encouraged the inclusion of <br soft>new material. Their numerous releases were not only consistently high-quality (particularly during 1952-67) <br soft>but classy.<br><br>There were many top musicians involved in hard bop, but few were more important than drummer-leader <br soft>Art Blakey. The co-founder of the Jazz Messengers in 1955 with Horace Silver, Blakey retained the group's <br soft>name after Silver went out on his own. Throughout a 35-year period, Blakey was a masterful talent scout <br soft>(perhaps even surpassing Fletcher Henderson in earlier years and Miles Davis). The passionate drummer <br soft>pushed his musicians to play themselves rather than copy their role models and to come up with original <br soft>compositions. Here is a partial list of the young talent that benefited from their periods as members of the <br soft>Jazz Messengers: tenors Benny Golson, Hank Mobley, Johnny Griffin, Wayne Shorter, Billy Harper, Bill <br soft>Pierce and Javon Jackson, altoists Jackie McLean, Bobby Watson, Branford Marsalis and Donald <br soft>Harrison, pianists Bobby Timmons, Walter Davis Jr., Cedar Walton, John Hicks, Keith Jarrett, James <br soft>Williams, Donald Brown, Mulgrew Miller, Benny Green and Geoff Keezer, bassists Doug Watkins, Reggie <br soft>Workman and Charles Fambrough, trombonists Curtis Fuller and Robin Eubanks and trumpeters Kenny <br soft>Dorham, Donald Byrd, Bill Hardman, Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, Chuck Mangione, Woody Shaw, <br soft>Valeri Ponomarev, Wynton Marsalis, Wallace Roney, Terence Blanchard, Phillip Harper and Brian Lynch!<br><br>In addition to the Jazz Messengers, other significant hard bop groups included the Horace Silver Quintet <br soft>(particularly when it featured trumpeter Blue Mitchell and the tenor of Junior Cook), the Jazztet (with <br soft>trumpeter Art Farmer and Benny Golson on tenor) and the Cannonball Adderley Quintet (which crossed <br soft>over into soul jazz).<br><br>Even though the avant-garde began to garner most of the headlines by the early '60s, hard bop was <br soft>quantity-wise the most dominant jazz style of 1955-68. In general the pacesetters were trumpeters Clifford <br soft>Brown, Lee Morgan (who had a major hit in the mid-'60s with &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;) and Freddie Hubbard, <br soft>trombonists J.J. Johnson and Curtis Fuller, tenors Sonny Rollins and Hank Mobley (although John <br soft>Coltrane's influence was felt by the late '50s), altoists Phil Woods, Jackie McLean and Cannonball <br soft>Adderley, guitarists Kenny Burrell, Grant Green and Wes Montgomery, organist Jimmy Smith and pianists <br soft>Horace Silver and Bobby Timmons. As the 1960s progressed, such new players as tenors Joe Henderson <br soft>and Stanley Turrentine and trumpeter Woody Shaw emerged to give the music some fresh blood.<br><br>But by the mid-to-late-'60s hard bop was running out of gas. With the sale of Blue Note to Liberty and <br soft>eventually United Artists, the style (and jazz in general) gradually lost its most significant label. Soul jazz, <br soft>which was becoming more commercial, took part of hard bop's audience and many of the musicians were <br soft>looking elsewhere towards the emerging fusion movement, the avant-garde or more commercial sounds. <br soft>The rise of commercial rock and the consolidation of most of the independent record labels caused hard <br soft>bop to have a much lower profile in the 1970s as it was overshadowed by other trends.<br><br>However hard bop never died and in the 1980s it served as the inspiration for the Young Lions movement. <br soft>Wynton Marsalis and many of the other later graduates of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers used hard bop <br soft>(along with the post bop music of Miles Davis' mid-60s quintet) as a starting point for their own careers. <br soft>With so many young players being signed to major labels (at least for brief periods), hard bop suddenly <br soft>returned full force to the extent where detractors complained that the new musicians were merely recycling <br soft>the past. Although that was true to an extent, the top members of the Young Lions eventually developed their <br soft>own musical vision without forgetting their straightahead roots.<br><br>In the 1990s, hard bop is the modern mainstream music of the era. Sometimes called &quot;traditional&quot; or <br soft>merely &quot;mainstream,&quot; this style of music still seems to offer improvisers endless possibilities and is the <br soft>foundation of modern acoustic jazz.<br><br>17 Essential Hard Bop Recordings (listed roughly in chronological order:<br><br>Miles Davis, Vol. 1 (Blue Note)<br><br>Clifford Brown/Max Roach, At Basin Street (EmArcy)<br><br>Sonny Rollins, A Night at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note)<br><br>Horace Silver, And the Jazz Messengers (Blue Note)<br><br>Art Blakey, Moanin' (Blue Note)<br><br>Art Farmer/Benny Golson, Meet the Jazztet (Chess)<br><br>Jackie McLean, Bluesnik (Blue Note)<br><br>Hank Mobley, Workout (Blue Note)<br><br>Freddie Hubbard, Ready for Freddie (Blue Note)<br><br>Donald Byrd, Chant (Blue Note)<br><br>Wes Montgomery, Full House (Original Jazz Classics)<br><br>Lee Morgan, The Sidewinder (Blue Note)<br><br>Joe Henderson, Page One (Blue Note)<br><br>Grant Green, Idle Moments (Blue Note)<br><br>Cannonball Adderley, Dizzy's Business (Milestone)<br><br>Horace Silver, Song for My Father (Blue Note)<br><br>Art Blakey, Straight Ahead (Concord Jazz)<br><br></span></font></span>      </div>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p align="center"><br /><font color="#990000">[[p. 395]]</font> I. The Farmers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years of the century, English readers 
        enjoyed the perusal of many American works of fiction dealing with the 
        rural life of the Eastern States in those almost forgotten days when railways 
        and telegraphs were unknown, when all beyond the Mississippi was &quot;the 
        far west,&quot; when California and Texas were foreign countries, and when 
        millionnaires, tramps, and paupers were alike unknown. They introduced 
        us to an almost idyllic life, so far as rude abundance, varied occupations, 
        and mutual help and friendliness among neighbors constitute such a state 
        of existence. Almost all the necessaries and many of the comforts of life 
        were obtained by the farmer from his own land. He had abundance of bread, 
        meat, and poultry, with occasional game. Of butter, cheese, fruit, and 
        vegetables there was no lack. He made his own sugar from his maple trees, 
        and soap from refuse fat and wood ashes; while his clothes were the produce 
        of his own flocks, spun, and often dyed, woven, and made at home. His 
        land contained timber, not only for firing, but for fencing and house-building 
        materials, as well as for making many of his farm implements; and he easily 
        sold in the nearest town enough of his surplus products to provide the 
        few foreign luxuries that the family required. The farmer of that day 
        worked hard, no doubt, but he had also variety and recreation, and there 
        was none of that continuous grinding, hopeless toil, that appears to characterize 
        the life of the Western farmer to-day. As a rule, his farm was his own, 
        unburdened by either rent or mortgage. Year by year it increased in value, 
        and if he did not get rich he was at least able to live in comfort and 
        to give his sons and daughters a suitable start in life. In those days 
        wages of <font color="#990000">[[p. 396]]</font> all kinds were high; 
        food was cheap and abundant; and the strange phenomenon--yet so familiar 
        and so sad a phenomenon now--of men seeking for work in order to live, 
        and seeking it in vain, was absolutely unknown.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impression of general well being and contentment 
        given by these tales, was confirmed by the narratives of travellers and 
        the more solid works of students of society. All agreed in telling us 
        that not only the pauperism of Europe, but even ordinary poverty or want 
        was quite unknown. The absence of beggars was a noticeable fact; and except 
        in cases of illness, accident, or old age, occasions for the exercise 
        of charity could hardly arise. The extraordinary contrast between this 
        state of things and that which prevailed in Europe, had to be accounted 
        for, and several different causes were suggested. A favorite explanation 
        on both sides of the Atlantic was, that it was a matter of political institutions. 
        On the one hand, it was said, you have a Republican government, in which 
        all men have equal rights and no privileged classes can oppress or rob 
        the people; on the other, there is a luxurious court, a bloated aristocracy, 
        and an established church, quite sufficient to render a people poor and 
        miserable; and this was long the opinion of the English radicals, who 
        thought that the cost of the throne and of the church was the chief cause 
        of the poverty of the working classes. Others maintained that it was entirely 
        a matter of density of population. Europe, it was said, was overpeopled; 
        and it was prophesied that, as time went on, poverty would surely arise 
        in America and become intensified in Europe. More philosophical thinkers 
        imputed the difference to the fact that there was an inexhaustible supply 
        of unoccupied and fertile land in America, on which all who desired to 
        work could easily support themselves; and that, all surplus labor being 
        thus continually drawn off, wages were necessarily high, as the only means 
        of inducing men to work for others instead of for themselves. When the 
        accessible land was all occupied, it was anticipated that America would 
        reproduce the phenomena of poverty in the midst of wealth which are prevalent 
        throughout Europe.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is needless to point out that these anticipations 
        have been realized far sooner and far more completely than were ever thought 
        possible. The periodical literature of America teems with facts which 
        show that the workers of almost <font color="#990000">[[p. 397]]</font> every class are now very little, 
        if any, better off than those of the corresponding classes in England. 
        For though their wages are nominally higher, the working hours are longer; 
        many necessaries, especially clothing, tools, and house rent, are dearer; 
        while employment is, on the whole, less continuous. The identity of conditions 
        as regards the poverty and misery of the lower grades of workers is well 
        shown by the condition of the great cities on both sides of the Atlantic. 
        The description of the dwellers in the tenement houses of New York, Boston, 
        and Chicago exactly parallels that of the poorer London workers, as revealed 
        in the &quot;Bitter Cry of Outcast London,&quot; in the &quot;Report of the Sweating 
        Commission,&quot; and in cases of misery and starvation recorded almost daily 
        in the newspapers. In both we find the same horrible and almost incredible 
        destitution, the same murderous hours of labor, the same starvation wages; 
        and the official statistical outcome of this misery is almost the same 
        also. The English registrar-general records that considerably over one 
        tenth of all the deaths in London occur in the workhouses, while nearly 
        the same proportion receive pauper burial in New York.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry George, in his great work &quot;Progress and 
        Poverty,&quot; declares in his title page that there is, in modern civilization, 
        &quot;increase of want with increase of wealth&quot;; and in Book V., Chapter II., 
        he traces out the causes of &quot;the persistence of poverty amid advancing 
        wealth.&quot; The truth of this latter statement stares us in the face in every 
        country, and especially in every great city, of the civilized world; no 
        one can have the hardihood to deny it. But people are so dazzled by the 
        palpable signs which everywhere surround them of wealth and luxury; so 
        many comforts are now obtainable by the middle classes, which were formerly 
        unknown; so many and so wonderful have been the gifts of science in labor-saving 
        machinery, in the means of locomotion and of distant communication, and 
        in a hundred arts and processes which add to the innocent pleasures and 
        refinements of life; and again, so jubilant are our legislators and our 
        political writers over our ever-increasing trade and the vast bulk of 
        yearly growing wealth, that they cannot and will not believe in the increase 
        or even in the persistence of an equal amount of poverty as in former 
        years. That there <font color="#990000">[[p. 398]]</font> is far too much cruel and grinding poverty 
        in the midst of our civilization, they admit; but they comfort themselves 
        with the belief that it is decreasing; that, bad as it is, it is far better 
        than at any previous time during the present century, at all events; and 
        they scout the very notion that it is even proportionally as great as 
        ever, as too absurd to be seriously discussed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These good people, however, believe what they 
        wish to believe, and persistently shut their eyes to facts. Even in Great 
        Britain it can, I believe, be demonstrated that there is actually a greater 
        bulk of poverty and starvation than one hundred or even fifty years ago; 
        probably even a larger proportion of the population suffering the cruel 
        pangs of cold and hunger. I need not here go into the evidence for this 
        statement, beyond referring to two facts. There has, during the last thirty 
        or forty years, been an enormous extension of the sphere of private charity, 
        together with a judicious organization calculated to minimize its pauperizing 
        effects.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the marvellous work of Dr. Barnado and 
        General Booth, there are in London, and in all our great cities, scores 
        of general and hundreds of local charities; while the number of earnest 
        men and women who devote their lives to alleviating the sorrows and sufferings 
        of the poor, have been steadily increasing, and may now be counted by 
        thousands. The fact of a slight diminution in the amount of state relief 
        under the poor law is, therefore, quite consistent with a great increase 
        of real poverty; yet this slight diminution is again and again cited to 
        show that the people are really better off. This decrease is, however, 
        wholly due to the growing system, favored by the authorities, of refusing 
        all outdoor relief, the place of which is fully taken by the increase 
        of private and systematized charity. And there is good proof that this 
        vast growth of charitable relief has not overtaken the still greater increase 
        of real pauperism. This proof is to be found in the steadily increasing 
        proportion of the population of London which dies in the workhouses. The 
        registrargeneral gives this number as <em>6,743</em> in 1872; in 1881 
        it had risen to <em>10,692</em>, and in 1891 to <em>12,473</em>. Thus 
        the deaths of paupers in workhouses had increased 85 per cent from 1872 
        to 1891, while the total deaths in London during the same period had increased 
        from 70,893 to 90,216, or 27 per cent. It may be thought that this has 
        been caused <font color="#990000">[[p. 399]]</font> by the influx of the poor into the towns; but it 
        is mainly the young that thus emigrate; and the registrar-general shows 
        that the same increase of deaths in workhouses has occurred, though in 
        a less degree, in the whole country. In his report for 1888, the only 
        one I have at hand, he says: &quot;The proportion of deaths recorded in workhouses, 
        which steadily increased from 5.6 per cent in 1875 to 6.7 per cent in 
        1885, further rose, after a slight decline in 1886 and 1887, to 6.9 per 
        cent in 1888.&quot; The same continuous increase of aged pauperism is thus 
        proved to occur in all England, but to be especially great in the larger 
        cities; and this fact appears to me to demonstrate the increase of poverty 
        during the last twenty years of rapidly increasing wealth, and ever-growing 
        luxury. And at the same time, notwithstanding all the efforts of all the 
        charitable institutions and philanthropic associations, we see every week 
        in the papers, though only a few of these cases get noticed, such headings 
        as &quot;Shocking Destitution,&quot; &quot;Destitution and Death,&quot; proving that the official 
        records, terrible though they are, only show us a portion, perhaps only 
        a small portion, of the wretchedness and poverty culminating in actual 
        death from want of food, fire, and clothing, in the midst of the wealthiest 
        city the world has ever seen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if any real doubt can exist as to the actual 
        increase of poverty in England, we have in America an object lesson in 
        which the fact is demonstrated with a clearness and fulness that admits 
        of no dispute. Fifty years ago there was, practically, no poverty, as 
        we now understand the word, in the sense of men willing to work being 
        unable to procure the bare necessaries of life. Now these exist by tens 
        of thousands, culminating in all the great cities, in actual death caused 
        or accelerated by want of the barest necessaries of life. That the wealth 
        of the community has increased enormously in this period, there is also 
        no doubt. According to Mr. Mulhall, the great English statistician, the 
        total wealth of the United States increased nearly seven-fold from 1850 
        to 1888, while the population had increased less than two and three-fourths 
        fold. Here, then, we have a clear and palpable &quot;increase of want with 
        increase of wealth&quot;; and as the causes which have been at work in the 
        production of this increased wealth are of exactly the same nature in 
        America and in England, only that they have acted with more <font color="#990000">[[p. 400]]</font> 
        intensity in America, we are justified in the conclusion that the coincident 
        increase of want has occurred also, though with less intensity, in England. 
        The causes of the enormous wealth-increase are simple and indisputable. 
        First, steam power has increased in America seven-fold (and probably as 
        much in England), and its application to ever-improving labor-saving machinery 
        has given it an effective productive power of perhaps twenty-fold or even 
        more; secondly, railways have spread over the country, enabling the varied 
        products of the whole land to be more and more utilized. The result of 
        these two great factors has been the corresponding increase of agriculture, 
        mining, manufactures, and commerce, by means of which the increased wealth 
        has been directly produced. If, then, fifty years ago there was practically 
        no want in the United States, and there is now, say, ten times the wealth, 
        with about four times the population, not only ought there to be no want 
        of any kind, but all those who had mere necessaries before should be able 
        to have comforts and even luxuries now; hours of labor should be shorter, 
        and the struggle for existence less severe. But the facts are the very 
        opposite of these; and there has evidently been an increasing inequality 
        in the distribution of the wealth produced. The result of this inequality 
        is seen, broadly, in the increase of wealth and luxury on the one hand, 
        and of the most grinding poverty on the other; and more particularly in 
        the growth and increase of millionnaires. Fifty years ago a millionnaire 
        was a rarity in England; now they are so common as to excite no special 
        attention. In America in 1840, there was probably no one worth one million 
        pounds (five million dollars). Now there are certainly hundreds, perhaps 
        over a thousand, who own as much; and it has been estimated that two hundred 
        and fifty thousand persons own three fourths of the whole wealth of the 
        country.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paradox of increasing want with increasing 
        wealth is thus clearly explained. If we take the two hundred and fifty 
        thousand persons above referred to to be heads of families, four to a 
        family, we have a million persons absorbing three fourths of the wealth 
        created by the whole community, the remaining fifty-nine millions having 
        the remaining one fourth between them; and as probably half of these are 
        comfortably off, the other half have to exist in various <font color="#990000">[[p. 401]]</font> grades 
        of destitution from genteel poverty down to absolute starvation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we have now to solve is, to discover 
        what are the special legal and social conditions that have enabled a small 
        proportion of the community to possess themselves of so much of the wealth 
        which the whole of the community have helped to produce. That much of 
        this wealth has been obtained dishonestly, is quite certain, yet it has 
        for the most part been obtained quite legally; and it is probable that 
        if the whole of the transactions of some of the chief of American millionnaires 
        were made public, few of them would be found to be contrary to law, or 
        even contrary to what public opinion holds to be quite justifiable modes 
        of getting rich. Yet there is probably a very large majority of voters 
        who see the evil results of the system, and would be glad to alter it 
        if they knew how. They have a vague feeling that something is wrong in 
        the social organization which renders such results possible. They begin 
        to see that the old explanations of the poverty and starvation in Europe 
        were all wrong; since, though America still possesses its republican constitution, 
        though it is still free from hereditary aristocracy, state church, or 
        the relics of a feudal system, though its population is less than twenty 
        to a square mile, while Great Britain has over three hundred, it has, 
        nevertheless, reached an almost identical condition of great extremes 
        of wealth and poverty, of fierce struggles between capitalists and laborers, 
        of crowded cities where women are often compelled to work sixteen hours 
        a day in order to sustain life, and where thousands of little children 
        cry in vain for food. The causes that have led to such identical results, 
        slowly in the one case, more rapidly in the other, must in all probability 
        be identical in their fundamental nature.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present writer has long since arrived at 
        very definite conclusions as to what these causes are, and what are the 
        measures which alone will remedy the evil. In America there has hitherto 
        been a great prejudice against these measures because they run counter 
        to one of the institutions which has profoundly influenced society, and 
        which, till quite recently, has been considered to be almost perfect and 
        to be of inestimable value--I allude, of course, to the land system of 
        the United States. It is because the present <font color="#990000">[[p. 402]]</font> generation has 
        been taught to look upon this land system as almost perfect, that we now 
        behold the curious phenomenon of a large and most important class of the 
        community, the Western farmers, while almost on the brink of ruin, yet 
        quite unable to discover the real cause of their suffering, and frantically 
        asking help of the government through action which might, perhaps, alleviate 
        their immediate distress, but could have no effect in permanently benefiting 
        them. As this question of the farmers is one calculated to throw light 
        on the whole problem of &quot;increasing want with increasing wealth,&quot; it will 
        be well to devote a little space to its discussion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers in the great food-producing states 
        of the West are admitted to be very badly off. A large proportion of them 
        are crushed down by heavy mortgages, others are tenants at high rents, 
        and almost all have a hard struggle for a bare livelihood.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
        Their friends and representatives consider that their misfortunes depend 
        primarily on financial and fiscal legislation, and advocate reforms of 
        this nature. Mr. S. S. King of Kansas City says: &quot;The first step in legislation 
        is for the people to undo, so far as they can, the things done by the 
        hired tools of the monopolists, repeal the National Banking Act, pay off 
        the bonds, stop the interest, call in the National Bank notes, and replace 
        them with full legal-tender paper money issued by the government. . . 
        . Then let the government reclaim from the railroads all the land still 
        held by them beyond what is necessary for the operation of the roads . 
        . . take absolute control of the roads . . . then level to the ground 
        the tariff-tax abomination.&quot; Hon. James H. Kyle, U. S. Senator from South 
        Dakota, says: &quot;To pass the income tax; to sweep away national banks; to 
        restore free coinage of gold and silver; to have money issued directly 
        to the people in sufficient volume to meet the needs of <font color="#990000">[[p. 403]]</font> legitimate 
        business--these are the reforms which are entirely within the reach of 
        earnest and persistent agitation. . . . Land loans and produce loans would 
        surely follow. . . . The nationalization of the great highways of commerce 
        would inevitably follow.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These same reforms are advocated by General J. 
        B. Weaver in his powerful work &quot;A Call to Action&quot;; and he imputes all 
        the evils of the present land system--the increase of large proprietors, 
        the rapidly increasing army of tenants, the numerous mortgages at high 
        interest, and the universal distress of the agriculturists--to causes 
        connected with the banking system and with the tariff.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, so far as I can understand these difficult 
        questions, all the evils pointed out by these writers are real and very 
        great evils, and the remedies they suggest may to some extent remove these 
        evils; but I feel convinced that these are <em>not</em> the fundamental 
        evils as regards the farmers. The suggested remedies would benefit them 
        along with the rest of the community, but would not remove the troubles 
        that specially affect the tillers of the soil. It would, no doubt, be 
        an advantage to be able to pay off existing mortgages with money advanced 
        by the government at very low interest; but an agriculture that rests 
        on mortgages, whether at high or at low interest, is not a successful 
        agriculture. General Weaver truly says: &quot;The cultivation of the soil should 
        be, and in fact is, under natural conditions, the surest road to opulence 
        known among men. Under just relations it would be impossible to impoverish 
        this calling, for it feeds, clothes, and shelters the human family.&quot; And 
        again: &quot;What the farmer most wants is a good price for the products of 
        his farm rather than an advance in the value of the farm itself.&quot; But 
        he does not pursue this point, and does not show how any of the remedial 
        measures suggested can possibly raise the price of farm produce; and unless 
        this is done, the farmer's condition, though it may be somewhat ameliorated, 
        will never be raised to the degree of comfort and security which ought 
        to be enjoyed by those whose labor provides the food of the community.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then try and get at the root of this question. 
        Why is it that the degree of comfort and safety of the American farmer 
        has, during the last fifty years or less, so greatly deteriorated? What 
        is the cause of the strange <font color="#990000">[[p. 404]]</font> phenomenon of food being sold by 
        its producers at such low prices as to be unremunerative to them? It is 
        evident that these prices are determined by competition. How is it that 
        in this particular business competition has forced prices down to such 
        a point as to be permanently unprofitable? The causes that have brought 
        this about are clearly twofold: the absence of the equalizing power of 
        RENT, and the competition of capitalist or <em>bonanza</em> farms. Why 
        this is so will now be explained.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the almost universal custom in America 
        (until recently) of purchase rather than rental of land, and the wide-spread 
        interests involved in real-estate speculation, the true nature of RENT, 
        as thoroughly worked out by the political economists of Europe, is quite 
        unknown except to the comparatively few who have made a special study 
        of the subject. It is therefore necessary to show, in as clear a manner 
        as possible, its economic importance, and that it is really the key to 
        the whole problem of American agricultural distress.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent is the equalizer of opportunities, the means 
        of giving fair play to all cultivators of the soil in the struggle for 
        existence. Farms differ greatly in value, from two quite distinct causes: 
        the fertility of the land itself, as dependent on soil and climate, is 
        one cause; situation, as regards distance from a railroad or from a market, 
        is the other. Let us suppose one farm to produce thirty bushels of wheat 
        an acre, another only twenty, with the same labor and cost, and that the 
        first farm is only a mile from a railroad, while the other is ten miles 
        over a bad and hilly track. The owner of the first farm will evidently 
        have a double advantage over the owner of the other, both in the amount 
        of his crops and the economy in getting them to market; and prices which 
        will enable the first to live comfortably and lay by money, will mean 
        poverty or ruin to the second. It is just the same as with shops or stores. 
        The business done, other things being equal, will depend upon situation. 
        If one store is situated in a main street, with five hundred people passing 
        the door every hour, and another store just like it is in a by-street 
        where not more than fifty people pass per hour, and both sell exactly 
        the same goods of the same quality, and neither have any special connection 
        or reputation, but depend mainly on chance customers, then it is quite 
        certain <font color="#990000">[[p. 405]]</font> that the one will make a living where the other will 
        starve. Now prices are fixed by the competition of the whole of the stores 
        of these two classes, and the more favored class will run down prices 
        just so low that the less favored class can hardly live; and the inevitable 
        result will be that many of them will be starved out, and the whole of 
        the business be absorbed by the other class. But if all these shops belong 
        to landlords, whether private individuals or the municipalities, then 
        rents will be so much higher in the one class than in the other as to 
        approximately equalize the opportunities of both. Both will then be able 
        to earn a living for a time, and the ultimate superior success of either 
        will be a matter of business capacity. The competition between them will 
        be fair and equal.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing happens with rival manufacturers. 
        Facilities for getting raw material, cheapness of water power, and above 
        all the possession of the best and most improved machinery, enable one 
        to undersell another, and ultimately to drive him out of the market, unless 
        the latter can improve his conditions, or the former is subject to an 
        increased rent, to compensate for his advantages of position.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the case of the farmer there is no possibility 
        of removing the disadvantages of some as compared with others. Land which 
        is naturally poor can never be made equal to that which is naturally fertile; 
        neither can a farm be moved bodily near to a market or to a railway. The 
        competition between different farmers is, therefore, not a fair one. As 
        more land is cultivated and more surplus grain produced, those having 
        the advantage in land and situation will get their produce earliest to 
        market; and those who come later, when the market is already well supplied, 
        must take a lower price. Year by year, as the output of grain increases, 
        the price becomes lower still, till it reaches a point at which those 
        worst situated cannot afford to grow it at all. Then either the worst 
        farms go out of cultivation, or some other crops are grown, or the owner, 
        burthened with mortgages, is sold out, and his farm is perhaps joined 
        to another, and goes to form one of the great capitalist farms, which 
        form another means of driving down prices below the level at which the 
        less favored farmers can make a living.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people argue that if large farming pays 
        where small farming will not pay, that large farming therefore produces 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 406]]</font> more food and is better for the country. But this is a great 
        mistake. The farms measured by thousands of acres never produce so much 
        per acre as the small farms of fifty or a hundred acres. In the former 
        the object is to reduce the cost of labor to a minimum, and so leave a 
        larger profit to the owner. Whether in Australia, Dakota, or California, 
        the great machine-worked farms only produce from about eight to twelve 
        or twenty bushels of wheat an acre; but on ten thousand acres a very small 
        profit per bushel will give a large income, while the same profit on a 
        much larger produce per acre will starve the small farmer. In 1879 the 
        wheat produce of the United States varied in the several states from an 
        average of seven bushels an acre in North Carolina and Mississippi, to 
        nineteen and twenty bushels in Michigan and Indiana; and in the bad year, 
        1884, the range was from five bushels to twenty bushels. But as these 
        are the averages of whole states, the produce of the several farms must 
        have a very much wider range; and the profit made will vary still more 
        than the produce, owing to much greater cost of carriage to market in 
        some cases than in others. It thus happens that the variations in the 
        cost of producing a bushel of wheat are, in the United States, extremely 
        large, perhaps larger than in any other part of the world, because, in 
        the first place, that cost is not equalized by any general payment of 
        rent for the land in proportion to its better or worse quality; and in 
        the second place, because capitalists have been allowed to acquire enormous 
        areas of land from which, by means of machinery and a very little hired 
        labor, they can make large profits from a very small produce per acre.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people will say that this result is a good 
        one. Bread is made cheap, and that benefits the whole community. This, 
        however, is one of those utterly narrow views by which capitalist writers 
        delude the people. All other things being equal, cheap bread is doubtless 
        better than dear; but if cheap bread is only obtained through the poverty 
        or ruin of the bulk of those who grow it, and if its value to most other 
        workers is discounted by lower wages or smaller earnings, both of which 
        propositions are in the present state of society demonstrably true, then 
        cheap bread is altogether evil.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few better definitions of good government 
        than that it renders possible for all, and actually produces in the <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        407]]</font> great majority of cases, happy homes and a contented people. Unless 
        a number of the best writers of American fiction, and a considerable proportion 
        of these who contribute to the most serious periodicals of the day, are 
        deluding their readers, the present system of cheap bread production is 
        founded on privation, misery, or ruin in the houses of thousands of farmers, 
        and on the unnatural growth of great cities, with a corresponding increase 
        of millionnaires, of pauperism, and of crime.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the exposition now given of the causes of 
        the sufferings of the Western farmers is correct,--and I have the greatest 
        confidence that it is so,--the only thorough remedy will be to bring the 
        land back into the possession of the people, to be administered locally 
        for the benefit of the men who actually use it, never for those who want 
        it only for speculation; and by means of a carefully adjusted system of 
        rents or land taxes, to equalize the benefits to be derived by occupiers 
        from the land (as regards quality and situation), so that none will be 
        able to undersell others to their ruin. Prices will then be adjusted by 
        fair competition, and will fall to the lowest level compatible with the 
        usual standard of living of the time and place, and will be such as to 
        leave a clear margin of profit for the support of a family and for provision 
        for old age.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will of course be understood that under such 
        a system the farmers would be really as much the owners of their land 
        as if they possessed the fee simple and were free of mortgage. So long 
        as the very moderate differential rent or land tax was paid, the farmer 
        would have perpetual, undisturbed possession, with the right to bequeath 
        or sell, just as he has now. Rents would never be raised on the farmer's 
        improvements, but only on any increase of value of the land itself, due 
        to the action of the community, as when increase of population or new 
        railroads so raised prices or cheapened production as to increase the 
        inherent value of land in that locality in proportion to its value in 
        other localities. But it should be always recognized that the creation 
        of &quot;happy homes,&quot; so far as material well being affects them, is the first 
        object of land legislation; and thus rents should in every case be assessed 
        low enough to secure that end, always supposing reasonable care and industry 
        in the farmer, which would be sufficiently indicated by the average result.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 408]]</font> Under such a system of land tenure 
        as is here suggested, the farmer's life would become a peaceable and happy 
        one, more like that of the early days, when he supplied most of his own 
        wants, and only needed to sell a portion of his surplus products. Every 
        benefit which the community at large may derive by the abolition of import 
        duties, and the operation of the railroads by the state for the good of 
        all, would be fully enjoyed by the farmer also, and his standard of comfort 
        would gradually rise. If, however, these last mentioned reforms are made 
        without any alteration of land tenure, he will not be permanently benefited, 
        because the competition of the better, rent-free land, and also that of 
        the great capitalist farmers, will still drive prices down to the lowest 
        point at which he can just exist. This competition will act quite as surely 
        and quite as cruelly as the competition of laborers in the towns and cities, 
        which always drives down the earnings of unskilled labor to the very lowest 
        point, a point which is kept stationary by the presence of a large body 
        of the unemployed on the verge of starvation and always ready to work 
        at a little above starvation wages.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will no doubt be objected that, even admitting 
        such a land system to be desirable, there is now no equitable means of 
        getting the land back, except the impossible one of purchase from existing 
        owners. But this is a mistake, and several practical methods have been 
        or can be suggested. We have, first, the &quot;single tax&quot; of Mr. George, which 
        has already obtained many adherents. At first sight farmers may think 
        this would increase their burthens; but it would, on the contrary, relieve 
        them, because all land would be taxed on its inherent, not on its improved, 
        value. Now the inherent value of land in and around cities is enormous, 
        and is not now fairly assessed. This city land would bear a much larger 
        share of taxation than now; farm land proportionally less; and as this 
        single tax would be accompanied by the removal of all duties on imported 
        goods and produce, the farmer's tools, machinery, and clothing would be 
        greatly cheapened.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But notwithstanding this single tax on land values, 
        it might still be worth the while of great capitalists, companies, and 
        trusts to hold large areas of land, because they could derive both profit 
        and power from it in various indirect ways. The people will never be free 
        from the countless <font color="#990000">[[p. 409]]</font> evils of land-monopoly and land-speculation 
        until it is declared contrary to public policy for any one to hold land 
        except for personal use and occupation. A date might then be fixed before 
        which all land not personally occupied must be sold; and that it should 
        be really sold might be insured by declaring that afterwards no rental 
        or other charge on land to individuals or companies would be recoverable 
        at law. All municipalities, townships, or other local authorities should, 
        however, have a prior and also a continuous right to purchase all such 
        land at a moderate but fair valuation, paying for it with bonds bearing 
        a low interest and redeemable at fixed dates. In this way the public would 
        be able to acquire most of the land for some miles around all towns and 
        cities; and as this would certainly increase rapidly in value, through 
        growth of population and municipal improvements, the bonds could in a 
        few years be redeemed out of the increased rents.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, another quite distinct method 
        of reclaiming the land for the community, which has many advantages. This 
        may be affected by carrying into practice two great ethical principles. 
        These are, first, that the unborn have no individual rights to succeed 
        to property; and, second, that there is no equitable principle involved 
        in <em>collateral</em> succession to property, whatever there may be in 
        <em>direct</em> succession. By the application of these two principles 
        the people may, if they so will, in the course of some eighty years gradually 
        regain possession of the whole national domain, without either confiscation 
        or purchase. The law should declare that, after a certain date, land would 
        cease to be transferable except to direct descendants--children or grandchildren; 
        and, that, when all the children of these direct descendants, who were 
        living at the time of passing the law, had died out, the land should revert 
        to the state. As people owning land, but having no children, are dying 
        daily, while even whole families often die off in a few years, land would 
        be continually falling in, to be let out to applicants on a secure and 
        permanent tenure, as already explained, so as best to subserve the wants 
        of the community.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, then, are two very distinct methods of 
        obtaining the land, both thoroughly justifiable when the welfare of a 
        whole nation is at stake. The last named is that which seems best to the 
        present writer, since it would at once abolish the <font color="#990000">[[p. 410]]</font> greatest 
        evils of the American social system--those founded on land speculation 
        and land monopoly; while the land itself would be acquired by means involving 
        the minimum of interference with the property or welfare of any living 
        persons. But, unless by these or some analogous measures farmers are relieved 
        from the competition of great capitalists, while competition among themselves 
        is rendered fair and equal by a differential rent or land tax, no other 
        kind of legislation can possibly relieve the majority of them from the 
        state of poverty and continuous labor in which they now exist. In an unfair 
        and unequal competition the less favored must always be beaten.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The once familiar term &quot;republican simplicity&quot; 
        is now an unmeaning one, since both in France and in America there is 
        an amount of wealth and luxury not surpassed in any of the old monarchies. 
        Yet it serves to show us the ideal which the founders of republics fondly 
        hoped to attain. They aimed at abolishing forever, not only the rank and 
        titles of hereditary nobility, but also those vast differences of wealth 
        and social grade which were supposed to depend upon monarchical government. 
        Their objects were to secure, not only political and religious freedom, 
        but also an approximate equality of social conditions; or, at the very 
        least, an adequate share of the comforts and enjoyments of life for every 
        industrious citizen. Yet after a century of unprecedented growth, and 
        the utilization of the natural riches of a great continent, we find to-day, 
        in all the great cities of the United States, thousands and tens of thousands 
        who by constant toil cannot secure necessaries and comforts for their 
        children or make any provision for an old age of peaceful repose. One 
        great object of republican institutions has, it is clear, not been attained. 
        Let us now endeavor to form some idea of the extent and nature of the 
        disease of the social organism, so as more effectually to provide the 
        true remedy.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his &quot;Social Problems&quot; (written in 1883) Henry 
        George thus refers to the condition of one of the richest states of the 
        union, Illinois: &quot;In their last report the Illinois Commissioners of Labor 
        Statistics say that their tables of wages and cost of living are representative 
        only of intelligent working men who make the most of their advantages, 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 526]]</font> and do not reach 'the confines of that world of helpless ignorance 
        and destitution in which multitudes in all large cities continually live, 
        and whose only statistics are those of epidemics, pauperism, and crime.' 
        Nevertheless, they go on to say, an examination of these tables will demonstrate 
        that one half of these intelligent working men of Illinois 'are not even 
        able to earn enough for their daily bread, and have to depend upon the 
        labor of women and children to eke out their miserable existence.'&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Edward Aveling, in his book on the &quot;Working 
        Class Movement in America,&quot; quotes from the same reports for other states 
        as follows: &quot;In Massachusetts a physician gives evidence as to the condition 
        of Fall River: 'Every mill in the city is making money, . . . but the 
        operatives travel in the same old path--sickness, suffering, and small 
        pay.'&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pennsylvania the commissioners say, &quot;The rich 
        and poor are further apart than ever.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Jersey, &quot;The struggle for existence is 
        daily becoming keener, and the average wage laborer must practise the 
        strictest economy, or he will find himself behind at the end of the season.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kansas, &quot;The condition of the laboring classes 
        is too bad for utterance. . . . It is useless to disguise the fact that 
        out of this . . . enforced idleness grows much of the discontent and dissatisfaction 
        now pervading the country, and which has obtained a strong footing now 
        upon the soil of Kansas, where only the other day her pioneers were staking 
        out homesteads almost within sight of her capital city.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Michigan, &quot;Labor to-day is poorer paid than 
        ever before; more discontent exists, more men in despair; and if a change 
        is not soon devised, trouble must come.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pages of <em>The Arena</em>, within the 
        last two years, I find the following statements:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the city of New York there are over one hundred 
        and fifty thousand people who earn less than sixty cents a day. Thousands 
        of this number are poor girls who work from eleven to sixteen hours a 
        day. Last year there were over twenty-three thousand families forcibly 
        evicted in that city owing to their inability to pay their rent.&quot; (<em>Arena</em>, 
        February, 1891, p. 375.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During the ten years which ended in 1889, the 
        great metropolis of the western continent added to the assessed <font color="#990000">[[p. 527]]</font> 
        value of its taxable property almost half a billion dollars. In all other 
        essential respects save one, the decade was a period of retrogression 
        for New York City. Crime, pauperism, insanity, and suicide increased; 
        repression by brute force personified in an armed police was fostered, 
        while the education of the children of the masses ebbed lower and lower. 
        The standing army of the homeless swelled to twelve thousand nightly lodgers 
        in a single precinct, and forty thousand children were forced to toil 
        for scanty bread.&quot; (<em>Arena</em>, August, 1891, p. 365.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When the compulsory education law went into 
        effect (in Chicago), the inspectors found in the squalid region a great 
        number of children so destitute that they were absolutely unfit to attend 
        school on account of their far more than semi-nude condition; and although 
        a number of noble-hearted ladies banded together and decently clothed 
        three hundred of these almost naked boys and girls, they were compelled 
        to admit the humiliating fact that they had only reached the outskirts, 
        while the great mass of poverty had not been touched. . . . On one night 
        last February, one hundred and twenty-four destitute men begged for shelter 
        at the cells of one of the city police stations.&quot; (<em>Arena</em>, November, 
        1891, p. 761.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Within cannon shot of Beacon Hill, where proudly 
        rises the golden dome of the Capitol, are hundreds of families slowly 
        starving and stifling; families who are bravely battling for life's barest 
        necessities, while year by year the conditions are becoming more hopeless, 
        the struggle for bread fiercer, the outlook more dismal.&quot; (<em>Arena</em>, 
        March, 1892, p. 524.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above extracts may serve to give an imperfect 
        indication of the condition of those whose labor produces much of America's 
        phenomenal wealth. Volumes would not suffice to picture a tithe of the 
        misery, starvation, and degradation that pervades all the great cities, 
        and to a less extent the smaller manufacturing towns and rural districts; 
        and one of the latest writers on the subject gives it as his conclusion, 
        &quot;that there is in the heart of America's money centre a poverty as appalling, 
        as hopeless, as degrading, as exists in any civilized community on earth.&quot; 
        (<em>Arena</em>, December, 1892, p. 49.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it be clearly understood that I do not in 
        any way <font color="#990000">[[p. 528]]</font> imply that republicanism is itself the cause of this 
        state of things. It simply exists in spite of republicanism, and serves 
        to demonstrate the great truth that systems of government are in themselves 
        powerless to abolish poverty. The startling, and at first sight depressing, 
        fact that grinding poverty dogs the footsteps of civilization under all 
        forms of government alike, is really, from one point of view, a hopeful 
        circumstance, since it assures us that the source of the evil is one that 
        is common alike to republic, constitutional monarchy, and despotism, and 
        we are thus taught where not to look for the remedy. We find it prevailing 
        where militarism is at a maximum, as in France, Italy, and Germany, and 
        where it is at a minimum, as in the United States. It is quite as bad 
        in thinly as in thickly populated countries; but the one thing that it 
        always accompanies is CAPITALISM. Wherever wealth accumulates most rapidly 
        in the hands of private capitalists, there--notwithstanding the most favorable 
        conditions, such as general education, free institutions, a fertile soil, 
        and the fullest use of labor-saving machinery--poverty not only persists 
        but increases. We must therefore look for the source of the evil in something 
        that favors the accumulation of individual wealth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, great wealth is obtained by individuals 
        in two ways: either by speculation, which is but a form of gambling and 
        perhaps the very worst form, since it impoverishes, not a few fellow-gamblers 
        only, but the whole community; or by large industrial enterprises, and 
        these depend for their success on the existence of great bodies of laborers 
        who have no means of living except by wage labor, and are thus absolutely 
        dependent on employment by capitalists in order to sustain life, and are 
        compelled in the last resort to accept such wages as the capitalists choose 
        to give. The result of these conditions is very low wages, or if nominally 
        higher wages, then intermittent work; and thus we find in all great cities--in 
        New York, Chicago, London, Vienna, for example, in this winter of 1892-93--tens 
        of thousands of men out of work, and either partially supported by charity 
        or undergoing slow starvation. Now I propose to show that these terrible 
        phenomena, pervading all modern civilizations alike--speculation, capitalism, 
        compulsory idleness of those willing to labor, women and children starving 
        or killed by overwork--all arise as the natural consequences and direct 
        results of private <font color="#990000">[[p. 529]]</font> property, and consequent monopoly in land. 
        This is the <em>one</em> identical feature in the social economy of modern 
        civilizations, and it alone is an adequate cause for an identity of results 
        when so many of the conditions of existence in the great civilized communities 
        of to-day are not identical but altogether diverse.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must always remember that the existence of 
        large numbers of surplus laborers, which is at once the indication and 
        the measure of poverty, is a purely artificial phenomenon. There is no 
        surplus as regards land and natural products waiting to be transmuted 
        by labor into various forms of wealth; there is no surplus as regards 
        demand for this wealth by those in want of all the comforts and many of 
        the barest necessaries of life, and who only ask to be allowed to call 
        those necessaries into existence by their labor. The only surplus is a 
        surplus as regards demand for laborers by capitalists, a surplus which 
        owes its existence wholly to artificial conditions which are fundamentally 
        wrong. It is not a natural but a man-created surplus, and all the want 
        and misery and crime that spring from it is equally man-created, and altogether 
        unnatural and unnecessary.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those early times to which I referred in my 
        first article, wages were higher, food cheaper, and there were practically 
        none unemployed. Why was this? The country was then far less rich; there 
        was almost no labor-saving machinery; yet no one wanted food, clothing, 
        or fire. The reason simply was that immediately around most of the smaller 
        towns was land which could be had for little or nothing; and farther off 
        was everywhere the forest or the prairie, where any one might build his 
        log hut, grow his corn, or even hunt or fish to support life. Every one 
        could then easily find land from which he could, by his own labor, support 
        himself and his family. There was a charm in the free life, and men were 
        continually drifting away from civilization to enjoy it. Therefore it 
        was that wage labor was <font color="#990000">[[p. 530]]</font> scarce and wages high, for no one would 
        work for low wages when he had the alternative of working for himself. 
        The laborer could then really make a &quot;free contract&quot; with the capitalist 
        who required his services, because he would have an alternative; or, at 
        all events, a sufficient number would have this alternative, and would 
        avail themselves of it, to prevent there being any surplus labor vainly 
        seeking employment.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the great majority of the unemployed have 
        no such alternative. It is either work for the capitalist or starve. Hence 
        &quot;free contract&quot; is a mockery; the wages of unskilled labor is the minimum 
        that will support life in a working condition,--it cannot permanently 
        be less,--and skilled labor obtains somewhat better terms just in proportion 
        as it is plentiful or scarce. If, then, we really desire that laborers 
        shall all be better paid, and none be unemployed (and the two things necessarily 
        go together), we <em>must</em> enable a large proportion of all wage workers 
        to have a sufficiency of land, by the cultivation of which they can obtain 
        food for themselves and their families, and thus have an alternative to 
        starvation wages. There is absolutely no other way, because it is from 
        land alone that a man can, by his own labor, obtain food without the intervention 
        of a capitalist employer. But in order to insure his doing this, he must 
        have the land on a permanent tenure; he must be able to live on it, and 
        must never be taxed on the improvements he himself makes on it; and though 
        he may be allowed to sell or bequeath it, he must not be allowed to mortgage 
        it, since what we want is to create as many secure and permanent <em>homes</em> 
        as possible, as the only safe foundation for a prosperous and happy community.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to do this--not here and there in 
        certain localities, but everywhere throughout the length and breadth of 
        the Union--the people must resume the land, which should never have been 
        parted with, to be administered locally for the benefit of all, and to 
        be held always for <em>use</em>, never for speculation. People are now 
        beginning to see that land speculation is the curse of the country. Millionnaires 
        have, in almost every case, grown by what is, fundamentally, land speculation. 
        It is this which has enabled the few to acquire the bulk of the wealth 
        created by the many toilers; and it is by the monopoly of land, whether 
        in city lots, in railroads, <font color="#990000">[[p. 531]]</font> mines, bonanza farms, vast forests, 
        or vaster cattle ranches, that the rich are ever growing richer, and the 
        poor more numerous.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an American town or city to-day, it is practically 
        impossible for the worker to obtain land for cultivation, except at town-lot 
        prices; while beyond the municipal limits the land is usually held in 
        farms of one hundred and sixty acres or more, the owners of which are 
        all holding for a rise in value when the town limits are extended so as 
        to include some of their property. But so soon as the land becomes all 
        municipal or township property, and it becomes recognized that on its 
        proper use depends the well being of the workers, these workers, being 
        everywhere in the majority, will see that beyond the central business 
        part of the town, the land is let in lots of from one to five or ten acres 
        at fair agricultural rents, and on a permanent tenure. Such small lots 
        would be a twofold benefit to the community. In the first place they would 
        constitute homesteads for workers, where they and their families could 
        utilize every portion of spare time in the production of vegetables, fruit, 
        poultry, eggs, pork, and other foodstuffs, which would supply their families 
        with a considerable portion of their daily food. In the second place they 
        would supply the town itself with fresh and wholesome vegetables, fruit, 
        eggs, etc., and also, from the larger plots of five or ten acres, abundance 
        of fresh milk and butter and other farm and garden produce. A little farther 
        off, the regular farms, held in the same way, would provide the town with 
        wheat, corn, hay, beef, mutton, and other necessaries; and thus each town 
        and the surrounding district would be to a large extent self-contained 
        and self-supporting.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the very reverse of this is the case; most 
        of the towns and cities drawing their supplies mainly from great distances, 
        the country immediately around them being often but half cultivated. Certain 
        districts grow cattle, others wheat, others vegetables, others again fruit, 
        each kind having its special district where it is raised on an enormous 
        scale and sent by rail for hundreds or even thousands of miles to where 
        it is to be consumed. This is thought to be economy, but it is really 
        waste from every point of view except that of the capitalist farmer. He 
        chooses a place where land can be had cheaply (though probably not more 
        suitable for the <font color="#990000">[[p. 532]]</font> special purpose than plenty of land within 
        a few miles of every city), where communication is easy, and labor abundant, 
        and therefore cheap; and by growing on a large scale, and employing the 
        greatest amount of machinery and the least amount of labor, he obtains 
        large profits. But this profit is derived, not from superior cultivation, 
        but from the practical monopoly of a large area of land, and by the labor 
        of hundreds of men and women who work hard and live poorly to make him 
        rich. The same land, if cultivated <em>for themselves</em> by an equal 
        or a larger number of workers, would produce far more per acre, and would 
        keep them all in comfort, instead of making <em>one</em> man exceptionally 
        well off while all the rest live in uncertainty and poverty. And besides 
        this material difference, there is the moral effect of work on a man's 
        own homestead, where every hour's extra labor increases the value of his 
        property or the comfort of his home, as compared with wage work for a 
        master who will discharge him as soon as he ceases to want him, and in 
        whose work, therefore, he can take no interest. Experience in every part 
        of the world shows that this moral effect is one of the greatest advantages 
        of securing to the mass of the people homesteads of their very own. As 
        this aspect of the question is hardly ever discussed in America, a few 
        illustrative examples must be given.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first as to the profits of small farms as 
        compared with large ones. Lord Carrington has eight hundred tenants of 
        small plots of land around the town of High Wycombe, Bucks., and he has 
        recently stated that these tenants get a net produce of forty pounds an 
        acre, while the most that the farmers can obtain from the same land by 
        plough cultivation is seven pounds an acre. Here is a gain to the country 
        of thirty-three pounds an acre by peasant cultivation; and it is all clear 
        gain, for these men are wage laborers, and their little plots of land 
        are cultivated by themselves and their families in time that would otherwise 
        be wasted.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case is that of the Rev. Mr. Tuckwell 
        of Stockton, Warwickshire, who has let two hundred acres of land to laborers 
        in plots of from one to four acres, at fair rents, and with security for 
        fourteen years. Most of the men with two acres grow enough wheat and potatoes 
        to supply their families for the whole year, besides providing food for 
        a pig, and all this by utilizing the spare time of the family. These men 
        grow forty bushels of wheat to the acre, the farmer's <font color="#990000">[[p. 533]]</font> average 
        being less than thirty; and their other crops are good in proportion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still more interesting is the Wellingborough 
        Allotment Association in Northamptonshire, where two hundred and twenty-three 
        men rent and occupy a farm of one hundred and eighty-four acres at three 
        hundred pounds a year rent, though the land is rather poor. It is divided 
        into plots from one eighth of an acre to six acres, the occupiers being 
        various wage workers, small tradesmen, mechanics, and comparatively few 
        farm laborers. The farm was visited by Mr. Impey, who states that it was 
        excellently cultivated, and that the wheat averaged forty-eight bushels 
        an acre,--nearly twice the average of Great Britain,--while one man got 
        fifty-six bushels an acre from two and one-fourth acres. When this farm 
        was let to a farmer, four men on the average were employed on it; now 
        an amount of work equal to that of forty men is expended on it, and a 
        considerable portion of the work is done during time that would otherwise 
        be wasted.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reports issued by the last Royal Commission 
        on Agriculture in 1882 give numerous similar illustrations, showing that 
        in periods of agricultural distress, when large farmers were being ruined, 
        the small farmers who cultivated the land themselves were prosperous. 
        Thus Mr. F. Winn Knight, M. P., of Exmoor, Devonshire, had sixteen tenants 
        paying rents from thirteen pounds up to two hundred pounds a year, all 
        being paid regularly to the last shilling, and every one of these men 
        had been agricultural laborers. More remarkable is the case of Penstrasse 
        Moor in Cornwall, a barren, sandy waste, which neither landlord nor tenant 
        farmer thought worth cultivation. Yet five hundred acres of this waste 
        have been enclosed and reclaimed by miners, mechanics, and other laborers, 
        on the security of leases for three lives at a low rent. This land now 
        carries more stock than any of the surrounding farms, and the total produce 
        is estimated by the assistant commissioner, Mr. Little, at nearly twice 
        the average of the county.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarks are then made both on the material and 
        moral effects of this experiment. &quot;The family have a much more comfortable 
        home, and many advantages, such as milk, butter, eggs, which they would 
        not otherwise enjoy. The man has a motive for saving his money and employing 
        his spare time; he enjoys a position of independence; he is <font color="#990000">[[p 534]]</font> 
        elevated in the social scale; his self-respect is awakened and stimulated, 
        and he acquires a stake and an interest in the country.&quot; And the same 
        reporter again recurs to the subject in the following weighty remarks: 
        &quot;Interesting as this subject is in its relation to agriculture, as showing 
        the capacity for improvement which some barren spots possess, and as a 
        triumph of patience and industry, it is most valuable as an instance where 
        the opportunity of investing surplus wages and spare hours in the acquirement 
        of a home for the family, an independent position for the laborer, a provision 
        for wife and children in the future, has been a great encouragement to 
        thrift and providence. It is not only that the estate represents so much 
        land reclaimed from the waste and put to a good use, it represents also 
        so much time well spent, which would, without this incentive, have most 
        probably been wasted, and wages, which would otherwise probably have been 
        squandered, employed in securing a homestead and some support for the 
        widow and family when the workman dies.&quot; The men who reclaimed this waste, 
        it must be remembered, are all miners, hence the references to their &quot;wages&quot;; 
        and all these good results are secured on an uncertain tenure dependent 
        on the duration of the longest of three lives, after which it all reverts 
        to the landlord, who has not spent a penny on it, but has, on the contrary, 
        received rent the whole time for giving the tenants permission to reclaim 
        it! Under an equitable system of permanent tenure, the interest of the 
        laborer in improving the land would be greater, his position more secure, 
        and the benefit to the nation in the creation of happy homes more certain 
        to be brought about.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another illustration of the moral effects of 
        even a moderately good land system is given by the Honorable George C. 
        Brodrick, in his interesting work &quot;English Land and English Landlords.&quot; 
        It occurred on the Annandale Estate in Dumfriesshire, where farm laborers 
        were given leases for twenty-five years, at ordinary farm rents, of from 
        two to six acres of land each, on which they built their own cottages 
        with stone and timber supplied by the landlord. &quot;All the work on these 
        little farms was done at by-hours, and by members of the family, the cottager 
        buying roots of the farmer, and producing milk, butter, and pork, besides 
        rearing calves. Among such peasant farmers pauperism soon ceased to exist, 
        and many of them became comparatively <font color="#990000">[[p. 535]]</font> well off. It was particularly 
        observed that habits of marketing and the constant demands on thrift and 
        forethought, brought out new virtues and powers in the wives. In fact, 
        the moral effects of the system, in fostering industry, sobriety, and 
        contentment, were described as no less satisfactory than its economical 
        success.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These moral effects of the secure tenure of land 
        in small farms or cottage homesteads have been observed by politicians, 
        travellers, and moralists wherever the system prevails. Thus William Howitt, 
        in his &quot;Rural and Domestic Life of Germany,&quot; says: &quot;The German peasants 
        work hard, but they have no actual want. Every man has his house, his 
        orchard, his roadside-trees, commonly so heavy with fruit that he is obliged 
        to prop and secure them or they would be torn to pieces. He has his corn 
        plot, his plots for mangold-wurzel, for hemp, and so forth. He is his 
        own master, and he and every member of his family have the strongest motives 
        to labour. You see the effects of this in that unremitting diligence which 
        is beyond that of the whole world besides, and his economy, which is still 
        greater. . . . The German bauer looks on the country as made for him and 
        his fellow-men. He feels himself a man; he has a stake in the country 
        as good as that of the bulk of his neighbours; no man can threaten him 
        with ejection or the workhouse so long as he is active and economical. 
        He walks, therefore, with a bold step; he looks you in the face with the 
        air of a free man, but a respectful air.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That admirable historian and novelist, Mr. Baring 
        Gould, confirms this. Writing at a much later period, he says in his &quot;Germany 
        Past and Present&quot;: &quot;The artisan is restless and dissatisfied. He is mechanized. 
        He finds no interest in his work, and his soul frets at the routine. He 
        is miserable, and he knows not why. But the man who toils on his own plot 
        of ground is morally and physically healthy. He is a freeman; the sense 
        he has of independence gives him his upright carriage, his fearless brow, 
        and his joyous laugh.&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see, then, that the statements continually 
        made by economical writers as to the advantages of large farms are either 
        partially or wholly untrue. Large farms, as compared with smaller farms--one 
        thousand acres with two hundred <font color="#990000">[[p. 536]]</font> acres, for instance--may be 
        more profitable, but partly because the larger farmer usually has more 
        capital, and employs more machinery. His individual profits may also be 
        much larger, even if he gets a smaller profit per acre, on account of 
        his larger acreage; and for this reason landlords like large farmers because 
        they can afford to pay a higher rent. But this has nothing whatever to 
        do with the question of peasant or cottage farmers who do their own work, 
        and capitalist farmers employing wage labor. In every case known, and 
        in all parts of the world, the former raise a much larger produce from 
        the land, and it is this question of the amount of <em>produce</em> that 
        is the important question for the community.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often the case, perhaps even generally 
        the case with capitalist farmers, that a larger profit is obtained from 
        a small than from a large production. This is the reason that, during 
        the last twenty years, about two million acres of English arable land 
        have been converted into pasture. Now the average produce of arable land 
        in Great Britain has been estimated by the best authorities as worth about 
        ten pounds, while the average produce of pasture land does not exceed 
        one pound ten shillings. Here is an enormous difference, yet the profit 
        to the farmer is often larger per acre from the small than from the large 
        produce. This is because the cost of raising the larger produce is much 
        greater, labor of men and horses being the most important item of this 
        great cost. When prices of wheat and other arable crops are low, it therefore 
        pays both landlord and farmer to discharge their laborers, sow grass, 
        and keep cattle or sheep, which require the minimum amount of labor per 
        hundred acres. We have already seen in the case of the Wellingborough 
        Allotment Association, that men working for themselves can profitably 
        put ten times as much labor on the land as a tenant farmer usually employs; 
        and this last number is again reduced to one fifth when the land is turned 
        into grass. It follows that the two millions of acres recently thrown 
        out of cultivation in Great Britain would support in comfort, at the lowest 
        computation, more than a hundred thousand families in excess of those 
        who are now employed there.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of this method 
        of confounding <em>profit</em> with <em>produce</em> was seen when, in 
        reply to the demand of the Highland crofters to be allowed to occupy and 
        cultivate the valleys formerly cultivated by their ancestors, but <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        537]]</font> from which these were expelled to make room for deer, the Duke of 
        Argyle replied that there was no unoccupied land available, since all 
        the land in Scotland was applied to its best &quot;economic use.&quot; By which 
        he meant that the rental received by the landlords for their deer and 
        grouse shootings was greater than they could obtain from the Highland 
        cultivators. The difference in produce of food might be a hundred to one 
        in favor of the Highlanders; but that, in the duke's opinion, had nothing 
        to do with the matter. Political economists, as a rule, never allude to 
        this most important point, of the essential difference between <em>production</em> 
        and <em>profit</em>. Mill just mentions it while showing that peasant 
        farms are the most productive; but he does not reason the thing out, and 
        few other writers mention it at all. Hence political writers, in the face 
        of the clearest and most abundant evidence, again and again deny that 
        laborers can possibly grow wheat and other crops at a profit because capitalist 
        farmers cannot do so. But the peasant gives that daily, minute, and loving 
        attention to his small plot which the capitalist farmer cannot possibly 
        give to his hundreds of acres; he works early and late at critical periods 
        of the growth of each crop; and as a result he often obtains double the 
        produce at less than half the cost.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another objection to peasant cultivators, 
        repeated again and again with the greatest confidence, but which is shown 
        to be equally unfounded by the inexorable logic of facts. Peasants and 
        small farmers, it is said, cannot afford to have the best machinery, neither 
        can they make those great improvements which require large expenditure 
        of capital; therefore they should not be encouraged. Yet fifty years ago 
        Mr. Laing, in his &quot;Journal of a Residence in Norway,&quot; showed how far advanced 
        were the peasant farmers of Scandinavia in co-operative works. The droughts 
        of summer are very severe; and to prevent their evil consequences, the 
        peasants have combined to carry out extensive irrigation works. The water 
        is brought in wooden troughs from high up the valleys and then distributed 
        to the several plots. In one case the main troughs extended along a valley 
        for forty miles. Another writer, Mr. Kay, in his work on the &quot;Social Condition 
        of the People in Europe,&quot; shows that the countries where the most extensive 
        irrigation works are carried on are always those where small proprietors 
        prevail, such as <font color="#990000">[[p. 538]]</font> Vaucluse and the Bouches-du-Rhone in France, 
        Sienna Lucca and other portions of Italy, and also in parts of Germany.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in the French Jura and in Switzerland, 
        the peasants of each parish combine together for co-operative cheese-making, 
        each receiving his share of the product when sold, in proportion to the 
        quantity of milk he has contributed. This system is also at work in Australia, 
        where, in the districts suited to dairying, co-operative butter and cheese 
        factories are established, where the best machinery and the newest methods 
        are used, the result being that some of the butter is so good that, after 
        supplying the great cities, the surplus is exported to England. Of course 
        it would be easy to apply the same principle to mowing machines, harvesters, 
        or even flour mills, all of which might be obtained and worked by the 
        co-operation of peasant farmers, each paying in proportion to the days 
        or hours he made use of the machine. Neither is there anything in the 
        superior education and intelligence often claimed for the large farmer. 
        Mr. Kay tells us that in Saxony &quot;the peasants endeavor to outstrip one 
        another in the quantity and quality of the produce, in the preparation 
        of the ground, and in the general cultivation of their respective portions. 
        All the little proprietors are eager to find out how to farm so as to 
        produce the greatest results; they diligently seek after improvements; 
        they send their children to agricultural schools, in order to fit them 
        to assist their fathers; and each proprietor soon adopts a new improvement 
        introduced by any of his neighbors.&quot; Finally, under this system of small 
        peasant cultivators, who reap all the fruits of their own labors, the 
        land is improved in an almost incredible manner. The bare sands of Belgium 
        and Flanders have been gradually converted into gardens, and Mr. Kay sums 
        up his observations by saying: &quot;The peasant farming of Prussia, Holland, 
        Saxony, and Switzerland is the most perfect and economical farming I have 
        ever witnessed in any country;&quot; thus illustrating the famous axiom of 
        Arthur Young a century ago, &quot;Give a man secure possession of a bleak rock, 
        and he will turn it into a garden.&quot; It will hardly be said that the workers 
        of America and of England to-day are <em>less</em> industrious, <em>less</em> 
        intelligent, <em>less</em> influenced by the desire for an independent 
        life and a home which shall be indeed each man's castle, than were the 
        peasants of various parts of Europe half a century <font color="#990000">[[p. 539]]</font> ago. Give 
        them, therefore, equal or even superior opportunities, and you will obtain 
        at least equal, probably far superior, results.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we may expect better results is, 
        that the system of peasant proprietors, from which most of our illustrations 
        have necessarily been drawn, had in it the seeds of decay and failure 
        from the very same causes as those which have led to the failure of the 
        homestead system of the United States: unequal competition, owing to differences 
        in quality and situation of farms, as well as to capitalist farmers, the 
        influence of both having been greatly increased by railroads and other 
        means of rapid communication, and by the growth of great cities offering 
        a practically unlimited market. Added to this there has been the twofold 
        influence of the millionnaire and the speculator, ever seeking to buy 
        land, and of the money lender, ever seeking to lend money on land mortgages. 
        These combined influences have led to the almost complete extermination 
        of the statesmen and other small land-owning farmers of England, and have 
        greatly diminished the number and the prosperity of the peasant farmers 
        in France, Germany, and Austria. The lawyers and money lenders have now 
        absorbed many of the peasant properties of France and Belgium, whose former 
        owners are now tenants, subject to the grinding pressure of rack rents; 
        while many others are struggling in the meshes of the mortgages, as are 
        so many of the farmers in the Western States of America.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present inquiry has, I venture to think, 
        led us to some definite and almost unassailable conclusions as to the 
        fundamental causes which have led all civilized nations into the Social 
        Quagmire in which they find themselves to-day; and in doing so it has 
        furnished us with an answer to the vital question, What should be our 
        next step towards better social conditions, such as will not render the 
        term &quot;civilization&quot; the mockery it is now?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, we have demonstrated that 
        a permanently successful agriculture, in which the food producer shall 
        be sure of an adequate reward for his labor, is absolutely impossible 
        without national or state ownership of the soil, so as to insure the farmer 
        undisturbed occupation at a low but equitably graded rent.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equally clear, in the second place, that 
        the condition <font color="#990000">[[p. 540]]</font> of the great body of industrial workers can only 
        be improved permanently by giving them free access to land--the primary 
        source of all food and all wealth--in the form of cottage homesteads around 
        all cities, towns, and villages, by which they may be enabled to provide 
        food for their families and to carry on such home industries as they may 
        find convenient. Thus only will it be possible for them to enter into 
        really &quot;free contracts&quot; with capitalists; thus only can we get rid of 
        the great army of the unemployed, and insure to the worker a much larger 
        proportion of the product of his labor.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these two great radical reforms have been 
        effected in every part of the country, the industrial classes of every 
        kind will have before them a vista of permanent well being and progressive 
        prosperity. Many industries now carried on in factories, for the benefit 
        of the individual capitalist, can be just as well prosecuted in the home 
        of the worker, if &quot;power&quot; to work his machine is supplied to him. And 
        so soon as there is a demand for such power it will be supplied, either 
        by compressed air or water, or by electricity. A hundred looms or knitting 
        frames or spinning mules can be worked quite as well in separate houses 
        as in one large building, with the enormous advantage to the worker that 
        he could work at them during winter or in wet weather or at times when 
        he would be otherwise idle, while carrying on another occupation out of 
        doors in summer or in fine weather. At such machines different members 
        of the family could work alternately, thus giving them all the relaxation 
        derived from diversity of occupation, and the interest due to the fact 
        that the whole product of their labor would be their own. In the case 
        of those processes that require to be carried on in special buildings 
        and on a larger scale, the workers could combine to erect such a building 
        in their midst, and carry on the work themselves, just as they carry on 
        co-operative cheese and butter making in so many parts of the world already. 
        And gradually, as men came to enjoy the health and the profit derived 
        from varied work, and especially the pleasure which every cultivator of 
        the soil feels in the products he sees grow daily as the result of his 
        own labor, there seems no reason to doubt that co-operation of the kind 
        suggested would spread, till the greater part or the whole of the manufactures 
        of the country were in the hands of associated workers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 541]]</font> At the present time all the boasted 
        division of labor and economy of manufacture on a great scale, tends wholly 
        to the benefit of the capitalist. It is advantageous for him to have a 
        thousand men working in one huge building, or agglomeration of buildings, 
        and all the workers are made to come there, though their homes may be 
        a long way off. The gain is his, the loss theirs. It is better for him 
        that each man should do one kind of work only all day long, and from year's 
        end to year's end, because he thus does it quicker and with less supervision. 
        But the man suffers in the monotony of his work and in the injury to his 
        health; while doing one thing only, he is helpless when out of work. But 
        in the future the arrangements will all be made in the interest of the 
        worker. When possible, he will do his work at home, neither tied to special 
        hours nor compelled to walk long distances, and thus lose precious time, 
        besides adding so much unpaid labor to his daily toil. He will then be 
        able to work some hours a day in his garden or farm, or in some occupation 
        possessing more variety and interest than being a mere intelligent part 
        of a vast machine. And when he works at his own machine he will not need 
        to keep at it more than four or six hours a day. Being thus able to work, 
        even as a manufacturer on his own account, in association with his fellow-townsmen, 
        he will not be induced to work for a capitalist except for very high wages 
        and for very moderate hours of labor. He will then soon compete successfully 
        with the capitalist, and ultimately drive him out of the field altogether. 
        For it must always be remembered that, once the workers get homes of their 
        very own, with the means of obtaining a considerable portion of their 
        food direct from the soil, they can save their own capital, and thereafter 
        employ their own labor; whereas the capitalists, though possessing abundance 
        of money and machinery, cannot make a single piece of calico or an ingot 
        of steel, cannot raise a ton of coal or turn out a single watch, unless 
        they can induce men to work for them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers of America, like those of Great Britain, 
        have their future in their own hands. They have the majority of votes, 
        and can return representatives to do their bidding. Let them turn their 
        whole attention to the one point--of rescuing the land from the hands 
        of monopolists and speculators. In this direction only lies the way out 
        of the terrible <font color="#990000">[[p. 542]]</font> Social Quagmire in which they are now floundering; 
        this is the next step forward towards a happier social condition and a 
        truer civilization.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I should not have ventured to 
        make these suggestions to Americans on matters which, it may be supposed, 
        they are quite able to deal with themselves, were it not that the principles 
        on which my proposals are founded are fundamental in their nature and 
        of universal application. For many years I have advocated similar remedies 
        for my own country, and these are at length being very widely adopted 
        by the chief organizations of our workers. These remedies are equally 
        applicable and equally needed in Australia and New Zealand; while every 
        country in Europe, from Spain to Russia, is at this moment suffering the 
        evils which necessarily result from a vicious land system. You Americans 
        received this system from us, as you received slavery from us. To abolish 
        the latter you incurred a fearful cost and made heroic sacrifices. The 
        system which permits and even encourages land monopoly and land speculation 
        inevitably brings about another form of slavery, more far-reaching, more 
        terrible in its results, than the chattel slavery you have abolished. 
        Let the tenement houses of New York and Chicago, with their thousands 
        of families in hopeless misery, their crowds of half-naked and famishing 
        children, bear witness! These white slaves of our modern civilization 
        everywhere cry out against the system of private ownership and monopoly 
        of land, which is, from its very nature, the robbery of the poor and landless. 
        This system needs no gigantic war to overthrow it; it can be destroyed 
        without really injuring a single human being. Only you must not waste 
        your time and strength in the advocacy of half-measures and petty palliatives, 
        which will leave the system itself to produce ever a fresh crop of evil. 
        The voice of the working and suffering millions must give out no uncertain 
        sound, but must declare unmistakably to those who claim to represent them, 
        &quot;Our land system is the fundamental cause of the persistent misery and 
        poverty of the workers; root and branch it is wholly evil; its fruits 
        are deadly poison; cut it down; why cumbereth the ground?&quot;</p>

<p><font size="-1"><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. See James B. Weaver's &quot;Call to Action,&quot; p. 369. <font color="#990000">[[on p. 397]]</font></font></p>

      <p><font size="-1"><a name="2" id="2"></a>2. Mr. Atkinson, the optimist statistician of Boston, 
        in his paper read before the British Association last August, summarizes 
        the special Census Report on this subject as follows: Dealing with Illinois, 
        Alabama, Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska, he states that &quot;more than 
        one half of the farms are free from any mortgage,&quot; and that &quot;those which 
        are under mortgage are encumbered for less than half their value.&quot; This 
        is the optimist way of stating the case, as if it were something gratifying, 
        something that indicated a successful agriculture and a contented body 
        of farmers! Nearly half the farms in six great agricultural states mortgaged! 
        And these mortgaged to nearly half their value, which, at the high rates 
        of interest usually paid, is equivalent to a heavy, sometimes to a crushing 
        rent!! I could scarcely have imagined a more terrible state of things, 
        short of absolute ruin; and had the facts been stated by any less trustworthy 
        authority, I should have thought there was certainly error or exaggeration. 
        It must be remembered, also, that during past years many mortgages have 
        been foreclosed, and the mortgagees are now the landlords. We are not 
        told how many of the farmers in these states are tenants. <font color="#990000">[[on p. 402]]</font></font></p>

      <p><font size="-1"><a name="3" id="3"></a>3. In his most admirable and thoughtful work, &quot;Poverty and 
        the State,&quot; Mr. Herbert V. Mills relates how he was led to study the subject 
        by finding in three adjoining houses in Liverpool a baker, a tailor, and 
        shoemaker, all out of work. They all wanted bread and clothes and shoes; 
        all were anxious to work to supply their own and the others' wants. But 
        the social system of which they formed a part did not permit of their 
        so working for each other, the alleged reason being that there was already 
        an overstocked market of all these commodities; therefore they must either 
        remain starved and naked or be supported in idleness by their fellows. 
        It is hardly possible to imagine a more complete failure of civilization 
        than such a fact as this; and the failure is rendered more grotesque and 
        horrible by the additional fact that no politician or legislator has any 
        effectual remedy to suggest, while the majority maintain that no remedy 
        is needed or is possible! <font color="#990000">[[on p. 529]]</font></font></p>

        &quot;Mills' Political Economy,&quot; Book II., Chapter VI., and also in the present 
        writer's &quot;Land Nationalization,&quot; Chapter VI. <font color="#990000">[[on p. 535]]</font></font></p>

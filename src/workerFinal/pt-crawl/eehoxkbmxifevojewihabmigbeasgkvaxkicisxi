/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 86]]</font> In his 
          original explanation of the cause of mimicry, Mr. Bates referred to 
          the occurrence of many cases in which species of different genera of 
          Heliconid&aelig; resemble each other quite as closely as the mimicking 
          Leptalides and Papilios resemble species of Ithomia and other Heliconoid 
          butterflies. In these cases both the imitating and the imitated species 
          are protected by distastefulness, and it was not therefore clear how 
          the one could derive any benefit by resembling the other. Accordingly, 
          Mr. Bates did not consider these to be true cases of mimicry, but to 
          be due, either to identical parallel variations of externally similar 
          form, or &quot;to the similar adaptation of all to the same local, probably 
          inorganic, conditions.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of this close resemblance of species 
          of different genera of protected groups have now become very numerous, 
          and they often extend to three or more distinct genera, some species 
          of which imitate each other in most parts of tropical America, each 
          changing in a corresponding manner as we pass from one district to another.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Address to the Biological Section of 
          the British Association at Glasgow, in 1876 (reprinted in &quot;Tropical 
          Nature&quot;), I connected these cases with a number of others in which peculiarities 
          of colour or of form appear together in several groups not closely allied, 
          but always among those inhabiting the same locality and as frequently 
          among unprotected (that is, eatable) as among protected groups of butterflies; 
          and I concluded, generally, as Mr. Bates had done, that these curious 
          phenomena were due to &quot;unknown local causes.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the matter rested, till, in 1879, Dr. 
          Fritz M&uuml;ller published in <em>Kosmos</em> a paper on &quot;Ituna and 
          Thyridia; a remarkable case of Mimicry in Butterflies&quot;; and in 1881 
          a second paper, entitled &quot;Remarkable cases of acquired resemblance among 
          Butterflies,&quot; in which he gives a solution of the problem as really 
          a case of mimicry. The first of these papers was translated by Mr. R. 
          Meldola, and communicated to the Entomological Society of London in 
          May, 1879, and the same gentleman has kindly furnished me with a translation 
          of the second paper,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> which discusses the 
          whole question in great detail, and<sup></sup> devotes much space to 
          a criticism of my suggested &quot;unknown local causes&quot; as a sufficient explanation 
          of the phenomena. I may at once say that I admit this criticism to be 
          sound; and that Dr. F. M&uuml;ller's theory appears to me to afford 
          a clue (with some slight modifications) to most of the cases of close 
          individual resemblance of not-nearly-related species of butterflies 
          yet observed. I therefore wish to state, as briefly as possible, the 
          exact nature of the explanation now afforded us, and this is the more 
          necessary because Dr. M&uuml;ller's theory did not receive much support 
          when brought before the Entomological Society, nor did it then satisfy 
          Mr. Bates, the discoverer of the true meaning and importance of the 
          phenomena of mimicry as interpreted by the doctrine of Natural Selection.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation depends on the assumption, 
          that some at least, if not all, young insectivorous birds learn by experience 
          that the Heliconoid butterflies are distasteful, and in so doing sacrifice 
          a certain number of individuals <font color="990000">[[p. 87]]</font> 
          of each distinct species. But if two species, both equally distasteful, 
          closely resemble each other, then the number of individuals sacrificed 
          is divided between them in the proportion of the square of their respective 
          numbers; so that if one species (<em>a</em>) is twice as numerous as 
          the other (<em>b</em>), then <em>b</em> will only lose one-fourth as 
          many individuals as it would do if it were quite unlike<em> a</em>; 
          and if it is only one tenth as numerous then it will benefit in the 
          proportion of 100 to 1. It is an undoubted fact that the species of 
          protected butterflies, like those of other groups, differ greatly in 
          abundance of individuals, some being very rare while others are among 
          the commonest of all butterflies. The proportion of 100 to 1, therefore, 
          is far below the amount of benefit an uncommon species might derive 
          by resembling a common one. The benefit to be derived is thus clear, 
          if the protected species are subject to the danger of attacks by young 
          birds before they learn that such species are uneatable. I agree with 
          Dr. M&uuml;ller that they are exposed to this danger; and when we consider 
          the great number and variety of insectivorous birds in South America 
          the danger must be considerable, and quite sufficient to render it important 
          for a numerically weak species to reduce it to a minimum, although to 
          a species abounding in individuals it may be of little importance. It 
          has been suggested that young birds have an hereditary instinct enabling 
          them to distinguish uneatable butterflies antecedent to experience; 
          but this seems in the highest degree improbable. It has no doubt been 
          shown by Mr. Darwin that monkeys in captivity have a dread of snakes, 
          and Mr. Jenner Weir believes that birds have an instinctive knowledge 
          of uneatable caterpillars. But even admitting that in these two cases 
          there is an instinctive hereditary aversion, it does not follow that 
          the same will occur with regard to protected butterflies. Snakes form 
          one well-marked group, and it is not alleged that monkeys distinguish 
          between poisonous and harmless snakes; and caterpillars can also be 
          readily divided into the two classes of edible and inedible by their 
          green or brown (protective) colours on the one hand, and their gaudy 
          or conspicuous colouration or hairy bodies on the other. But the protected 
          butterflies have no such general mark of inedibility. Their colours 
          and forms vary greatly, and cannot as a group be readily differentiated 
          from those of other butterflies; and it is not to be accepted without 
          actual proof that a young bird knows instinctively every Heliconoid 
          or Danacoid butterfly in its district, as well as the protected Papilios 
          and moths, almost infinitely varied as they are in colour and marking, 
          among the equally numerous and equally varied butterflies of other groups. 
          It therefore seems clear to me that we have here a <em>vera causa</em> 
          for the acquisition of true protective mimicry by the less abundant 
          species of inedible butterflies.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is however yet another cause which may 
          have led to mimicry in these cases, and one which does not appear to 
          have been discussed by Dr. M&uuml;ller. The fact that the majority of 
          butterflies are edible and are actually eaten by birds and other insectivorous 
          creatures, while a considerable minority are distasteful and are thus 
          protected, renders it pretty certain, <em>a priori</em>, that there 
          exist many degrees of distastefulness. Certain species appear to be 
          rejected by all insectivorous creatures, while some, though not eaten 
          by birds, may be devoured by lizards, dragon-flies, or spiders. Some, 
          too, may be eaten by some birds and rejected by others, and no ornithologist 
          will think it strange or improbable that a trogon should have somewhat 
          different tastes from a tyrant-shrike or a swallow. Again, in some species 
          the distastefulness may extend to all the stages of egg, larva, pupa, 
          and perfect insect, while in others it may be confined to one or more 
          of these stages; or special dangers may exist for one species which 
          are absent in the case of another. But it is evident, that, if these 
          differences exist, it will be advantageous for the less protected to 
          mimic the more completely protected species, and the fact of the affinity 
          between the different genera, with perhaps some tendency to revert to 
          a common style of colouration or marking, will afford facilities for 
          the development of this class of mimicry even greater than occur in 
          the case of the distinct and often remote families of completely unprotected 
          butterflies. We need not, therefore, be surprised to find whole series 
          of species of distinct genera of Heliconoid butterflies apparently mimicking 
          each other; for such mimicry is antecedently probable on account of 
          the greater need of protection of some of these species than others, 
          arising either from some species being less distasteful to certain enemies, 
          or less numerous, and therefore likely to suffer to a serious extent 
          by the attacks of inexperienced birds. When these two conditions are 
          combined, as they often would be, we have everything necessary for the 
          production of mimicry.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation now given, so far as it refers 
          to the various degrees of protection, may be extended to explain those 
          cases in which various groups of Nymphalid&aelig; or other families 
          appear to mimic each other; such as Catagramma, Callithea, and Agrias 
          in one series, and Apatura with Heterochroa in another. In my &quot;Tropical 
          Nature&quot; (p. 257) I have remarked--&quot;Here, again, neither genus is protected, 
          and the similarity must be due to unknown local causes&quot;; but this is 
          more than we know, and I now think that some of these groups--perhaps 
          Catagramma and Heterochroa--are partially protected, and the advantage 
          of sharing in this partial protection has led species of altogether 
          unprotected and much persecuted groups to gain some protection by mimicking 
          them, whenever their general form, habits, and style of coloration offered 
          a suitable groundwork for variation to act upon.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these views are correct we shall have the 
          satisfaction of knowing that all cases of mimicry are explicable by 
          one general principle; and it seems strange to me now that I should 
          not have seen how readily the principle is applicable to these abnormal 
          cases. The merit of the discovery is however wholly due to Dr. Fritz 
          M&uuml;ller; and it is to be hoped that he will complete his work by 
          obtaining, if possible, evidence of its correctness. The chief thing 
          required is an experimental proof of various degrees of inedibility 
          in butterflies, during the different stages of their life-history; and 
          also some observations as to the comparative abundance of the species 
          of protected butterflies which mimic each other. If to this can be added 
          the proof that such groups as Catagramma, which seem to be the objects 
          of mimicry, are partially protected by inedibility, the chief remaining 
          difficulty in the application of the theory of natural selection to 
          all known cases of protective imitation will have been cleared up.</p>

April 29, 2024:
    Animal visual systems have evolved at multiple levels of the visual perception pathway according to a given species' visual needs in the light environments it inhabits. Among the most impactful adaptations are changes to the visual opsin proteins, which are the protein component of the light-sensitive visual pigments housed in the photoreceptor cells of the retina that detect and respond to light signals. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae049>Schott et al. (2024)</a> examine the diversity and evolution of visual opsins specifically the gene duplication/ loss and sequence evolution across 122 frog species representing 34 families with a diversity of life histories and ecologies. They find most species express four visual opsins with evidence for gene loss in two lineages (Arthroleptidae and Dendrobatidae), which represents a much lower level of gene loss than that inferred in other ancestrally nocturnal vertebrate groups like mammals, snakes, geckos, and crocodilians. This relatively limited gene loss in anurans suggests they have heavily invested in their visual systems despite being predominantly nocturnal. They also find evidence for shifts in selective pressure on each visual opsin associated with differences in ecology (scansorial and aquatic lifestyles) and life history (direct development), highlighting the need for functional studies to better understand how particular substitutions may impact visual pigment function. Finally, Schott et al. measure the spectral sensitivities of visual pigments in a subset of species, greatly expanding the previously known ranges for all frog visual pigments. Surprisingly, much of this variation is not explained by mutations at known "spectral tuning sites" identified in other vertebrates, suggesting that frogs have used unique molecular pathways to achieve this high level of spectral diversity. In sum, their study furthers our understanding of adaptive evolution in frog visual systems and represents an important advance in our growing understanding of vertebrate visual evolution.

April 22, 2024:
    The salamander fungus <i>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</i> (Bsal) is spreading in Europe and has the potential to invade North America. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38979-4>Gray et al. (2023)</a> investigated how susceptible North American salamanders, newts, and sirens are to Bsal. They also infected some native and invasive species of frogs. The researchers found that a large portion (74%) of the species they tested could be infected, and over a third (35%) died from the infection, which included both salamanders and frogs. Newts (Salamandridae) and lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae) were among the most vulnerable salamander families, confirming earlier findings (Martel et al. 2014). The findings suggest that Bsal could cause significant salamander die-offs, particularly in the Appalachian region and along the West Coast of the United States. Larval stages (e.g., <i>Eurycea bislineata</i>) were infected as well. Sadly, the study predicts that over 80 salamander species in the US and 140 in all of North America could be lost due to Bsal. Of great concern, Bsal infected two species that frequently occur in the pet trade in the experiments, suggesting these species could be reservoirs of Bsal or could bring Bsal when imported from countries were Bsal occurs; one of them (<i>Osteopilus septentrionalis</i>) is invasive in Florida and has spread to South Carolina, further increasing the threat of disease spread should Bsal arrive to the US.

April 15, 2024:
    In a recent paper documenting the results of expedition to the tepuis of Brazil – the so-called “Lost World” of Arthur Conan Doyle fame, <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2023.107971>Fouquet et al. (2024)</a> describe two new species of direct-developing brachycephaloid frogs (the large clade of frogs mostly comprised of species once placed in the genus <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> but later shown through phylogenetic analysis to best be spread across five families of frogs). Remarkably, these two new species,<i>Caligophryne doylei</i> and <i>Neblinaphryne mayeri</i>, not only fall outside of all currently recognized genera of brachycephaloid frogs but they also fall outside of each of the five currently recognized brachycephaloid families! Thus, the authors erect two new families of frogs, Caligophrynidae and Neblinaphrynidae, which we now recognize on AmphibiaWeb. This finding is consistent with the controversial theory that the tepuis could be home to relatively ancient lineages left behind as the ancient plateau eroded away leaving habitat on stilts (so to speak). There may not be dinosaurs on the tepuis, but there are previously undiscovered frog families. Not surprisingly, the recent fieldwork in the Pantepui region has resulted in many new species of herps in addition to these deeply divergent new frog lineages including additional frogs, plus new lizards and snakes.

April 8, 2024:
    In populations with highly skewed male sex ratios, females may be overwhelmed with male suitors. In these situations, female choice may be nullified. However, <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.01.023>Chen et al. (2024)</a> recently documented a strategy that maximizes <i>Odorrana tormota</i> female choice. These frogs live in noisy, waterfall environments with a 10:1 male to female sex ratio. Both males and females call to attract partners, but field observations and laboratory mate trials both indicate that females show their willingness to mate by blinking at a particular male. To further test the importance of female blinking, males were given preference tests with two simultaneous videos, one of a blinking female and one without blinking. Those tests showed a clear male preference for blinking females. All together, these results indicate that blinking is an effective form of private communication for this species with intense male competition, and this may be the first time blinking has been shown as a social signal in a non-primate species.

April 1, 2024:
    Many lineages of aposematic organisms exhibit high species diversity and high speciation rates, but what causes these groups to diversify more rapidly remains unknown. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.2292>Medina et al. (2024)</a> investigated whether species with aposematic anti-predator defenses (e.g. bright coloration in toxic frogs) exhibit higher levels of genetic divergence between populations, which may be a first step in the speciation process, compared to non-aposematic species. Analyzing over 3,800 pairwise values of genetic differentiation from more than 750 populations of over 60 frog species, they uncovered that frog species with warning coloration show greater genetic divergence over small distances (at the scale of single-generation gene flow) compared to those without. This suggests that aposematic coloration may somehow contribute to restricted dispersal, potentially leading to increased opportunities for speciation. (Ian Wang)</div>

March 24, 2024:
Various frog species have long been used as cell and developmental biology model systems, which makes understanding their genome of particular importance. The first amphibian genome was sequenced in 2010 (<a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1183670>Hellsten et al 2010</a>) and the second in 2015 (<a target=_blank href=https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1501764112>Sun et al 2015</a>). More recently, <a target=_blank href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43012-9>Bredeson et al. (2024)</a> reported a high-quality genome assembly for <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i>, which serves as a model for comparative genomics of frogs. Based on short DNA sequencing reads and chromosome conformation capture data, the authors also were able to generated chromosome-scale genome maps for several frog species, notably <i>Eleutherodactylus coqui</i>, <i>Engystomops pustulosus</i>, and <i>Hymenochirus boettgeri</i>. Within chromosomes, they found that the arrangement of genes was conserved across related frog species (i.e., synteny). By comparing gene arrangements across different frog species and performing phylogenetic analysis of interchromosomal rearrangements, they inferred the ancestral genome organization and speed of evolution. And by mapping the 3D genome organization using chromosome conformation capture, the authors were able to rationalize how spatial variation in recombination rates varies across genomes. Given the conservation and stability of the <i>X. tropicalis</i> genome organization, this high-quality genome assembly will help researchers understand genomic variation within anurans, which is crucial for deciphering the molecular basis of development, disease, tissue regeneration, among other non-molecular research questions in this vertebrate model system.

March 18, 2024:
    Convergent evolution, the independent development of similar phenotypic traits in different lineages, is a widespread phenomenon in nature. Examples range from image-forming eyes in diverse organisms to the repeated evolution of wings in tetrapods. Convergent evolution among close relatives is less-studied and often thought to be generated from shared (homologous) mechanisms, but this is not necessarily always the case. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syad051>Twomey et al. (2023)</a> studied color convergence in <i>Ranitomeya</i>, a relatively young, color-diverse group of Neotropical poison frogs. By combining phylogenetic analysis with examination of skin pigments and spectral reflectance data, they identified several instances of color convergence based on independent gains and losses of carotenoid and pterin pigments. In one case, red coloration evolved independently via distinct pathways: in one lineage through an increase in the red pterin pigment drosopterin, and in another lineage through red ketocarotenoids. These results demonstrate that convergent evolution can occur through “same” or “different” pathways even when the species involved are only recently diverged. (Evan Twomey)</div>

    Chemical signalling in frogs is only poorly understood but is expected to be far more common than currently known. Thus far, all cases of proven or suggested chemical communication in frogs are based on skin-derived chemical cues; however, internal tissues may likewise be involved in sequestering communication chemicals in frogs. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.1693>Schäfer et al. (2024)</a> analysed the volatile chemical composition and the general anatomy of a fatty strand, embedded in the lower jaw of both sexes of West African Saber-toothed Frogs (Odontobatrachidae) and discovered a previously unknown, internal structure which produces sex-, species- and mating related chemical cues. The chemical properties leave little doubt about the breeding related signalling function of the strand’s secretions. Just how the five <i>Odontobatrachus</i> species, use and excrete these cues remains a mystery. Given the anatomical placement and close association with calling related structures it is likely that the chemical cues complement the acoustic signals that both sexes emit. Though preliminary, the Odontbatrachidae add a new dimension to frog communication, highlighting that a deeper look, beyond the salient most obvious signals can be worthwhile.

    Frogs and toads are often known for their acoustic communication, yet many lineages of frogs and toads (anurans) have lost their tympanic middle ears that are vital to airborne hearing in most four-legged animals. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1159/000534936>Womack and Hoke (2023)</a> used phylogenetic comparative methods to examine whether particular geographic ranges, microhabitats, activity patterns, or aspects of acoustic communication are associated with the many instances of anuran tympanic middle ear loss. They found plenty of overlap between the geographic distributions of eared and earless species and no relationship between a species’ microhabitat (e.g., arboreal, burrowing, etc.) and earlessness. Additionally, they found no noticeable differences in the call frequencies of earless species when compared to eared species. However, they did find a higher prevalence of diurnality in earless species, which could indicate increased importance of visual systems in diurnal species or selection to be acoustically cryptic in daylight. But not all earless species were diurnal, leaving the researchers with no single, clear adaptive explanation that was shared by all earless lineages. The puzzling lack of a universal, adaptive explanation for anuran middle ear loss motivates discussion of alternative hypotheses, including genetic or developmental constraints, and the possibility that anura earlessness is maladaptive.

    Those trying to understand global amphibian declines in the context of the fossil record are probably out of luck. It’s not that the fossils aren’t there; rather, it’s that the fossils couldn’t be there. That’s the conclusion <a target=_blank  href=https://doi.org/10.1017/pab.2023.34 >Krone et al. (2023)</a> draw from a novel analysis of fossilization potential that includes nearly all modern tetrapods. To reach this rather jarring conclusion, the authors measured the area of overlap between the geographic ranges of modern tetrapods and areas of current sediment deposition. If no sediments are being deposited somewhere, no sedimentary rocks from our time period will exist there, which means that the animals living there won't have the opportunity to leave behind fossils. Among major tetrapod groups, amphibians have, by far, the poorest preservation potential, with only 40% of amphibian species having more than 1 km^2 of their geographic range in a sedimentary basin. Amphibians with a large amount of sedimentary basin overlap are even rarer. Additionally, more phylogenetically unique lineages of amphibians tend to be excluded from the fossil record. The authors link all of this to the particular affinity of amphibians for mountainous environments, which are areas of net erosion, rather than sedimentation. If this regime of under-preservation has affected amphibians throughout deep time, fluctuations in their diversity may be in principle impossible to recover. For instance, they show that, were the 40% of currently endangered amphibian species to go extinct, the fossil record would record, at best, a 13.6% drop in amphibian diversity, and more realistically, a drop of less than 5%. While these results suggest that the vast majority of amphibian history has gone unfossilized, their model can help point amphibian paleontologists away from hopeless dead-ends and remind us how precious and ephemeral modern amphibian species are.

    Nine of the 10 modern families of salamanders occur today in North America. But often overlooked are several other families of salamanders that occurred during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic of North America. One of those, the Batrachosauroididae, occurred along the coastal plain of the Western Interior Seaway during the Late Cretaceous and then persisted along the Southern coastal plain into the Miocene. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.58782/flmnh.tzqg4599>Bourque and colleagues (2023)</a>  describe newly discovered fossils of <i>Batrachosauroides</i> from the Late Miocene of Florida. This reveals that this now extinct family persisted in the Florida peninsula until 9 or 10 million years ago, a time of global cooling. Although <i>Batrachosauroides</i> is now extinct, it co-occurred with other salamanders that still live today in Florida (<i>Ambystoma, Siren</i>), which adds new insight into the timing of turnover of the North American salamander fauna.

    The caecilian fossil record is remarkably scarce. Although time-calibrated molecular phylogenies suggest that caecilians have existed for more than 200 million years, there has been named fossil referred to any of the lineages alive today (i.e., part of the crown group). <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlad188>Otávio Santos and colleagues (2024)</a> have described a new extinct caecilian, <i>Ymboirana acrux</i>, from the Oligocene (approximately 25 million years ago) of Brazil and that they refer to the living family Typhlonectidae. This extinct caecilian was likely aquatic and was fossilized in what was then a lake. The remarkable preservation of both its vertebral column and much of its skull promises that this fossil will be an important resource for understanding the evolution of caecilians in South America.

    A whopping 59% of frogs and toads lack data on larval stages. <a target=_blank href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s44185-023-00027-1>Vera Candioti et al. (2024)</a> quantify these gaps in knowledge of amphibian larvae. Of note is Brachycephaloidea (also known as the Terrarana) with larval stages described in only 3% of 1,228 species and a general lack of information regarding fossorial versus lentic/lotic tadpoles. In general, very few endotrophic species are known (226 species), but they are broadly distributed across the amphibian tree of life and are likely much more widespread than currently described. The Tropical Andes and New Guinea were identified as regions with particularly large knowledge gaps; the Andes is also a hot spot of new species descriptions, suggesting that specific efforts to describe larval stages will be increasingly necessary (<a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1643/h2022005>Womack et al. 2022</a>). In contrast, the Brazilian Atlantic forest and Madagascar have relatively high proportions of known larval stages. The authors propose that more focus on larval stage descriptions could reveal novel and highly specialized life stages equally exciting for researchers and local communities in addition to more general knowledge that is critical for successful conservation initiatives.

    Animals that live underground have to deal with long periods with low oxygen and sometimes high carbon dioxide within burrows. Burrowing mammals often handle this challenge by having lower metabolisms than species that stay above ground. Many amphibians spend lots of time in burrows but it was not clear whether they had lower metabolisms like burrowing mammals. <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10682-023-10253-5>Giacometti and Tattersall (2023)</a> compared metabolic rates among 185 amphibian species with different lifestyles including burrowing, but found that burrowing amphibians did not have lower metabolic rates than non-burrowing amphibians. Instead, they found that species living at higher latitudes generally had higher metabolic rates than species at lower latitudes, regardless of lifestyle. It is possible that having relatively low energy requirements, small body sizes, and multiple respiratory surfaces (skin and lungs) helps amphibians avoid negative respiratory effects of life underground.

    When toads invade an environment, they arrive armed with a chemical weapon: bufadienolides (BDs). Toads synthesize these potent cardiotoxins and store them in their lumpy skin as a defense against predators. <a target=_blank  href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10886-023-01460-z>Sawada et al. (2023)</a> demonstrate for the first time that invasive toads can serve as a toxin source for a sequestering predator. The Tiger Keelback, <i>Rhabdophis tigrinus</i>, is a poisonous snake that eats toads and concentrates the consumed BDs in specialized glands that run along its back. R. tigrinus living on Sado island in Japan have been isolated from toad prey for 120,000 to 800,000 years, until the introduction of the Eastern Japanese Common Toad, <i>Bufo formosus</i> (formerly <i>Bufo japonicus formosus</i>) in 1966. The researchers detected bufadienolides in the gland extracts of more than half of the snakes sampled from toad-infested areas of Sado, but found no poison in the snakes sampled from parts of the island not yet invaded by toads. Intriguingly, the BD composition largely matched that of keelbacks which predate native Japanese Common Toad in other regions of Japan, and differed from keelbacks which eat a different toad species, <i>Bufo praetextatus</i> (formerly <i>Bufo japonicus japonicus</i>). This strengthens the case that B<i>. formosus</i> is indeed the source of BDs in Sado island keelbacks. The Tiger Keelback snakes from historically nontoxic populations exhibit different antipredator behaviors than historically poisonous ones, thus the re-toxicification of Sado island keelbacks may have interesting effects on fitness and the microevolution of behavior. While its frequency of occurrence is yet unclear, the phenomenon of invasive species as toxin sources is a novel paradigm for the study of chemical ecology and evolution in a changing world.

    Many frog enthusiasts have noticed that some frogs tap their toes on the ground fairly regularly. However we still do not know why most frogs exhibit this "toe tapping" behavior. To better characterize this toe tapping behavior, <a target=_blank href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10682-023-10277-x>Vergara-Herrera et al. (2023)</a> created a vibration-sensitive arena and examined toe tapping patterns during feeding in both males and females of the Yellow-striped Poison Frog, <i>Dendrobates truncatus</i>. The researchers found no differences between tapping behavior in males and females but they did find that tapping often increased before frogs attacked prey. And interestingly, frogs with longer third toes were more likely to increase their taps before attack. The patterns of toe tapping provided in this study provide an excellent starting point for asking more questions about the evolution and purpose (if any) of frog toe tapping. (Molly Womack)</div>

    Microplastics are becoming ubiquitous in waterways used by amphibians, and consequently tadpoles are ingesting those microplastics. There is growing concern of the effects of this environmental pollutant, however, few studies have quantified their effects.  <a target=_blank href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163779>Ruthsatz et al. (2023)</a> examined the effects of microplastics and climate change in lab experiments on the development of <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, African Clawed Frog. They found that microplastics increased larval metabolic and developmental rate as well as increased their corticosterone levels. The result of these changes led to juveniles that had wider bodies and longer limbs. Some of these changes were counteracted by the temperature treatments, but the authors noted that in other organisms the degree of temperature change can have opposing effects. Although the biological implications for these changes, particularly in amphibian species with more traditional life histories, is still murky, the illustration of this study that microplastics can cause sublethal and permanent changes to amphibian physiology and morphology is worth further investigation.

     <em>Happy New Year’s!</em> The <a href="/about/team.html">AmphibiaWeb Team</a> wishes you all a safe and happy year in 2024. We are grateful for the wonderful year we had in 2023 thanks to the enthusiasm and work of our users, contributors, and volunteers. We successfully launched our new initiative <a href="/data/salta.html">Species Account Live Training for AmphibiaWeb (SALTA)</a> to expand our network of experts. So far we had two SALTA workshops and now have 39 new experts who will mentor students and other contributors to AmphibiaWeb. We also recorded <a href="/amphibian/newspecies.html">131 new species in 2023</a>, <a target=_blank href=https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?where-lifeform=amphibian&where-index_date=2023-01-01&rel-index_date=after&max=100&orderby1=index_date+desc&orderby2=taxon>over 680 new photos</a> and 107 new species accounts. However, the main reason for launching AmphibiaWeb over 20 years ago, the alarming global decline of amphibians, has not abated but has since deepened. The recent <a href="/resources/amphibian_news_archive.html#2023">news highlights</a> have been a sober reminder that our mission to "connect people around the world by synthesizing and sharing information about amphibians to enable research, education, and conservation" is as important as ever. </div>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        350]]</font> Mr. Tylor has devoted himself to a branch of Anthropology 
        of which there are very few students in this country, that namely which 
        treats of the mental development of man as elucidated by his arts and 
        customs, and especially by his myths, his superstitions, and his language. 
        More than a third of this volume is devoted to an elaborate account of 
        the gesture-language used by deaf mutes and savages, and to picture-writing, 
        word-writing, and the influence of names and images, as illustrative of 
        various phases in the development of the human mind. After this we have 
        chapters on the growth and decline of culture, as illustrated by the use 
        of stone implements of various degrees of perfection, by weapons, by modes 
        of procuring fire, and by modifications in various domestic utensils. 
        Then follow accounts of remarkable savage customs, such as the curing 
        of disease by the extraction of foreign substances from the body of the 
        patient, the prohibition of marriage with certain relations or namesakes, 
        tabooing the names, and even avoiding the sight, of certain relations, 
        and the extraordinary custom of the <em>couvade</em>. Myths, their origin 
        and geographical distribution, are then discussed; and these varied subjects 
        are all treated from a twofold point of view, either as giving us an insight 
        into the laws of the development of the human mind and the growth of civilisation, 
        or as furnishing, by their similarity over extensive areas and in widely 
        separated countries, an argument for the common origin of the different 
        races of man.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work is throughout 
        carefully written, and is illustrated by abundance of curious and little-known 
        facts and a critical examination of their bearings. The author is very 
        cautious in drawing any general conclusions, and when he does so carefully 
        indicates all sources of error and uncertainty. The character of such 
        a book cannot be fairly shown by extracts; we shall, therefore, briefly 
        summarise one or two of the more interesting subjects and arguments.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many persons are, 
        no doubt, under the impression that the deaf and dumb talk to each other 
        by means of the finger alphabet; but the use of this pre-supposes a knowledge 
        of the meaning of words and letters, which the deaf and dumb child can 
        hardly be taught till intelligible communication has been established 
        with it. Alphabetical speech is slow and clumsy, whereas the deaf mute 
        speaks to his comrades as rapidly, if not as precisely, as we do by means 
        of vocal speech. He uses a copious and expressive language of signs, indicating 
        words and ideas by means of simple motions and gestures. This language 
        has the advantage of being natural and universal. English, French, and 
        German children to a great extent understand each other, and even a North 
        American Indian would be able to talk with them all, it being a curious 
        fact that many of the signs used by the Indian tribes are identical with 
        those of the deaf and dumb schools of Europe; and Mr. Tylor states that 
        a Sandwich islander and a Chinese both made themselves understood in an 
        American deaf and dumb institution. The &quot;gesture language&quot; is also connected 
        with spoken language in two remarkable ways. Among low savage tribes there 
        are cases in which speech has to be supplemented by gesture to make it 
        intelligible, and it is, perhaps, reasonable to suppose that at an earlier 
        stage of civilisation the proportion of gestures to words would be greater 
        than it is now. There is also an agreement in some fundamental idioms. 
        In the Aryan languages many substantives have verbal roots descriptive 
        of some of their essential attributes. &quot;Thus, the horse is the <em>neigher</em>; 
        stone is what <em>stands</em>, is <em>stable</em>; water is that which 
        <em>waves</em>, <em>undulates</em>; the mouse is the <em>stealer</em>; 
        and age is what <em>goes on</em>; the oar is what <em>makes to go</em>; 
        the serpent is the <em>creeper</em>; and so on.&quot; Now the deaf and dumb 
        who have no means of communication but by signs, express themselves in 
        the same way. To them the bird is what <em>flies</em>, the fish what <em>swims</em>, 
        the plant what <em>sprouts out of the earth</em>, &amp;c., and the motions 
        of <font color="990000">[[p. 351]]</font> flying, swimming, and sprouting 
        up, are used as the signs for bird, fish, and plant.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Tylor is usually 
        very cautious in concluding that any art or custom found among distant 
        peoples has had a common origin, or can be used to measure the comparative 
        antiquity of the migrations of races. Yet, in one case, in which he considers 
        that it can be so used, he arrives at conclusions which hardly seem warranted 
        by the facts. The Madagascans smelt iron, as do also the natives of Africa 
        and of the western islands of the Malay Archipelago, but the bellows used 
        in Madagascar is the peculiar Malay form--an upright bamboo, with piston 
        formed of a bunch of feathers, and entirely different from the inflated 
        skin-bellows of Africa. This curious fact, taken in conjunction with many 
        others, and with the presence of a considerable Malay element in the Malagasi 
        language, as well as some physical resemblance between the Hovas and Malays, 
        conclusively proves that there has been a Malay immigration to Madagascar, 
        and also that it took place subsequent to the introduction of the art 
        of working iron. So far the facts lead us safely; but Mr. Tylor, if we 
        understand him rightly, goes further than this, and holds it to be proved 
        that the art of smelting iron was first introduced from Malaisia rather 
        than from Africa, and also that the Malay migration to Madagascar was 
        a much later event than the Malay migration to Polynesia, where the use 
        of iron was unknown till introduced by Europeans. Now, for all that the 
        facts tell us, iron working may have been known in Madagascar before the 
        Malays came, they merely introducing the bamboo bellows, which would be 
        especially adapted to a country in which bamboos were abundant, but cattle, 
        deer, and all large animals which could furnish suitable skins, <em>entirely 
        absent</em>. They certainly might have introduced iron-working also, but 
        the fact of their introducing a more useful form of bellows does not prove 
        it. So, with regard to Polynesia, there are two sufficient reasons why 
        iron-working should not have been introduced there, even if the Malay 
        immigration had been long subsequent to that which invaded Madagascar. 
        The only Malay iron-smelters are certain tribes of Borneo, Sumatra, and 
        the Malay peninsula, while among the Javanese and Coast Malays who are 
        the chief navigators, as well as among the whole of the Moluccan tribes, 
        the art is entirely unknown. But the Malay element in the Polynesian languages 
        is composed of pure Malay and Javanese words, and there is every reason 
        to believe that wandering traders of these nations introduced the Malay 
        language into Polynesia. Added to this the fact that the volcanic and 
        coralline islands of the Pacific contain no iron ore, and we need not 
        wonder at iron workers not being found among them, or that the tribes 
        who still more recently peopled New Zealand should not know how to make 
        use of the iron ore that occurs there. The evidence of language on the 
        other hand would seem to be in favour of the Madagascar migration being 
        the most ancient, because the Malay and Javanese words are generally more 
        changed in the Malagasi than in the Polynesian languages. In the latter, 
        scores of words are slightly modified but intelligible Malay, as <em>pua</em> 
        for <em>bua</em> (fruit), <em>ika</em> for <em>ikan</em> (fish), while 
        in the former many equally common words have been greatly altered, as 
        <em>ravina</em> for <em>ron</em>, Jav. (leaf), <em>lanitra</em> for <em>langit</em> 
        (sky); and the word <em>lima</em> or <em>rima</em> (five), which extends 
        almost unchanged over the whole of Polynesia, becomes the hardly recognisable 
        <em>dimi</em> in Malagasi. The Hovas are undoubtedly much nearer the true 
        Malays in both physical and mental characteristics, than are the Maories 
        or Tahitians, and this would indicate that a larger and more compact body 
        had reached Madagascar than Polynesia. This is what we might expect, for 
        the chances are so much against a safe canoe voyage across the open Indian 
        Ocean, a distance of nearly 3,000 miles with scarcely an intervening island, 
        that we can hardly suppose it to have occurred more than once; while the 
        numerous islands in every part of the Pacific render it much more probable 
        that canoes accidentally blown out of their course from the Moluccas or 
        New Guinea, might repeatedly reach some islands tenanted by the Polynesian 
        race. But a compact body which ultimately conquered much of the country 
        and established a dominant race, would have a greater tendency to preserve 
        their language unchanged; and the fact that so much change has taken place 
        is an additional argument for the comparative antiquity of the Madagascar 
        immigration. The ignorance of making pottery in Polynesia, an art which 
        has certainly been known to the Malays and Javanese from a very early 
        period, seems at first sight opposed to the theory of a late communication; 
        but this fact may, I think, be easily understood when we consider that 
        the immigrants were most probably traders, and of the male sex, and therefore 
        ignorant of an art which in their native country is almost entirely practised 
        by women. While treating of this subject, Mr. Tylor falls into some confusion 
        by speaking of the &quot;Malayo-Polynesian culture,&quot; and &quot;the pure Malayo-Polynesian 
        race,&quot; things which can have no existence, if, as I believe, Malays and 
        Polynesians are almost as distinct as Malays and Africans.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geographical 
        distribution of customs, beliefs, and myths, furnishes our author with 
        materials for some of his most curious and interesting chapters; but, 
        still less than the arts of savage life, do they appear to afford any 
        safe ground for conclusions as to the affinities or early migrations of 
        the races of mankind. We cannot conclude without expressing our admiration 
        of Mr. Tylor's industry and research in so little trodden and comparatively 
        unproductive a field. He has carefully brought together a vast number 
        of interesting phenomena illustrative of the mental condition of savage 
        man, but we cannot help feeling that a satisfactory explanation of them 
        has not yet been arrived at, and that we require researches of a very 
        different nature before we can form any adequate conception of the various 
        causes that have influenced the early mental development of the human 
        race.</p>

<p>
Welcome to the home page of Cambridge Amateur Radio Astronomers. We
are a group of people, mainly from a radio and computing background,
with an interest in radio astronomy. Initially our focus is on
restoring part of the One Mile Telescope at the University of
Cambridge's Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory to full working order.
<p>
An important goal of the project is to allow public access to the
telescope, for example, for schools or interested amateur astronomers,
either remotely or through site visits.
<p>
There may also be possibilities for real research using the telescope,
although we recognise that there may be limited opportunities here,
the sky being fairly well understood at the frequencies accessible
with the telescope.
<p>
We intend to make full use of modern technology, in particular the
ability to control and get data from the telescope using the Internet.

<h2>Present and Future Plans</h2>
<p>
The current specific objectives of the project include:
<ul>
<li>
Updating or replacing the receiver equipment. This has largely fallen
into disrepair or lags behind modern standards.
<li>
Updating the control mechanism of the telescope to allow observations
to be set up, and data to be retrieved, remotely over the Web.
<li>
Generally to replace obsolete or worn-out parts of the telescope.
</ul>
<p>
In the first phase of the project we are renovating or replacing the
dish feed components of the central aerial, leaving the rest of the
control system as it is. Once this has been done the second phase will
consist of developing a system to allow the remote control of the
telescope.
<p>
For more technical details of the work currently underway see
<a href="focusbox/focusbox.html">Renovation of the One Mile Telescope Focus Box</A>.
<p>
In addition, we intend to perform a number of specific investigations
with the telescope, for example:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Examining the hydrogen-line spectrum.
<li>
Monitoring bright radio sources.
<li>
Observing bright pulsars.
<li>
Moon bounce at 430 and 1296 MHz in conjunction with an off-site
2.9 metre dish belonging to a member of the group.
<li>
Observations of the Sun and the Moon.
<li>
Lunar occultations.
<li>
Variable source studies.
<li>
SETI.
</ul>
<p>
Initially we intend to concentrate on moon bounce and pulsar
observation.

<h2>The One Mile Telescope</h2>
<IMG SRC="images/view.jpg" ALT="View of the One Mile Telescope">
<p>
The One Mile Telescope was built between 1962 and 1964, and was first
used for astronomical observations in November 1963. It consists of
three separate 18 metre dish aerials, one mounted on rails, to allow
the use of aperture synthesis techniques, in fact it was the first
such telescope in the world. It was built to allow observations at 408
and 1410 MHz but has been used for frequencies up to 5 GHz, at which
point small inaccuracies in the dish surface become significant.

<p>
Currently only the central, stationary, aerial is known to be
functional, and only at 408 MHz. It was last used in early 1999, to
observe the well-known pulsar in the Crab Nebula. The telescope was
built to a high mechanical specification and is generally in good
shape. However, the electrical systems are old and need
replacing. Spare parts are also a problem in many key areas.
<p>
We will initially concentrate on this central aerial, though
a longer term goal is to attempt the full restoration of all three
dishes.

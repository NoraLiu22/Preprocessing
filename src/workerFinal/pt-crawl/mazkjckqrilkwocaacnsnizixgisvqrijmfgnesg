In September 1981, petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that during discovery respondent failed to produce any evidence to support her allegation that the decedent had been exposed to petitioner's products. In response, respondent produced documents tending to show such exposure, but petitioner argued that the documents were inadmissible hearsay and thus could not be considered in opposition to the summary judgment motion. In July 1982, the court granted the motion because there was no showing of exposure to petitioner's products, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that summary judgment in petitioner's favor was precluded because of petitioner's failure to support its motion with evidence tending to <i>negate</i> such exposure, as required by <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e)</a> and the decision in <i>Adickes</i> v. <i>S.

In such a situation, there can be "no genuine issue as to any material fact," since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is "entitled to a judgment as a matter of law" because the nonmoving party <span page-number="318" pagination-id="477 U.S. 317" id="p318"></span> has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has the burden of proof.

Catrett, resulted from his exposure to products containing asbestos manufactured or distributed by 15 named corporations. Respondent's complaint sounded in negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability. Two of the defendants filed motions challenging the District Court's <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction, and the remaining 13, including petitioner, filed motions for summary judgment. Petitioner's motion, which was first filed in September 1981, argued that summary judgment was proper because respondent had "failed to produce evidence that any [Celotex] product . . . was the proximate cause of the injuries alleged within the jurisdictional <span page-number="320" pagination-id="477 U.S. 317" id="p320"></span> limits of [the District] Court." In particular, petitioner noted that respondent had failed to identify, in answering interrogatories specifically requesting such information, any witnesses who could testify about the decedent's exposure to petitioner's asbestos products. In response to petitioner's summary judgment motion, respondent then produced three documents which she claimed "demonstrate that there is a genuine material factual dispute" as to whether the decedent had ever been exposed to petitioner's asbestos products. The three documents included a transcript of a deposition of the decedent, a letter from an official of one of the decedent's former employers whom petitioner planned to call as a trial witness, and a letter from an insurance company to respondent's attorney, all tending to establish that the decedent had been exposed to petitioner's asbestos products in Chicago during 1970-1971. Petitioner, in turn, argued that the three documents were inadmissible hearsay and thus could not be considered in opposition to the summary judgment motion. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="26" id="pa26"> In July 1982, almost two years after the commencement of the lawsuit, the District Court granted all of the motions filed by the various defendants. The court explained that it was granting petitioner's summary judgment motion because "there [was] no showing that the plaintiff was exposed to the defendant Celotex's product in the District of Columbia or elsewhere within the statutory period."

According to respondent's argument, since petitioner did not "support" its motion with affidavits, summary judgment was improper in this case. But as we have already explained, a motion for summary judgment may be made pursuant to <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a> "with or without supporting affidavits."

Such a motion, whether or not accompanied by affidavits, will be "made and supported as provided in this rule," and <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(e)</a> therefore requires the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the "depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file," designate "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="34" id="pa34"> We do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment.

H. Kress Co.</i>, <a href="/case/adickes-v-kress-company" class="raw-ref">398 U.S. 144</a> (1970). There we held that summary judgment had been improperly entered in favor of the defendant restaurant in an action brought under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-42-the-public-health-and-welfare/chapter-21-civil-rights/subchapter-i-generally/section-1983-civil-action-for-deprivation-of-rights" class="raw-ref">42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983</a>. In the course of its opinion, the <i>Adickes</i> Court said that "both the commentary on and the background of the 1963 amendment conclusively show that it was not intended to modify the burden of the moving party . . . to show initially the absence of a genuine issue concerning any material fact." <i>Id.</i>, at 159. We think that this statement is accurate in a literal sense, since we fully agree with the <i>Adickes</i> Court that the 1963 amendment to <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(e)</a> was not designed to modify the burden of making the showing generally required by <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(c)</a>. It also appears to us that, on the basis of the showing before the Court in <i>Adickes</i>, the motion for summary judgment in that case should have been denied. But we do not think the <i>Adickes</i> language quoted above should be construed to mean that the burden is on the party moving for summary judgment to produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, even with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Instead, as we have explained, the burden on the moving party may be discharged by "showing" &mdash; that is, pointing out to the district court &mdash; that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="36" id="pa36"> The last two sentences of <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(e)</a> were added, as this Court indicated in <i>Adickes</i>, to disapprove a line of cases allowing a party opposing summary judgment to resist a properly made motion by reference only to its pleadings. While the <i>Adickes</i> Court was undoubtedly correct in concluding that these two sentences were not intended to <i>reduce</i> the burden of the moving party, it is also obvious that they were not adopted to <i>add to</i> that burden. Yet that is exactly the result which the reasoning of the Court of Appeals would produce; in effect, an amendment to <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(e)</a> designed to <span page-number="326" pagination-id="477 U.S. 317" id="p326"></span> <i>facilitate</i> the granting of motions for summary judgment would be interpreted to make it <i>more difficult</i> to grant such motions. Nothing in the two sentences themselves requires this result, for the reasons we have previously indicated, and we now put to rest any inference that they do so. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="37" id="pa37"> Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that district courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments <i>sua sponte</i>, so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.

The manner in which this showing can be made depends upon which party will bear the burden of persuasion on the challenged claim at trial. If the <i>moving</i> party will bear the burden of persuasion at trial, that party must support its motion with credible evidence &mdash; using any of the materials specified in <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(c)</a> &mdash; that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial. <i>Ibid</i>. Such an affirmative showing shifts the burden of production to the party opposing the motion and requires that party either to produce evidentiary materials that demonstrate the existence of a "genuine issue" for trial or to submit an affidavit requesting additional time for discovery. <i>Ibid.;</i> <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Fed.

First, the moving party may submit affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim. Second, the moving party may demonstrate to the court that the nonmoving party's evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim. See 10A Wright &sect; 2727, pp. 130-131; Louis, Federal Summary Judgment Doctrine: A Critical Analysis, 83 Yale L. J. 745, 750 (1974) (hereinafter Louis). If the nonmoving party cannot muster sufficient evidence to make out its claim, a trial would be useless and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Liberty Lobby, Inc., ante</i>, at 249. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="62" id="pa62"> Where the moving party adopts this second option and seeks summary judgment on the ground that the nonmoving party &mdash; who will bear the burden of persuasion at trial &mdash; has <span page-number="332" pagination-id="477 U.S. 317" id="p332"></span> no evidence, the mechanics of discharging <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a>'s burden of production are somewhat trickier. Plainly, a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence is insufficient. See <i>ante</i>, at 328 (WHITE, J., concurring). Such a "burden" of production is no burden at all and would simply permit summary judgment procedure to be converted into a tool for harassment. See Louis 750-751. Rather, as the Court confirms, a party who moves for summary judgment on the ground that the nonmoving party has no evidence must affirmatively show the absence of evidence in the record. <i>Ante</i>, at 323. This may require the moving party to depose the nonmoving party's witnesses or to establish the inadequacy of documentary evidence. If there is literally no evidence in the record, the moving party may demonstrate this by reviewing for the court the admissions, interrogatories, and other exchanges between the parties that are in the record. Either way, however, the moving party must affirmatively demonstrate that there is no evidence in the record to support a judgment for the nonmoving party. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="63" id="pa63"> If the moving party has not fully discharged this initial burden of production, its motion for summary judgment must be denied, and the court need not consider whether the moving party has met its ultimate burden of persuasion. Accordingly, the nonmoving party may defeat a motion for summary judgment that asserts that the nonmoving party has no evidence by calling the court's attention to supporting evidence already in the record that was overlooked or ignored by the moving party. In that event, the moving party must respond by making an attempt to demonstrate the inadequacy of this evidence, for it is only by attacking all the record evidence allegedly supporting the nonmoving party that a party seeking summary judgment satisfies <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a>'s burden of production.<a note-disclosure="3" href="#a7d80fb3-6ee3-431a-a936-6a817df23fb0-fn3"></a> Thus, if the record disclosed that the moving <span page-number="333" pagination-id="477 U.S. 317" id="p333"></span> party had overlooked a witness who would provide relevant testimony for the nonmoving party at trial, the court could not find that the moving party had discharged its initial burden of production unless the moving party sought to demonstrate the inadequacy of this witness' testimony. Absent such a demonstration, summary judgment would have to be denied on the ground that the moving party had failed to meet its burden of production under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a>.  </p><div note-container="3" id="a7d80fb3-6ee3-431a-a936-6a817df23fb0-fn3"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="64" id="pa64"> Once the moving party has attacked whatever record evidence &mdash; if any &mdash; the nonmoving party purports to rely upon, the burden of production shifts to the nonmoving party, who must either (1) rehabilitate the evidence Page 333 attacked in the moving party's papers, (2) produce additional evidence showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial as provided in <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(e)</a>, or (3) submit an affidavit explaining why further discovery is necessary as provided in <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56(f)</a>. See 10A Wright &sect; 2727, pp. 138-143. Summary judgment should be granted if the nonmoving party fails to respond in one or more of these ways, or if, after the nonmoving party responds, the court determines that the moving party has met its ultimate burden of persuading the court that there is no genuine issue of material fact for trial. See, <i>e. g., First National Bank of Arizona</i> v. <i>Cities Service Co.</i>, <a href="/case/first-nat-bank-v-cities-service#p289" class="raw-ref">391 U.S. 253, 289</a> (1968).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="65" id="pa65"> The result in <i>Adickes</i> v. <i>S. H. Kress Co., supra</i>, is fully consistent with these principles. In that case, petitioner was refused service in respondent's lunchroom and then was arrested for vagrancy by a local policeman as she left. Petitioner brought an action under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-42-the-public-health-and-welfare/chapter-21-civil-rights/subchapter-i-generally/section-1983-civil-action-for-deprivation-of-rights" class="raw-ref">42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983</a> claiming that the refusal of service and subsequent arrest were the product of a conspiracy between respondent and the police; as proof of this conspiracy, petitioner's complaint alleged that the arresting officer was in respondent's store at the time service was refused. Respondent subsequently moved for summary judgment on the ground that there was no actual evidence in the record from which a jury could draw an inference of conspiracy. In response, petitioner pointed to a statement from her own deposition and an unsworn statement by a Kress employee, both already in the record and both ignored by respondent, that the policeman who arrested petitioner was in the store at the time she was refused service. We agreed that "[i]f a policeman were present, . . . it would be open to a jury, in light of the sequence that followed, <span page-number="334" pagination-id="477 U.S. 317" id="p334"></span> to infer from the circumstances that the policeman and Kress employee had a 'meeting of the minds' and thus reached an understanding that petitioner should be refused service." <a href="/case/adickes-v-kress-company#p158" class="raw-ref">398 U.S., at 158</a>. Consequently, we held that it was error to grant summary judgment "on the basis of this record" because respondent had "failed to fulfill its initial burden" of demonstrating that there was no evidence that there was a policeman in the store. <i>Id.</i>, at 157-158. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="66" id="pa66"> The opinion in <i>Adickes</i> has sometimes been read to hold that summary judgment was inappropriate because the respondent had not submitted affirmative evidence to negate the possibility that there was a policeman in the store. See Brief for Respondent 20, n. 30 (citing cases). The Court of Appeals apparently read <i>Adickes</i> this way and therefore required Celotex to submit evidence establishing that plaintiff's decedent had not been exposed to Celotex asbestos. I agree with the Court that this reading of <i>Adickes</i> was erroneous and that Celotex could seek summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff could not prove exposure to Celotex asbestos at trial.

He contends that the judgment of the Court of Appeals reversing the District Court's judgment should be affirmed on the "narrow ground" that it was "palpably erroneous" to grant summary judgment on this basis. <i>Post</i>, at 339 (dissenting). The Court replies that Page 335 what the District Court said was that plaintiff had failed to show exposure in the District of Columbia "or elsewhere." <i>Ante</i>, at 320, n. 2. In my view, it does not really matter which reading is correct in this case. For, contrary to JUSTICE STEVENS' claim, deciding this case on the ground that Celotex failed to meet its burden of production under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a> does not involve an "abstract exercise in Rule construction." <i>Post</i>, at 339 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). To the contrary, the principles governing a movant's burden of proof are straightforward and well established, and deciding the case on this basis does not require a new construction of <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a> at all; it simply entails applying established law to the particular facts of this case.

Indeed, given that the issue of the moving party's burden under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a> was the basis of the Court of Appeals' decision, the question upon which certiorari was granted, and the issue briefed by the parties and argued to the Court, it would seem to be the preferable ground for deciding the case.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="71" id="pa71"> Approximately three months earlier, Celotex had filed an essentially identical motion.

It was only the phrase 'or elsewhere,' appearing with no prior discussion, in the judge's oral ruling at the close of argument that made the grant of summary judgment even conceivably proper").</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="91" id="pa91"> Taken in the context of the motion for summary judgment on the basis of no exposure in the District of Columbia, the <span page-number="339" pagination-id="477 U.S. 317" id="p339"></span> District Court's decision to grant summary judgment was palpably erroneous. The court's bench reference to "or elsewhere" neither validated that decision nor raised the complex question addressed by this Court today. In light of the District Court's plain error, therefore, it is perfectly clear that, even after this Court's abstract exercise in Rule construction, we should nonetheless affirm the reversal of summary judgment on that narrow ground.<a note-disclosure="5" href="#a84d1021-8cf2-4d19-80c5-d6240645965a-fn5"></a>  </p><div note-container="5" id="a84d1021-8cf2-4d19-80c5-d6240645965a-fn5"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="92" id="pa92"> Cf. n. 2, <i>supra</i>. The Court's statement that the case should be remanded because the Court of Appeals has a "superior knowledge of local law," <i>ante</i>, at 327, is bewildering because there is no question of local law to be decided. Cf. <i>Bishop</i> v. <i>Wood</i>, <a href="/case/bishop-v-wood#p345" class="raw-ref">426 U.S. 341, 345-347</a> (1976). The Court's decision to remand when a sufficient ground for affirmance is available does reveal, however, the Court's increasing tendency to adopt a presumption of reversal. See, <i>e. g., New York</i> v. <i>P. J. Video, Inc.</i>, <a href="/case/new-york-v-p-j-video-inc#p884" class="raw-ref">475 U.S. 868, 884</a> (1986) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); <i>Icicle Seafoods, Inc</i>. v. <i>Worthington</i>, <a href="/case/icicle-seafoods-inc-v-worthington#p715" class="raw-ref">475 U.S. 709, 715</a> (1986) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>City of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Heller</i>, <a href="/case/los-angeles-v-heller#p800" class="raw-ref">475 U.S. 796, 800</a> (1986) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Goldhammer</i>, <a href="/case/pennsylvania-v-goldhammer#p31" class="raw-ref">474 U.S. 28, 31</a> (1985) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).

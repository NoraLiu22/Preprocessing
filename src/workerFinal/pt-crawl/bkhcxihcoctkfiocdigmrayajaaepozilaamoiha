<p>A Cross-Language System Evaluation activity is now being launched in Europe. The activity is sponsored by the DELOS Network of Excellence for Digital Libraries, funded by the EC Information Society Technologies programme. It is conducted in collaboration with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the TREC Conferences.
</p>

<p>The Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) will run three main evaluation tracks in 2000, testing multilingual, bilingual and monolingual (non-English) information retrieval systems. Interested groups can participate in any or all tracks. Newcomers to the activity may choose to begin with the monolingual track in the first year and work up to the others in later years. There will also be a special sub-task for domain-specific cross-language evaluation.</p>

<H4>Multilingual Information Retrieval</H4>

<p>The main task in CLEF 2000 requires searching a multilingual collection in English, French, German, and Italian for relevant documents. The goal is to retrieve documents from all languages,  listing the results in a merged, ranked list.</p>

<p>Although the official languages for  CLEF 2000 will be English, French, German and Italian, it will also be possible to submit runs in which the document collection is queried in other languages. In this case, participants will be responsible for the translation of the query into their selected language.</p>

<H4>Bilingual Information Retrieval</H4>

<p>A task will be provided in which the query language can be French, German or Italian and the target document collection is English. Unofficial bilingual runs in which the query to the English document collection can be in other languages can also be submitted and will be evaluated.</p>

<H4>Monolingual (non-English) Information Retrieval</H4>

<p>Different languages present different problems; IR techniques that are highly efficient for certain language typologies may not be so effective for others. So far, most IR system evaluation has focussed on English. We will provide the opportunity for monolingual system testing and tuning and will build up test suites in other European languages (beginning with French, German and Italian in CLEF 2000).</p>

<H4>Special Task GIRT</H4>

<p>The rationale of this subtask is to study CLIR in a vertical domain (i.e., social science) where a German/English/Russian thesaurus and English translations of the document titles are available. </p>

<H4>Workshop</H4>

<p>A two-day Workshop will be held 21-22 September in Lisbon, Portugal, immediately after the fourth European Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL 2000: see &lt;<a href="http://www.bn.pt/org/agenda/ecdl2000">http://www.bn.pt/org/agenda/ecdl2000</a>&gt;).
The first day will be open to all interested participants and focussed on research related issues in Multilingual Information Access.
The second day will present and discuss the results of the CLEF activity and will be restricted to active CLEF participants.</p>

<P>Ex Libris has acquired the sole rights to the SFX Reference Linking Software Solution from the University of Gent (Belgium) and will begin its immediate deployment. SFX will play a vital role in Ex Libris' new Internet Strategy.</P>

<P>The wide use of hyperlinks on the World Wide Web has conditioned Internet users to expect similar linking convenience within other computer environments, including digital library collections. However, when you want to ascertain the availability of items, it is still a case of "hit-and-miss".</P>

<P>As the Web evolves, the creation of services that link related information entities is an area of strongly growing interest, particularly for the research community and for managers of research-related information systems. Publishers, subscription agents, researchers and libraries are looking for ways to create value-added services through linking these entities.</P>

<P>"SFX is a groundbreaking tool for discovery and navigation that will deliver such linking services in the scholarly information environment" said Oren Beit-Arie, Vice President of Research and Development. "SFX enables linking between all parts of an electronic collection: full-text repositories; abstracting, indexing and citation databases; online library catalogs; citations appearing in research articles and other web resources..."</P>

<P>SFX is a system that dynamically interlinks numerous electronic resources and can be used in a wide range of digital libraries. SFX is based on the research work about the reference linking problem undertaken by Herbert Van de Sompel at the University of Gent and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. It has been applied in the complex digital library environments of both institutions. The solution has successfully demonstrated its ability to dynamically create services interlinking:</P>
<P><ul>
<li>Abstracting and indexing databases (Inspec, Medline, PubMed, Public Genome database, MathSci, Compendex, LiSa, Current Contents, BIOSIS, Books in Print, EconLit, Ulrich)</li>
<li>Library catalogues</li>
<li>Citation databases (ISI, SLAC/SPIRES)</li>
<li>Citations in research papers (Wiley InterScience, American Physical Society PROLA archive)</li>
<li>E-print archives (Los Alamos xxx and the experimental UPS Prototype service)</li> 
<li>Internet Bookshops</li></ul></p>

<p>The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) has introduced a major breakthrough in making scientific information available to researchers in a more timely and comprehensive manner.
</p>

<p>The PrePRINT Network (PPN) &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/preprint/">http://www.osti.gov/preprint/</a>&gt; is a new Web-based tool that provides access to the energy-related papers, draft journal articles, and other electronic materials produced by researchers.  At numerous sites throughout the country, databases and Web sites exist on servers that contain this information for specific projects or disciplines; the PrePRINT Network, in effect, combines those dispersed servers into a comprehensive set of energy research information and makes them all searchable via a single query.</p>

<p>Using this valuable asset, researchers can browse or search one specific preprint site, a selected set of sites, or all of the listed sites.  With a single query, users can search one or a collection of existing preprint servers.  The PPN facilitates access to and searching of preprints by linking to preprint servers wherever they exist on the Web. The PPN pulses the search engines of such servers, compiles the results, and returns them to the users.
</p>

<p>In this manner, the PPN provides links to 250 preprint sites housing over 215,000 documents, and over twenty heterogeneous preprint databases are available for distributed cross-searching via a single query.  Collections and resources included on the PPN are provided by academic institutions, government research laboratories, scientific societies, private research organizations, and individual scientists and researchers.</p>

<p>The PPN is the latest in a series of Web-based services developed by OSTI and made available to the public through EnergyFiles &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/energyfiles/">http://www.osti.gov/energyfiles/</a>&gt;, DOE's virtual library of energy science and technology.  With the addition of PPN, EnergyFiles captures the three main ways by which researchers disseminate their findings: grey literature (the DOE Information Bridge, &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/bridge/">http://www.osti.gov/bridge/</a>&gt;); journal literature (PubSCIENCE, &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/pubscience/">http://www.osti.gov/pubscience/</a>&gt;); and preprints, &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/preprint/">http://www.osti.gov/preprint/</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>The European Commission on Preservation and Access (ECPA) received one of
fifty-five subsidies granted to cultural projects designed to test the
framework programme "Culture 2000" of the European Union for its project
"Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access" (SEPIA).</p> 

<p>The SEPIA project, &lt;<a href="http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa/sepia">http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa/sepia</a>&gt;, deals with historic photographic collections that are
an essential part of the European cultural heritage. The project's aim is</P>
<ol>
<p><li>to promote awareness of the need to preserve photographic collections,</li></p>
<p><li>to provide training for professionals involved in preservation and
digitisation of photographic collections and</li></p> 
<p><li>to develop an overall
framework under which future projects in the area of preservation and
access of photographic materials can be brought together.</li></p></ol> </p>

<p>Activities of the SEPIA project will include expert meetings and
workshops to train those working with photographic collections. A survey report on the status of preservation and digitisation of photographic collections
in Europe will be published. In addition an introductory text on
(preservation of) photographic collections will be prepared, and the ECPA's website will be expanded with a section on photographs. An open conference on the management of photographic collections will close the activities at
the end of the experimental year, in June 2000 in the UK.</p>

<p>The ECPA will coordinate the SEPIA project. Its partners are: Centre de
Recherches sur la Conservation des Documents Graphiques (CRCDG) (Paris,
France); National Photographic Conservation Studios (Rotterdam, The
Netherlands); Public Record Office (Kew, Richmond, United Kingdom);
Stockholm City Museum (Stockholm, Sweden); The British Library (London,
United Kingdom); The Finnish Museum of Photography (Helsinki, Finland)
and The Royal Library of Denmark (Copenhagen, Denmark).</p>

<p>The Culture 2000 programme of the European Commission aims to strengthen
cooperation between Europeans on a cultural level. As of the year 2000 it
took over from the programmes Kaleidoscope (for the "living arts"),
Ariane (for literature) and Raphaël (for cultural heritage). The call for
application of experimental measures in the framework of Culture 2000 was
published in June 1999. For more information on Culture 2000, see:

<p>The UK Higher Education funding bodies have established a new Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN) to promote high quality learning and teaching in all subject disciplines in Higher Education (HE). The network will support the sharing of innovation and good practices in learning and teaching including the use, where appropriate, of communications and information technology (C&IT).</p>

<p>The network will consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li>24 subject centres
<li>The Generic Learning and Teaching Centre
<li>A programme director and co-ordinator.
</ul>

<p>The subject/discipline focus of this programme recognises that for many in HE, it is at this level where most networking and exchange of learning, teaching and assessment practice  and innovation take place. Therefore, the creation of 24 subject centres will provide a means for effective dissemination and promotion of practice and innovation amongst subject-based communities.</p> 

<p>There are also many learning and teaching issues and practices common to all subjects, which will be disseminated and promoted by a Generic Learning and Teaching Centre (GLTC). The GLTC will also reduce duplication and build links between the subject centres and will become a major national source of information and expertise on HE learning and teaching practice.</p>

<p>Following an extensive tendering process the UK funding bodies have now contracted with  lead sites for 23 subject centres -- the final one will be in place by April 2000.</p>

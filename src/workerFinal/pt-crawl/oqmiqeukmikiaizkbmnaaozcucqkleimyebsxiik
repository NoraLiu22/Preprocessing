Many of us are dying in this mortality, that is many of us are being freed
from the world.&nbsp; This mortality is a bane to the Jews and pagans and
enemies of Christ; to the servants of God it is a salutary departure.&nbsp;
<p>As to the fact that without any discrimination in the human race the
just are dying with the unjust, it is not for you to think that the destruction
is a common one for both the evil and the good.&nbsp;
<p>The just are called to refreshment, the unjust are carried off to torture;
protection is more quickly given to the faithful; punishment to the faithless....&nbsp;
<p>How suitable, how necessary it is that this plague and pestilence, which
seems horrible and deadly, searches out the justice of each and every one
and examines the minds of the human race....

In the year of our Lord 1315, apart from the other hardships with which
England was afflicted, hunger grew in the land....&nbsp; Meat and eggs
began to run out, capons and fowl could hardly be found, animals died of
pest, swine could not be fed because of the excessive price of fodder.
<p>A quarter [8 bushels] of wheat or beans or peas sold for twenty shillings
[four times the cost in 1313], barley for a mark, oats for ten shillings.&nbsp;
A quarter of salt was commonly sold for thirty-five shillings, which in
former times was quite unheard of.&nbsp; The land was so oppressed with
want that when the king came to St. Albans ... it was hardly possible to
find bread on sale to supply his immediate household....
<p>...The dearth began in the month of May and lasted until [September].&nbsp;
The summer rains were so heavy that grain could not ripen.&nbsp; It could
hardly be gathered and used to bake bread ... unless it was first put in
vessels to dry....
<p>Bread did not have its usual nourishing power and strength because the
grain was not nourished by the warmth of summer sunshine.&nbsp; Hence those
who ate it, even in large quantities, were hungry again after a little
while.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the poor wasted away when even
the rich were constantly hungry....
<p>Four pennies worth of coarse bread was not enough to feed a common man
for one day.&nbsp; The usual kinds of meat, suitable for eating, were too
scarce; horse meat was precious; plump dogs were stolen. And, according
to many reports, men and women in many places secretly ate their own children....

all their beggars because they could not support them....&nbsp; The agitation

        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">...and 
        ask yourself a couple of very important questions such 
        as: do you really want a snake that will get to be 10 
        feet long, weigh over 50 pounds, urinate and defecate 
        like a St. Bernard, should live more than 30 years and 
        for whom you will have to kill mice, rats and, eventually, 
        small rabbits? Many people think that it will be easy 
        to find someone who will take it if they decide they don't 
        want their Boa when it is 8 or 10 feet long. So, take 
        a look at the classified ads--they always have sale ads 
        for big pythons and boas. The zoo doesn't want any more--they 
        already have more giant snakes than they need. The local 
        herpetology societies and reptile veterinarians always 
        have big snakes for whom they are trying to find homes. 
        At 8 feet and 40 pounds, a 2-year old Boa may already 
        be eating rabbits a couple of times a month and can be 
        very unwieldy to handle alone. You have to interact with 
        them constantly to keep them tame--do you want a hungry, 
        cranky 10 foot snake mistaking your face for prey? Another 
        consideration is who is going to help you clean its enclosure? 
        take it to the vet when it's sick? take care of it when 
        you go away to school or on vacation? No matter how much 
        they love you, there are some things a mother, and your 
        friends, will not do! Owning a big snake is not cool; 
        it is a major, long-term commitment and responsibility.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> There 
        has been a disturbing increase over the past year or so 
        (1996 to present) of boas being dumped by their owners 
        (many of whom tried to sell the 6+ foot boa only to find 
        that, no matter how much they reduced their price, no 
        one was interested in buying) on animal shelters and reptile 
        rescues. Many of these snakes are in terrible condition, 
        with respiratory infections, riddled with endo- and ectoparasites, 
        many suffering severe injury and infection from untreated 
        rat bites and thermal burns. This is a clear indication 
        that many people who are buying boas shouldn't be.</font></p>

        read about <a href="ibd.html">inclusion body disease</a>, 
        a virus that affects only boas and pythons and that has 
        become increasingly widespread as stores and too many 
        breeders and dealers fail to take proper precautions when 
        integrating new stock. It is always fatal to pythons and 
        generally fatal to boas. If you have a boa or python and 
        are considering buying another one, quarantine it for 
        at least 6 months! By this I mean strict quarantine. Follow 
        proper cleaning routines when doing maintenance with your

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><b>Natural 
        History</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The name 
        &quot;Red-Tail Boa&quot; has commonly been used by pet 
        stores and snake aficionados to distract the public's 
        attention from the fact that their proper name is boa 
        constrictor. Many people who do not know much about snakes 
        are fearful of all &quot;constrictors,&quot; especially 
        large constrictors; Red-Tail Boa sounds much less threatening. 
        In fact, not all boa constrictors are red-tailed. While 
        many boas on the market are true red-tailed <i>Boa constrictor 
        constrictor</i> imported from Brazil, with a few coming 
        from very limited areas in Columbia, the Amazon, Guyana, 
        and Surinam, most are actually <i>B. c. imperator</i> 
        from Columbia, with a few coming in from Mexico, Hogg 
        Island and countries throughout Central America. There 
        are seven other subspecies of <i>B. constrictor</i> from 
        South America which can sometimes be found in the retail 
        and private pet trade. All of the <i>Boa </i>ssp. are 
        listed as threatened on Appendix II of the Convention 
        on the International Trade in Endangered Species (<a href="http://www.cites.org">CITES</a>); 
        the Argentine Boa (<i>B. c. occidentalis</i>) is on Appendix 
        I--the endangered listing. Appendix II animals can be 
        exported and imported with the proper permits, and can 
        legally be sold through the pet trade; Appendix I animals 
        require special permits to buy, sell, trade and own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Ranging 
        from the high cloud forests to the dry low lands, these 
        beautifully marked snakes are only moderately arboreal. 
        Frequently found near human habitation (due to the quantity 
        of rodents found near human habitats), Boas are primarily 
        nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk). In 
        the extreme northern and southern portions of their range, 
        the Boas will often go through several weeks of inactivity 
        to get through the periods of extreme cold or drought, 
        a behavior that may be observed in captivity as the weather 
        changes throughout the year. Those snakes living in the 
        consistently high humid temperatures of the rain forest 
        areas will remain active throughout the year.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Boas 
        devour a variety of prey in the wild - amphibians, lizards, 
        other snakes, birds and mammals. In captivity, they should 
        be fed pre-killed mice, rats and, when adults, rabbits 
        and chickens. You can buy the rodents and rabbits at pet 
        stores; these animals have been specially raised and are 
        clean, healthy and well-nourished. Chickens can be purchased 
        at hatcheries; do not feed raw chicken pieces purchased 
        at the grocery store - up to 80% of it may be infected 
        with Salmonella bacteria. Chickens from hatcheries should 
        also be considered suspect due to the overcrowded conditions 
        typical of most hatcheries; check the hatchery out first 
        before you buy. Under no circumstances should you feed 
        your snakes wild-caught prey items. Wild rodents and other 
        animals carry a variety of parasites and bacteria for 
        which your snake has no immunity. If you cannot afford 
        to buy the proper food, you should not buy the snake.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> That 
        cute little 2 ounce, 14-22&quot; hatchling laying cupped 
        in the palm of your hand will increase its size by up 
        to 300% in its first year, reaching 5-6 feet during that 
        time. The following year will add another 3-4 feet to 
        its length, as well as several pounds. After the second 
        year, the growth rate slows down significantly, but snakes 
        do continue to grow, however slightly, during their entire 
        lives. The live bearing females will give birth to 10-60 
        young (depending upon the subspecies) after a gestational 
        period of 4-10 months (depending upon temperature and 
        several other factors). Unlike most big snakes, many female 
        Boas do not bear young each year.</font></p>

        STARTED</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Selecting 
        Your Boa Constrictor</b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><br>
        </b>Choose an animal that has clear firm skin, rounded 
        body shape, clean vent, clear eyes, and who actively flicks 
        its tongue around when handled. When held, the snake should 
        grip you gently but firmly when moving around. It should 
        be alert to its surroundings. All young snakes are food 
        for other, larger snakes, birds, lizards and mammalian 
        predators so your hatchling may be a bit nervous at first 
        but should settle down quickly. Like the pythons, Boas 
        have anal spurs. These single claws appearing on either 
        side of the vent are the vestigial remains of the hind 
        legs snakes lost during their evolution from lizard to 
        snake millions of years ago. Males have longer spurs than 
        do the females. There is little difference in temperament 
        between the two sexes. Imported Colombian B. c. imperator 
        and B. c. constrictor are the nicest, least aggressive 
        of all the Boas. The other true red-tails tend to be testy 
        and aggressive. Captive-bred Boas of all subspecies tend 
        to be more docile than their wild-caught counterparts.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Housing</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Snake-Proof 
        Enclosure</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Select 
        an enclosure especially designed for housing snakes, such 
        as those with the combination fixed screen/hinged glass 
        top. All snakes are escape artists; Boas are especially 
        powerful and can easily break out of a tank sealed with 
        a board and a couple of bricks. A good starter tank for 
        a hatchling is a 20 gallon tank. After the first couple 
        of years, you will have to build your own enclosure out 
        of wood and glass or Plexiglas or purchase a tank made 
        by producers of large reptile enclosures. Be prepared 
        - big snakes need lots of room, not the least of which 
        is an enclosure big enough for you to get in and clean 
        it out!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Suitable 
        substrate</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Use paper 
        towels at first. These are easily and quickly removed 
        and replaced when soiled and, with an import, will allow 
        you to better monitor for the presence of mites and the 
        condition of the feces. Once the animal is established, 
        you can use more decorative ground cover such as commercially 
        prepared shredded cypress or fir bark. Pine, cedar and 
        aspen shavings should not be used as they can become lodged 
        in the mouth while eating, causing respiratory and other 
        problems. The bark must be monitored closely and all soiled 
        and wet portions pulled out immediately to prevent bacteria 
        and fungus growths. The utilitarian approach is to use 
        inexpensive Astroturf. Extra pieces of Astroturf can be 
        kept in reserve and used when the soiled piece is removed 
        for cleaning and drying (soak in a solution of two tablespoons 
        of household bleach in for each gallon of water; rinse 
        thoroughly, and dry completely before reuse). Remember: 
        the easier it is to clean, the faster you'll do it!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Hiding 
        Place<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A 
        hiding place should be provided for Boas. A half-log (available 
        at pet stores), an empty cardboard box or upside-down 
        opaque plastic container, both with an access doorway 
        cut into one end, can also be used. The plastic is easily 
        cleaned when necessary; the box can be tossed out when 
        soiled and replaced with a new one. Many Boas enjoy hanging 
        out on branches; provide clean branches big enough to 
        support the Boa's weight. If you use a found branch, soak 
        first in the bleach/water solution, then clean water to 
        thoroughly rinse; place in cage only when completely dry. 
        If you use rocks and bricks to construct a cave, be sure 
        to affix them firmly in place. Boas are very strong, and 
        can easily topple such a structure when moving about. 
        When the rocks tumble on the snake, severe injuries may 
        result.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Temperature 
        Gradient<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        proper temperature range is essential in keeping your 
        snake healthy. The ambient daytime air temperature throughout 
        the enclosure must be maintained between 82-90 F (28-32 
        C), with a basking area kept at 90-95 F (32-35 C). At 
        night, the ambient air temperature may be allowed to drop 
        down no lower than 78-85 F (26-30 C). Special reptile 
        heating pads that are manufactured to maintain a temperature 
        about 20<sup>o</sup> higher than the air temperature may 
        be used inside the enclosure. There are adhesive pads 
        that can be stuck to the underside of a glass enclosure. 
        Heating pads made for people, available at all drug stores, 
        are also available; these have built-in high-medium-low 
        switches and can be used under a glass enclosure. You 
        can also use incandescent light bulbs in porcelain and 
        metal reflector hoods to provide the additional heat required 
        for the basking area, or the new ceramic heating elements 
        which can be put into regular light sockets and radiate 
        heat downward. All lights must be screened off to prevent 
        the snake from burning itself. All snakes are susceptible 
        to thermal burns. For this same reason do not use a hot 
        rock. Buy at least two thermometers - one to use in the 
        overall area 1&quot; above the enclosure floor, and the 
        other 1&quot; above the floor in the basking area. Ideally, 
        you should place a third thermometer at near the upper 
        basking bench or branch. Don't try to guess the temperature--you 
        will end up with a snake who will be too cold to eat and 
        digest its food. Once your snake has grown quite large, 
        you may wish to invest in a pig blanket, a large rigid 
        pad for which you can buy a thermostat to better control 
        the temperature.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> No 
        special lighting is needed</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">You 
        may use a full-spectrum light or low wattage incandescent 
        bulb in the enclosure during the day but snake, having 
        evolved to living underground, have not need for regular 
        full-spectrum/UV lighting. If you do use such a light 
        in the tank, make sure the snake cannot get into direct 
        contact with the light bulbs, nor burrow itself into the 
        casing of the fluorescent hood. If you are uncertain about 
        what lights out there do what, please read the article 
        <a href="liteheat.html">&quot;Lighting and Heating&quot;</a>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>Feeding<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Allow 
        your snake to acclimate for a couple of weeks to its new 
        home. Start your hatchling off with a single pre-killed 
        week to 10-day old &quot;fuzzy&quot; rat. A smaller sized 
        hatchling may require a small mouse. Larger Boas may be 
        fed larger pre-killed rats. The rule of thumb is that 
        you can feed prey items that are no wider than the widest 
        part of the snake's body. While Boas will often gladly 
        eat prey that is actually too large for it, they will 
        generally regurgitate the prey item one or more days later. 
        Not a pretty sight. If you have not had any experience 
        force feeding a snake, you may not want to try it yourself 
        until you have seen someone do it. Force feeding should 
        be an action of last resort, as it is very stressful for 
        the snake--and the owner! It is very easy to overfeed 
        captive snakes, especially the boas and pythons, as they 
        do not get enough opportunity to exercise and burn calories 
        in captivity as they do in the wild. Be judicious--your 
        snake will get big and impressive soon enough. Feed it 
        enough to keep it healthy, not obese.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>Provide

        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Keep 
        a bowl of fresh water available at all times. Your snake 
        will both drink and soak, and may defecate, in it. Check 
        it often and change it as needed. A warm bath in your 
        bathtub will also be welcomed just before your Boa is 
        ready to shed.</font></p>

        veterinary screening for newly acquired snakes is essential. 
        Many of the parasites infesting Boas and other reptiles 
        can be transmitted to humans and other reptiles. Left 
        untreated, such infestations can ultimately kill your 
        snake. When your snake first defecates, collect the feces 
        in a clean plastic bag, seal it, label it with the date, 
        your name and phone number and the snake's name, and take 
        it and your snake to a vet who is experienced with reptiles. 
        Ask that it be tested for worms and protozoans, which 
        are two different tests. If either test is positive, your 
        Boa will be given medication given that you can repeat 
        later at home.</font></p>

        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">After 
        giving your Boa a couple of days to settle in, begin picking 
        it up and handling it gently. It may move from you, and 
        may threaten you by doing tail lashings and hissing. Be 
        gentle but persistent. Daily contact will begin to establish 
        a level of trust and confidence between you and your snake. 
        When it is comfortable with you, you can begin taking 
        it around the house. Don't get over-confident! Given a 
        chance and close proximity to seat cushions, your Boa 
        will make a run (well, a slither) for it, easing down 
        between the cushions and from there, to points possibly 
        unknown. Always be gentle, and try to avoid sudden movements. 
        If the snake wraps around your arm or neck, you can unwind 
        it by gently grasping it by the tail and unwrapping it 
        from around you. If you start at the head, you will find 
        that your snake is stronger than you are, or at least, 
        more tenacious.</font></p>

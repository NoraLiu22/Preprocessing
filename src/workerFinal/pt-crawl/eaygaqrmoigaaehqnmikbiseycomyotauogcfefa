        Rat!?<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Corn and Rat 
        snakes both belong to the genus <i>Elaphe</i>; Corns belong to the species 
        <i>Elaphe guttata</i>; many of the rat snakes are subspecies of <i>Elaphe 
        obsoleta</i>. For a full list of the <i>Elaphe</i> species, see the <a href="http://www.reptile-database.org/">TIGR 
        Database</a>: Colubridae: <i>Elaphe</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The Latin word <i>elaphe</i> 
        means deerskin; <i>guttata</i> means speckled or spotted. Both terms apply 
        to corns and rats: in most species, their skin feels like finely tanned 
        deerskin, while the patterns on their back create spots or speckles. Some 
        people see the patterning of the belly scales as resembling maize, a colorful 
        ancestor of our modern day corn. Another theory relating to how corn snakes 
        got their name comes from the early Europeans settlers. They frequently 
        found these snakes in their corn fields and corn cribs, and thought they 
        were eating the corn! In fact, the corn snakes were, and remain, very 
        helpful to farmers as they help keep down the rodent population. Amelanistic 
        corns (those lacking the black and brown skin coloring) are sometimes 
        called &quot;red rat snakes&quot; because of their red-to-orange coloring.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">There are presently 
        two subspecies of corns, <i>E. g. gutatta</i> and <i>E. g. meahllmorum</i>. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The care information 
        below discusses corns. The same information applies to rat snakes, as 
        well, other than that species whose overall length and size are larger 
        than corns will require larger enclosures and larger prey.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Natural History<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Corns are 
        commonly found in deciduous forests, pine barrens, rocky hillsides and 
        farm areas over a broad swath of the United States (Alabama, Arkansas, 
        West central/Southeast Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, 
        Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Southern 
        Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
        Texas, Eastern Utah, Virginia). They have also been reported in Mexico 
        (Chihuahua, Coahuila, North Durango, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas) and the Cayman 
        Islands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Corns are most active 
        at night or in the hours of dawn and dusk (crepuscular). While they are 
        primarily ground-dwellers, some are semi-arboreal. While the <i>Elaphes</i> 
        feed on everything ranging from fish to frogs to rodents to mammals, wild 
        Corns start off feeding on small invertebrates and vertebrates, such as 
        crickets. Corns lay eggs, becoming sexually mature at around two years 
        of age.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Personal Statistics<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hatchlings 
        range in size from 9-14 inches (22-36 cm); adults are generally 2.5 to 
        5 feet 76-152 cm) in length; most are in the 3-4 foot (91-122 cm) range. 
        The average life span of these snakes is 10 years, although one was documented 
        to be 21 years old. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> In the wild, hatchlings 
        feed largely on small lizards and tree frogs, while adults feed on small 
        rodents and birds, killing their prey by constriction. In captivity, hatchlings 
        Corns can easily be started on pinkie mice (1-2 day old), quickly moving 
        up the prey scale, to fuzzies, crews and small adult mice. Both hatchlings 
        and adults can be fed prekilled rodents.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When selecting a corn 
        or rat snake, look for a well-fleshed body, no visible cuts or abrasions, 
        clear, alert eyes, tongue flicking, no signs of mites or ticks. The vent 
        should be clean.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">It is always recommended 
        to obtain captive bred, rather than wild-caught, corns. Captive bred ones 
        have become very popular because of all the exotic colors and patterns 
        they &quot;come in&quot;. Unfortunately, those morphs are caused by intense 
        inbreeding. As a result, corns are increasingly exhibiting morbitidy and 
        mortality problems as a result of undesireable genes being bred along 
        with the ones for color and pattern. Failure/Inability to feed and sudden, 
        inexplicable death are the two most common problems that have been increasing 
        over that past several years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Growth</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many people believe that 
        a reptile will not grow any larger that its tank. THIS IS NOT TRUE! The 
        reptile keeps growing and will become miserable, and probably ill, if 
        the proper tank size is not provided. The only way to &quot;stunt&quot; 
        a reptile's is to not feed it enough; assuming you do not want a dead 
        reptile, this is not something you should do. Always find out the adult 
        size of an animal before you buy it. Note that many pet stores intentionally 
        stunt a reptile's growth; they find it's easier to sell a cute young reptile 
        to someone who does not know what they are looking at than an older, bigger 
        animal. Always inquire how old the animal is, when it was acquired, etc. 
        Be a knowledgeable consumer, not an impulse buyer.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Setting Up Your Snake's 
        New Home</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Enclosure</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Corns must be housed 
        in at least a 20 gallon tank. The tank must have a secure top. A determined 
        snake can push against screen or glass until it finds an opening big enough 
        for its head; where its head goes, so goes its body. Some snakes will 
        constantly rub their nose against the screened top of the tank in an effort 
        to find a way out. The resulting abrasions should be treated with an antiseptic 
        and antibiotic ointment. The furnishings in the enclosure should then 
        be evaluated to provide a more natural environment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Provide a Hiding 
        Place<br>
        </b>A hide box of some sort should be provided, and an interesting branch 
        for climbing and resting. Branches collected from the wild will need to 
        be debugged by soaking first in chlorine/water solution, then rinsed thoroughly, 
        soaked in clean water, then left to dry in the sun. No special lighting 
        is required.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Substrate</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">With corn snakes, there 
        are a couple of different substrates that can be used, such as pine chips 
        (not cedar chips, are toxic), indoor/outdoor carpeting and &quot;Astroturf&quot;. 
        If you use the carpeting or Astroturf, you must wash it then let it dry 
        thoroughly before it can be used in the tank again; have two pieces on 
        hand which can be rotated. The snakes will often burrow under the chips 
        or carpet/turf, so don't be surprised if they are not always in view. 
        If you use pine or aspen shavings or cypress mulch, the urine and feces 
        can be scooped out with a cat litter scoop, with fresh chips added as 
        needed. Be sure to remove soiled substrate as soon as possible; urine-soaked 
        material become a breeding ground for bacteria and fungus. If you use 
        this type of substrate you will have to place your snake in a secure area 
        to feed it; you do not want it to ingest any chips.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Temperature<br>
        </b>An undertank heat pad is placed under one-half of the tank; this leaves 
        one side cooler so that your snake can regulate its body temperature as 
        needed. A heating pad made for people can be purchased at any drug store; 
        set it at medium or low depending upon the ambient air temperature. To 
        maintain health, corn snakes must be kept at 75-85 F, the higher temperature 
        being necessary to digest its food. Temperatures can fall to the lower 
        range at night. To easily monitor temperature, inexpensive aquarium self-stick 
        thermometers can be purchased and applied about an inch above the bottom 
        of the tank on the warm side. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hot rocks should never 
        be used; they fluctuate too much, and too many reptiles suffer severe 
        ventral burns. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">An incandescent light 
        bulb in a reflector shield may be set just outside the tank to heat up 
        a basking area; appliance timers can be set to turn the light on and off 
        at set times during the day. Reset the hours of operation to adjust for 
        seasonal fluctuations in ambient air temperature.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Feeding<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">An active 
        snake will happily eat every 10 days or so. They will eat, and should 
        only be fed, killed prey. A snake who is not hungry when live prey is 
        introduced into the enclosure often finds itself becoming the meal, especially 
        if the prey is a rat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">To economize, you can 
        buy in bulk and freeze them. Contact your local herpetology society; many 
        members breed mice and rats, and most will pre-kill them for you. Remove 
        the prey item from the freezer and allow to defrost at room temperature. 
        When defrosted, use forceps or tongs to pick up the rodent by the tail, 
        and hold the prey in front of the snake for the snake to strike at.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Many snakes will eat 
        prey that is just placed in the tank. Occasionally, a quail egg can be 
        offered to wild-caught specimens. If the snake likes it, one can be offered 
        every couple of weeks. (Since quail eggs purchased in stores or from hatcheries 
        are unlikely to be fertilized, they should not form a regular part of 
        the main diet.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Start hatchlings off 
        with pinkie mice. As your snake grows, gradually increase the prey size 
        by offering fuzzies, crews, then small adult mice or rat pinkies. A full-grown 
        Corn or Rat can eat a medium to large mouse; large Rat snakes can eat 
        small rats. If you feed too much at one feeding session, or feed a prey 
        item that is too large, your snake may regurgitate it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Water<br>
        </b>A bowl of fresh water must always be available at all times. It will 
        be used for drinking and sometimes for bathing. If the snake defecates 
        in it, the bowl must be cleaned and disinfected immediately.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Handling<br>
        </font> </b>Corns do not wrap snugly around your arm like pythons or kings. 
        They tend to pick a direction and go for it. Though they are relatively 
        small in body mass, they are quite strong. Always support the body and 
        give free rein to the head. If the head starts going somewhere you don't 
        want it to go, gently guide it into another direction. Many snakes are 
        nervous when introduced into a new situation with new people. Give them 
        a couple of days to settle down before letting new people handle them.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Shedding<br>
        </font></b>As a reptile grows, its old skin become too tight and worn. 
        A new skin awaits just below the old. As a snake gets ready to shed, its 
        eyes will turn a milky blue over the course of several days, and the body 
        color will start to dull and develop a whitish sheen. Once the eyes have 
        cleared, the snake is ready to shed. To assure proper hydration, soak 
        the snake in warmish water after the eyes clear; this should enable to 
        snake to shed easily within the next 24 hours.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Veterinary 
        Care<br>
        </font></b>All newly acquired reptiles should have fecal exams done by 
        an experienced reptile vet to check for bacteria, protozoa and worms. 
        Many of the parasites, bacteria and protozoans can be transmitted to humans 
        and other reptiles. Left untreated, these infestations can ultimately 
        kill your reptile. Medications are available to treat these conditions. 
        When your snake first defecates, collect the feces in a clean plastic 
        bag, seal it, label it with your name, phone number, date and your snake's 
        name, then take it and your snake to a <a href="vets/index.html">reptile 
        vet</a>.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Signs of ill-health<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Snakes, like 
        all other animals, do get sick. Listlessness, failure to eat over several 
        weeks or regurgitating meals can be signs of bacterial or endoparasite 
        infection. Take these animals to a reptile vet, with a fecal or vomitus 
        sample enclosed in a ziplock bag. Ectoparasites, such as ticks and mites, 
        must also be dealt with. With proper instruction, this is something you 
        can do yourself if the infestation is mild. Allowed to escalate, ectoparasites 
        can kill their host. If the skin around the neck forms wrinkles and puckers, 
        the snake is severely dehydrated and you must see a vet. The vet will 
        either administer subcutaneous fluids or show you how to force fluids. 
        Animals cannot digest food when dehydrated, so emaciation will set in 
        if the condition is allowed to continue untreated. Then, respiratory infections, 
        parasites and other problems, and possibly death, will occur. Thin, stringy 
        mucous coming out of nose or mouth or changes in feces or urates (different 
        color, consistency, frequency) signal a disease or infection. Observe 
        your snake every day to be sure to catch any problems early. Treat the 
        problem as soon as it is noticed to prevent other health problems and 
        vet bills.</font></p>

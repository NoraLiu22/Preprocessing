<h2>The First Bee of Spring</h2>
<p>
It is not <a href="meadow.html#b">natural</a> for native plants here to flower in mid March, as my
crocuses do. Even in early April, only in open woods are there insects about to pollinate flowers.
But, hungry for something of nature in the new environment around me that we call a city, I've planted
them throughout the mowed area around my home. They came originally from mountains in Turkey,
where insects could warm up their flight muscles at lower, warmer altitudes, then fly up the hills
in search of food.
<p>
For two weeks each spring, they waited in vain for their chance at life as they see it - pollination and
seed production. I had mixed feelings sometimes, watching them open and close with the sun.
Was it right for me to enjoy their life of sterility? Then, the first bee of spring would arrive,
at the peak of warmth just after noon. Wings buzzing non stop to keep warm, she would
quickly grab the most easily accessible pollen for a few minutes, then head back to the
warmth of her nest before she could be chilled into immobility.
<p>
I used to follow her, up the full length of Cadboro, to the rocky patch between Ogilvie and the
Queensway - a kilometer of barren brown, for there are few here who dare to defile their lawns
with 'weeds' such as flowers. There, I would find her kin, busily foraging along the edges of a brushy
area that still survived the development plans for a &#34;vibrant new Gloucester City
Center&#34;. It was still enough for the first bees of spring to replenish their larder.
<p>
No more. It's all gone - covered with asphalt for big box store parking.
<p>
Why must we always equate development with sterility? Should we all not rejoice in
the first bee of spring? Should we not, even more, wish that our children's children will too?
<p>
Imitation Astroturf lawns don't feed hungry people, provide shelter, or provide warmth. Surely
some of that space can be used for a better purpose than for 12-foot swamp grass, for that's what
bluegrass is, shackled and starved into submission by overzealous mowing?
<p>
If you would join me in making space for nature around your home, set aside a patch of 'lawn'
this year for
<a href="meadow.html">a meadow</a> or
<a href="groundcover.html">flowering ground covers</a>.
And, support natural spaces for your community that support the insects that share this world with us.

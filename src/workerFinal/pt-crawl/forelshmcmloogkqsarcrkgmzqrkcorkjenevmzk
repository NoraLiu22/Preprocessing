      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">From March 3-15,
      2001, Alim also had a very successful series of performances
      in Tabriz, Iran. It was his first visit to this city, which boasts
      the largest Azerbaijani population in what is often referred
      to as Southern Azerbaijan. Tabriz is Iran's third largest city,
      with a population of more than 2 million. For years, people in
      Tabriz had been begging Alim to come and give a concert. The
      only other performance that the mugham master had ever made in
      Iran was at a festival in Tehran in 1993. <BR>
<BR>
      Originally Alim had intended to give five concerts in Tabriz,
      but interest ran so high that ten concerts were scheduled, two
      a day. The auditorium was packed each day. Although the auditorium
      seats 700 people, more than 1,000 people attended each performance.
      It became nearly impossible to get tickets for these sell-out
      performances. Concerts were scheduled to last only one hour each,
      but they usually lasted 1 1/2 to 2 hours and the final performance
      was 2 1/2 hours long.<BR>
<BR>
      Reportedly, during Alim's rendition of the Azerbaijani folk song
      &quot;Sari Galin&quot; (Yellow Bride), the concert organizers
      had to pass out tissues because so many men and women in the
      audience were emotionally touched and started crying. Since the
      1960s, Azerbaijani music performances were discouraged. Only
      recently has the government begun to allow Azerbaijanis to begin
      performing publicly. Alim's daughter, Fargana, 21, who usually
      performs with him, did not do so in Iran. Women are not allowed
      to perform on stage as featured soloists when there are men in
      the audience. <BR>
<BR>
      When Alim was leaving the concert, fans surrounded the car. One
      girl pushed her hand through the window, begging for Alim to
      write his autograph on her hand. He didn't oblige, as it is against
      Iranian rules for a man to sign a woman's hand.</FONT></P>

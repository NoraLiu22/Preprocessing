  <blockquote>  <!--sino date 1 January 2002-->

On one reading of the approach by some Judges of the Federal Court to complex
cases involving more than one respondent, particularly
where the conduct in
question involves a complicated or lengthy series of transactions, those cases
should simply not be brought
as class actions. If that reading is correct, then
to put it bluntly, defendants are more likely to escape liability if by their
conduct they cause harm or loss to more people over a greater period of time,
and if they do so in concert with
others.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup><br>
Class actions are unlikely to flourish in Australia without a change in
attitudes, both in the profession and the judiciary ... Many
Australian judges
may still view class actions as predatory litigation instituted for the
advantage of entrepreneurial
lawyers.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In March
2002 the class action regime introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament, through
the addition of a new Part IVA to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/" class="autolink_findacts">Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</a>
</i>(Cth),<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup> celebrated its tenth
'birthday'. During this time, a number of important issues, concerning the
interpretation and application of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>, have
emerged.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup> One such issue has been
the circumstances in which a proceeding may be brought, in pursuance of the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>, against more than one respondent ('multiple respondents
suits').<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup> It is the aim of this
article to assess the operation of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> regime with respect to such
suits.</p>
<p>The picture that will emerge from this analysis is a largely unsatisfactory
one as it will reveal (a) conflicting decisions of the
Federal Court and,
consequently, uncertainty as to the precise ambit and impact of applicable
principles; and (b) the existence of
significant and unnecessary barriers to the
availability of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> regime in relation to multiple respondents
suits.</p>
<p>In Section II below, the relevant provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> will be summarised.
Sections III, IV and V will explore the impact on multiple respondents suits of
the judicial interpretation of
the three requirements which, according to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)</a>, must be complied with before aspiring representative plaintiffs
may avail themselves of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>
regime.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> A summary of the author's
conclusions is provided in Section VI.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading18"></a><b>II	THE PART IVA REGIME</b></h2>
<p>The central provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)</a> as it sets out the
conditions which need to be satisfied in order to activate the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>
regime.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup> It provides that where</p>
<blockquote>
(a)	7 or more persons have claims against the same
person;<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> and<br>
(b)	the claims of all those persons are in respect of, or arise out of, the
same, similar or related circumstances; and<br>
(c)	the claims of all those persons give rise to a substantial common issue of
law or fact;<br>
a proceeding may be commenced by one or more of those persons as representing
some or all of them.</blockquote><p>In light of the importance of the three
requirements set out above, each will be considered in Sections III, IV and V
below respectively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33d.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33D(1)</a> addresses the standing of the applicant to commence a class
action on behalf of the represented group:</p>
<blockquote>
(1)	A person referred to in paragraph 33C(1)(a) who has a sufficient interest to
commence a proceeding on his or her own behalf against
another person has a
sufficient interest to commence a representative proceeding against that other
person on behalf of other persons
referred to in that
paragraph.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33C(1)</a> reflects a deliberate decision by the
Commonwealth Parliament not to impose on potential class representatives the
requirement of
seeking leave from the Federal Court before they may proceed with
a class suit under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA.</a> This rejection of a mandatory certification
requirement<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> was based upon the
recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission
('ALRC').<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup> However, a properly
commenced class proceeding, that is, a proceeding which complies with all three
requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)</a>, may be discontinued, as a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> suit, by the
Federal Court if one of the scenarios specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33l.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss

exist. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33n.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33N</a> constitutes the most significant source of the Federal
Court's power to terminate a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> suit. It allows the Court, on application
by the respondent or of its own motion, to order that the action no longer
continue as
a class action where</p>
<blockquote>
it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so because:<br>
(a)	the costs that would be incurred if the proceeding were to continue as a
representative proceeding are likely to exceed the costs
that would be incurred
if each group member conducted a separate
proceeding;<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup> or<br>
(b)	all the relief sought can be obtained by means of a proceeding other than a
representative proceeding under this Part; or<br>
(c)	the representative proceeding will not provide an efficient and effective
means of dealing with the claims of group members;
or<br>
(d)	it is otherwise inappropriate that the claims be pursued by means of a
representative
proceeding.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33p.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
33P</a> provides that where the Court orders the discontinuance of a class suit,
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33l.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 33L</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33m.html" class="autolink_findacts">33M</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33n.html" class="autolink_findacts">33N</a>, the proceeding may be continued as a proceeding by the
representative party on his/her own behalf and 'on the application of a person
who was a group member for the purposes of the proceeding, the Court may order
that the person be joined as an applicant in the proceeding'.
O'Loughlin and
Drummond JJ of the Federal Court have explained that:</p>
<blockquote>
where the Court determines that a proceeding commenced under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> is not
authorised by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C</a> to be commenced as a representative proceeding or where
it orders, under any of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33l.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 33L</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33m.html" class="autolink_findacts">33M</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33n.html" class="autolink_findacts">33N</a>, that a representative proceeding no
longer continue under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>, the effect of such a determination is to
extinguish the representative aspect of the proceeding but to leave unaffected
its character
as a proceeding brought for the benefit of the representative
party itself. The implication in each of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33l.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 33L(b)</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33m.html" class="autolink_findacts">33M</a>(c) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33n.html" class="autolink_findacts">33N</a>(1) is that
once an order terminating the representative character of a proceeding brought
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> is made, that same proceeding continues, but as an action brought
by and for the sole benefit of the representative party. What is
implied in
these provisions is expressly stated in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33p.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33P(a).</a><sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33h.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
33H(1)</a> outlines the requirements with respect to the originating process in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
IVA</a> proceedings. The pleadings must describe or otherwise identify the group
members to whom the proceeding relates, specify the nature
of the claims made on
behalf of the group members and the relief claimed as well as the questions of
law or fact common to the claims
of the group members. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33h.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33H(2)</a> makes it
clear, however, that in describing, or otherwise identifying group members, it
is not necessary to name, or specify the
number of, group
members.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33h.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33H(2)</a> reflects
the fact that an opt out mechanism was selected by the Commonwealth
Parliament.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading51"></a><b>III	SEVEN OR MORE PERSONS MUST HAVE A CLAIM AGAINST
THE SAME PERSON</b></h2>
<p>In <i>Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd v
Nixon</i>,<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup> Sackville J of the
Federal Court (with whose reasons Spender and Hill JJ agreed) enunciated the
following principle ('the <i>Philip Morris</i> principle') concerning the impact
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a)</a> upon multiple respondents suits:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a)</a> requires every applicant and represented party to have a claim
against the one respondent or, if there is more than one, against
all
respondents. This conclusion follows from the language of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a)</a>
itself and is consistent with the approach taken by the [ALRC] in <i>Grouped
Proceedings</i>. It is also consistent with the structure of the legislation.
For example, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33D(1)(a)</a> (which provides that a person who has a sufficient
interest to commence a proceeding on his or her own behalf against another
person
has a sufficient interest to commence a representative proceeding
<i>against that person</i> on behalf of other persons referred to in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a))</a> is clearly drafted on the assumption that all applicants and
represented persons will have claims against the same person.<br>
It follows that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a)</a> is not satisfied if some applicants and group
members have claims against one respondent (or group of respondents) while other
applicants
and group members have claims against another respondent (or group of
respondents). The requirement in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(b)</a> that the claims of all group
members are in respect of or arise out of the same, similar or related
circumstances, is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for the commencement
of representative proceedings. Of course, if there are two sets of claims
against
two sets of respondents, it may well be that each can be the subject of
representative proceedings. It may even be that directions
can be made for them
to be heard together: <i>Ryan v Great Lakes Council </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20149%20ALR%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 149 ALR 45</a>, at
48, per Wilcox J. But they cannot both be the subject of the same representative
proceedings.<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
the remainder of this section an analysis of the cogency and the impact of the
<i>Philip Morris</i> principle will be provided. In particular, the
appropriateness of Sackville J's reliance on the ALRC's
report,<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup> which led to the
enactment of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>, will be considered (see Section IIIA below). This will be
followed by a study of whether the <i>Philip Morris </i>principle is, in fact,
in accordance with the intention of the Commonwealth Parliament (see Section
IIIB below). The approach to the
application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a)</a> in multiple
respondents suits, dictated by the <i>Philip Morris</i> principle, is then
contrasted with the approach adopted by the Federal Court before <i>Philip
Morris</i> and by courts in British Columbia and Ontario (see Section IIIC and
Section IIID below, respectively). Section IIIE will canvass
the availability of
other procedures, such as joinder and consolidation, in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>
proceedings affected by the <i>Philip Morris </i>principle. Finally, in Section
IIIF it will be submitted that the <i>Philip Morris</i> principle may, and
should, be applied in a less strict fashion than what occurred in <i>Philip
Morris </i>itself.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading59"></a><b>A	The grouped proceedings proposal of the
ALRC</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> was based upon the grouped proceedings model recommended by the ALRC
in 1988.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup> As the passage from
Sackville J's judgment set out above indicates, his Honour placed significant
reliance on the views of the ALRC
in reaching the conclusion that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a)</a> requires every representative plaintiff and every group member
to have a claim against every respondent. Sackville J was of the view
that the
ALRC's</p>
<blockquote>
recommendations were specifically designed to provide an effective procedure to
enable people suffering loss or damage in common
with others as a result of a
wrongful act or omission <i>by the same respondent</i> (par 69, 95, 133). It
therefore plainly did not envisage that the grouped procedure could be employed
to bring a proceeding against
more than one respondent, in circumstances where
some members of the group make a claim against one respondent only and others
make
a claim against another
respondent.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Before
considering the report of the ALRC in some detail, some preliminary comments,
concerning Sackville J's views quoted above,
are called for. His Honour was
correct when he noted that the ALRC made numerous references to 'respondent'
rather than 'respondents'.
However, it is equally clear that the ALRC <i>did
envisage</i> the commencement of grouped proceedings against more than one
respondent. The ALRC furnished a number of examples of legal grievances
which
could be appropriately dealt with by the model proposed by the ALRC. Three of
these examples, provided by the ALRC, involved
causes of action against more
than one respondent.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>A central component of the model advocated by the ALRC was that the class
representatives <i>and the group members</i> would all be parties to the
proceeding. In the words of the ALRC:</p>
<blockquote>
all persons with relevant and related claims [would] be made parties to their
own separate proceedings. This implies that a distinct
proceeding be commenced
on behalf of each member of the group even if they have different causes of
action, claim different relief
or rely on different bases of jurisdiction. The
proceeding of each member of the group could be 'bundled together' and conducted
by one of the group on behalf of all of them together with his or her own
proceedings. The result would be that all such persons
would be bound by the
decision in a matter to which that person was a
party.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The model
proposed by the ALRC should be contrasted with the class action model, pursuant
to which</p>
<blockquote>
one party commences an action on behalf of other persons who have a claim to a
remedy for the same or similar perceived wrong. That
party conducts the action
as 'representative plaintiff'. Only the 'representative plaintiff' is a party.
Other persons having claims
that share questions of law and fact in common with
those of the representative plaintiff are members of the 'class'. Once the class
has been determined, the class members are bound by the outcome of the
litigation even though, for the most part, they do not participate
in the
proceedings.<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup></blockquote><p>What
the ALRC had in mind bears some similarity to the group litigation regime
introduced in England in May
2000.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup> In fact, under this new
English system, 'each group litigant is a member of a procedural class as a
party, rather than as a represented
non-party'.<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> However, one crucial
difference between the English model and the ALRC's grouped proceedings model is
that in the former model the
requirement of making group members parties was the
result of an evaluation of the relevant policy
considerations.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup> The decision of
the ALRC, on the other hand, was based entirely on its concern that adherence to
a class action model for the Federal
Court&#8212;pursuant to which only the
applicant would be a party on the record&#8212;would violate the <i>Commonwealth
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup> Obviously, the
Commonwealth Parliament did not share the views of the ALRC, concerning the
compatibility of a class action model
with the <i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,
as it selected, for the Federal Court, a class action
model.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Under the regime advocated by the ALRC, it was essential that, if a group
action was initiated against more than one respondent, each
member of the group
was to have a claim against each respondent. Otherwise, the constitutional
problem identified by the ALRC,<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup>
and which dictated (in the ALRC's view) a grouped proceedings model, would
re-emerge, rendering the relevant legislation unconstitutional
in its
application to multiple respondents suits. In light of the Commonwealth
Parliament's rejection of the model proposed by the
ALRC, the views of the ALRC
on the issue of multiple respondents suits&#8212;which views were, as indicated
above, totally dictated
by the essential features of the model the ALRC was
putting forward&#8212;can shed no light upon the crucial issue of what
s 33C(1)(a)
requires in multiple respondents
suits.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup> Consequently, Sackville
J's reliance on the views of the ALRC, in respect of multiple respondents suits,
was, with respect,
inappropriate.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading84"></a><b>B	That elusive intention of Parliament</b></h3>
<p>The reasoning in favour of the <i>Philip Morris </i>principle that was
embraced by the Federal Court essentially revolved around the terms of
s 33C(1)(a) and
s 33D(1).<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> As was indicated
by Wilcox J in <i>Ryan v Great Lakes Council</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
Subsection (1) of 33D may have been inserted out of an abundance of legislative
caution. The standing it confers may be implicit
in the closing words of
s 33C(1) anyway; nonetheless, in confirming that standing, s 33D(1)
also limits it. The subsection takes
one of the seven or more claimants referred
to in s 33C(1)(a) (the first person) whose individual interest is
sufficient to support
a proceeding brought by the first person <i>against a
particular person</i>, and gives the first person the further entitlement to
make claims on behalf of others against '<i>that other person</i>'. The 'other
person' is the person referred to earlier in s 33D(1) as 'another person',
that is, the person against whom seven or
more members, <i>including the
applicant</i>, have
claims.<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It is
submitted, however, that the terms of these provisions would not necessarily
preclude the commencement of one <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> action against more than one
respondent where in relation to each respondent there are at least seven
persons, including a representative
party, who are all claiming against that
respondent.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup> As is explained in
Section IIIC below, this was essentially the approach adopted by the Federal
Court before <i>Philip Morris</i>. </p>
<p>The objectives which the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> device, and indeed any class action
regime,<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup> seeks to attain were
explained as follows in the Second Reading Speech of the Federal Court of
Australia (Amendment) Bill 1991 (Cth),
which introduced Part IVA:</p>
<blockquote>
The Bill gives the Federal Court an efficient and effective procedure to deal
with multiple claims. Such a procedure is needed for
two purposes. The first is
to provide a real remedy where, although many people are affected and the total
amount at issue is significant,
each person's loss is small and not economically
viable to recover in individual actions. It will thus give access to the courts
to those in the community who have been effectively denied justice because of
the high cost of taking action.<br>
The second purpose of the Bill is to deal efficiently with the situation where
the damages sought by each claimant are large enough
to justify individual
actions and a large number of persons wish to sue the respondent. The new
procedure will mean that groups of
persons, whether they be shareholders or
investors, or people pursuing consumer claims, will be able to obtain redress
and do so
more cheaply and efficiently than would be the case with individual
actions.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It is
submitted that the existence of these objectives of fundamental importance
dictates that a generous approach be taken to the
construction and application
of Part IVA. This point was made most effectively by the Supreme Court of Canada
in <i>Hollick v Toronto
(City)</i><sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup> in relation to
Ontario's counterpart to Part IVA:</p>
<blockquote>
the legislative history of the <i>Class Proceedings Act 1992 </i>makes clear
that the Act should be construed generously ... it is essential ... that courts
not take an overly restrictive approach
to the legislation, but rather interpret
the Act in a way that gives full effect to the benefits foreseen by the
drafters.<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
<i>Philip Morris </i>principle is not in accordance with the desirable
philosophy outlined above. This can be seen by exploring the impact which this
principle
has had upon (a) the class members in the <i>Philip Morris
</i>litigation itself and (b) other multiple respondents suits that sought to
rely on the Part IVA regime. The <i>Philip Morris</i> litigation involved claims
by those suffering the ill effects of smoking and were made against Australian
manufacturers and distributors
of cigarettes. Sackville, Spender and Hill JJ
delivered separate judgments but all agreed that the proceeding was not properly
brought
as a Part IVA suit because it failed to adhere to s 33C(1)(a) (as
well as s 33C(1)(b) and s 33C(1)(c)). Section 33C(1)(a) had not
been
satisfied because, in the words of Sackville J, 'the statement of claim pleads
that some applicants and group members have claims
against one respondent, while
others have claims against the other individual
respondents'.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup> Spender and Hill
JJ (Sackville J dissenting) held that the applicants should not be permitted
once again to replead the application
as a Part IVA action. As is explained in
Section IIIF below, a predominant reason for this ruling by Spender and Hill JJ
was their
conclusion that it would be impossible for the applicants to plead a
case that would demonstrate that every applicant and group member
had a claim
against each respondent. Hill J also explained that</p>
<blockquote>
to allow a case to continue which involves investigation of the conduct of all
the respondents over such a period of time [40 years]
might well be productive
of considerable injustice to them or some of them who will incur enormous costs
in giving discovery in respect
of matters which may not be relevant at all to
any actual applicant. This difficulty would disappear if those applicants who
have
a genuine case bring individual proceedings where discovery and other
interlocutory processes can be limited to what is actually
alleged, rather than
to what may hypothetically be
alleged.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Hill J's
comments, and his (and Spender J's) decision not to allow the applicants to
replead their case, are, with respect, disappointing
on both a conceptual and a
practical level. Failing to provide the applicants with another opportunity to
plead their case as a Part
IVA proceeding by, instead, categorically holding
that under no circumstances could the applicants in <i>Philip Morris</i> comply
with s 33C(1)(a)<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup> as well as
concluding that a more satisfactory scenario would ensue, if individual
proceedings were commenced by the group members,
demonstrate an inability,
and/or an unwillingness, on the part of Hill and Spender JJ, to embrace the
philosophy underlying class
action
regimes.<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></sup> The comments made by
Goldberg J of the Federal Court, in a different context, are apposite here:</p>
<blockquote>
counsel for the applicants correctly pointed out ... [that the] group members
... will be free either to bring, or join in the bringing
of, further
proceedings against the respondent. This may be true as a matter of theory and
principle but ... it fails to recognise
the practical advantage of the current
representative proceeding. The whole purpose of a representative proceeding is
to enable persons
with relatively small claims to have their claims pursued,
where the cost of pursuing individual claims is impractical having regard
either
to the quantum or nature of the
claim.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></sup></blockquote><p>On a more
practical level, the approach of Hill and Spender JJ displays an insufficient
understanding of, and/or regard for, the circumstances
of the class members.
Individual proceedings were simply not an option for most, if not all, of the
representative plaintiffs and
group
members.<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a></sup> As was revealed to the
High Court by Tobin QC, acting for the applicants, in <i>Philip Morris</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
there is no way that the tobacco litigation will continue as individual
proceedings. It is financially impossible ... there is another
reason ... and it
is this ... for an individual plaintiff to take on the tobacco companies while
suffering from a terminal disease
is, in the lingo, a big ask, and it is not a
realistic ask ... because individual plaintiffs, in these circumstances, are
probably
unlikely to see the outcome of their own
litigation.<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Kirby
J of the High Court was entitled to lament that the group members in <i>Philip
Morris</i> were 'put out of court under the provisions that are reformatory
provisions which, at least on my understanding, were enacted for
cases such as
this'.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a></sup> If, on the other hand,
individual proceedings were feasible, a state of affairs inconsistent with the
'judicial economy' goal of
class actions would result. This was precisely the
scenario witnessed in Ontario after the decision of the Ontario Court (General
Division) not to certify a class proceeding in <i>Sutherland v Canadian Red
Cross Society</i><sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></sup><i>
</i>concerning claims by persons who received HIV-infected blood as well as
those cross-infected by the primary infected
persons:<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
as a consequence, there are at least 84 individual tainted blood cases before
the Ontario courts and another possible 300 cases
forthcoming;<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a> </sup>and<br>
the filing of individual claims resulted in three very long trials without
significant plaintiff-wide
settlements.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
adverse practical impact of the <i>Philip Morris </i>principle extends beyond
preventing access to justice to smokers. To the knowledge of the author, there
have been five Part IVA proceedings&#8212;that
were either on foot at the time
of, or were started after, the judgment in <i>Philip Morris</i> that encompassed
multiple respondents suits&#8212;that were found by the Court not to have been
properly instituted, mainly as a
result of an inability to adhere to the
<i>Philip Morris </i>principle.<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></sup>
The application of the <i>Philip Morris </i>principle by the Supreme Court of
Victoria to the Victorian equivalent of Part IVA has also resulted in the
termination of the proceedings
against multiple defendants in <i>Cook v Pasminco
Ltd</i>.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a></sup> Furthermore, certain
comments by Hill<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a></sup> and Sackville
JJ<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a></sup> in <i>Philip Morris</i> raise
legitimate concerns as to the future availability of the Part IVA regime in
certain types of multiple respondents suits brought
pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act 1974</a></i> (Cth).</p>
<p>It is also vital to note that comments made by Senator Tate, the then
Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, indicate that the
government
responsible for the introduction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> envisaged the use of the class
action procedure in circumstances now precluded by the <i>Philip Morris
</i>principle. In a media release issued on 17 April 1991 Senator Tate drew
attention to the fact that</p>
<blockquote>
the legislation will confer no new legal rights&#8212;but it will allow people
to assert existing rights collectively, effectively
and more cheaply. If such a
measure had already been in operation, the present actions by haemophiliacs and
others who have medically
acquired AIDS, for example, could have proceeded with
one action representing the general group of AIDS
sufferers.<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
litigation referred to by Senator Tate was <i>E v Australian Red
Cross</i>.<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a></sup> This action was
brought in the Federal Court against three respondents: the Australian Red Cross
Society, the New South Wales Division
of that Society and the Central Sydney
Area Health Service. Wilcox J indicated that there were also thirty other
individual actions
before the Federal Court 'each seeking damages from the
Australian Red Cross Society ..., the New South Wales Division of that Society
... <i>and one or more respondents</i> [emphasis
added]'.<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a></sup> The information above
tends to suggest, quite clearly, that the only respondents against whom all the
applicants were claiming were
the Australian Red Cross Society and the NSW
Division of that Society. And yet, as was indicated above, the Minister who
introduced
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> Bill in the Senate expressly singled out these
individual proceedings as an excellent example of the type of multi-party legal
dispute
that could appropriately be dealt with by the new regime his Government
was introducing. Similarly, Wilcox J noted that the grouped
proceedings regime
recommended by the ALRC would have provided an excellent vehicle for the
resolution of these
disputes.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>In light of the adverse impact which the <i>Philip Morris</i> principle has
had, and will continue to have, upon the ability of Part IVA to attain the
benefits it was created to secure, an obvious
question is whether it is in fact
possible for a class action regime to operate in a satisfactory manner, in
relation to multiple
respondents suits, in the absence of a requirement that
every applicant and group member have a claim against every respondent. The
approach followed by the Federal Court itself, in a number of multiple
respondents suits which preceded <i>Philip Morris</i>, provides an affirmative
answer to the question posed above.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading140"></a><b>C	The pre-</b><b><i>Philip Morris </i>era</b></h3>
<p>The first Part IVA proceeding where it was apparent that some of the
applicants and group members were not claiming against each respondent
was
<i>McMullin v ICI Australia Operations Pty
Ltd</i>.<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a></sup> The proceedings were
initiated by Mr and Mrs McMullin against seven respondents. The proceedings
concerned losses allegedly suffered
as a result of the accumulation of
chlorfluazuron in tissues of cattle. The contamination was said to have occurred
when the cattle
were fed cotton waste that had been sprayed with an insecticide
called Helix. The applicants carried on business as farmers and graziers
in New
South Wales. They represented other persons, such as graziers and abattoirs, who
suffered the losses described above. The
class members resided and carried on
their businesses in either New South Wales or Queensland. The respondents
included, in addition
to the manufacturers and distributors of Helix, the States
of Queensland and New South Wales. The negligence claims against these
States
essentially concerned the decisions of the relevant functionaries of each State
to register Helix under State law.</p>
<p>There was no discussion by the Federal Court, in the various judgments it
delivered in this class action, as to whether the proceeding
complied with
s 33C(1)(a). But the fact that the proceeding was permitted to continue
under Part IVA clearly shows that the Court
was of the view that all of the
threshold requirements of s 33C(1) had been satisfied; otherwise the Court
would have been compelled
to terminate the proceeding as Part IVA
proceeding.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></sup> What was equally
clear, however, was that the decision of the State of Queensland to allow the
registration of the impugned product
in that State could hardly affect (and thus
provide them with a cause of action against) those members of the class,
including the
applicants, who carried on business in New South Wales.
Accordingly, not all class members, including the applicants, had claims
against
every respondent. Indeed, given that New South Wales class members had no claims
against Queensland and that Queensland class
members had no claims against New
South Wales, it would seem highly likely that not a single member of the group
could be said to
have claims against each
respondent.<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[63]</a></sup> The validity of this
analysis appears to be confirmed by the following comment of Wilcox J, the trial
judge in <i>McMullin</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
during the hearing to which these reasons pertain, a question arose as to
whether the applicants are entitled to represent group
members who carried on
business in Queensland, especially in relation to those members' claims against
the State of Queensland. In
order to resolve any difficulty ... , I constituted
a sub-group consisting of those group members who conducted a grazing or other
relevant business in Queensland. With his consent, I appointed Christopher John
Blomfield as a sub-group representative party, representing
the members of that
sub-group in the proceeding ... Since 1975 Mr Blomfield has conducted a grazing
business [in] ... Queensland.
He also claims to have been affected by
chlorfluazuron
contamination.<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[64]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
fact that not all members of the group were claiming against all respondents did
not attract any adverse comments from the Court.
Nor did it prevent a ruling by
the Court as to the crucial issue of whether the respondents had in fact been
negligent, as alleged
by the
applicants.<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[65]</a></sup> Had the Court formed
the view that the proceedings, as Part IVA proceedings, would not provide an
efficient and effective means of
dealing with the claims of group members or
that it was simply inappropriate for the claims to be pursued under Part IVA, an
order
to discontinue the representative nature of the proceedings would have
been made by the Court under
s 33N.<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[66]</a></sup> No such order was
made.</p>
<p>The Federal Court's first discussion of what compliance with s 33C(1)(a)
entails for multiple respondents suits can be found in the
judgment handed down,
several months after the <i>McMullin</i> proceedings, by Wilcox J in
<i>Symington v Hoechst Schering Agrevo Pty
Ltd</i>.<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[67]</a></sup> In <i>Symington</i>,
the named plaintiffs were graziers who claimed that their cattle had ingested a
chemical, called endosulfan, marketed as a pesticide
by each of the respondents
under various brand names. The plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and other
persons who allegedly
suffered losses when meat was rejected and cattle
impounded following the detection of endosulfan residues in beef and beef
cattle.
There was, however, a problem. The representative parties claimed that
the product that contaminated their cattle was that of the
first respondent
only. Wilcox J explained as follows the impact of s 33C(1)(a) on this
representative proceeding:</p>
<blockquote>
I think it is clear that the applicant&#8212;that is to say, the representative
party&#8212;must himself or herself have standing
to sue the particular
respondent and, where there is more than one respondent, each of them. It is not
enough that the applicant
has standing to sue one respondent and other people
have claims against some other respondent which arise out of similar or related
circumstances and give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact.<br>
The present applicants claim the product supplied to their neighbours, which
contaminated their cattle, was that of the first respondent,
Hoechst Schering
Agrevo Pty Ltd. They concede they personally have no claim against the second,
third, fourth, fifth or sixth respondents.
The result is they have no standing
to bring an action against those respondents. Accordingly, the action must be
dismissed as against
those
respondents.<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[68]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Less
than two weeks later, in <i>Ryan v Great Lakes
Council</i>,<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[69]</a></sup> Wilcox J was
provided with another opportunity to canvass the ambit of s 33C(1)(a) in
the context of multiple respondents suits.
In <i>Ryan</i> the class
representative sued on behalf of himself and all other persons who suffered
injury as a result of eating oysters from the
Wallis Lakes in New South Wales,
which were contaminated with the Hepatitis A virus.</p>
<p>The action was brought against the Great Lakes Council ('the Council'), which
was said to have certain legal responsibilities in regard
to the quality of the
water at the lake, a number of oyster farmers and oyster distributors. The
representative plaintiff had a personal
claim against the first and second
respondents, namely, the Council and an oyster farmer, Graham Barclay Oysters
Pty Ltd. He had
no claims against the remaining ten respondents. Furthermore,
the evidence showed that there were a number of respondents against
whom it did
not yet appear that at least seven persons had claims. The only respondent
against whom all class members had a claim
was the Council. After reviewing the
terms of s 33C(1)(a) and s 33D(1), and the submissions put forward on
behalf of the applicant
and of the respondents, his Honour arrived at the
following general conclusion regarding the scope of s 33C(1)(a):</p>
<blockquote>
it follows that, in order to utilise the Pt IVA procedure against a given
respondent, the applicant must have a personal claim against
that respondent
that is shared by at least six other persons. The legislation does not prevent
several respondents being joined to
a single Pt IVA proceeding, so long as the
commencement and standing requirements are met by the applicant in respect of
each of
them. Nor is there any reason why an applicant could not, within the one
action, use the Pt IVA procedure against one or more respondents
but not against
others; the action is in the applicant's name alone, and it might be convenient
to determine connected non-representative
claims at the same time as the claims
the applicant brings for the benefit of the group. Nor is it forbidden to
consolidate the hearing
of two or more representative proceedings, brought by
different representatives but having, as between them, such similarity as to
warrant their being heard
together.<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[70]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
application of these principles to the proceedings before him led Wilcox J to
make the following orders:</p>
<blockquote>
as regards those respondents against whom the applicant personally makes no
claim, the present proceeding will, in any event, need
to be dismissed. If it is
possible to organise a separate Pt IVA proceeding against a particular oyster
grower or distributor using
a different representative party, it may be
appropriate to consolidate that proceeding with this one; the claim against the
council,
at least, will be common to both proceedings, and the expert and other
evidence seems likely to be substantially similar in nature
and effect.
Similarly, group members affected by the dismissal of the current proceeding
against particular respondents, who could
not satisfy the s 33C
requirements, might wish to bring individual claims against those respondents
which, again, might appropriately
be consolidated with the current
proceeding.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[71]</a></sup></blockquote><p>If
the exercise of ascertaining the views of the Court, as to what compliance with
s 33C(1)(a) entailed in multiple respondents suits,
was restricted to the
comments in <i>Symington </i>and <i>Ryan</i> set out above, then one would be
entitled to conclude that, subject to one exception, the Court adhered to the
view that compliance
with s 33C(1)(a) required each group member to be
claiming against each respondent. The exception referred to above concerns
<i>Ryan</i>. It will be recalled that whilst the applicant in <i>Ryan </i>had a
personal claim against the first two respondents, the only respondent against
whom all class members had a claim was the first
respondent. Consequently,
complete adherence to the <i>Philip Morris</i> principle would have also
required an order that s 33C(1)(a) had not been complied with in relation
to the action against the second
respondent.</p>
<p>As the trial judge in the <i>Philip Morris</i> proceedings, Wilcox J
said:</p>
<blockquote>
in <i>Symington</i> ... I held this paragraph [s 33C(1)(a)] requires that the
applicant, or each one of several applicants, and each group member must
have a
claim against each respondent; it is not sufficient for one applicant to make a
claim against one respondent and another applicant
or a group member to make a
claim against some other
respondent.<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[72]</a></sup></blockquote><p>A
substantially different picture, concerning the pre-<i>Philip Morris</i>
practice of the Federal Court in relation to multiple respondents suits,
emerges, however, if one concentrates (a) on the subsequent
class action in
<i>Schneider v Hoechst Schering Agrevo Pty
Ltd</i>;<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[73]</a></sup> and (b) on the orders
that were subsequently made in <i>Ryan</i>. The action in <i>Schneider</i> was
described as follows by the Federal Court:</p>
<blockquote>
this case is about damaged wheat crops ... A common feature in relation to many
of these [damaged] crops was that they had been sprayed
with a chemical
herbicide called Puma S. One of the farmers, Mr Schneider, commenced a
representative proceeding against the manufacturer
of Puma S ... Hoechst
... on behalf of all affected farmers. He also commenced proceedings against
IAMA Limited ('IAMA') from whom
he had purchased the Puma S ... <i>The
proceedings against IAMA were said to be brought on behalf of a sub-group of the
represented parties, namely those who had purchased
Puma S from
IAMA</i>.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[74]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It is
apparent from the description above that while the applicant had a claim against
each of the two respondents, the same cannot
be said about every group member.
The use of the term 'subgroup' by the Court suggests quite clearly that not all
of the represented
persons had a claim against the second respondent, the
distributor.</p>
<p>An even clearer illustration of the Federal Court permitting multiple
respondents suits to commence and continue, despite the inability
of the
plaintiffs to demonstrate that every member of the group, including the
representative parties, had a claim against every
respondent, is provided by the
developments in the <i>Ryan </i>proceeding itself. Additional representative
plaintiffs were added. Wilcox J explained, as follows, how, in his view, the
addition
of further applicants now ensured compliance with the requirements of
s 33C(1)(a):</p>
<blockquote>
on 18 September 1997 I ruled that Mr Ryan was not competent to maintain a
representative action against a person in relation to whom
he had no personal
claim ... However, I subsequently gave leave Mr Ryan to amend the proceeding in
such a manner as to join additional
applicants; each being a person who made a
personal claim against a particular grower or distributor and was therefore
competent
to represent other group members who had claims against that grower or
distributor.<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[75]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>After Wilcox J delivered a judgment on the 'merits' of the
action, there was an appeal to the Full Federal Court. In the judgment
of one of
the members of the Court, Lindgren J, appear the following comments, which are
directly relevant to the issue currently
being considered:</p>
<blockquote>
Originally Mr Ryan alone was the applicant but as a result of <i>Ryan v Great
Lakes Council </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2078%20FCR%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 78 FCR 309</a> the proceeding was reconstituted to add the
other six applicants. As a result, each applicant who made a personal claim
against a
particular oyster grower or distributor was competent to represent
other group members who claimed against the same grower or distributor.
Following the reconstitution of the proceeding, the group members to whom the
proceeding related were defined as 185 people named
in eleven annexures ... Each
annexure listed the group members who claimed against a particular grower or
distributor, the Council
or the State. <i>All 185 people claimed against the
Council and the State but not all of those people claimed against a particular
grower or distributor
of
oysters</i>.<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[76]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It
is clear from the summary above that, with the exception of the Council and the
State, not all applicants and class members in
<i>Ryan </i>were making a claim
against every respondent.</p>
<p>In light of the discussion above, it can be safely concluded that despite the
comments in <i>Symington</i> and <i>Ryan</i>&#8212;which appear to accord
largely with what the Full Federal Court subsequently held in <i>Philip
Morris</i>&#8212;the litigation in <i>McMullin</i>, <i>Ryan</i> and
<i>Schneider</i> was allowed to progress despite the fact that not all
representative parties and group members were claiming against all respondents.
Equally important is the fact that in <i>McMullin, Ryan</i> and
<i>Schneider</i>, the proceedings reached the final stage of a judgment on the
common issues.<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[77]</a></sup> This indicates
quite clearly that non-adherence to the <i>Philip Morris</i> principle will not
necessarily lead to unmanageable
proceedings<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[78]</a></sup> or generate unfair
scenarios for the class members and the
respondents,<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[79]</a></sup> as long as there is
sufficient similarity between the claims advanced against the various
respondents. This scenario is consistent
with the experience in the Canadian
provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. Attention will now be turned to how
courts in those
jurisdictions have dealt with multiple respondents suits.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading186"></a><b>D	Ontario and British Columbia</b></h3>
<p>The <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>, SO 1992, c 6 (<i>'Ontario Act'</i>)
introduced, in January 1993, a modern class action regime in Ontario. Pursuant
to s 5 of the <i>Ontario Act</i>, the Court is required to
certify<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[80]</a></sup> a class proceeding
if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the pleadings disclose a cause of action;</li>
<li>there is an identifiable
class<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[81]</a></sup> of two or more persons
that would be represented by the representative plaintiff or defendant;</li>
<li>the claims or defences of the class members raise common issues;</li>
<li>a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the resolution of
the common issues; and</li>
<li>there is a representative plaintiff or defendant who would fairly and
adequately represent the interests of the class; has produced
a plan for the
proceeding that sets out a workable method of advancing the proceeding on behalf
of the class and of notifying class
members of the proceeding; and does not
have, on the common issues for the class, an interest in conflict with the
interests of other
class members.</li></ul><p>As early as August 1993, courts in
Ontario were faced with the question of whether multiple respondents suits
should be certified
where some of the plaintiffs and some of the class members
do not have claims against all defendants. The case in question was <i>Bendall v
McGhan Medical Corp</i>.<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[82]</a></sup> The
class was defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
all persons who have had silicone gel breast implants placed in their bodies,
whose implants were manufactured, developed, designed,
fabricated, sold,
distributed or otherwise placed into the stream of commerce by the named
Defendants.<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[83]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
judge presiding over this class proceeding, Montgomery J of the Ontario Court
(General Division), explained that</p>
<blockquote>
the plaintiff Bendall allegedly received implants manufactured by the defendant
McGhan Medical Corporation ('McGhan') while the plaintiff
Wise allegedly
received implants manufactured by the defendants Dow Corning Canada Inc, or Dow
Corning Corporation ('Dow
Corning').<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[84]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This
meant, of course, that not all representative parties were making claims against
all defendants. The same conclusion applied
to the class members, as those women
who received McGhan implants had no cause of action against Dow Corning and
those class members
who received Dow Corning implants had no cause of action
against McGhan. However, the Court rejected the defendants' proposition
that
this state of affairs warranted the denial of certification under s 5.
Montgomery J's conclusion was consistent with, and probably
the product of, his
views concerning the appropriate approach to the interpretation of the
<i>Ontario Act</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
in my opinion, the court should err on the side of protecting people who have a
right of access to the courts. This is remedial legislation
and it should be
addressed with a purposive approach. This is not inconsistent with the duty to
look carefully at the facts to see
if they meet the requirements of
s 5.<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[85]</a></sup></blockquote><p><i>Bendall</i>
was recently endorsed by Cumming J of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in
<i>Gariepy v Shell Oil
Company</i>.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[86]</a></sup> Cumming J confirmed
that 'it is unnecessary in a class proceeding for the representative plaintiff
to personally have a cause of
action against each named defendant. It is
sufficient for a representative plaintiff to represent a proposed class of
persons who
may be able to assert claims against the various
defendants'.<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[87]</a></sup> Consequently, the
position in Ontario regarding multiple respondents suits is quite clear. As long
as it is possible to demonstrate
that for each of the various defendants there
are some class members who have claims against that particular defendant, a
class proceeding
may proceed, if the prerequisites for certification contained
in s 5 are satisfied. It is not necessary to show that the plaintiffs
and
the class members are all claiming against each defendant.</p>
<p>A modern class action regime was introduced in British Columbia in August
1995 as a result of the enactment of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>, RSBC
1996, c 50 (<i>'BC Act'</i>). This Act was based on, and is substantially
similar to, the <i>Ontario
Act</i>.<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[88]</a></sup> One of the first
judicial pronouncements on the <i>BC Act</i> was that of Mackenzie J of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia in <i>Harrington v Dow Corning
Corp.</i><sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[89]</a></sup><i> </i>His Honour
certified a proceeding in which the representative party was acknowledged to
have a cause of action against only five of
the sixteen defendants. Mackenzie J
also indicated that 'negligence is a cause of action which involves the
manufacturers severally
and it may be appropriate to divide the class into
sub-classes by manufacturer, with separate representatives for each
sub-class'.<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[90]</a></sup> However, the Court
went on to certify the class action without requiring a representative plaintiff
for each manufacturer.</p>
<p><i>Harrington</i> was applied by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in
<i>Campbell v Flexwatt Corporation</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
there is no requirement that there be a representative plaintiff with a cause of
action against every defendant; the legislation
simply requires that there be a
cause of action. If a class includes a subclass whose members have claims that
raise common issues
not shared by all members of a class then the court must
appoint a representative plaintiff for the subclass if the court determines
that
the representative plaintiff for the class could not fairly and adequately
represent the interests of the
subclass.<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[91]</a></sup></blockquote><p>As was
the case with the practice of the Federal Court in the pre-<i>Philip Morris</i>
era, permitting the use of the class action device in multiple respondents
suits, without requiring compliance with a principle such
as the <i>Philip
Morris </i>principle, has not generated problems for Canadian courts&#8212;in
managing class proceedings&#8212;nor has it resulted in unfairness
for either
class members or defendants in Ontario and British Columbia. At the same time,
this approach has expanded the availability
of the class action device in
multiple respondents suits thereby facilitating the attainment of the important
social goals of class
actions.<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[92]</a></sup> A
striking illustration of this state of affairs is provided by the litigation in
<i>Bendall</i>.<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[93]</a></sup> In that case,
the Court indicated that 'certification is the only way a large number of women
can access a legal system that would
otherwise be denied to
them'.<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[94]</a></sup> The outcome of this class
proceeding and similar breast implants class actions in Canada was that a global
settlement for more than
$50 million was attained on behalf of all class
members.<sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[95]</a></sup></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading228"></a><b>E	Associated issues</b></h3>
<p>In <i>Philip Morris</i>, the Full Federal Court did not consider what options
or procedures are available to the Court once a multiple respondents suit is
found not to have satisfied the condition which, according to the Court, is
contained in s 33C(1)(a), namely, that all members of
the group have a
claim against each respondent. A leading Victorian QC, Jonathan Beach, argued,
at a seminar held in October 2000,
that</p>
<blockquote>
in summary, on the authority of <i>Ryan</i>, it may be permissible directly, or
through separate proceedings and then consolidation, for:<br>
(i)	applicant A to bring representative claims for a group against respondent A
only and an individual claim against respondent B;
<br>
(ii)	applicant A to bring representative claims for one group against respondent
A and applicant B to bring other representative
claims for a <i>separate</i>
group against respondent B (providing that applicant A and six others at least
have claims against respondent A and applicant B and
six others at least have
claims against respondent B); <br>
(iii)	applicant A to bring representative claims for one group against
respondent A, and for one of those group members as a separate
applicant B to
bring an individual claim against respondent B. <br>
<i>Nixon </i>would appear in its terms not to foreclose any of those
possibilities. It only appears to stand as authority for the proposition that
if
an applicant(s) brings claims on behalf of group members (<i>one </i>group)
against multiple respondents, then <i>every </i>group member must have a claim
against <i>every
</i>respondent.<sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[96]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It
is submitted that scenario (ii) may not be attained directly. This is clearly
shown by the passage from Sackville J's judgment
set out
above<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[97]</a></sup> and by the recent
judgments in <i>Milfull v Terranora Lakes Country Club
Limited</i>,<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[98]</a></sup><i> Cook v Pasminco
Ltd</i>,<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[99]</a></sup><i> Batten v CTMS
Ltd</i><sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[100]</a></sup><i> </i>and <i>Hunter
Valley Community Investments Pty Ltd v
Bell</i>.<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[101]</a></sup> Whether each of
those three scenarios proposed by Beach are available through consolidation of
proceedings is not clear, especially
in light of the recent judgments of Kiefel
J in <i>Batten </i>and <i>Milfull</i>. Order 29 r 5 of the Federal Court
Rules provides that</p>
<blockquote>
where several proceedings are pending in the same Division, then, if it appears
to the Court:<br>
(a)	that some common question of law or fact arises in both or all of them; <br>
(b)	that the rights to relief claimed therein are in respect of, or arise out
of, the same transaction or series of transactions;
or<br>
(c)	that for some other reason it is desirable to make an order under this rule;
<br>
the Court may order those proceedings to be consolidated or may order them to be
tried at the same time or one immediately after
the other or may order them to
be stayed until after the determination of any of
them.<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[102]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
<i>Batten</i> Kiefel J indicated that in the proceedings before her:</p>
<blockquote>
the 1st applicant (and the group members he represents) does not have a claim
against the PCS companies or their directors, and the
2nd applicant (and his
group) has none against the 1st to 5th respondents. The proceedings cannot
therefore be continued as representative
proceedings.<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[103]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Her
Honour then considered whether it was appropriate to grant leave to join the
parties under O 6 r 2(b) of the Federal Court Rules.
This rule provides that two
or more persons may be joined as applicants in any proceeding where the Court
gives leave to do so.<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[104]</a></sup> Kiefel
J held that it was appropriate to exercise this power based on considerations
such as cost, delay and fairness. What happened
after Kiefel J delivered her
judgment in <i>Batten</i> was explained as follows by her Honour in
<i>Milfull</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
in <i>Batten v CTMS Ltd </i>... I ordered two separate representative
proceedings be treated as joined proceedings, on the basis that they shared a
common question
of fact. That order was set aside by a Full Court, with the
consent of the parties. The proceedings were later ordered to be heard
together.<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[105]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Kiefel
J explained why her earlier ruling in <i>Batten</i> was incorrect, as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
upon further reflection, it would not seem appropriate to apply the rule for
joinder, given that Part IVA ... makes express provision
for the circumstances
in which claims, other than those constituting the representative proceeding
itself, may be added to the proceeding
and for the procedures which are to be
followed. I refer in particular to ss 33Q, 33R and
33S.<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[106]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In order
to consider the cogency of Kiefel J's analysis it is necessary to consider the
provisions referred to by her Honour. Section
33Q(1) empowers the Court to give
directions in relation to the determination of issues which have been left
unresolved by the determination
of the common
issues.<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[107]</a></sup> Section 33Q(2) allows
the Court to establish sub-groups so as to deal with issues common to the claims
of some only of the group
members.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[108]</a></sup> Section 33R(1)
allows individual group members to appear in the class proceeding for the
purpose of determining an issue that relates
only to the claims of that
member.<sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[109]</a></sup> Section 33S comes
into play where an issue cannot properly or conveniently be dealt with under
s 33Q or s 33R. Section 33S(a) provides
that if the issue concerns
only the claim of a particular member, the Court may give directions relating to
the commencement and
conduct of a separate proceeding by that member; whilst
s 33S(b) provides that if the issue in question is common to the claims of
all members of a sub-group, the Court may give directions relating to the
commencement and conduct of a representative proceeding
in relation to the
claims of those members.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[110]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is submitted that Kiefel J's reliance on ss 33Q, 33R and 33S to justify
the inappropriateness of her reliance in <i>Batten</i> on O 6 r 2(b) is, with
respect, unpersuasive. None of those provisions of Part IVA deal with the issue
of joinder of parties which,
of course, is the topic with which that rule deals.
Furthermore, ss 33Q,<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[111]</a></sup> 33R
and 33S<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[112]</a></sup> empower the Court to
dispose of non-common issues only in respect of the parties bound by a properly
constituted Part IVA proceeding,
that is, a proceeding which complied from the
outset with the requirements of s 33C(1), which include, of course, the
<i>Philip Morris</i> principle. In a situation where there is, for instance, a
Part IVA proceeding ('proceeding A') by a group of persons ('group A')
against
respondent A and the question is whether, to these proceedings, can be joined
another group of persons ('group B') who have
claims against another respondent
('respondent B') ss 33Q, 33R and 33S can have no role to play. This is because
those provisions
may only be employed by the Court presiding over proceeding A
in relation to those who are bound by that proceeding and, as a result
of the
<i>Philip Morris </i>principle, proceeding A cannot encompass group B and
respondent B. Once the limited operation of these provisions is appreciated,
it
becomes clear why one of the provisions of Part IVA, s 33ZG(c)(iii),
expressly and unambiguously provides that 'except as otherwise
provided by this
Part, nothing in this Part affects ... the operation of any law relating to
joinder of parties'.</p>
<p>The reasoning in <i>Milfull</i>, if applied in future cases, is likely to
prevent the employment of the consolidation procedure in relation to each of the
three
scenarios depicted by Beach. If ss 33Q, 33R and 33S are sufficient, as
Kiefel J held, to displace the Court's general powers with
respect to joinder of
parties (despite the fact that Parliament sought to expressly save these powers
through s 33ZG(c)(iii)), then
a similar fate should logically be suffered
by the Court's general powers with respect to consolidation of proceedings. 
This should
logically follow in spite of the fact that, as with the joinder
powers, Parliament sought to expressly save these powers, through
the enactment
of s 33ZG(c)(iv).<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[113]</a></sup></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading278"></a><b>F	Alternative approaches to the application of the
</b><b><i>Philip Morris </i>principle</b></h3>
<p>Sections IIIA to IIIE above have sought to demonstrate that the requirement
that every applicant and group member have a claim against
every respondent has
highly undesirable consequences and is not, in any event, necessary. In this
section it will be submitted that,
if this interpretation of s 33C(1)(a) is
to remain,<sup><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[114]</a></sup> it should not be
applied in a restrictive manner, as was done by the Court in <i>Philip
Morris</i>; instead, the flexible approach evident in the judgment of a
differently constituted Full Federal Court in <i>King v GIO Australia Holdings
Ltd</i><sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[115]</a></sup> should be
followed.</p>
<p>In <i>Philip Morris</i>, when appearing before the Full Federal Court,
counsel for the applicants submitted that the primary judge's comments, set out
below,
provided an accurate statement of the case the applicants intended to
plead:</p>
<blockquote>
the applicants do not seek to make a product liability case, in which it would
be essential to relate the injury suffered by a particular
claimant to a
deficiency in the product of a particular manufacturer or distributor ... The
applicants' case is painted on a larger
canvas. They claim the three sets of
respondents&#8212;who, they say, at all relevant times dominated the Australian
retail cigarette
market&#8212;embarked individually and collectively on a course
of conduct designed to create a false community perception about
the risks
associated with cigarette smoking. If that claim can be made good, it would seem
not to matter that a particular claimant
smoked cigarettes manufactured by only
one of the respondents; indeed, logically, by none of them, although the present
claim is
not so
wide.<sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[116]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Sackville
J was of the view that the statement of claim lodged on behalf of the applicants
did not plead a case of collective conduct
on the part of all three respondents;
it was, instead, the conduct of one or more of the respondents which was said to
have influenced
the group members to smoke or continue to smoke the
cigarettes.<sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[117]</a></sup> His Honour then
considered what result would ensue if the statement of claim had clearly pleaded
that each class member was influenced
by the conduct of each respondent. He
concluded that</p>
<blockquote>
further pleading and endless management issues would be raised. Would it
possible to particularise such a case in a manner that makes
it clear how class
members are said to have been influenced by advertisements or public statements
they may never have seen? Is it
feasible to contemplate continuing
representative proceedings when the smoking history of and factors influencing
members of the
represented class are likely to vary so
substantially?<sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[118]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
first question posed by his Honour may be criticised for placing greater
importance on the procedural requirements contained in
s 33H than on the
crucial issue of whether a proceeding satisfies the requirements of
s 33C(1). As was clearly indicated by the High
Court in <i>Wong v Silkfield
Pty Ltd</i>,<sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[119]</a></sup> the requirements
for the originating process in a class action, set out in s 33H, are simply
designed to show that the threshold
requirements in s 33C(1) have been
met.<sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[120]</a></sup> It is also difficult to
see how the latter consideration canvassed by Sackville J could be relevant to
the question of compliance
with s 33C(1)(a). It would only be relevant to
the issue of whether the Court should exercise its discretion, under provisions
such
as s 33N, to order the discontinuance of a properly constituted class
suit.<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[121]</a></sup></p>
<p>Equally unpersuasive was, with respect, the approach of Hill and Spender JJ
in relation to the issue of whether the proceedings satisfied
s 33C(1)(a).
Their approach is accurately captured by the following passage from Hill J's
judgment:</p>
<blockquote>
it is impossible to conceive how a case could be pleaded, consistent with
instructions, which would allege that each and every applicant
class member
suffered loss or damage as a result of misleading and/or deceptive conduct of
every respondent as principal, or as a
result of negligence on the part of every
respondent as principal ... I share the view of Spender J as to the equal
impossibility
of its being suggested that each and every class member was caused
to smoke, discouraged from giving up or encouraged to continue
smoking as a
result of each lobbying effort being part of a single campaign to which each
company was a
party.<sup><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[122]</a></sup></blockquote><p>These
comments evince, with respect, an excessively narrow application of the
requirements of s 33C(1)(a) which is at odds with both
(a) the philosophy
underpinning Part IVA and with (b) the fact that s 33C(1)'s purpose is not
to authorise the Court to assess the
likelihood that the claims brought on
behalf of the class will
succeed.<sup><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[123]</a></sup> This fallacy in the
reasoning of their Honours becomes apparent when the judgment of a differently
constituted Full Federal Court
in <i>King </i>is considered.</p>
<p>The proceeding in <i>King </i>concerned advice provided to the shareholders
of GIO as to whether a takeover offer by AMP should have been accepted. The
class was
described as 'GIO shareholders who did not accept the AMP takeover
offer "by reason of the conduct ... of all (or alternatively,
any) of the
Respondents and who suffered loss as a
consequence"'.<sup><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[124]</a></sup> The use of the
alternative 'any' was relied upon by the respondents for the proposition that
the proceeding failed to comply with
s 33C(1)(a) in that it did not
disclose a claim by each group member against each respondent. Wilcox, Lehane
and Merkel JJ, in their
joint judgment, upheld the judgment of the trial judge
and rejected the argument of the
respondents<sup><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[125]</a></sup> on the following
grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
the alternative 'any' means that a person is a group member if he or she, as a
matter of fact, suffered loss as a result of the conduct
of <i>any
</i>respondent. This is necessary to cover the situation of a group member who,
although claiming against all respondents, only suffered
loss by reason of the
conduct of one of the respondents. That person is still to be regarded as a
group member and, accordingly,
is bound by the result.<br>
The fact that a person is ultimately adjudged to be entitled to succeed against
only one respondent, does not mean that a person
makes a claim against only that
respondent. There is a world of difference between a claim and success on the
claim.<sup><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[126]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
reasoning above is directly relevant to <i>Philip
Morris</i>.<sup><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[127]</a></sup> The fact that it
was highly likely that, once the claims of the class were adjudicated upon, it
would transpire that very few of
the class members in <i>Philip Morris</i> had
succeeded against each respondent was not relevant to the question of whether
every member of the class was claiming against
all
respondents.<sup><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[128]</a></sup> Furthermore, it
is submitted that Wilcox J's formulation of what the applicants in <i>Philip
Morris </i>needed to demonstrate, in order to succeed on the cause of action
that relied upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a></i> (Cth), is to
be preferred to that provided by the Full Court. His Honour concluded that</p>
<blockquote>
The claimant would establish a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> claim if he or she established:<br>
(a)	the publication by a particular respondent or respondents of misleading
information; <br>
(b)	that this information caused the claimant to commence, or continue, to smoke
cigarettes; and<br>
(c)	that such smoking&#8212;that is, the smoking caused by the misleading
conduct of a particular respondent or respondents&#8212;caused
the claimant to
contract a particular disease. <br>
For the purposes of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> claim ... it would seem unnecessary for a
claimant to establish an identicality between the respondent (if only one) whose
promotional
material caused him or her to commence or continue smoking and the
respondent whose product caused the relevant
disease.<sup><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[129]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
Federal Court will soon be provided with the opportunity, in <i>Bray v F
Hoffman-La Roche Ltd</i>,<sup><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[130]</a></sup> to
decide upon the most appropriate approach to the application of the <i>Philip
Morris </i>principle. In <i>Bray </i>the applicant commenced a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>
proceeding against 13 respondents claiming damages in respect of an
international price fixing and market sharing arrangement in
respect of a number
of vitamin products. The group members were described in the pleadings as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
persons who between 5 March 1992 and 5 July 1999 purchased in Australia all or
some of vitamins ... either directly or indirectly
by way of purchase of foods,
beverages, vitamin pills or capsules or other products which contained one or
more class vitamins <i>supplied by one or more of the
respondents</i>.<sup><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[131]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
highlighted part of the passage above bears some similarity to the pleadings in
<i>Philip Morris</i>.<sup><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[132]</a></sup> In a
judgment handed down in March 2002, Merkel J, the trial judge in <i>Bray</i>,
indicated that he has not yet had an opportunity 'to consider any questions
concerning the pleadings [and] ... questions arising
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part

<h2>
<a name="Heading323"></a><b>IV	THE CLAIMS MUST BE IN RESPECT OF, OR ARISE OUT
OF, THE SAME, SIMILAR OR RELATED CIRCUMSTANCES</b></h2>
<p>The inclusion of the term 'related' in
s 33C(1)(c)<sup><a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[134]</a></sup> tends to
suggest that this provision was not intended to place, in the path of potential
representative parties, a significant barrier.
This impression is confirmed by
s 33C(2)(b) which makes it clear that a representative proceeding may be
commenced whether or not
the proceeding:</p>
<blockquote>
(i)	is concerned with separate contracts or transactions between the respondent
in the proceeding and individual group members; or<br>
(ii)	involves separate acts or omissions of the respondent done or omitted to be
done in relation to individual group
members.<sup><a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[135]</a></sup></blockquote><p>As
was indicated by the High Court, 'the broadening provisions in subs (2) of
s 33C emphasise the width of the entitlement conferred
by s 33C(1) to
commence a representative
proceeding'.<sup><a name="fnB137" href="#fn137">[136]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>Zhang v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic
Affairs</i>,<sup><a name="fnB138" href="#fn138">[137]</a></sup> French J
outlined the parameters of s 33C(1)(b). His analysis, set out below, has
been referred to with approval by the High
Court<sup><a name="fnB139" href="#fn139">[138]</a> </sup>and by the Full Federal
Court:<sup><a name="fnB140" href="#fn140">[139]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
[s 33C(1)(b)] contemplates a relationship between the circumstances of each
claimant and specifies three sufficient relationships
of widening ambit. Each
claim is based on a set of facts which may include acts, omissions, contracts,
transactions and other events.
As appears from s 33C(2), the circumstances
giving rise to claims by potential group members do not fall outside the scope
of the
legislation simply because they involve separate contracts or
transactions between individual group members and the respondent or
involved
separate acts or omissions of the respondent done or omitted to be done in
relation to individual group members.<br>
The outer limits of eligibility for participation in representative proceedings
are defined by reference to claims in respect of
or arising out of related
circumstances. The word 'related' suggests a connection wider than identity or
similarity. In each case
there is a threshold judgment on whether the
similarities or relationships between circumstances giving rise to each claim
are sufficient
to merit their grouping as a representative proceeding. At the
margins, these will be practical judgments informed by the policy
and purpose of
the legislation. At some point along the spectrum of possible classes of claim,
the relationship between the circumstances
of each claim will be incapable of
definition at a sufficient level of particularity, or too tenuous or remote to
attract the application
of the
legislation.<sup><a name="fnB141" href="#fn141">[140]</a></sup></blockquote><p>French
J held that the proceedings before him adhered to s 33C(1)(b) despite the
fact that 'the relationship between the circumstances
of each group member is
defined by a few common integers which leaves room for considerable diversity in
circumstances which might
support individual claims to set aside the review
decisions'.<sup><a name="fnB142" href="#fn142">[141]</a></sup> The Court's
conclusion was based on 'the need for a purposive approach to the construction
of s 33C(1)(b)'.<sup><a name="fnB143" href="#fn143">[142]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a far more restrictive construction of s 33C(1)(b) was
embraced by Sackville and Spender JJ in <i>Philip
Morris</i>.<sup><a name="fnB144" href="#fn144">[143]</a></sup> The former
justice explained that:</p>
<blockquote>
The representative procedure provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> ... is plainly designed to
accommodate a case where the applicants and group members rely on a series of
related but not identical
transactions, such as similar representations being
made separately to different individuals: <i>Grouped Proceedings</i>, para 134.
But this case involves vastly different forms of advertising, promotions and
other public statements by the three respondents
over four decades. It is true
that the applicants allege that the various public statements&#8212;ranging from
a single brand name
on a billboard at a sporting match to a submission to a
Senate Committee&#8212;all make substantially the same representations. Yet
to
test that allegation it would be necessary to examine each of the public
statements made over four decades in its own context,
having regard to the
characteristics of the likely audience. This is a far cry from the kind of case
envisaged by the [ALRC] as falling
within the purview of the representative
procedure.<sup><a name="fnB145" href="#fn145">[144]</a></sup></blockquote><p>With
respect, Sackville J appears erroneously to have injected into the task of
ascertaining whether s 33C(1)(b) has been complied
with, considerations
pertaining to whether the class action device would provide the most effective
and efficient vehicle for the
resolution of the legal dispute in question. These
considerations are relevant to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the
Federal
Court by s 33N but ought not to be entertained in the context of
s 33C(1). As was clearly indicated by the High Court in
<i>Silkfield</i>,</p>
<blockquote>
[s 33C(1)] is concerned with the commencement, not subsequent conduct, of
litigation using the procedures provided in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
IVA.</a><sup><a name="fnB146" href="#fn146">[145]</a></sup> ...<br>
The circumstance that proceedings which pass the threshold requirement of
s 33C may later be terminated as representative proceedings,
by order made
under s 33N, confirms rather than denies ... a [broad] construction of
s 33C(1).<sup><a name="fnB147" href="#fn147">[146]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Accordingly,
once considerations such as the number and different types of representations
made by the tobacco companies and the period
over which those representations
were made are put to one side, it becomes clear that the conduct of the various
respondents challenged
by the applicants essentially entailed the making of, as
was conceded by Sackville J, 'substantially the same
representations'.<sup><a name="fnB148" href="#fn148">[147]</a></sup> It is
therefore difficult to understand why the facts in <i>Philip Morris</i> did not
constitute an illustration of one of the scenarios which the ALRC envisaged
would satisfy this prerequisite, namely, similar
representations being made
separately to different
individuals.<sup><a name="fnB149" href="#fn149">[148]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sackville J's narrow construction of s 33C(1)(b) is also not in
accordance with, and should not be preferred to, the approach of Einfeld
J in
<i>Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
I am not convinced that mere volume of evidence disqualifies a proceeding from
being undertaken as a class action. Nor in my experience
has complexity ever
been a reason for failure to determine an issue. I am also not persuaded that
substantial differences in individual
circumstances disqualify a case from being
a class action. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> anticipates that individuals in the group will have
differing circumstances ... As far as group actions provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt IVA</a> are
concerned, what is relevant is similarity not
difference.<sup><a name="fnB150" href="#fn150">[149]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Spender
J also concluded that s 33C(1)(b) had not been satisfied by the class in
<i>Philip Morris</i>. He explained the reasons for this conclusion by furnishing
the following hypothetical scenarios:</p>
<blockquote>
suppose one company, Widget Retailing Ltd ('Widget') had distributed its goods
by road throughout Australia over four decades. Suppose
further that various
individual members of the public were injured by the negligent driving of
different employees of Widget, as
follows: A in Melbourne in 1960; B in
Townsville in 1974; C in Sydney in 1984; and ... Z in Perth in 1996. Claims for
damages by
each injured individual against Widget, in my opinion, would not
properly be described as claims arising out of the same, similar
or related
circumstances. This is so, even if it be the position that on each occasion the
negligence consisted of, say, driving
at an excessive speed. In my opinion, a
representative proceeding against Widget could not properly be brought under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
IVA</a> ... on those assumed facts. The ALRC reports (which led to the introduction
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt IVA)</a> do not suggest that it was intended that such disparate claims could
properly be brought in representative proceedings.<br>
Closer to the present case, if each of A, B, C ... and Z had suffered loss or
damage in reliance on a particular deceptive advertisement
by Widget at the
times and places posed, with the advertisements in each case being different
(including, for instance, advertising
different products), but each one being
part of Widget's campaign over the years to persuade people to buy its products,
again the
claims, in my opinion, would not arise out of the 'same, similar or
related circumstances', within the proper meaning of those words
in
s 33C(1)(b).<sup><a name="fnB151" href="#fn151">[150]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
author is not as confident, as Spender J was, that the two scenarios above would
not have been seen by the ALRC as satisfying
the prerequisites for the
commencement of group litigation. It should not be forgotten that s 33C(2)
was based upon a specific recommendation
of the ALRC. The ALRC explained that
without a provision such as s 33C(2) there was a risk that the same,
similar or related circumstances
requirement might be interpreted in a way that
'would prevent the grouping of claims if the persons affected were involved in
different
transactions or series of transactions even if those transactions
involved similar or related acts of the
respondent'.<sup><a name="fnB152" href="#fn152">[151]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the examples provided by the ALRC, of situations which
could be dealt with through the group litigation model
it was proposing, could
possibly be regarded as involving circumstances as disparate as those covered by
Spender J's examples. The
illustration provided by the ALRC was that of
litigation encompassing 'approximately 1500 Australian women ... involved in a
claim
against AH Robins' Australian subsidiary for injuries arising from the use
of the Dalkon Shield birth control
device'.<sup><a name="fnB153" href="#fn153">[152]</a></sup> Similarly, the use
made by Senator Tate, of the litigation brought by sufferers of
medically-acquired HIV virus, as an excellent
example of the intended impact of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>, tends to indicate that s 33C(1)(b) was not intended to constitute
a significant hurdle for representative plaintiffs. In fact, the
claims of the
various applicants in the proceedings referred to by Senator Tate involved
substantially different
circumstances.<sup><a name="fnB154" href="#fn154">[153]</a></sup></p>
<p>The interpretation and application of s 33C(1)(b) implemented by the
Full Federal Court in <i>Philip Morris</i> have the potential to drastically
curtail the use of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> regime by those wishing to bring multiple
respondents suits.<sup><a name="fnB155" href="#fn155">[154]</a></sup> As was
perceptively noted by Beach,</p>
<blockquote>
the Court appeared [to assume] that, to satisfy the requirements of
sub-paragraph (b), an applicant had to plead a case which related
to the injury
suffered by a particular claimant to either:<br>
(a)	the use by that claimant of a product produced by each and every respondent;
or<br>
(b)	conduct by each and every respondent which was directed towards that
particular claimant and to which that particular claimant
was exposed. <br>
On one view, it is arguable that in making these assumptions the Court gave
s 33C(1)(b) a more restrictive operation than its plain
words warrant and
placed a gloss on the
paragraph.<sup><a name="fnB156" href="#fn156">[155]</a></sup></blockquote><h2>
<a name="Heading375"></a><b>V	THE CLAIMS MUST GIVE RISE TO A SUBSTANTIAL COMMON
ISSUE OF LAW OR FACT</b></h2>
<p>In <i>Silkfield</i> a majority of the Federal Court held that in order to
comply with s 33C(1)(c) the representative parties were required to satisfy
the Court that determination of the issue common to the claims of all group
members was likely to have a major impact on the conduct
and outcome of the
litigation by resolving wholly or to any significant degree the claims of all
group members.<sup><a name="fnB157" href="#fn157">[156]</a></sup> On appeal,
however, a different view was adopted by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and
Callinan JJ of the High Court:</p>
<blockquote>
Clearly, the purpose of the enactment of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt IVA</a> was not to narrow access to the
new form of representative proceedings beyond that which applied under [the
traditional representative
action procedures] ... This suggests that, when used
to identify the threshold requirements of s 33C(1), "substantial" does not
indicate
that which is "large" or "of special significance" or would "have a
major impact on the ... litigation" but, rather, is directed
to issues which are
"real or of
substance".<sup><a name="fnB158" href="#fn158">[157]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
ruling of the High Court in <i>Silkfield </i>has rendered compliance with
s 33C(1)(c) a reasonably easy
task.<sup><a name="fnB159" href="#fn159">[158]</a></sup> However, as was the
case with sub-ss (a) and (b) of s 33C(1), the application of sub-s (c) to
multiple respondents suits has generated
not insignificant problems for
representative plaintiffs. In fact, s 33C(1)(c) has been held to require
that the claims of all applicants
and group members against all respondents must
give rise to at least one substantial common issue of fact or
law.<sup><a name="fnB160" href="#fn160">[159]</a></sup> The problems which this
requirement can generate were evident in <i>Hunter
Valley</i>.<sup><a name="fnB161" href="#fn161">[160]</a></sup> </p>
<p>This proceeding related to the Hunter Valley Community Investments Limited
Partnership ('the Partnership') which was established as
part of a scheme which
was promoted to potential investors as providing a tax-effective form of
investment suitable for wage and
salary earners. When the expected tax benefits
did not eventuate, a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> proceeding was commenced on behalf of the partners
of the Partnership. There were four respondents to the class suit: Mr Bell ('the
first respondent'), the promoter of the scheme; and Lawler Davidson ('the second
respondent'), Lawler Davidson Partners ('the third
respondent') and Walker &amp;
Co ('the fourth respondent'), which are all accounting firms. According to the
applicants, there was
one common question of law or fact which related to the
claims of all applicants against all respondents.</p>
<p>In order to understand this common issue, a brief description of the claims
advanced by the applicants is necessary. It was alleged
that Bell, Lawler
Davidson and Lawler Davidson Partners made representations with respect to the
scheme that breached <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> </i>(Cth).
Lawler Davidson and Lawler Davidson Partners provided accounting services to the
applicants for the years 1992 to 1995 and
it was alleged that in providing such
services to the applicants, the second and third respondents breached their
retainer with,
and/or duty of care to, each of the applicants. Walker &amp; Co
was retained to audit the financial statements of Bell, as General
Partner of
the Partnership ('the Retainer'). It was alleged that Walker &amp; Co breached
the Retainer and/or breached its duty of
care to each of the applicants as
partners in the Partnership by failing to advise the applicants that such
financial statements
were not a true and fair view of the financial performance
of the Partnership and that the applicants should not rely on the financial
statements in their current form.</p>
<p>The common issue of law or fact identified by the applicants was whether the
failure to advise on the part of Walker &amp; Co, as
outlined above, 'resulted
in each of the Applicants losing the opportunity to have discovered in May 1995
the true nature of the
misleading and deceptive conduct, breaches of retainer
and/or negligence on the part of [Mr Bell], [Lawler Davidson] and [Lawler
Davidson Partners]'.<sup><a name="fnB162" href="#fn162">[161]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Court, however, held that the paragraph above did not identify</p>
<blockquote>
an issue of fact or law common to the claims of all applicants against all
respondents. In the first place, the proposed statement
of claim does not allege
that a consequence of Walker &amp; Co's breach of retainer or duty was to
deprive the applicants of the
opportunity to have discovered in May 1995 'the
true nature of the misleading and deceptive conduct ...' of Mr Bell, Lawler
Davidson
and Lawler Davidson Partners. In any event, [the alleged common issue]
identifies the issue as whether the applicants, by reason
of Walker &amp; Co's
breach of retainer or duty, lost that opportunity. That issue is not common to
all claims of the applicants
against the other respondents, let alone the
unpleaded claims of group
members.<sup><a name="fnB163" href="#fn163">[162]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
requirement of an issue of fact or law common to the claims of all applicants
and group members against all respondents also proved
to be too difficult to
satisfy in other class
proceedings.<sup><a name="fnB164" href="#fn164">[163]</a></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading397"></a><b>VI	CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p>As was recently noted by Sackville J, 'it is becoming increasingly frequent
for representative proceedings to be brought by more than
one representative
applicant against more than one
respondent'.<sup><a name="fnB165" href="#fn165">[164]</a> </sup>Consequently,
the question of how accessible the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> regime has been, to those wishing to
act on behalf of a group of persons with similar legal grievances against
multiple respondents,
is of considerable importance in assessing the general
operation and impact of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> over the last ten years.</p>
<p>The analysis developed in this article has revealed the existence of
significant barriers to the commencement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> proceedings against more
than one person.<sup><a name="fnB166" href="#fn166">[165]</a></sup> It has been
shown that this scenario is the result of a number of factors. The most
significant of these factors has been the fact
that s 33C(1)(a), as
construed by the Full Federal Court in <i>Philip Morris</i>, requires each
applicant and group member to be claiming against each respondent. This has
resulted in an inability to bring within
the one <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> proceeding claims
brought on behalf of various groups of persons against various respondents, even
where the causes of action against
the various respondents were linked by
similar or common issues of fact or law. </p>
<p>This scenario is difficult to reconcile with the clear intendment of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
IVA</a> regime, of allowing groups of related claims to be determined, so far as
possible, in one representative proceeding. This state of
affairs becomes
apparent when one compares the <i>Philip Morris</i> principle with O 6 r 13 of
the Federal Court Rules.<sup><a name="fnB167" href="#fn167">[166]</a></sup> This
rule governs the so-called traditional representative action
procedure<sup><a name="fnB168" href="#fn168">[167]</a></sup> and provides that
</p>
<blockquote>
where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceeding the proceeding
may be commenced, and, unless the Court otherwise
orders, continued, by or
against any one or more of them as representing all or as representing all
except one or more of
them.<sup><a name="fnB169" href="#fn169">[168]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Part IVA
was intended to allow the bringing of group litigation in circumstances which
would fall outside the purview of the traditional
representative action
procedure.<sup><a name="fnB170" href="#fn170">[169]</a> </sup>It is, therefore,
disappointing and ironic that, at least in relation to multiple respondents
suits, Part IVA operates in a more restrictive
manner than Order 6 rule 13. In
fact, in <i>SZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs</i> Lehane
J of the Federal Court recently noted that</p>
<blockquote>
although it is by no means clear that claims are asserted by all the represented
persons against all respondents, there is no explicit
requirement under ... FCR
O6 r 13 ... that all applicants claim against all respondents (compare
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(a)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/" class="autolink_findacts">Federal Court of Australia Act</a>
</i>...).<sup><a name="fnB171" href="#fn171">[170]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
<i>Philip Morris </i>principle is also difficult to reconcile with the class
proceedings that were allowed to be brought by the Federal Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a>
in <i>McMullin</i>, <i>Ryan </i>and
<i>Schneider</i>.<sup><a name="fnB172" href="#fn172">[171]</a></sup> Those
cases, and the approach of courts in Ontario and British Columbia, substantiate
the view that permitting one class proceeding
to encompass applicants and/or
group members who do not have claims against all respondents need not equate to
proceedings which
are either unmanageable or provide unfair advantages to the
plaintiffs. </p>
<p>Moreover, if abandoning the <i>Philip Morris </i>principle were to lead, in
some circumstances, to the unsatisfactory scenarios noted in the preceding
sentence, the provisions which
were mentioned in Section IIIE above&#8212;<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33q.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss
33Q</a>,<sup><a name="fnB173" href="#fn173">[172]</a></sup> 33R and
33S&#8212;provide the Court with adequate powers to deal with those
problems.<sup><a name="fnB174" href="#fn174">[173]</a></sup> Furthermore,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33zg.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33ZG(b)</a> provides that nothing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> affects 'the Court's powers
under provisions other than this Part, for example, its powers in relation to a
proceeding in which no
reasonable cause of action is disclosed or that is
oppressive, vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of the process of the
Court'.<sup><a name="fnB175" href="#fn175">[174]</a></sup> But perhaps the most
important provision is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33zf.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33ZF(1)</a> which empowers the Federal Court to make
'any order ... [it] thinks appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is
done in the
proceedings'.<sup><a name="fnB176" href="#fn176">[175]</a></sup> If
those powers are not sufficient in a given class action, the Court may terminate
the representative nature of the proceedings
pursuant to the power conferred
upon it by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33n.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33N.</a><sup><a name="fnB177" href="#fn177">[176]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Philip Morris </i>principle has been accompanied by a recent refusal,
on the part of the Federal Court, to allow representative plaintiffs to employ
procedures, such as the joinder procedure (and presumably the consolidation
procedure), to achieve, to some extent and indirectly,
the result which the
<i>Philip Morris </i>principle does not authorise directly. The difficulties
faced by those wishing to bring multiple respondents suits have been exacerbated
by a narrow interpretation of the concept of identical, similar or related
circumstances by the Federal Court in recent cases and
by an interpretation of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s33c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33C(1)(c)</a> which entails the need to demonstrate the existence of a
substantial common issue of fact or law in relation to the claims of all
members
of the group against all respondents.</p>
<p>In light of the picture depicted above, it does not appear unreasonable to
conclude that, unless the conduct of more than one person
that is being
challenged by a group of aggrieved persons entails a single transaction, act or
event;<sup><a name="fnB178" href="#fn178">[177]</a></sup> a single

ALR 515</a>, 543&#8211;4  (Wilcox J): </p>
<p>bearing in mind that, in drafting the Bill eventually presented to
Parliament, the Government departed from the Commission's model
in several
important respects, it is a large assumption to ascribe to the Government all
the Commission's views. Although the Commission's
report undoubtedly provides
relevant background to the Government's proposal, on matters of detail the
Government must be allowed
to speak for itself.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn34" href="#fnB34">[33]</a></sup> 	Lawyers for applicants in
pt IVA suits have attacked Sackville J's reliance on the ALRC's report upon the
following grounds: 'with
respect, the text of Part IVA itself, which provides
that once the threshold requirements are met, an action may be brought, does
not
require and is in fact inconsistent with the use Sackville J sought to make of
the [ALRC] report' (Gordon and Nichols, above
n 1, 10).</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn35" href="#fnB35">[34]</a></sup> 	See the quote accompanying
note 19 above.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn36" href="#fnB36">[35]</a></sup> 	 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20149%20ALR%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 149 ALR 45</a>, 48. It
is fascinating to note that there is a difference of opinion among commentators
as to how liberally s 33C(1) has been construed
and applied by the Federal
Court. See, for instance, Gordon and Nichols, above n 1, 8: '[there has been] an
overly-rigorous reading
of the threshold requirements allowing representative
proceedings to be commenced, resulting in an outcome inconsistent with the
legislative intent'; and Freeman, above n 4, 109. Clark and Harris, on the other
hand, have indicated that 'the threshold requirements
[of s 33C(1)] have
been liberally interpreted by the courts such that they are easily satisfied in
practice': above n 4, 307.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn37" href="#fnB37">[36]</a></sup> 	This is essentially the
interpretation advocated by Beach. However, he argues that this interpretation
can co-exist with the <i>Philip Morris </i>principle: Beach, above n 5, 23. But,
as is demonstrated in Section IIIE below, this latter proposition is incorrect.
The <i>Philip Morris</i> principle and the interpretation of s 33C(1)(a)
advanced by Beach are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p><sup><a name="fn44" href="#fnB44">[43]</a></sup> 	It is true that various
opportunities to produce appropriate pleadings were provided to the applicants.
But these opportunities
were granted to the applicants by the trial judge,
before the applicants were 'exposed' to the significantly more restrictive
approach
adopted by the members of the Full Court. If, after having had the
benefit of the guidance provided in the judgments of the Full
Court as to what
was required, the applicants continued, in the view of their Honours, to provide
pleadings which displayed a failure
to comply with s 33C(1) then, and only
then, would the Court have been entitled, in the author's view, to put an end to
the pt IVA
suit.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn45" href="#fnB45">[44]</a></sup> 	Gordon and Nichols have

<p>whilst people can say, rather facetiously, that any individual who has a
right can exercise that right, we know that that is not the
reality; the reality
is that ordinary people, as consumers or injured workers, for example, are not
able to exercise their rights
in the courts as more well-to-do people are able
to. This legislation seeks to enable those people who have a common cause of
action
to club together so that they are able to have a matter litigated and,
hopefully, result in a satisfactory outcome.</p>

<p>there is a difficulty in representative proceedings being brought where some
of the respondents are what may be called principal offenders
by virtue of
breaches of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a></i> committed by those
respondents on the one hand and others have an accessory liability on the other.
That problem is compounded where
the possibility arises that the so-called
common issue involves in one case one group of respondents as principals and
another group
of respondents with accessory liability and in another a quite
different group of respondents as principals and another differently
constituted
group of respondents with accessory liability ... The difficulties are both
legal and practical and would suggest that
it would be preferable that each case
be separately pleaded and tried, rather than an attempt be made to combine each

because it identifies the individuals entitled to notice,

actions have an important and valuable role to play by affording
access to
justice to many who could never in their wildest dreams hope to litigate
individually ... On the issue of whether class
actions have been a good thing
for the citizenry of Canada, if the 'proof of the pudding is in the eating' one
could ask the class
members who shared in the proceeds of the class actions
settled or litigated to date (eg, the ... $140 million recovery in the vanishing
premium cases and the $1.5 billion recovery in the Hepatitis C litigation),
keeping in mind that without a class action regime, it
is unlikely that any of
this money would ever have been recovered in Canada. On the other hand, there is
little if any evidence to
date of the 'successful' use of class actions as a
form of litigation blackmail. </p>

presiding over class actions in Canada and the US to consider the merits of the
litigation, as part of the
process of determining whether the suit should be

<p>the Quebec regime requires the certification judge to consider the merits of
the claim in deciding a certification application ...

<p><sup><a name="fn168" href="#fnB168">[167]</a></sup> 	The differences between
the class action procedure and the traditional representative action procedure
have been described as follows:</p>
<p>modern class action statutes elaborate and improve upon the 'representative
action' procedure. Like the historic action, in a modern
class action a
representative plaintiff conducts the proceeding on behalf of other persons.
However, a class member's claim need
only be similar to the representative
plaintiff's claim; it need not be exactly the same. Here again, all members of
the class are
bound by the outcome on the common issues. However, provision is
made for the formation of subclasses and the separate resolution
of issues
relating to individual class members in addition to the resolution of issues
common to the main class or a subclass. A
number of statutory safeguards and an
expanded role for the court help to ensure that the interests of the class
members are protected.</p>

these proceedings, to represent the sub-groups.

that the applicant may bring an application for
directions concerning the sub-groups already identified and as to their

them struck out.</p>

<p>the kind of case that can best be run as a representative proceeding is one
arising out of a 'mass wrong', ie, out of a single act,
omission or course of
conduct or the same act, omission or course of conduct repeatedly made or
engaged in. </p>
<p>This concept of a pt IVA case was essentially based on their Honours'
extremely narrow construction of s 33C(1)(c); a construction
which, as was
shown in Section V above, was unequivocally rejected by the High Court.</p>

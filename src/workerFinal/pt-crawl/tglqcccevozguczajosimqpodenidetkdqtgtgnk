Feldman (1926-1987)</h2><img style="width: 64px; height: 64px; float: left;" alt="Morton Feldman composer" src="images/feldman_composer_page.jpg" />Morton
Feldman was one of the most significant composers of his generation,
considered by many a genius. A truly original voice, he composed music
of a still, tranquil quality that never stated itself in the same way
twice and contained little melodic movement. "I like that particular
type of music that does not push," Feldman, citing Mozart as one of the
composers he most admired. In his early works Feldman, who preferred
instinctive methods over traditional compositional "rhetoric," wrote in
graphic notation, using nontraditional symbols to represent rhythm,
pitch, and dynamics.&nbsp;Later, Feldman gave prescribed pitches, but
left the rhythm to be determined by the performers. Feldman, however,
is best known for his later works. These were fully notated,
predominantly quiet, free from dramatic gestures, and frequently
written for unusual groups of instruments. Some were very long in
duration, such as the six-hour String Quartet No. 2 from 1983.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">- &nbsp;Laura Hightower @ musicianguide.com</span><br /></div><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">COMPOSITIONS</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

border=0><tr><td><img src = "facepain.gif" align = left hspace=20>You may
not like it, but we need pain. Pain acts as a warning system that protects
you.  Pain says, "Warning, Warning....stop what you doing and do something
else". For example, if you have your hand on a hot stove, pain tells you
to stop touching the stove and remove your hand.  In this way, pain
protects your body from injury (or further injury if you have already hurt
yourself).  Pain also helps healing...because an injury hurts, you rest.
<P>

<img src = "facepain.gif" align = right>There are some people who are born
WITHOUT the sense of pain. These people have a rare condition called
"congenital insensitivity to pain".  Their nervous systems are not
equipped to detect painful information.  You may think this is a good
thing....it is NOT.  Without the ability to detect painful events, you
would continue to cause injury to yourself.  For example, if you broke a
bone in your arm, you might continue using the arm because it did not
hurt. You could cause further injury to your arm.  People with congenital
insensitivity to pain usually have many injuries like pressure sores,
damaged joints and even missing or damaged fingers!<P>

So, what kind of things in the outside world can cause pain?  Events that
cause reactions are called <font color = red>stimuli</font>.  Stimuli are
painful when they damage tissues or threaten to damage tissue.  Pain is
nature's way of telling the brain about injury to the body.  Painful
stimuli can be divided into several types:</td></tr></table><P>

A toothache?  A broken bone?<P>

Ok..now we know the "stimuli" that may cause pain.  How do these stimuli
activate the nervous system?  There are specialized <font color =
red>"receptors"</font> in the skin and internal organs that are sensitive
to stimuli that are painful.  These receptors are called <font color =
red> "nociceptors"</font> and are free nerve endings connected to small
diameter myelinated A and unmyelinated C nerve fibers - these are the
nerve fibers that are LACKING in people with congenital insensitivity to
pain (here is <a href = "cv.html">more information</A> about nerve
fibers).  Nociception, then, is the response of the nervous system to
painful stimulation.  When the nociceptors detect a nociceptive stimulus,
they send a message to the spinal cord.  <P>

A famous theory concerning how pain works is called the <font color =
red>Gate Control Theory</font> devised by Patrick Wall and Ronald Melzack
in 1965.  This theory states that pain is a function of the balance
between the information traveling into the spinal cord through large nerve
fibers and information traveling into the spinal cord through small nerve
fibers. Remember, large nerve fibers carry non-nociceptive information and
small nerve fibers carry nociceptive information.  If the relative amount
of activity is greater in large nerve fibers, there should be little or no
pain.  However, if there is more activity in small nerve fibers, then
there will be pain.  Here is what the gate control theory looks
like:</td>

Control Theory</center></font><center><img src =
"./gif/gate.gif"></center> <center>I = "Inhibitory Interneuron";  P =
"Projection Neuron"<br> - = inhibition (blocking); + = excitation
(activation)</center><p> Let's go through the theory step by step:<P> <ol>
<li>Without any stimulation, both large and small nerve fibers are quiet
and the inhibitory interneuron (I) blocks the signal in the projection
neuron (P) that connects to the brain.  The "gate is closed" and therefore
NO PAIN.<P> <li>With non-painful stimulation, large nerve fibers are
activated primarily.  This activates the projection neuron (P), BUT it
ALSO activates the inhibitory interneuron (I) which then BLOCKS the signal
in the projection neuron (P) that connects to the brain.  The "gate is
closed" and therefore NO PAIN.<P> <li>With pain stimulation, small nerve
fibers become active.  They activate the projection neurons (P) and BLOCK
the inhibitory interneuron (I).  Because activity of the inhibitory
interneuron is blocked, it CANNOT block the output of the projection
neuron that connects with the brain. The "gate is open", therefore, <font
size = +2><font color = red>PAIN!!</font></font>

<td> Although the gate control theory has
support from some experiments and does explain some observations seen in
pain patients during therapy, it does not explain everything.  However,
think of this...what is one of the first things you do after you bump your
head or pinch a finger by accident?  You probably rub it and it feels
better, right?  Could this be explained by the gate control theory?  Well,
rubbing your bumped head or pinched finger would activate non-nociceptive
touch signals carried into the spinal cord by large nerve fibers. 
According to the theory, the activity in the large nerve fibers would
activate the inhibitory interneuron that would then block the projection
neuron and therefore block the pain.<p>

From the spinal cord, the messages go directly to several places in the
brain including the thalamus, midbrain and reticular formation.<p>

Some brain regions that receive nociceptive information are involved in
perception and emotion.  Also, some areas of the brain connect back to the
spinal cord - these connections can change or modify information
that is coming into the brain.  In fact, this is one way that the brain
can REDUCE pain.  Two areas of the brain that are involved in reducing
pain are the <font color = red>periaqueductal gray (PAG)</font> and the
<font color = red>nucleus raphe magnus</font>.  Neurosurgeons have
implanted electrical stimulating electrodes near the PAG of some patients
with severe pain - a small electrical shock through these electrodes can
relieve pain in some patients!!</td></tr></table> <P>

      <p><b><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Natural History</font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        </font></b><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Ball pythons 
        (<i>Python regius</i>) are found at the edges of the forest lands of Central 
        and Western Africa. They are equally comfortable on the ground and in 
        trees. They are crepuscular, active around dawn and dusk. Called royal 
        pythons in Europe, here in the United States we call them &quot;balls&quot; 
        due to their habit of curling themselves up into a tight ball when they 
        are nervous, their heads pulled firmly into the center. Like most pythons, 
        ball pythons are curious and gentle snakes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Ball pythons typically 
        reach 4 feet (1.2 m) in length; occasionally there are specimens that 
        reach 5 feet (1.5 m). When properly fed, their bodies become nicely rounded. 
        Like all pythons and boas, ball pythons have anal spurs. These single 
        claws appearing on either side of the vent are the vestigial remains of 
        the hind legs snakes lost during their evolution from lizard to snake 
        millions of years ago. Males have longer spurs than do the females; males 
        also have smaller heads than the females.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Ball pythons, like 
        all pythons and boas, devour a variety of prey in the wild - amphibians, 
        lizards, other snakes, birds and small mammals. They do not eat mice in 
        the wild, however, and do not recognize the mice we offer them as being 
        something edible. Thus, imported wild-caught ball pythons tend to be very 
        picky eaters, at least initially, and drive their owners to distraction 
        in their attempts to get them to eat something.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Ball pythons are reputed 
          to be able to go for extended periods of time without food; wild-caught 
          ball pythons have gone for a year or more without food until finally 
          enticed to eat lizards and other snakes.<i> This is not a healthy trait 
          and must not be a reason for selecting this species</i>. This should 
          also make you suspicious when a pet store tells you that their ball 
          pythons are eating well.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Buying captive-born 
        ball pythons reduces the stress on the threatened populations in the wild 
        and helps ensure you will get a healthy, established eater and a snake 
        already used to contact with humans. Buying from a reputable breeder will 
        ensure that you will get the help and advice you need to assure that your 
        ball feels comfortable and secure enough to eat after you bring it home 
        and let it get settled for a week or so.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> With the increased 
        popularity of reptiles as pets there is increased pressure on wild populations. 
        In addition to the more than 60,000 ball pythons that are imported annually, 
        ball pythons are killed for food and their skin is used for leather in 
        their native land. For some reason, despite their low reproduction rate, 
        wild ball pythons are the least expensive pythons on the market, generally 
        wholesaling for under ten dollars. Imported ball pythons also harbor several 
        different types of parasites which may go unnoticed by the novice snake 
        owner. All around, it is better to buy a captive-born hatchling or an 
        established, well-feeding juvenile, sub-adult or adult than an imported 
        ball of any age.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> In captivity, young 
        ball pythons will grow about a foot a year during the first three years. 
        They will reach sexual maturity in three to five years. The longest living 
        ball python on record was over 48 years old when it died. Egg-layers, 
        female ball pythons encircle their four to ten eggs, remaining with then 
        from the time they are laid until they hatch. During this three month 
        period, they will not leave the eggs and will not eat.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><b>Getting Started</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Selecting Your Ball 
        Python<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Choose an 
        animal that has clear firm skin, rounded body shape, clean vent, clear 
        eyes, and who actively flicks its tongue around when handled. All ball 
        pythons are naturally shy about having their heads touched or handled 
        by strangers; a normal reaction is for the ball to pull its head and neck 
        sharply away from such contact. When held, the snake should grip you gently 
        but firmly when moving around. It should be alert to its surroundings. 
        All young snakes are food for other, larger snakes, birds, lizards and 
        mammalian predators so your hatchling may be a bit nervous at first but 
        should settle down quickly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Selecting an escape-proof 
        enclosure<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Select an 
        enclosure especially designed for housing snakes, such as the glass tanks 
        with the combination fixed screen/hinged glass top. All snakes are escape 
        artists; ball pythons are especially powerful and cunning when it comes 
        to breaking out. A good starter tank for a hatchling is a 10 gallon tank 
        (approximately 20&quot;L x 10&quot;W [50 x 25 cm]). A young adult requires 
        a 20 gallon tank, and full adult may require a 30 gallon tank (36&quot; 
        x 12&quot;W [91 x 35 cm]).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Select a suitable 
        substrate<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Use paper 
        towels at first. These are easily and quickly removed and replaced when 
        soiled and, with an import, will allow you to better monitor for the presence 
        of mites and the condition of the feces. Once the animal is established, 
        you can use more decorative ground cover such as commercially prepared 
        shredded cypress or fir bark. Pine and aspen shavings should not be used 
        as they can become lodged in the mouth while eating, causing respiratory 
        and other problems. The shavings must be monitored closely and all soiled 
        and wet shavings pulled out immediately to prevent bacteria and fungus 
        growths. The utilitarian approach is to use inexpensive Astroturf. Extra 
        pieces can be kept in reserve and used when the soiled piece is removed 
        for cleaning and drying (soak in one gallon of water to which you have 
        added two tablespoon of household bleach; rinse thoroughly, and dry completely 
        before reuse). Remember: the easier it is to clean, the faster you'll 
        do it!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Provide a hiding 
        place<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A half-log 
        is available at pet stores. An empty cardboard box or upside-down opaque 
        plastic container, both with an access doorway cut into one end, can also 
        be used. The plastic is easily cleaned when necessary; the box can be 
        tossed out when soiled and replaced with a new one. The box or log must 
        be big enough for the snake to hide its entire body inside; you will need 
        to eventually replace it as your snake grows. Ball pythons prefer dark 
        places for sleeping and, as they are nocturnal, they like the dark place 
        during our daylight hours; they also like to sleep in something that is 
        close around them, so do not buy or make too big of a cave for its size. 
        Place a nice climbing branch or two in the tank with some fake greenery 
        screening part of it; your ball will enjoy hanging out in the &quot;tree.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Keeping it warm<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Proper temperature 
        range is essential to keeping your snake healthy. The ambient air temperature 
        throughout the enclosure must be maintained between 80-85F (27-29 C)-during 
        the day, with a basking area kept at 90F (32.5 C). At night, the ambient 
        air temperature on the coolest side may be allowed to drop down no lower 
        than 73-75F ( 23-24 C) only if a basking area of at least 80F (27 C) remains 
        available. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Special reptile heating 
        pads that are manufactured to maintain a temperature about 20 degrees 
        higher than the air temperature may be used inside the enclosure. There 
        are adhesive pads that can be stuck to the underside of a glass enclosure. 
        Heating pads made for people, available at all drug stores, are also available; 
        these have built-in hi-med-lo switches and can be used under a glass enclosure. 
        You can also use incandescent light bulbs in porcelain and metal reflector 
        hoods to provide the additional heat required for the basking area. All 
        lights must be screened off to prevent the snake from burning itself. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">All pythons, especially 
        ball pythons, are very susceptible to thermal burns. For this same reason 
        do not use a hot rock. New on the market are ceramic heating elements. 
        They radiate heat downwards, do not emit light, and are reported to be 
        long lasting. Plugged into a thermostat will enable you to adjust the 
        temperature inside the tank as the ambient room temperature changes with 
        the seasons.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Buy at least two thermometers 
        - one to use in the overall area 1&quot; (2.5 cm) above the enclosure 
        floor, and the other 1&quot; (2.5 cm) above the floor in the basking area. 
        Don't try to guess the temperature - you will either end up with a snake 
        who will be too cold to eat and digest its food or one ill or dead from 
        overheating.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Humidity</b><br>
        Ball pythons are native to generally temperate to arid areas. Depending 
        on where you live, they may be fine with the ambient humidity. If there 
        are any problems shedding, or feces are dry when deposited or there is 
        straining to defecate, check the humidity with a hygrometer and get it 
        up to 50 percent. When shedding, they will need higher humidity: increase 
        enclosure humidity to 60-65 percent, or mist daily during the shed. If 
        you bathe them in a warm bath the day their eyes clear, they should shed 
        completely within 24 hours.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Lighting<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">No special 
        lighting is needed. Ball pythons are nocturnal snakes, spending their 
        days in the wild securely hidden away from possible predators. To make 
        it easier to see your ball during the day, you can use a full-spectrum 
        light or low wattage incandescent bulb in the enclosure during the day. 
        Make sure the snake cannot get into direct contact with the light bulbs 
        as ball pythons are very prone to getting seriously burned. Respect your 
        ball's needs, however, and be sure to provide a hide box, and expect them 
        to use it!</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Feeding</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Allow your snake to acclimate 
        to its new home for a couple of weeks. Start your hatchling (about 15&quot; 
        in length) off with a single pre-killed one week to 10-day old &quot;fuzzy&quot; 
        mouse. A smaller sized hatchling may require a smaller mouse; try a pre-killed 
        5-day old. Older ball pythons may be fed larger pre-killed mice or pinkie 
        rats. If you have not had any experience force feeding a snake, you may 
        not want to try it yourself until you have seen someone do it. Force feeding, 
        whether of a mouse or with a formula inserted by catheter and syringe, 
        is very stressful for the snake (and it isn't much fun for the owner!). 
        If your new ball has gone several months without eating and is beginning 
        to noticeably lose weight, take it to a reptile vet or contact your local 
        herpetology society and ask to speak to someone who is knowledgeable about 
        ball pythons and feeding problems. A good inexpensive book that covers 
        some of the tricks to enticing reluctant ball pythons to feed is The Care 
        and Maintenance of Ball Pythons by Philippe de Vosjoli, or the new edition, 
        The Ball Python Manual, by de Vosjoli, Dave and Tracy Barker and Roger 
        Klingenberg.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>Water<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Provide a 
        bowl of fresh water at all times. Your snake will both drink and soak, 
        and may defecate, in it. Check it daily and change when soiled. Soaking 
        is especially good just before a shed. When they eyes clear from their 
        milky opaque, or &quot;blue&quot; state, soak the snake in a tub of warm 
        water for ten minutes or so, then lightly dry it off, and return it immediately 
        to its tank; it should shed cleanly within twenty-four hours.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>Health problems<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Routine veterinary 
        care for newly acquired snakes is essential. Many of the parasites infesting 
        ball pythons and other reptiles can be transmitted to humans and other 
        reptiles. Left untreated, such infestations can ultimately kill your snake. 
        When your snake first defecates, collect the feces in a clean plastic 
        bag, seal it, label it with the date, your name and phone number and the 
        snake's name, then take it and your snake to a vet who is experienced 
        with reptiles. There it will be tested and the proper medication given 
        if worms or protozoan infestations are found.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> A common problem encountered 
        in captivity include retained eye shed (spectacles) and mites. When snakes 
        shed their skin, the layer of skin over their eye is also shed, and can 
        be clearly seen when looking at a piece of head shed. Always check your 
        ball's head shed to assure it has shed the spectacles. If one or both 
        spectacles have been retained, bathe the snake again in warmish water 
        for about ten minutes. Before returning it to the enclosure, place a dab 
        of mineral oil on that eye with a cotton-tipped swab. The spectacle should 
        come off within twenty-four hours. If it does not come off, wrap your 
        four fingers with transparent tape, sticky side out. Gently rock your 
        fingers from left to right (or, from nose to neck) across the eye; the 
        spectacle should come off. If this does not removed the spectacle, then 
        seek veterinary assistance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Mites are a sign of 
        poor environmental conditions. Adult mites are tiny reddish brown dots 
        barely bigger than the period at the end of this sentence. You may first 
        notice them swarming over your hand and arm after you have handled your 
        snake (don't worry--they are harmless to humans) or see them moving around 
        your snake's body or clustered around the eyes. Mites are harmful to snakes, 
        especially ones that have not been kept properly. On the positive side, 
        they are easy and relatively inexpensive to get rid of, although the process 
        is time-consuming. Read the article <a href="mites.html">Getting Rid of 
        Reptile Mites </a>to find out the best ways to eradicate them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Snakes, including ball 
        pythons, should routinely shed is one piece, from snout (including spectacles) 
        to tail-tip. If a snake does not shed cleanly, it is a sign that something 
        is not right, either with the snake or with its environment. Newly acquired 
        snakes may not shed properly for the first month or two as they are getting 
        acclimated to their new surroundings. This is a sign of transient stress. 
        If it continues, or begins to occur in a long established snake, the snake 
        must be evaluated for possible health problems, and the snake's environment 
        must be evaluated for humidity problems.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Humidity and Ball 
        Pythons<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Ball pythons 
        are native to very warm, but not hot, dry areas in Africa. Many people 
        make the mistake of trying to keep them in a too humid overall environment, 
        using damp sphagnum moss or misting them frequently throughout the day. 
        The problem with this is that keeping the overall environment damp leads 
        to conditions such as blister disease where in the skin, usually of the 
        belly, becomes covered with blisters, leading to bacterial infections 
        of the skin, which in turn leads to overall health problems.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> In fact, all a ball 
        python needs is an area within its dry enclosure to which to retreat when 
        it requires higher humidity. One way to accomplish this is to provide 
        a water bowl large enough for the snake to soak in when it wants. Depending 
        on the ambient room (and thus enclosure) humidity, this may be enough, 
        or may be enough during part of the year. Another good, safe option for 
        a ball python is a humidity <a href="microclimates.html">retreat box.</a></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>Handling your new 
        snake</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">After giving your ball 
        a couple of days to settle in, begin picking it up and handling it gently. 
        It may move away from you, and may threaten you by lashing it's tail and 
        hissing; don't be put off - it is usually just a bluff, and snakes, like 
        most reptiles, are very good at bluffing! Be gentle but persistent. Daily 
        contact with each other will begin to establish a level of trust and confidence 
        between you and your snake. When it is comfortable with you, you can begin 
        taking it around the house. Don't get overconfident! Given a chance and 
        close proximity to seat cushions, your ball will make a run (well, a slither) 
        for it, easing down between the cushions and from there, to points possibly 
        unknown. Always be gentle, and try to avoid sudden movements. If the snake 
        wraps around your arm or neck, you can unwind it by gently grasping it's 
        tail and gently unwrapping it from around your neck or arm - do not try 
        to unwrap it by moving the head. Some snakes are a bit sensitive about 
        being handled soon after they have eaten. If you feed your snake out of 
        it's enclosure, go ahead and replace it back into it's enclosure after 
        it has finished eating. Then leave it be for a couple of days. As the 
        snake gets more comfortable with you, it will be less nervous and less 
        likely to give you back your mouse.</font></p>

      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Always</b> spend 
        a considerable amount of time observing boids before you buy them, especially 
        at pet stores. Even reptile specialty stores have been selling infected 
        stock so buying from such stores is no guarantee that you are buying an 
        uninfected/unexposed snake. Don't buy a boid because you feel sorry for 
        it, because it looks sick and the store isn't providing proper care for 
        it - you may lose every boid you own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Always</b> observe 
        <a href="cleaning.html">strict quarantine procedures</a> when bringing 
        in a new boid into your house if you already have other boids. IBD may 
        take several months to manifest itself. Owners have reported their new 
        snakes showing signs as little as one month after acquiring hatchlings 
        to well over one year after acquiring a new boid.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Always</b> have 
        boids who are not acting well (loss of appetite, regurgitating meals, 
        mouthrot, respiratory infection, contorted body positions, stargazing) 
        seen by a reptile vet as soon as possibly after symptoms are noticed. 
        Warn the vet before coming in that it may be IBD so they may take precautions 
        to reduce exposure to other boids who may be in their office at that time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Remember</b> that 
        it doesn't require snake-to-snake contact to spread the disease. You may 
        unwittingly spread it by handling other snakes without first thoroughly 
        washing your hands. Viruses are airborne - think twice about taking your 
        snakes to places where they will encounter snakes belonging to people 
        who may not be taking proper precautions.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><b>Necessities<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some things 
        you should have on hand for general maintenance and first aid include: 
        Nolvasan (chlorhexidine diacetate) for cleaning enclosures and disinfecting 
        food and water bowls, litter boxes, tubs, sinks, your hands, etc. Betadine 
        (povidone/iodine) for cleansing scratches and wounds. Set aside a food 
        storage bowl, feeding and water bowls, soaking bowl or tub, even sponges, 
        to be used only for your snake.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>Enjoy yourselves<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">You have a 
        companion that will be a part of your life for a great many years if taken 
        care of properly. They should remain alert and active well into their 
        old age. The main causes of death of snakes in captivity are directly 
        related to their care: improper temperatures, contact with heating and 
        lighting elements, no regular access to water, lack of necessary veterinary 
        care and treatment, careless handling--all things for which we, as their 
        caretakers, are directly responsible.</font></p>

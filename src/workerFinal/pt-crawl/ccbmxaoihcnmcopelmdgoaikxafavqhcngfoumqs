  <p>The instrument amends the <a
  href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2019L01105">Agricultural and
  Veterinary Chemicals Code (MRL Standard) Instrument 2019</a> to set new and
  varied maximum residue limits and make other changes to the tables.</p>
  <p>When deciding whether to register a chemical product as
  safe to be supplied, sold or used in Australia, the Australian Pesticides and
  Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) undertakes a residue risk assessment,
  which includes a dietary risk assessment. A key outcome of these assessments
  is the setting of a maximum residue limit (MRL) for a particular chemical in
  relation to nominated crops and animals. An MRL is the maximum amount of a
  residue which is expected and legally permitted to be present in food or
  animal feed if the agricultural or veterinary chemical product was used
  according to its label instructions as approved by the APVMA. </p>

  4.6</a> of the Plan provides that AFMA must determine a percentage for the
  purpose of applying the undercatch provisions to the Fishery.</p>
  <p>Undercatch and overcatch provides for ‘carry over’ or
  ‘carry under’ of a small amount of end of season quota between fishing
  seasons thereby allowing fishers the flexibility to catch a certain amount of
  fish over or under their quota, and debit or credit this to or from the
  following season’s quota.</p>
  <p>The instrument sets the following percentages and weights:</p>
  <ul><li> the
  determined overcatch percentage, and the determined overcatch weight for
  albacore tuna, bigeye tuna, broadbill swordfish, striped marlin and yellowfin
  tuna is 10 per cent, and 2 tonnes, respectively</li><li> the

  <p>The instrument determines the total allowable catch (TAC) for
  target species and catch limits for other species in the Heard Island and
  McDonald Islands Fishery (the Fishery) for the 2022–23&nbsp;fishing year. The
  target species are Patagonian toothfish (<em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em>) and
  Mackerel icefish (<em>Champsocephalus gunnari</em>). Other species listed in
  the Determination are species that may be caught by fishers as incidental
  catch while fishing for the target species in the Fishery.</p>
  <p>The Fishery includes external territories of Australia
  located in the Southern Indian Ocean about 4,000 km south-west of Perth. The
  islands lie within the Convention Area as described in the <a
  href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/other/dfat/treaties/ATS/1982/9.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=antarctic&amp;nocontext=1"><em>Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
  Resources</em></a>. The waters surrounding the islands out to 200
  nautical miles are part of the Australian Fishing Zone, which is managed by
  the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).</p>
  <p>AFMA determined the <a

  of the Plan, AFMA must, before the beginning of each fishing year, determine
  the TAC by the Fishery with respect to certain species of fish. Before
  deciding on the TAC for target species and catch limits for other species,
  AFMA must (among other things) take into account the TAC set by the <a
  href="https://www.ccamlr.org/en/organisation">Commission
  for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</a> (CCAMLR).
  </p>
  <p>The instrument sets the following limits on the fish that
  may be taken by the Fishery:</p>
  <ul><li> 2,510
  tonnes for Patagonian toothfish (<em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em>)</li><li> 2,616
  tonnes for Mackerel icefish (<em>Champsocephalus gunnari</em>)</li><li> 409
  tonnes combined for Caml grenadier (<em>Macrourus caml</em>) and Whitson’s
  grenadier (<em>Macrourus whitsoni</em>)</li><li> 360
  tonnes combined for Bigeye grenadier (<em>Macrourus holotrachys</em>) and Ridge
  scaled rattail (<em>Macrourus carinatus</em>)</li><li> 1,663
  tonnes for Unicorn icefish (<em>Channichthys rhinoceratus</em>)</li><li> 120

  <p>The instrument determines the manner in which transfer
  weighing is to be carried out when an operator in the Southern Bluefin Tuna
  Fishery transfers Southern Bluefin Tuna from a tow pontoon to a farm.</p>
  <p>The majority of Southern Bluefin Tuna are caught in
  offshore waters adjacent to Kangaroo Island, South Australia. The fish are
  caught live using the purse seine method and transferred from a tow pontoon
  into a farm where they are kept for an approximate six months grow out
  period. The transfer weighing is conducted at the time of transfer to
  determine the weight of live fish transferred. This weight is used for quota
  decrementation purposes. The remainder of the total allowable catch is taken
  using longline methods, predominantly off south eastern Australia during the
  winter months.</p>
  <p>Section 6 of the instrument provides that transfer
  weighing of a fish is to be carried out as follows:</p>
  <ul><li> at
  least 100 fish that each weighs 8 kilograms or more must be taken from the
  tow pontoon and the average weight of those fish must be determined</li><li> if
  150 fish have been taken from the tow pontoon and the number of fish that
  weigh 8&nbsp;kilograms or more each is less than 100 then the average weight
  shall be calculated from the 150 fish taken regardless of the individual
  weight of each fish</li><li> a
  video recording must be made of each transfer of the fish from the tow
  pontoon to the farm</li><li> the
  video must depict a side view covering the opening between the tow pontoon
  and the farm in order that all southern bluefin tuna transferred will appear
  on the video recording</li><li> once
  all the transfers from that tow pontoon are complete, a farm representative
  and Australian Fisheries Management Authority must view the recordings and
  tally the number of fish transferred.</li></ul>

  9C</a> of the Plan, AFMA may determine percentages for undercatch for the
  Fishery.</p>
  <p>Undercatch and overcatch provides for ‘carry over’ or
  ‘carry under’ of a small amount of end of season quota between fishing
  seasons thereby allowing fishers the flexibility to catch a certain amount of
  fish over or under their quota, and debit or credit this to or from the
  following season’s quota.</p>
  <p>The instrument sets the following percentages and weights
  for the Fishery:</p>
  <ul><li> the
  determined percentage of overcatch is&nbsp;5%</li><li> the
  determined amount of overcatch is 100&nbsp;tonnes</li><li> the
  determined additional weight of overcatch is 2 tonnes</li><li> the
  determined percentage of undercatch for the fishing season commencing on 1&nbsp;December
  2022 and ending on 30&nbsp;November 2023 is:</li>

  2004</a> (the Rules). </p>
  <p>Amended Rule 1.09.2 provides that the Justices of the High
  Court, or a majority of them, may approve a form for the purposes of the
  Rules. Forms will be approved by the High Court and published in a Practice
  Direction rather than through an amendment to the Rules.</p>
  <p>The Rules specify the amount which solicitors, who are
  entitled to practise in the High Court, may charge and be allowed on taxation
  of costs by the Taxing Officer of the Court in respect of proceedings in the

  <p>The instrument
  provides for the future management of the Mersey Bluff Lighthouse by the Australian
  Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA),
  with the objective of identifying, protecting, conserving, presenting and
  transmitting its Commonwealth heritage values. The Plan contains a detailed
  description of the history and cultural significance of the Lighthouse, as
  well as its physical elements and condition. Importantly, the Plan sets out
  the operational requirements for the management of the Lighthouse, heritage
  management policies that guide the management and protection of the
  Commonwealth heritage values of the Lighthouse and plans for AMSA to
  implement such operation requirements and policies.</p>
  <ul><li> Built
  in 1889, Mersey Bluff Lighthouse is a historic site recognised by both the
  Commonwealth and the Tasmanian State Government for its heritage
  significance. The Lighthouse is renowned for its association with the
  development of Devonport and the Mersey District, and for its significance as
  a local landmark.  </li><li> The
  Lighthouse was included on the Commonwealth Heritage List in 2004 for its
  cultural significance.</li></ul>

  <p>The instrument amends the <a
  href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2022L00347">Higher Education
  Support (Other Grants) Guidelines 2022</a> to establish the Microcredentials
  Pilot Program (the Program).</p>
  <p>The instrument sets out the objectives for the program,
  the extra conditions of eligibility, conditions that apply to grants under
  the Program and the method by which grant amounts under the Program will be
  determined.</p>
  <p>Grants under the Program will be made for the purposes of
  supporting open access to higher education across Australia and encouraging
  higher education providers to engage with industry.</p>
  <p>The Program will provide funding to higher education
  providers to develop and deliver microcredential courses for the domestic
  market, and to promote a systemic approach to supporting them.</p>
  <ul><li> Microcredential
  courses give students an opportunity to be more selective and targeted about
  acquiring new skills, providing flexibility to students already in the
  workforce and those managing caring and family responsibilities who are often
  time-poor and will not otherwise be able to commit to a full qualification.</li><li> Microcredential
  courses address the cost and time barriers for students, ensuring that all
  Australians are able to continue accessing high-quality higher education
  throughout their lives.</li></ul>
  <p>The purpose of the Program is to examine newer, shorter
  forms of industry focussed learning aimed at supporting people to upskill and
  reskill in areas of national priority such as health, teaching, IT and
  engineering.</p>

  <p>Historically, TEQSA has recovered approximately 15% of its

  TEQSA will be moving toward a model under which it recovers 90% of its costs.</p>

  require amendments to the current Fee Instrument. The amendments made by this

  2022.</p>

  their longer-term care arrangements. It can be delivered in a residential
  care setting, a person’s home, or a combination of both.</li><li> The
  TCP is jointly funded by the Australian and state/territory governments,

  for up to 12 weeks (with the possibility of a six-week extension) following
  discharge from hospital. There are eight state and territory health
  authorities who are approved providers of transition care.</li><li> The

  <p>The instrument amends the <a

  Regulations 1994</a> (Regulations) to support family unity for skilled
  workers by enabling family members to join a subclass 191 (Permanent
  Residence (Skilled Regional)) visa application without having to depart
  Australia.</p>
  <ul><li> The
  subclass 191 (Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional)) visa (subclass 191 visa)
  is a permanent visa available to certain persons who have lived and worked in
  regional Australia and have held the relevant qualifying provisional
  ‘pathway’ visa beforehand. </li><li> Paragraph
  41(2)(a) of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1958A00062"><em>Migration Act 1958</em></a><em> </em>provides that the
  Regulations may provide that a visa, or visas of a specified class are
  subject to a condition that the holder of the visa will not, after entering
  Australia, be entitled to be granted a substantive visa (other than a
  protection visa, or a temporary visa of a specified kind) while he or she
  remains in Australia. Subsection 41(2A) then provides that the Minister may,
  in prescribed circumstances, by writing, waive such a condition. </li><li> The
  pathway visas do not have any conditions that prevent further visa
  applications being made in Australia and hence an ability to waive such
  conditions is not needed to enable their holders to apply for a Subclass 191
  visa in Australia. However, there may be impacted family members, for
  example, a spouse who is in Australia on a student visa with a ‘No Further
  Stay’ condition.</li><li> The
  instrument ensures that such conditions may be waived to enable genuine
  family members to join the permanent visa application without having to
  depart Australia.</li></ul>

  <p>The instrument prescribes the Australia-India Critical
  Minerals Investment Partnership Program (the Program), which will provide $5.8
  million to undertake due diligence exercises ($0.8 million for administrative
  costs) to promote and further the ongoing relationship between the Commonwealth
  and the government of India through investment in critical minerals.</p>
  <p>The Commonwealth’s contribution makes up 50 per cent of
  the Program’s funding. The remaining funding contribution will be provided by
  Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. The Program’s funding will be used to undertake due
  diligence exercises to assist the development of a business case for
  prospective Indian investment in Australia.</p>

  Program’s funding will be managed by the Critical Minerals Office (CMO),
  which is the Australian Government's central coordination point to help grow
  Australia’s critical minerals sector, within the Department of Industry,
  Science and Resources. The CMO works across government with key agencies like
  Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to help connect
  Australian critical minerals projects with investors, regulators, government
  financing facilities and Australia's strategic partners.</li><li> Spending
  decisions will be made by Australian Government officials.</li><li> Underpinning
  the Program is a Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth of
  Australia, as represented by the Critical Minerals Office, and Khanij Bidesh
  India Ltd. (the MoU) dated 10 March 2022. The MoU provides a framework for
  building an Australia&#8209;India
  partnership in critical minerals investment. It sets out the objectives and
  actions that will deliver on the ambition of both Australia and India to
  develop robust and commercially viable critical minerals supply chains
  through investing in upstream mineral assets and associated development
  projects in Australia.</li></ul>

  <p>The instrument prescribes the Diesel Exhaust Fluid
  Emergency Stockpile Program, part of a package of measures which provides
  funding to secure the supply of Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).</p>
  <ul><li> The
  funding for the Program has been secured through the Department of Climate
  Change, Energy, the Environment and Water 2022-23 Budget. The Program is part
  of a package of measures, which provides $49.5 million in total funding, to
  deliver the Australian Government’s commitment to secure the supply of Diesel
  Exhaust Fluid (DEF). As part of this package, the Program will establish an
  emergency stockpile of 7,500 tonnes of Technical Grade Urea (TGU) which is
  the main ingredient of DEF. </li><li> The
  strategic stockpile will ensure that Government can support the market
  through release of TGU, by sale of all or part of the stockpile, if a supply
  shortage occurs. A release, by sale, of TGU from the stockpile could help
  prevent a supply crisis like that experienced in December 2021 by increasing
  supply in the market.</li><li> The
  Program provides funding for the Commonwealth to engage a successful
  tenderer, or successful tenderers, to undertake the procurement of the
  emergency TGU stockpile which will be owned by the Commonwealth. The
  successful tenderer, or successful tenderers, will procure, transport, store,
  and manage the emergency stockpile of TGU as directed by the Commonwealth.
  The Commonwealth will sell all or part of the emergency stockpile if a supply
  shortage occurs.</li></ul>

  <p>The instrument has been issued to correct an unsafe
  condition on the Fokker F100 aircraft due to main landing gear pistons not
  being overhauled in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, which can
  cause internal hydrogen embrittlement and cause cracking after incorrect
  treatment. </p>

  <p>The instrument enables paragliders to be flown in the Go
  For Goal 2022 paragliding event without the pilots in command having to
  comply with certain licensing and radiocommunication regulatory requirements.</p>
  <p>The event is to be held near Corryong, Victoria. The
  exemptions are necessary because paragliders are not typically equipped with
  VHF radio equipment but during the event paragliders will be flown in the
  vicinity of Corryong aerodrome, and above 5,000 feet above mean sea level which
  requires the carriage and use of VHF radio equipment.</p>
  <p>The instrument also provides an exemption for a named
  individual who holds a radio operator endorsement issued by Sports Aviation
  Federation of Australia Limited to allow the individual to transmit on a
  radio frequency while operating a ground communications station for the
  event.</p>

  Section 360L of the <a

  (Designated Service Area and Statutory Infrastructure Provider) Declaration
  (No. 1) 2020</a></li>
  <li>SIPs
  have obligations under Part 19 of the Act. These include that an SIP must
  connect premises to its networks and must supply an eligible service to
  consumers.</li>
  <li>SIPs
  must also comply with standards, benchmarks and rules determined by the
  Minister.</li>
  <li>Telstra
  previously held<a
  href="https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-your-say/consultation-telstra-request-extensions-ministerial-exemptions-its-south-brisbane-and-velocity">
  exemptions</a> with respect to certain obligations in the Act , which would
  have otherwise required Telstra to update its South Brisbane network. </li>
  <li>On
  24 December 2020, Telstra and Uniti announced that they had entered into a
  commercial agreement relating to the service areas collectively known as
  ‘Velocity’ estates, which include Telstra’s FTTP network in South Brisbane</li>
  <li>The
  ownership of the Telstra FTTP networks in the estates passed to Uniti on 24&nbsp;December
  2020, but Telstra retained operational control of the networks pending a
  transition process. As such it has continued to be responsible for connecting
  premises to the networks, and for providing wholesale services under the SIP
  regime. It has therefore remained the SIP for the estates until now</li>
  <li>The
  transition process will involve the disconnection of Telstra’s equipment and
  the installation of new equipment owned by Uniti’s subsidiary, Opticomm. Both
  Telstra and Opticomm have stated that the process at any individual premises
  will be completed in a single day, meaning disruptions to service for
  end-users should be limited. Once the Opticomm equipment has been installed,
  Opticomm will fully control the networks and take over the role of providing
  network connectivity and wholesale services in the Velocity estates. As such,
  it should also be the SIP for the estates.</li></ul>

  <p>The instrument specifies exceptions to statutory

  a Premises Transition Date, establishing a time when individual premises are
  transferred from Telstra’s operational control to Opticomm’s.</li><li> Determines
  exceptions from SIP obligations. Specifically, Opticomm does not have to
  fulfil SIP obligations at individual premises prior to the Premises
  Transition Date, and Telstra does not have to fulfil SIP obligations at
  individual premises after the Premises Transition Date.</li><li> Specifies
  conditions which must be met for the exceptions to apply. Specifically, it
  requires that:</li><ul>
  <li>Telstra
  and Opticomm have executed an agreement on the operational measures required
  to comply with a request to fulfil SIP obligations</li>

  <p>The instrument varies the characteristics, including
  technical specifications, of Murrayville community radio broadcasting
  services in the Murrayville RA1 licence area.</p>
  <p>The main variation is to add a technical specification to
  the Murrayville licence area plan (LAP) for an existing community radio
  broadcasting retransmission with the call sign 3MBR serving Lameroo.</p>
  <p>There is currently one community radio broadcasting
  service planned in the Murrayville RA1 licence area, serving the general area
  of Murrayville. In 2000, the licensee was issued with a retransmission
  licence to transmit the service in Lameroo; however, this transmission was
  not planned in the Murrayville LAP. It was assessed at the time to be an
  appropriate technical specification and the Australian Communications and Media
  Authority (ACMA) has not received any objections or complaints about the
  service. The ACMA therefore believes it is appropriate to regularise the
  service by planning it officially in the Murrayville LAP.</p>

  16 Leases</a> (February 2016) to add subsequent measurement requirements for

  <p>AASB 16 already requires a seller-lessee to recognise only
  the amount of any gain or loss related to the rights transferred to the
  buyer-lessor. The amendments made by this instrument ensure that a similar
  approach is applied by also requiring a seller-lessee to subsequently measure

  any amount of the gain or loss related to the right of use it retains.</p>

  2020, ASIC extended the Existing Waivers for a further two-year period, to 16

<p><b>Note:</b>
a notice of a motion to disallow a legislative instrument or a provision of a
legislative instrument may be given in a House of the Parliament within <strong>15
sitting days</strong> of that House after a copy of the instrument was laid before
that House. If, within 15 sitting days of that House after the giving of that
notice, the House passes a resolution, in pursuance of the motion, disallowing
the instrument or provision, then the instrument or provision so disallowed
then ceases to have effect. (<a

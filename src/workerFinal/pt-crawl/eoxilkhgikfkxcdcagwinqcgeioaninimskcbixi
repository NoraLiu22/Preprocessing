                  <h3>Translation of Dreaming</h3>
                  <p>Dreaming is an approximate English translation of an Aboriginal 
                    concept, which has no equivalent in the English language. Groups 
                    each have their own words for this concept: for example the Pitjantjatjara 
                    people use the term Tjukurpa, the Arrernte refer to it as Aldjerinya 
                    and the Adnyamathanha use the word Nguthuna. </p>
                <h2>The Dreaming</h2>
                  <p>Dreaming does not convey the fullness of the concept for Aboriginal 
                  people but is the most acceptable English word to Aboriginal people. 
                  The word is acceptable because very often revelations or insights 
                  are received in dreams or recurring visions. The Dreaming refers 
                  to all that is known and all that is understood. It is the way Aboriginal 
                  people explain life and how their world came into being. It is central 
                  to the existence of traditional Aboriginal people, their lifestyle 
                  and their culture, for it determines their values and beliefs and 
                  their relationship with every living creature and every feature 
                  of the landscape. </p>
                <h2>Journey of the Creator Ancestors</h2>
                  <p>The Dreaming tells of the journeys and deeds of creator ancestors. 
                  The creator ancestors made the trees, rocks, waterholes, rivers, 
                  mountains and stars, as well as the animals and plants, and their 
                  spirits inhabit these features of the natural world today. Good 
                  and bad behaviours are demonstrated in Dreaming stories as ancestors 
                  hunt, marry, care for children and defend themselves from their 
                  enemies. </p>
                <h2>Concept of Time</h2>
                  <p>The Dreaming is often understood as a period of time, but this European 
                  concept of a unit of time in past does not contain the full meaning. 
                  The Dreaming is not some long past era but a continuous entity, 
                  from which people come, which people renew and which people go back 
                  to. Art is one to the ways through which Aboriginal people communicate 
                  with and maintain a oneness with the Dreaming. When people take 
                  on the characteristics of the Dreaming ancestors through dance, 
                  song and art and when they maintain sacred sites, the spirits of 
                  the creator ancestors are renewed. </p>
                  <h2>Our "Country"</h2>
                      <p>It is the natural world, which therefore provides the link between 
                      the people and the Dreaming, especially the land (or 'country') 
                      to which a person belongs. Aboriginal people see themselves as related 
                      to, and part of, this natural world and know its features in intricate 
                      detail. This relationship carries responsibilities for its survival 
                      and continuity so that each person has special obligations to protect 
                      and preserve the spirit of the land and the life forms that are 
                      a part of it. </p>
                      <h2>Obligations to Our "Country"</h2>
                      <p>These obligations may take the form of conservation practices, obeying 
                      the law, observing codes of behaviour or involvement in secret/sacred 
                      ceremonial activities, but the influence of the Dreaming is embedded 
                      in every aspect of daily life. The Dreamings permeates through song, 
                      dance, storytelling, painting, artifacts making, hunting and food 
                      gathering activities as well as through the social (kinship) system 
                      because it provides the framework for living. </p>
                      
                    <h2>The Individual's Link with the Dreaming</h2>
                      <p>For Aboriginal people who follow traditional beliefs, the Dreaming 
                      is intensely personal. Each person is linked to it by his or her 
                      individual Dreaming (or totem), this belief involves the idea that 
                      the creator ancestors who were physically alive in the natural features 
                      of the landscape in which they once moved. </p>
                      <h2>Unborn Child's Dreaming</h2>
                      <p>At the very earliest stage of life, during pregnancy, each fetus 
                      is believed to be activated by one of these 'spirit babies'. Their 
                      presence enters the mother's body from one of the places where spirit 
                      babies are in hiding, waiting for an opportunity to enter a fetus. 
                      Usually the mother associates this event with the place where she 
                      first becomes aware of carrying her child. Because each part of 
                      the landscape is clearly identified with a Dreaming spirit ancestor 
                      there is usually no doubt as to the actual Dreaming to which the 
                      unborn child belongs. </p>
                      <h2>Conception</h2>
                      <p>Some earlier writers assumed that Aboriginal people did not know 
                      about physical conception. This is not so. It is simply a matter 
                      of emphasis. Traditional Aboriginal people tended to stress the 
                      gaining of a spiritual identity as the vital aspect of conception. 
                      This belief reinforces the spiritual and physical ties that Aboriginal 
                      people have with the land.</p>
                      <h2>Links with the Land</h2>
                      <p>Whenever a traditional Aboriginal person looks at the landscape, 
                      he or she always sees much more than just the physical features. 
                      There is a deep awareness of the presence of the Dreaming ancestors. 
                      All around are signs of their presence, their tracks, places where 
                      they had dug out valleys, split rocks or disturbed the ground in 
                      their passing. Sometimes too, their bodies or those of their enemies 
                      are perceived in rocks, boulders and trees. Their actual spirits 
                      are also there, not dangerous or unfriendly, living on in the world 
                      they made. It is possible to communicate with ancestor spirits. 
                      The bond that this creates is one of enormous strength. Overall, 
                      the earth is a 'mother' in a real sense. </p>
                      <h2>Guardians</h2>
                      <p>This interpretation of landscape confers responsibilities of the 
                      highest order. In many lonely places in Australia today there are 
                      quiet, sacred places that are regularly visited and cared for by 
                      the Aboriginal man or woman who is the guardian of the place. Their 
                      responsibilities usually defined the territory occupied by each 
                      group. They also from a basis for land rights claims today. </p>
                      <h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
                      <p>The Dreaming is as important to Aboriginal people as the Christian 
                      Bible and the whole ethos of Christian belief is to the devout Christian. 
                      The Dreaming is still vitally important to today's Aboriginal people. 
                      It gives a social and spiritual base and links them to their cultural 
                      heritage. Many Aboriginal people are Christian as well as having 
                      a continuing belief in their Dreaming. In some areas, where Aboriginal 
                      people may no longer have the full knowledge of their Dreaming, 
                      they still retain strong spirituality, kinship practices and traditional 
                      values and beliefs. </p>
                    <h2>Everyone is an Artist</h2>
                    <p>Like European art, Aboriginal art represents and symbolises the 
                        world and the beliefs of people. Traditional Aboriginal art represent 
                        the Dreaming but is often also a vital part of ceremonies. </p>
                      <h2>Concept of Art in Traditional Aboriginal Society</h2>
                      <p>The concept of art in traditional Aboriginal society is very different 
                            to the concept of art in European society. In traditional Aboriginal 
                            societies, activities like dancing, singing, body decorations, sand 
                            drawings, making implements or weaving baskets were not considered 
                            to be separate activities called art and design. All of these activities 
                            were a part of the Dreaming and a part of normal daily life. There 
                            was no concept of a special type of person, artists, because, in 
                            a sense, everyone was an artist. This is changing as tradition-oriented 
                            communities adapt to aspects of western culture although the number 
                            of 'artists' in any Aboriginal group would generally be far greater 
                            than in non-Aboriginal communities. </p>
                      <h2>Art Forms</h2>
                      <p>Aboriginal people traditionally used the materials available to 
                          them to symbolise the Dreaming and their world. As a result, art 
                          forms varied in different areas of Australia. In the central desert, 
                          ground drawing was a very important style of art and throughout 
                          Australia rock art as well as body painting and decoration were 
                          common although varying in styles, method, materials and meaning. 
                          There is and was a wide range of traditional Aboriginal art forms. </p>
                      <h2>Contemporary Art</h2>
                      <p>Communities today throughout central and northern Australia still 
                            produce traditional art, which has traditional content and meaning. 
                            However, some methods of producing the art may be contemporary, 
                            for example, the use of acrylic paint on canvas or commercial fixatives 
                            on bark. </p>

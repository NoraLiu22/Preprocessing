/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 242]]</font> To those readers whose knowledge of ethnology or anthropology has been derived
from a perusal of Prichard's &quot;Natural History of Man,&quot; or the compilations of Wood, Brown,
Peschel, or Brace, the present work will present a surprising amount of freshness and originality.
They will in fact find themselves introduced to a new and very captivating science. Instead of the
disconnected, and often confusing accounts of the numerous races, families, and tribes into
which mankind have been divided, with separate details of the appearance, manners, customs,
houses, implements, weapons, and ornaments of each, the reader of the present work will be
shown how <font color="990000">[[p. 243]]</font> mankind may be studied in a logical, connected, and far more interesting
manner, by the method of comparison, and by tracing the growth or development of those
faculties which more especially distinguish him from the lower animals. Everywhere he will find
proofs of the essential unity of man; whether in the close similarity of the forms of the stone
implements and weapons found in the most remote parts of the earth, and among the most varied
races; in the identity of signs and gestures, and the striking resemblances even among the most
diverse languages; or in the wonderful similarity and often identity, of habits, customs, ideas,
beliefs, and religions among all savages, and the curious way in which traces of these can often
be found in the very midst of modern civilised society.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very difficult to give any adequate idea of a work of this kind, which, in a moderate
compass, contains the essence and outcome of all modern research on the various branches of the
study of man and civilisation; but we shall perhaps best exhibit its wide scope and systematic
treatment by an enumeration of the subjects discussed in the several chapters, adding a few
remarks or criticisms where called for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first chapter contains a brief sketch of what we learn from history, arch&aelig;ology, and
geology, as to man's antiquity and early condition; and in the next we are shown man's relation
to the lower animals both in bodily structure and mental characteristics. These two chapters
might, with advantage, have been considerably enlarged, as they constitute the foundation, and,
to many persons, the most interesting portions of the modern study of man. The results hitherto
arrived at by these branches of study, are, besides, both suggestive and important, and might, we
think, have been more expressly referred to. The numerous remains now discovered of
prehistoric man, and of his works, dating back to an undoubtedly vast antiquity, show us in no
case any important deviation from the existing human type, nor any indication that his mental
status was lower than (if so low as) that of many living races. At the same time the increasing
rudeness of his implements as we go back, undoubtedly indicates that we have made some
approach towards the period when he first emerged from the purely brute state and became &quot;a
tool-using animal.&quot; We find him in the remote past surrounded by a number of huge mammalia,
including many carnivora of greater size and destructive power than any that now exist, and we
know that at a still earlier period these animals were even more abundant and more destructive;
yet man must have held his own against them during the time when he had not yet begun to make
tools or use fire. How did he do this without the possession of some additional natural weapons
or faculties, of which nevertheless we find no trace in the earliest remains yet discovered? Again,
the whole bearing of the evidence as to the development of man, indicates that the point of union
or of common origin of man and the anthropoid apes, is enormously remote. Each of the existing
types of these great apes possesses some specially human characteristic wanting in the others (for
an enumeration of which see Mivart's &quot;Man and Apes&quot;), and this indicates that the common
origin of these apes is of less remoteness than the common origin of them all and of man. How
immensely remote, then, must be this point of common origin, and what a long and complex
series of diverging forms must have existed, always in sufficient numbers to hold their own
against their numerous competitors and enemies! The evolutionist <em>must</em> postulate the existence of
this long series of divergent forms, yet notwithstanding the richness of the Tertiary deposits in
many parts of the world no trace whatever of their actual existence has yet been discovered. The
extreme remoteness of the origin of man is also shown by the facts, that neither the size nor the
form of the cranium of the prehistoric races shows any inferiority to those of existing savages,
while the approximate equality of their mental powers is shown by the ingenious construction of
weapons and implements, and the artistic talent which we find developed at a period when the
reindeer and the mammoth inhabited the south of France. It has been argued that the inferiority of
the early implements shows mental inferiority, but this is palpably illogical. Did Stephenson's
first rude locomotive--the <em>Rocket</em>--show less mind in its constructor than the highly-finished
products of our modern workshops? Or were the Greeks mentally inferior to us because they had
rude cars instead of locomotives, and had no clocks, water-mills, steam-engines, or spinning-jennies? It is forgotten that arts are a growth, and have little relation to the mental status of the
artificer. A number of European infants brought up among savages would not, probably, in many
generations, invent even the commonest implements and utensils of their ancestral homes; and it
is difficult to say how slow may have been the development of the arts in their earliest and by far
most difficult stages. It is therefore by no means impossible that the makers even of the
pal&aelig;olithic implements may have been fully equal, mentally, to existing savages of by no means
the lowest type.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next chapter we have an excellent sketch of the chief races of man copiously
illustrated by portraits, mostly from photographs and very characteristic. Among the best are
those of the Andaman Islanders and the Dyaks, which we here reproduce. The Malays are less
characteristic, this race being in fact better represented by the cut of the two Cochin Chinese at p.
98.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four chapters on Language, whether manifested by gestures and signs, by articulate
speech, by pictures, or by written characters, are exceedingly interesting and instructive,
especially the account of the gesture language and the illustrations of how connected stories may
be told to the deaf-and-dumb quite independently of any knowledge of alphabetical or even
verbal signs. Picture-writing, as exhibited in the works of savages, in Egyptian hieroglyphics and
in the modern Chinese characters, is also well explained, and is so interesting that one wishes the
subject were more fully gone into. In treating of the origin of language Mr. Tylor doubts the
sufficiency of the theory that emotional, imitative, and suggestive sounds were the basis on
which all languages were founded, though he gives tolerably full illustrations of how roots thus
obtained became modified in an infinite variety of ways to serve the growing needs of mankind
in expressing their wants or their feelings. He impresses on his readers the important fact that
language is always growing and that new words are continually made &quot;by choosing fit and proper
sounds.&quot; He shows how words once imitative or emotional have been often so changed and
modified as to have their original character totally concealed; yet he concludes, that--&quot;it would
be unscientific to accept all this as a complete explanation of the origin of language&quot;--because
&quot;other causes may have helped.&quot; It seems, however, to the present writer, that the imitative and
emotional origin of language is demonstrated by a body of facts almost as extensive and
complete as that which demonstrates the origin of species by natural selection; and that the
&quot;other causes&quot; are in both cases exceptional and subordinate. As the examples of imitative words
given by Mr. Tylor are comparatively trivial and altogether inadequate, it may be well to call
attention to the wide and far-reaching character of such words, and to show how much of the
force, expressiveness, and beauty of our language (as of most others) depends upon them.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting aside all mere representations of animal 
        sounds--as the <em>whinny</em> of the colt, the <em>mew</em> of the cat, 
        or the <em>bleat</em> of the sheep--let us consider what an immense number 
        of natural sounds are named by words which we at once see to be appropriate 
        representations or imitations of them. Such are--<em>crash</em>, <em>whizz</em>, 
        <em>fizz</em>, <em>hiss</em>, <em>creak</em>, <em>whistle</em>, <em>rattle</em>, 
        <em>bang</em>, <em>clang</em>, <em>flop</em>, <em>thud</em>, <em>clap</em>, 
        <em>roar</em>, <em>snore</em>, <font color="990000">[[p. 244]]</font> 
        <em>groan</em>, <em>moan</em>, <em>wail</em>, <em>thunder</em>. In other 
        cases sights, sounds, or feelings, are represented by their accompanying 
        or appropriate sounds. We see a <em>splash</em>, or a <em>slop</em>; we 
        feel a thing to be <em>smooth</em> or <em>rough</em>, or to <em>vibrate</em>; 
        and we <em>shiver</em> with cold or <em>terror</em>. Again, how many actions 
        and qualities are represented by words expressing the sounds which sometimes 
        accompany them--as <em>knock</em>, <em>shock</em>, <em>crack</em>, <em>snap</em>, 
        <em>ring</em>, <em>whisper</em>, <em>hush</em>, <em>sigh</em>, <em>sob</em>, 
        <em>wash</em>, <em>squash</em>, <em>crush</em>, <em>crunch</em>, <em>rip</em>, 
        <em>rend</em>, <em>grind</em>, <em>scratch</em>, <em>split</em>, <em>spit</em>, 
        <em>cough</em>, <em>sneeze</em>, <em>wheeze</em>. How characteristic are 
        such words as <em>sticky</em>, <em>flicker</em>, <em>flutter</em>, <em>hurry</em>, 
        <em>flurry</em>, <em>stumble</em>, <em>hobble</em>, <em>wobble</em>. Here 
        we have not only sound, but motion and quality, represented by the arrangement 
        of letters and syllables. How clearly do such words as <em>slide</em>, 
        <em>glide</em>, and <em>wave</em> imply slow and continuous motion, the 
        movement of the lips while pronouncing the latter word being a perfect 
        double undulation. How curiously do the tongue and palate seem to be pulled 
        apart from each other while pronouncing the words <em>glue</em> or <em>sticky</em>. 
        How marked is the contrast between the harsh consonants used to express 
        <em>rough</em>, <em>rugged</em>, and <em>gritty</em>, as compared with 
        the soft flow of sounds in <em>smooth</em>, <em>oily</em>, <em>even</em>, 
        <em>polished</em>. Look again at the sense of effort and feeling of grandeur 
        in pronouncing the words <em>strong</em>, <em>strength</em>, <em>power</em>, 
        <em>might</em>, as compared with the opposites, <em>weak</em>, <em>faint</em>; 
        or the open-mouthed sounds of <em>grand</em>, <em>huge</em>, <em>monstrous</em>, 
        <em>vast</em>, <em>immense</em>, <em>giant</em>, <em>gigantic</em>, as 
        contrasted with the almost closed lips with which we say <em>small</em>, 
        <em>little</em>, <em>tiny</em>, <em>minute</em>, <em>pigmy</em>, <em>midget</em>. 
        So <em>crawl</em> and <em>drag</em> are pronounced slowly as compared 
        with <em>run</em>, <em>fly</em>, or <em>swim</em>; while <em>difficult</em> 
        and <em>easy</em> express their own meaning while we pronounce them. Many 
        objects and substances have names curiously corresponding with their qualities. 
        We have already noticed <em>glue</em> as indicating stickiness, but no 
        less clearly is <em>oil</em> smooth; while <em>brass</em> and <em>glass</em> 
        indicate resonance; <em>tin</em> a tinkling sound; <em>lead</em> and <em>wood</em> 
        a dull sound or <em>thud</em>; in <em>bell</em> we imitate its sound, 
        while the word <em>jelly</em> indicates the shaking of the substance. 
        In <em>ice</em> we hear the interjectional <em>sh</em> of shivering with 
        cold; in <em>fire</em> the flicker of the ascending flame. In other cases 
        the motion of the breath gives an indication of meaning; <em>in</em> and 
        <em>out</em>, <em>up</em> and <em>down</em>, <em>elevate</em> and <em>depress</em>, 
        are pronounced with an inspiration and expiration respectively, the former 
        being necessarily accompanied with a raising, the latter with a depression, 
        of the head. When we name the <em>mouth</em> or <em>lips</em> we use labials; 
        for <em>tooth</em> and <em>tongue</em>, dentals; for the nose and things 
        relating to it, nasal sounds; and this peculiarity is remarkably constant 
        in most languages, civilised and savage. Among the Malay races, for instance, 
        we find such words as <em>mulut</em>, <em>bawa</em>, <em>mohon</em>, and 
        <em>moda</em> for mouth; <em>gigit</em>, <em>nisinen</em>, <em>nigni</em>, 
        and <em>niki</em> for teeth; and <em>idong</em>, <em>ugerun</em> and <em>usnut</em>, 
        for nose. So in words for <em>large</em> we find a prevalence of broad 
        sounds involving a wide opening of the mouth, as <em>busar</em>, <em>bak&egrave;</em>, 
        <em>bagut</em>, <em>lamu</em>, <em>elamo</em>, <em>ilah&eacute;</em>, 
        <em>er&auml;amei</em>, <em>aiyuk</em>, <em>m&auml;ina</em>--and for <em>small</em>, 
        words that are pronounced quickly and with slight opening of the lips, 
        as <em>kichil</em>, <em>chili</em>, <em>kidi</em>, <em>k&ouml;i</em>, 
        <em>roit</em>, <em>kemi</em>, <em>anan</em>, <em>kiiti</em>, <em>fek</em>, 
        <em>didiki</em>, all taken from languages of the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These few examples, which might be greatly increased, indicate the variety of ways in which,
even now, after all the modifications and development which language has undergone, sound still
corresponds to sense; and if the reader will turn to Dr. Farrar's suggestive little work on the
&quot;Origin of Language,&quot; he will find how wonderfully, by the help of analogy and metaphor, the
uses and meanings of simple words and sounds have been indefinitely increased, so as to
subserve the growing need of mankind to express more and more complex ideas. Mr. Tylor is
rather unfortunate in his illustration of words for the form of which no cause can be assigned,
when he says: &quot;There is no apparent reason why the word <em>go</em> should not have signified the idea
of coming, and the word <em>come</em> the idea of going.&quot; But, in accordance with the examples already
<font color="990000">[[p. 245]]</font> given, there <em>is</em> a very good and sufficient reason. We pronounce <em>come</em> with a closure
and contraction of the lips and usually during inspiration, <em>go</em> with open and protruding lips and
usually during expiration. Now many savages point with the lips as we do with the finger,
signifying <em>there</em>, by protruding the lips in the direction to be indicated; and any one who has seen
this curious gesture must be struck with its close similarity to the protrusion of the lips in
pronouncing the word <em>go</em>. The same difference of the nearly closed or open lips characterises the
words for these two ideas in many other languages. In French we have <em>viens</em> and <em>va</em>, in German
<em>komm</em> and <em>geh</em>, in Italian <em>vieni</em> and <em>vai</em>, showing that words in distinct languages differing greatly
in spelling and pronunciation may yet have a common character in the mode of speaking which
indicates their common meaning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The five following chapters treat of the Arts of Life, a subject which Mr. Tylor has to a great
extent made his own, and which he discusses in a very interesting manner. The doctrine of
development in the arts is however somewhat strained when it is implied that the modern gun is
an outgrowth of the South American or Indian blow-tube; while the origin of bank notes, and the
account of the rise and progress of mathematics are hardly anthropology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next two chapters discuss the ideas of savage man as to the spirit-world, and the origin
and development of myths; while the final chapter gives an admirable sketch of man as a social
being, and of the development of that complex organism, Society. This thoughtful chapter cannot
be epitomised, but the reader will find in it much curious information as to the sources of many
of the customs, laws, and observances of civilised life, which are shown to be often traceable
among the lowest savages. The following passage will serve to illustrate the author's style and
treatment of his subject:--</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Much of the wrong-doing of the world comes from want of imagination. If the drunkard
could see before him the misery of next year with something of the vividness of the present
craving, it would overbalance it. Oft-times in the hottest fury of anger, the sword has been
sheathed by him across whose mind has flashed the prophetic picture of the women weeping
round the blood-stained corpse. The lower races of men are so wanting in foresight to resist
passion and temptation, that the moral balance of a tribe easily goes wrong, while they are rough
and wantonly cruel, much as children are cruel to animals through not being able to imagine what
the creatures feel. What we now know of savage life will prevent our falling into the fancies of
the philosophers of the last century, who set up the 'noble savage' as an actual model of virtue to
be imitated by civilised nations. But the reality is quite as instructive, that the laws of virtue and
happiness may be found at work in simple forms among tribes who make hatchets of sharpened
stones and rub sticks together to kindle fire. Their life, seen at its best, shows with unusual
clearness the great principle of moral science, that morality and happiness belong together--in
fact that morality is the method of happiness.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reader who wishes to know what is the outcome of modern research into the nature,
characteristics, and early history of man; and into his progress in the arts of life, in morality, and
in social economy, will find a store of valuable information and much suggestive remark in this
carefully-written but unpretending volume.</p>

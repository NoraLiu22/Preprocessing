<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">So
far ...</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In this course we have mainly discussed
evolution within species, and evolution leading to speciation. Evolution
by natural selection is caused by the interaction of populations/species
with their environments.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Today
...</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, the environment of a species is
always partly <b><font color="#ff0000">biotic</font></b>. This brings up
the possiblity that the "environment" itself may be evolving. Two or more
species may in fact <b><font color="#ff0000">coevolve</font></b>. And <b><font color="#ff0000">coevolution</font></b>
gives rise to some of the most interesting phenomena in nature.</font>

</p><hr width="100%">
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">What
is coevolution?</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At its most basic, <b><font color="#ff0000">coevolution</font></b>
is defined as <b><font color="#ff0000">evolution in two or more evolutionary
entities brought about by reciprocal selective effects between the entities</font>.</b>
The term was invented by Paul Ehrlich and Peter Raven in 1964 in a famous
article: "Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution", in which they
showed how genera and families of butterflies depended for food on particular
phylogenetic groupings of plants.&nbsp; We have already discussed some
coevolutionary phenomena:</font>
</p><blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">For example, <b>sex and recombination</b>
may have evolved because of a <b>coevolutionary arms race</b> between organisms
and their parasites; the rate of evolution, and the likelihood of producing
resistance to infection (in the hosts) and virulence (in the parasites)
is enhanced by sex.</font></li>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have also discussed <b>sexual selection</b>
as a coevolutionary phenomenon between female choice and male secondary
sexual traits. In this case, the coevolution is <b>within a single species</b>,
but it is a kind of coevolution nonetheless.</font></li>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of our problem sets involved frequency
dependent selection between two types of players in an <b>evolutionary
"game"</b>. The "game theory" underlying this idea could be either between
species (as in interspecific competition) or within species (different
morphs of the same species) competing for a resource such as food or females.
Evolutionary interactions such as this will often produce coevolution.</font></li>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the rest of this lecture, we will be referring
only to between-species coevolution.&nbsp; Because a very large part of
all evolutionary biology involves coevolutionary interactions, we have
to pick and choose the examples we treat.&nbsp; We can choose from among
many types of adaptive radiation, or of parasite/host evolution (e.g. coevolution
of vertebrates and their diseases).&nbsp; However, many of the best-studied
examples which we shall discuss are to be found among the organisms with
most species, insects.</font>
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff">Coevolution
and interspecific interactions</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Coevolution might occur in <b>any interspecific
interaction</b>. For example:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ff0000">Interspecific competition
for food or space</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ff0000">Parasite/host interactions</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ff0000">Predator/prey interactions</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ff0000">Symbiosis</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ff0000">Mutualisms</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, tight interspecific interactions
do not always lead to coevolution. <b>Mimicry</b>, for example, can be
a parasite/host interaction (in Batesian mimicry) or a mutualism (M&uuml;llerian
mimicry, see earlier lecture). Mimicry creates exactly the kinds of ties
between species that might lead to coevolution, but in practice there are
rather good reasons why adaptation may be unilateral rather than coevolutionary:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Palatable <b>Batesian mimics</b>
adapt to the unpalatable model by copying its pattern, but the model may
not be able to escape its parasite.&nbsp; The first model individuals with
a new, non-mimicked pattern would also lose the protection of their own
species' warning pattern. Thus we can hypothesise that "<b>coevolutionary
chase"</b> <b>is</b> an <b>unlikely</b> outcome of Batesian mimicry.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In <b>M&uuml;llerian mimicry</b> the most
abundant and noxious species will also be trapped by its own pattern; any
individuals that mimic a rarer or less noxious species will lose the protection
of their own species' pattern even though, once the new mimetic pattern
became common, both species would ultimately benefit. In contrast, the
rarer or less noxious species always gains by mimicking the more common
or noxious species, because its own species' protection is weaker than
the other's. <b>Mutual convergence is therefore unlikely</b> because of
these difficulties for the initial mimetic variants, in spite of the fact
that the outcome, once achieved, is mutualistic.</font></p></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thus, mimicry is a good example showing that
<b>coevolution
</b>does
not always result from interspecific interactions. In mimicry, perhaps
surprisingly, the outcome seems almost always to produce
<b>unilateral
adaptation</b> by one species to the other.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In general, there is much discussion about
the likelihood of coevolution in cases where more than one species is involved
in an evolutionary interactions. An "Ockham's Razor" approach to proving
coevolution requires that we should first <i>disprove</i> the simpler hypothesis
of unilateral adaptation.</font>
<br>
</p><hr width="100%">
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Types
of coevolution</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Answers to the question "How likely is
coevolution?" depends what you mean by coevolution! Various types have
been proposed:</font>
</p><blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In <b><i><font color="#3333ff">specific
coevolution</font></i></b>, or <b><i><font color="#3333ff">coevolution
in the narrow sense</font></i></b>, in which one species interacts closely
with another, and changes in one species induce adaptive changes in the
other, and vice-versa. In some cases, this adaptation may be polygenic;
in other cases, there may be
<i>gene-for-gene coevolution</i>, in which
the mutual interactions are between individual loci in the two species.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Specific coevolution may of course be short-lived,
but if the interaction is very close, as in many host-parasite systems,
<b><i><font color="#3333ff">concordant
speciation</font></i></b> or <b><i><font color="#3333ff">cospeciation</font></i></b>
may result; where the speciation in one form causes speciation in another.
Of course, cospeciation doesn't necessarily require coevolution.&nbsp;
For example, a very unimportant but highly host-restricted parasite may
always speciate whenever its host speciates, without the parasite causing
any evolutionary reaction in the host.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In <b><i><font color="#3333ff">diffuse
coevolution</font></i></b>, also called <b><i><font color="#3333ff">guild
coevolution</font>,</i></b> whole <i>groups</i> <i>of species</i> interact
with other groups of species, leading to changes that cannot really be
identified as examples of specific, pairwise coevolution between two species.
For example, a group of plant species may be fed on by a particular family
of insects, which may frequently (in evolutionary time) change hosts. The
plants may evolve defensive adaptations, such as defensive chemistry, or
physical defenses such as spines, which work against large numbers of the
species. In time, some of the insects may be able to overcome the plant's
defences, leading to further evolution by the plant, and so on.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another related type of evolution is called
<b><i><font color="#3333ff">escape-and-radiate
coevolution</font></i></b>. Here, an evolutionary innovation by either
partner in a coevolutionary interaction enables an
<i>adaptive radiation</i>,
or speciation due to the availability of ecological opportunity. For example,
it is easy to imagine that this could be a result of the diffuse kind of
herbivore-plant coevolution described above.</font></p></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is interesting that Ehrlich and Raven almost
certainly did not mean specific coevolution in their original paper about
the evolutionary interactions between butterflies and their host plants.
Some people today even go so far as to say that they were not talking about
coevolution at all.</font>
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Concordant
and non-concordant phylogenies</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Phylogenies are very useful in the study
of coevolution.&nbsp; If the phylogenies of two closely associated groups,
such as host and parasite, are concordant (see overhead), this may imply:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">That cospeciation has occurred, or</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">That one of the groups (often the parasite)
has "colonized" the other (the host).&nbsp; Here, host shifts by the parasite
may well correspond to the host phylogeny, but only because closely related
hosts are similar, and liable to colonization by closely-related parasites.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In other cases, phylogenies may not be concordant,
because the parasite may be able to switch between host lineages fairly
frequently (see examples on overheads).</font>
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Host/parasite
and predator/prey coevolution</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, as we have seen, even contemporaneous
cospeciation with concordant phylogenies does not prove that two lineages
have coevolved.&nbsp; Instead, we can look at individual adaptations of
the interacting species to get an idea of whether coevolution has taken
place.&nbsp; Here are some examples:</font>
<br>
</p><hr width="100%">
<b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff">Defences of
plants against herbivores</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Plants have many complex chemicals, called
"secondary chemicals", which are not obviously used in normal metabolism.&nbsp;
Ehrlich and Raven and others subsequently interpreted this "secondary chemistry"
as an example of defensive adaptation by the plants. Many of these compounds
(for instance, tannins and other phenolic compounds, alkaloids like nicotine,
cocaine, opiates and THC, or cyanogenic glycosides) are highly toxic.&nbsp;
Many animals such as insects have adapted to feeding exclusively on plants
with particular defensive chemistry.&nbsp; If the plants evolved secondary
chemistry to avoid insects, and insects evolved to handle the plant chemistry,
then&nbsp; plant/insect coevolution has occurred.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, critics argue that:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">phytophagous insects are usually rare, and
therefore do not pose a threat to their host plants</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">secondary chemistry may be a byproduct of
normal metabolic processes, rather than necessarily defensive</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">To find evidence for coevolution, we must
show that specific poisons or other defenses work against specific insects,
or that they become less necessary when the insects are not present.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b><i><font color="#3333ff">Ant-acacias.
</font></i></b>Good
evidence for insect/plant coevolution is found in the Central American
plant known as "bullshorn <i>Acacia</i>", <i>Acacia cornigera</i>.&nbsp;
This plant is similar to other members of the genus <i>Acacia</i> (thorn
trees in the pea family), in that it has large spines which presumably
protect it against mammalian herbivores (another example of coevolution,
presumably against mammalian browsers).&nbsp; However, it lacks the cyanogenic
glycosides (cyanide-producing chemicals) found in related <i>Acacia</i>
and the thorns in this species are particularly large and hollow, and provides
shelter to a species of <i>Pseudomyrmex</i> ant. The plant also provides
proteinaceous food bodies on the tips of the leaflets, which sustain the
ant colonies. These ants are particularly nasty (I can tell you from personal
experience!), and are well able to deter even mammals with their wasp-like
stings.&nbsp; It has been shown experimentally that the ants will also
remove any caterpillars from the leaves that they patrol.&nbsp; The ants
even remove vines and plants from around the base of the tree, creating
a bare patch on the soil.&nbsp; Plants of the bullshorn
<i>Acacia</i> which
have not been occupied by ant colonies are heavily attacked by herbivores
and often have vines growing in the branches.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Related <i>Acacia</i> species lack hollow
thorns and food bodies, and do not have specific associations with ants.&nbsp;
They also have many cyanogenic glycosides in their leaves.&nbsp; This data
strongly supports the idea that the bullshorn
<i>Acacia</i> has evolved
a close, mutualistic association with the ants in order to protect themselves
from herbivores (and also plant competitors).&nbsp; It also supports the
idea that the cyanogenic glycosides found in other species have a defensive
role; a role which has been taken over by
<i>Pseudomyrmex</i> in the bullshorn
<i>Acacia.</i></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b><font color="#3333ff"><i>Egg mimicry
in </i>Passiflora<i>. </i></font></b>Similarly, we have already given examples
of egg-mimicry in <i>Passiflora</i>, which protects plants against species
of <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies.&nbsp; Female <i>Heliconius</i> avoid
laying eggs on plants already occupied by eggs, because first instar larvae
of <i>Heliconius</i> are highly cannibalistic; the plants exploit this
habit of <i>Heliconius</i> by creating fake yellow eggs as deciduous buds,
stipule tips, or as part of the "extrafloral nectaries" on young leaves.&nbsp;
Clearly, the plant, whose defenses of cyanogenic glycosides, alkaloids,
and a host of other secondary compounts, have been breached by <i>Heliconius</i>,
has counterevolved new defenses against this genus.</font>

<hr width="100%">
<b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff">Predator-prey
coevolution</font></font></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Predators have obviously evolved to exploit
their prey, with hunting ability being at a premium.&nbsp; Mammalian predators,
for example, must be fast, strong and cunning enough to be able to catch
their prey.&nbsp; It is almost as obvious that prey have evolved to protect
themselves from predators.&nbsp; They may have a variety of defenses:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Large size and strength</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Protective coverings such as shells or hard
bony plates</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Defensive weapons, such as stings or horns</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Defensive coloration (see mimicry lecture)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unpalatability and nastiness</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Clearly these features also represent examples
of coevolution.&nbsp; We have already pointed out that it is thought <b>un</b>likely
that <i>mimics</i> coevolve with their <i>models</i> in Batesian or M&uuml;llerian
mimicry systems.&nbsp; These mimicry systems are nonetheless examples of
coevolution, but with their <i>predators</i> rather than with their <i>mimics!</i></font>
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Some
very specialized coevolved pollination systems</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Two of the most famous are figs and fig-wasps,
and <i>Yucca</i> and Yucca moths (<i>Tegeticula</i>).</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In both cases, the larvae are seed/flower
eaters, which reduce the fertility of the flowers or inflorescences they
infest.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In both cases, the plant is completely
dependent on its herbivore for pollination.&nbsp; The arrangement is therefore
a tightly coevolved mutualism, in which the plant relies exclusively on
the insect for pollination, and the insect relies exclusively on the plant
for food.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the case of the Yucca moth the mutualism
has sometimes broken down, and some clades of the moth have reverted to
a parasitic mode of life -- they oviposit in the plant, but do not pollinate
-- the ancestral condition for the moths.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These examples are interesting because
they represent cases where mutualisms have become so specific that they
almost rival the ancient prokaryotic mutualisms of mitochondria and chloroplasts
with archaebacterial cells, to produce what we now know as eukaryotes.</font>
<br>
</p><hr width="100%">
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Coevolutionary
competitive interactions and adaptive radiation</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is an ecological principle (Gause's
principle) that related species must differ in some part of their ecology.
If two species have identical or nearly identical resources, <b><i><font color="#ff0000">competitive
exclusion</font></i></b> will result, and the less well adapted species
will go extinct.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If this is true, and it probably is, the
reverse should also occur.&nbsp; If a species colonizes an area where its
competitors do not occur, then it may experience <b><i><font color="#ff0000">ecological
release</font></i></b>, and grow to very large population sizes.&nbsp;
Not only that, the colonists may also experience disruptive selection,
followed by speciation. The process can be repeated for multiple species,
which evolve apart from one other to form an <b><i><font color="#ff0000">adaptive
radiation</font>.</i></b></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many examples of this principle are known
in island colonists.&nbsp; For example, we have already come across the
Darwin's finches of the Galapagos islands, which have evolved into a whole
range of seed-feeding and insectivorous forms.&nbsp; A similar, although
much more diverse radiation occurs in the Hawaiian archipelago: the Hawaiian
honeycreepers.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sometimes, the islands are "<b><i><font color="#ff0000">ecological
islands</font></i></b>" rather than actual islands.&nbsp; A number of lakes
in the North temperate zone were left behind during the retreat of the
ice.&nbsp; These lakes have in the last 10,000 years been colonized by
a variety of fish.&nbsp; In many cases of stickleback and the trout family,
multiple forms have now been produced in each lake or large fresh water
body.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sticklebacks in Canada (<i>Gasterosteus</i>)
often produce <b><i>benthic</i></b> (deep water) and <b><i>limnetic</i></b>
(shallow water) forms (see overhead), which appear to have specialized
feeding differences.&nbsp; These forms also keep to their own habitat,
and may mate assortatively.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Similarly, the Atlantic char (<i>Salvelinus</i>)&nbsp;
in Thingvallavatn, Iceland's largest lake, have produced no less than FOUR
different trophic forms; similar examples are known from Norway and Ireland
for other salmonids.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff">Adaptations leading
to ecological release, and "escape and radiate" coevolution</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As well as the colonization of new habitat,
the possession of a unique adaptation may also allow adaptive radiation
to colonize a new "adaptive zone" opened up as a result.&nbsp; There is
good evidence for this:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A massive phylogenetic study of beetles by
Brian Farrell showed that new adaptations for herbivory on flowering plants
led to massive amounts of speciation.&nbsp; Most of the diversity of species
of beetles is in the herbivorous clades (overhead).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The evolution of resin- or latex-bearing canals
allowed plants carrying them a more rapid speciation rate than among sister
taxa that lacked these adaptations.&nbsp; Latex and resin is a physical
defence against herbivorous insects.</font></li>
</ul>

<hr width="100%">
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Conclusions</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Evolutionary interactions between species,
and coevolution show that the complexity of genetic evolution goes on increasing,
even beyond the species level.&nbsp; Coevolution represents an area where
genetics, ecology, phylogeny all interact.&nbsp; To understand the evolution
of life fully, the interactions between individuals and species must be
explored at many levels.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One thing is clear; the majority the diversity
of life and life forms is not just due to adaptation to static environments;
biotic interactions are probably much more important.&nbsp; The biotic
environment is itself constantly evolving, leading to orders of magnitude
more diversity possible than could be produced by evolutionary adaptation
to simple physical conditions.</font>

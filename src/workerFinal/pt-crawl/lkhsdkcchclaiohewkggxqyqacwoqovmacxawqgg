                        Most landscapes show obvious evidence of erosion. Erosion
                        is responsible for the creation of hills and valleys.
                        It removes sediments from areas that were once glaciated,
                        shapes the shorelines of lakes and coastlines, and transports
                        material downslope from elevated sites. In order for
                        erosion to occur three processes must take place: <b><a href="../physgeoglos/d.html#detachment">detachment</a></b>, <b><a href="../physgeoglos/e.html#entrainment">entrainment</a></b> and <b><a href="../physgeoglos/t.html#transport">transport</a></b>.
                        Erosion also requires a medium to move material. Wind,
                        water, and ice are the mediums primarily responsible
                        for erosion. Finally, the process of erosion stops when
                        the transported particles fall out of the transporting
                        medium and settle on a surface. This process is called <b><a
href="../physgeoglos/d.html#deposition">deposition</a></b>. <b>Figure 10w-1</b> illustrates
                        an area of Death Valley, California where the effects

                        from several sources. Mountain building creates a disequilibrium
                        within the Earth's landscape because of the creation
                        of relief. <b><a href="../physgeoglos/g.html#gravity">Gravity</a></b> acts

                        Gravity also acts on the mediums of erosion to cause

                      <p align="left"><a href="../physgeoglos/e.html#erosion"><b>Erosion</b></a> can

                        These three processes are often closely related and sometimes

                        may undergo detachment, entrainment, and transport many

                      <p align="left"><a href="../physgeoglos/e.html#erosion"><b>Erosion</b></a> begins
                        with the <b><a href="../physgeoglos/d.html#detachment">detachment</a></b> of
                        a particle from surrounding material. Sometimes detachment
                        requires the breaking of bonds which hold particles together.
                        Many different types of bonds exist each with different
                        levels of particle cohesion. Some of the strongest bonds
                        exist between the particles found within <b><a href=
"../physgeoglos/i.html#igneous_rock">igneous rocks</a></b>. In these materials,
                        bonds are derived from the growth of <b><a href="../physgeoglos/m.html#mineral">mineral</a></b> crystals
                        during cooling. In sedimentary rocks, bonds are weaker
                        and are mainly caused by the cementing effect of compounds
                        such as iron oxides, silica, or calcium. The particles
                        found in soils are held together by even weaker bonds
                        which result from the cohesion effects of water and the
                        electro-chemical bonds found in <b><a href="../physgeoglos/c.html#clay">clay</a></b> and
                        particles of <b><a href="../physgeoglos/o.html#organic_matter">organic

"../physgeoglos/b.html#biological_weathering">biological weathering</a></b> act to weaken
                        the particle bonds found in rock materials. As a result,
                        weathered materials are normally more susceptible than
                        unaltered rock to the forces of detachment. The agents
                        of erosion can also exert their own forces of detachment
                        upon the surface rocks and soil through the following

                          extreme stress on a very small area of a surface. Cavitation
                          only occurs when water has a very high velocity, and
                          therefore its effects in nature are limited to phenomenon

                        the process of particle lifting by the agent of erosion.
                        In many circumstances, it is hard to distinguish between
                        entrainment and detachment. There are several forces
                        that provide particles with a resistance to this process.
                        The most important force is frictional resistance. Frictional
                        resistance develops from the interaction between the
                        particle to its surroundings. A number of factors increase
                        frictional resistance, including: <b><a href=
"../physgeoglos/g.html#gravity">gravity</a></b>, particle slope angle relative
                        to the flow direction of eroding medium, particle <b><a href="../physgeoglos/m.html#mass">mass</a></b>,
                        and surface roughness.</p>
                      <p align="left">Entrainment also has to overcome the resistance
                        that occurs because of particle cohesive bonds. These
                        bonds are weakened by weathering or forces created by
                        the erosion agent (<b><a href="../physgeoglos/a.html#abrasion">abrasion</a></b>, <b><a href="../physgeoglos/p.html#plucking">plucking</a></b>, <b><a

                      <p align="left">The main force reponsible for entrainment
                        is <b><a href="../physgeoglos/f.html#fluid_drag">fluid
                        drag</a></b>. The strength of fluid drag varies with
                        the mass of the eroding medium (water is 9000 times more
                        dense than air) and its velocity. Fluid drag causes the
                        particle to move because of horizontal force and vertical
                        lift. Within a medium of erosion, both of these forces
                        are controlled by velocity. Horizontal force occurs from
                        the push of the agent against the particle. If this push
                        is sufficient to overcome friction and the resistance
                        of cohesive bonds, the particle moves horizontally. The
                        vertical lift is produced by turbulence or eddies within
                        the flow that push the particle upward. Once the particle
                        is lifted the only force resisting its transport is gravity
                        as the forces of friction, slope angle, and cohesion
                        are now non-existent. The particle can also be transported
                        at velocities lower than the entrainment velocities because
                        of the reduction in forces acting on it.</p>
                      <p align="left">Many hydrologists and geomorphologists
                        require a mathematical model to predict levels of entrainment,
                        especially in stream environments. In these highly generalized
                        models, the level of particle entrainment is relative
                        to particle size and the velocity of the medium of erosion.
                        These quantitative models can be represented graphically.
                        On these graphs, the x-axis represents the log of particle
                        diameter, and the y-axis the log of velocity. The relationship
                        between these two variables to the entrainment of particles
                        is described by a curve, and not by a straight line.</p>
                      <p align="left">The <b><a href="../physgeoglos/c.html#critical_entrainment_velocity ">critical
                            entrainment velocity</a> </b>curve suggests that
                            particles below a certain size are just as resistant
                            to entrainment as particles with larger sizes and
                            masses (<b>Figure 10w-2</b>). Fine silt and clay
                            particles tend to have higher resistance to entrainment
                            because of the strong cohesive bonds between particles.
                            These forces are far stronger than the forces of
                            friction and gravity.</p>

                            The curved line labeled &quot;erosion velocity&quot; describes
                            the velocity required to entrain particles from the
                            stream's bed and banks. The erosion velocity curve
                            is drawn as a thick line because the erosion particles
                            tends to be influenced by a variety of factors that
                            changes from stream to stream. Also, note that the
                            entrainment of silt and clay needs greater velocities
                            then larger sand particles. This situation occurs
                            because silt and clay have the ability to form cohesive
                            bounds between particles. Because of the bonding,
                            greater flow velocities are required to break the
                            bonds and move these particles. The graph also indicates
                            that the transport of particles requires lower flow
                            velocities then erosion. This is especially true
                            of silt and clay particles. Finally, the line labeled &quot;settling
                            velocity&quot; shows at what velocity certain sized
                            particles fall out of transport and are deposited.</td>

                        occur in four different ways:</p>

                            in air, water, and ice.
                          <li><a href="../physgeoglos/s.html#saltation"><b>Saltation</b></a> is
                            where the particle moves from the surface to the
                            medium in quick continuous repeated cycles. The action
                            of returning to the surface usually has enough force
                            to cause the entrainment of new particles. This process

                        Instead, we find that particles may undergo repeated
                        cycles of <b><a href="../physgeoglos/e.html#entrainment">entrainment</a></b>, <b><a href="../physgeoglos/t.html#transport">transport</a></b>,
                        and <b><a
href="../physgeoglos/d.html#deposition">deposition</a></b>. Transport depends
                        on an appropriate balance of forces within the transporting
                        medium. A reduction in the velocity of the medium, or
                        an increase in the resistance of the particles may upset
                        this balance and cause deposition. Reductions in competence
                        can occur in a variety of ways. Velocity can be reduced
                        locally by the sheltering effect of large rocks, hills,
                        stands of vegetation or other obstructions. Normally,
                        competence changes occur because of large scale reductions
                        in the velocity of flowing medium. For wind, reductions
                        in velocity can be related to variations in spatial heating
                        and cooling which create pressure gradients and wind.
                        In water, lower velocities can be caused by reductions
                        in discharge or a change in the grade of the stream.
                        Glacial flows of ice can become slower if precipitation
                        input is reduced or when the ice encounters melting.
                        Deposition can also be caused by particle <b><a href="../physgeoglos/p.html#precipitation">precipitation</a></b> and <b><a href="../physgeoglos/f.html#flocculation">flocculation</a></b>.
                        Both of these processes are active only in water. Precipitation
                        is a process where dissolved ions become solid because
                        of changes in the temperature or chemistry of the water.
                        Flocculation is a chemical process where salt causes
                        the aggregation of minute clay particles into larger
                        masses that are too heavy to remain suspended.</p>

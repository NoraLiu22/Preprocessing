<h3>Visitor Arrivals</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p>Visitor Arrivals shows number of travelers from abroad who have visited Japan, and is calculated uniquely by JNTO based on statistics on Immigration Control provided by the Immigration Bureau at the Ministry of Justice.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Definition of the Visitor Arrivals</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p>Visitor Arrivals to Japan are calculated based on the number of travelers of foreign nationality entering Japan provided by the Ministry of Justice. Those figures exclude permanent residents having Japan as their primary place of residence and include travelers entering Japan for the purpose of transit. Foreigners entering or re-entering Japan, such as expatriates and their families, and international students are included in Visitor Arrivals to Japan. Crew members are excluded.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Counting Visitor Arrivals</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p>Each instance of entry into the country/area is counted as one person.<br />(Example: If the same person visits Japan once in January and then once again in September, they are counted as two people)</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Difference Between Preliminary Figures, Provisional Figures and Definitive Figures for the Visitor Arrivals</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p>Preliminary figures are estimate figures published by JNTO the month following the month in question and are calculated to the nearest hundred.<br />Provisional figures are figures that are close to the definitive figures, and are announced two months after the release of the estimate figures. These are calculated to the nearest single digit. These figures also contain clear breakdowns of purposes of visit, showing numbers in terms of tourism, business and other purposes.<br />Definitive figures are the final figures calculated by JNTO using definitive yearly data published by the Ministry of Justice in July of the year following the year concerned. These figures are calculated to the nearest single digit.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Definition of Japanese Overseas Travelers</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p>This is the number of Japanese nationals who have traveled abroad.<br />JNTO uniquely calculates its figures using statistics on Immigration Control provided by the Immigration Bureau at the Ministry of Justice and publishes this information in conjunction with data on the Visitor Arrivals the month after the month concerned. After data is published, amendments are made in accordance with quick estimations, monthly reports and yearly reports released by the Ministry of Justice.</p>

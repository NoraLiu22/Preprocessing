/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 288]]</font> I venture 
          to hope that you will allow me space in your columns to express opinions 
          on this subject which are not popular with scientific men, and which 
          are evidently opposed to your own views as indicated in your recent 
          article on Science Reform. 
        
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public mind seems now to be going mad on the subject 
        of education; the Government is obliged to give way to the clamour, and 
        men of science seem inclined to seize the opportunity to get, if possible, 
        some share in the public money. Art education is already to a considerable 
        extent supplied by the State,--technical education (which I presume means 
        education in &quot;the arts&quot;) is vigorously pressed upon the Government,--and 
        Science also is now urging her claims to a modicum of State patronage 
        and support. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, sir, I protest most earnestly against the application 

          of public money to any of the above specified purposes, as radically 

          vicious in principle, and as being in the present state of society a 

          positive wrong. In order to clear the ground let me state that, for 

          the purpose of the present argument, I admit the right and duty of the 

          State to educate its citizens. I uphold national education, but I object 

          absolutely to all sectional or class education; and all the above-named 

          schemes are simply forms of class education. The broad principle I go 

          upon is this,--that the State has no moral right to apply funds raised 

          by the taxation of all its members to any purpose which is not directly 

          available for the benefit of all. As it has no right to give class preferences 

          in legislation, so it has no right to give class preferences in the 

          expenditure of public money. If we follow this principle, national education 

          is not forbidden, whether given in schools supported by the State, or 

          in museums, or galleries, or gardens, fairly distributed over the whole 

          kingdom, and so regulated as to be equally available for instruction 

          and amusement of all classes of the community. But here a line must 

          be drawn. The schools, the museums, the galleries, the gardens, must 

          all alike be <i>popular</i> (that is, adapted for and capable of being 

          fully used and enjoyed by the people at large), and must be developed 

          by means of public money to such an extent only as is needful for the 

          highest attainable <i>popular</i> instruction and benefit. All beyond 

          this should be left to private munificence, to societies, or to the 

          classes benefited, to supply. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In art, all that is needed only for the special 

          instruction of artists, or for the delight of amateurs, should be provided 

          by artists and amateurs. To expend public money on third-rate prints 

          or pictures, or on an intrinsically worthless book, both of immense 

          value on account of their rarity, and as such of great interest to a 

          small class of literary and art amateurs and to them only, I conceive 

          to be absolutely wrong. So, in science, to provide museums such as will 

          at once elevate, instruct, and entertain all who visit them is a worthy 

          and a just expenditure of public money; but to spend many times as much 

          as is necessary for this purpose in forming enormous collections of 

          all the rarities that can be obtained, however obscure and generally 

          uninteresting that they may be, and however limited the class who can 

          value or appreciate them is, as plainly, an unjust expenditure. It will, 

          perhaps, surprise some of your readers to find a naturalist advocating 

          such doctrines as these; but though I love nature much I love justice 

          more, and would not wish that any man should be compelled to contribute 

          towards the support of an institution of no interest to the great mass 

          of my countrymen, however interesting to myself.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the same reason I maintain that all schools 

          of art or of science, or for technical education, should be supported 

          by the parties who are directly interested in them or benefited by them. 

          If designs are not forthcoming for the English manufacturer, and he 

          is thus unable to compete with foreigners, who should provide schools 

          of design but the manufactures and the pupils who are the parties directly 

          interested? It seems to me as entirely beyond the proper sphere of the 

          functions of the State to interfere in this matter as it would be to 

          teach English bootmakers or English cooks at the public expense in order 

          that they may be able to compete with French <i>artistes</i> in these 

          departments. In both cases such interference amounts to protection and 

          class legislation, and I have yet to learn that these can be justified 

          by the urgent necessity of our producing shawls and calicoes, or hardware 

          and crockery, as elegantly designed as those of our neighbours. And 

          if our men of science want more complete laboratories, or finer telescopes, 

          or more expensive apparatus of any kind, who but our scientific associations 

          and the large and wealthy class now interested in science should supply 

          the want? They have hitherto done so nobly, and I should myself feel 

          that it was better that the march of scientific discovery should be 

          a little less rapid (and of late years the pace has not been bad), than 

          that Science should descend one step from her lofty independence and 

          sue <i>in form&acirc; pauperis</i> to the already overburthened taxpayer. 

          So if our mechanics are not so well able as they might be to improve 

          the various arts they are engaged in, surely the parties who ought to 

          provide them with the special education required are the great employers 

          of labour, who by their assistance are daily building up colossal fortunes; 

          and that great and wealthy class which is, professionally or otherwise, 

          interested in the constructive or decorative arts.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I maintain further, not only that the money spent 

          by Government for the purposes here indicated is wrongly spent, but 

          also that it is in a great measure money wasted. The best collectors 

          are usually private amateurs, the best workers are usually home students 

          or the employ&eacute;s of scientific associations, not of governments. 

          Could any Government institution have produced results so much superior 

          to those produced by our Royal Institution, with its Davy, Faraday, 

          and Tyndall, as to justify the infringement of a great principle? Would 

          the grand series of scientific and mechanical inventions of this century 

          have been more thoroughly and more fruitfully worked out, if Government 

          had taken science and invention under its special patronage in the year 

          1800, and had subjected them to a process of forcing from that day to 

          this? No one can really believe that we should have got on any better 

          under such a <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, while it is certain that much power 

          would have been wasted in the attempt to develop inventions and discoveries 

          before the age was ripe for them, and which would therefore have inevitably 

          languished and been laid aside without producing any great results. 

          Experience shows that public competition ensures a greater supply of 

          the materials and a greater demand for the products of science and art, 

          and is thus a greater stimulus to true and healthy progress than any 

          Government patronage. Let it but become an established rule that all 

          institutions solely for the advancement of science and art must be supported 

          by private munificence, and we may be sure that such institutions would 

          be quite as well supported as they are now, and I believe much better. 

          If they were not, it would only prove more clearly how unjust it is 

          to take money from the public purse to pay for that which science-and-art-amateurs 

          would very much like to have, but are not willing themselves to pay 

          for.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very common line of argument which attempts 
          to prove the wide-spread uses and high educating influences of art and 
          of science, are utterly beside the question. Every product of the human 
          intellect is more or less valuable; but it does not therefore follow 
          that it is just to provide any particular product for those who want 
          it, at the expense of those who either do not want, or are <font color="990000">[[p. 
          289]]</font> not in a condition to make use of it. Good architecture, 
          for instance, is a very good thing, and one we are much in want of; 
          but it will hardly be maintained that architects should be taught their 
          profession at the public expense. The history of old china, of old clothes, 
          or of postage stamps, are each of great interest to more or less extensive 
          sections of the community, and much may be said in each case to prove 
          the value of the study; but surely no honest representative of the nation 
          could vote, say, the moderate sum of a million sterling for three museums 
          to exhibit these objects, with a full staff of beadles, curators, and 
          professors at an equally moderate expenditure of &pound;10,000 annually, 
          and a like sum for the purchase of specimens. But if we once admit the 
          right of the Government to support institutions for the benefit of any 
          class of students or amateurs however large and respectable, we adopt 
          a principle which will enable us to offer but a feeble resistance to 
          the claims of less and less extensive interests whenever they happen 
          to become the fashion. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it be asked (as it will be) what we are to do 

          with existing institutions supported by Government, I am at once ready 

          with an answer. Taking the typical examples of the National Gallery 

          and the British Museum, I maintain that these institutions should be 

          reorganised, so as to make them in the highest degree entertaining and 

          instructive to the mass of the people;--that no public money should 

          be spent on the purchase of specimens, but what they already contain 

          should be so thoroughly cared for and utilised as to make these establishments 

          the safest, the best, and the most worthy receptacles for the treasures 

          accumulated by wealthy amateurs and students, who would then be ready 

          to bestow them on the nation to a much greater extent than they do at 

          present. From the duplicates which would thus accumulate in these institutions, 

          the other great centres of population in the kingdom should be proportionately 

          supplied, and from the Metropolitan centres trained officers should 

          be sent to organise and superintend local institutions, such a proportion 

          of their salaries being paid by Government as fairly to equalise the 

          expenditure of public money over the whole kingdom, and thus not infringe 

          that great principle of equality and justice which I maintain should 

          be our guide in all such cases.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This communication will doubtless call forth much 

          opposition, but I trust it will also elicit the support of some of those 

          eminent scientific men, who I know hold similar general views, and who 

          are so much better able than I am to explain and support them.</p>

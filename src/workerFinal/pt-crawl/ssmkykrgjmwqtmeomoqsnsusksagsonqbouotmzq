Uprooted by civil war, two peasant couples are split apart when the men – against the counsel of their wives – leave their families in search of greater fortune.</p>

<p>Ugetsu Monogatari is filmed in Mizoguchi’s distanced but all-encompassing camera style, full of flowing movement and respect for the action’s context, as the story of the men’s striving assumes the quality of an allegory. The film is especially celebrated for its subtly achieved supernatural elements: the spectral appearance of a boat through the mist, and the scenes in which the potter (Masayuki Mori) is lured to the castle of the mysterious Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo).</p>

<p>“Taking a journey through a watery, misty netherworld, the film is comfortable with the uncanny, but there are real-world lessons here about the toxicity of the male ego.” <strong>Donald Clarke</strong></p>

<p>“In Mizoguchi’s use of the moving camera – detached yet empathetic – to express the conflict between male and female drives, his ineffably beautiful anti-war ghost fable is unparalleled.” <strong>Graham Fuller</strong></p>

<p>“Mizoguchi’s contemplative style at its most expressively Bruegelesque.” <strong>Ramsey Campbell</strong></p>

<p>“Mizoguchi’s greatest film bridges the realms of reality and fantasy so effortlessly, as if both realms exist in a single construct.” <strong>Tom Gunning</strong></p>

Uprooted by civil war, two peasant couples are split apart when the men – against the counsel of their wives – leave their families in search of greater fortune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ugetsu Monogatari is filmed in Mizoguchi’s distanced but all-encompassing camera style, full of flowing movement and respect for the action’s context, as the story of the men’s striving assumes the quality of an allegory. The film is especially celebrated for its subtly achieved supernatural elements: the spectral appearance of a boat through the mist, and the scenes in which the potter (Masayuki Mori) is lured to the castle of the mysterious Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taking a journey through a watery, misty netherworld, the film is comfortable with the uncanny, but there are real-world lessons here about the toxicity of the male ego.” <strong>Donald Clarke</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In Mizoguchi’s use of the moving camera – detached yet empathetic – to express the conflict between male and female drives, his ineffably beautiful anti-war ghost fable is unparalleled.” <strong>Graham Fuller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mizoguchi’s contemplative style at its most expressively Bruegelesque.” <strong>Ramsey Campbell</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mizoguchi’s greatest film bridges the realms of reality and fantasy so effortlessly, as if both realms exist in a single construct.” <strong>Tom Gunning</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Kenji Mizoguchi","producer":"Masaichi Nagata","writer":"Matsutaro Kawaguchi, Yoshikata Yoda","featuring":"Masayuki Mori, Kinuyo Tanaka, Ichisaburo Sawamura"},"year":"1953","nameAndYear":"Ugetsu Monogatari (1953)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"Japan","runningTime":97,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":90,"tied":true,"category":"critics"},{"position":105,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":{"critics":[{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Azoury","slug":"philippe-azoury","name":"Philippe Azoury","sortName":"Azoury, Philippe","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Film Critic","country":"France","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/philippe-azoury"},{"firstname":"Abbas","surname":"Baharloo","slug":"abbas-baharloo","name":"Abbas Baharloo","sortName":"Baharloo, Abbas","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Film critic and historian","country":"Iran","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/abbas-baharloo"},{"firstname":"Miriam","surname":"Bale","slug":"miriam-bale","name":"Miriam Bale","sortName":"Bale, Miriam","type":"critic","jobTitle":"film programmer and critic","country":"USA","remarks":[{"type":"p","key":"Howard Hawks, Ernst Lubitsch, and Jacques Rivette are my favorite directors yet are absent from this list.

She zeroes in on one particular student from Poplar \"who’d been working in a dress shop for 5 years and she came to the university because she was determined that she wasn’t going to be like the other women in the shop who’d been there for 10 years.\" Rose read the first sentence aloud - \"Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress\" - and asked her students what they thought. \"She's not talking to me,\" said the student in question. For Rose, this was an illuminating experience, leading her to question \"what is contained in the 'we' of as authoritative a voice as George Eliot's,\" and to encourage skepticism about \"spurious forms of unity\" and \"the way in which literature encourages identifications.\"  "},"_owner":null},{"type":"p","key":"I was struck by this example.

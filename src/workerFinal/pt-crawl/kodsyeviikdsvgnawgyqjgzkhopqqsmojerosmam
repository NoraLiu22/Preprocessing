/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

		  --Wilson's 2000 and Raby's 2001 biographies of Wallace list his relative Rebecca Greenell as having died in 1826, thus conflicting with Wallace's statement in his autobiography that his family moved to Hertford in 1828 in connection with that event. But in 2008 George Beccaloni and I visited her gravesite in that town, and into the gravestone is in fact cut the date 1828 (moreover, her will was executed in late 1828).</p>
        <p>--Wallace was a reader of the <em>The Gardeners' Chronicle</em> as early 
        as 1841 or 1842, per comments in <em>My Life</em> (S729), Vol. 1, p. 193.</p>
		 <p>--It is known that in 1843 Wallace contacted the early
          British photographer W. H. Fox Talbot on an idea of his (<em>see</em> <a href="S712A.htm">S712a</a>),
          but it is not known who might have suggested he do so. Perhaps it was
          Thomas Sims, his future brother-in-law, who later became an early professional
          photographer, but it is not clear the two knew one another at that
          point. Another,  better, candidate is John Dillwyn Llewelyn
          (1810-1882), another early photographer, brother of Lewis L. Dillwyn
          and son of Lewis W. Dillwyn, both of whom Wallace knew from his early
          days at Neath, on. Further, J. D. Llewelyn was also an avid botanist,
          and was married to one of Fox Talbot's relatives. </p>
           <p>--A note was printed in the <em>Hereford Times</em> issue of 19 October 1844 to the effect that &quot;Kington. Mechanics' Institution. Some time ago a prize was awarded to Mr. A. R. Wallace, one of its members, for an essay on 'the best method of conducting the Kington Mechanics' Institution.' We are informed that it possesses great merit.&quot; The 2 November issue of the same paper contains an anonymous letter to the Editor agreeing as to the quality of the essay, but noting that it had been the only essay submitted for the prize! The <em>Hereford Journal</em> issue of 22 October printed the same first letter, though it referred to Wallace as &quot;Mr. A. Wallace.&quot; There has been some question as to whether the essay itself (designated item 'S1a' in my list) was in fact written by Wallace (instead of &quot;for him,&quot; or by some other Wallace) but I have just (May 2018) determined that Wallace's bosses at the time, the Sayce brothers, also held offices in the Kington Mechanics' Institution, so the referral, at least, seems very likely to be to him (and not some other Wallace). The essay  includes mentions of several of Wallace's pet themes of the time, so it also seems likely that, despite its somewhat erudite tone,  he was the one who composed it (or perhaps originally delivered it as a talk that was transcribed by someone who &quot;improved&quot; it). The newspaper letters remain somewhat puzzling.</p>
      <p>--In Wallace's <em>My Life</em>, published in 1905, he wrote: &quot;Some time in 1844 Mr. Spencer Hall gave some lectures on mesmerism illustrated by experiments.&quot; However, notes in the 15 and 22 February issues of the <em>Leicestershire Mercury</em> indicate that Hall's lectures in Leicester took place on 18 and 19 February 1845, several weeks before Wallace left the area. No evidence could be found that Hall also lectured in Leicester in 1844, though a note in the Saturday 18 March 1843 issue of the <em>Leicestershire Mercury</em> indicates that he  lectured (or was to lecture?) at the Mechanics' Institute in Leicester "on Thursday and Friday evenings." This was some nine months or more before Wallace arrived in town, however.</p>
      <p>--According to bibliographic records in the British online database COPAC, 
        the National Library of Wales holds three maps Wallace took part in making 
        circa 1845-1847: of Neath, Briton-Ferry Demesne, and Llantwit Lower. Images of these maps can now be viewed at John van Wyhe's  website &quot;Wallace Online.&quot; </p>     
      <p>--The first English edition of F. J. F. Meyen's
          <em>Grundriss der Pflanzengeographie</em>, published in 1846, lists Wallace
          as a subscriber. </p>    
		  <p>--According to a story printed on page 3 of the 25 December 1846 issue of <em>The Welshman</em>, the third annual meeting of the Neath Mechanics' Institution took place the preceding week, and included discussions regarding the erection of a building to house them. The story  mentions how "At a meeting of the Committee held on the 21st of August, a memorial and plan for a new building in which to hold the future meetings, drawn up by Mr. A. Wallace, was unanimously approved and adopted... Three plans with estimates for a desirable building have been prepared, two by Mr. Moxham, and one by Mr. A. Wallace."</p>
      <p>--<em>The Literary Gazette and Journal of the Belles Lettres, Science, 
        and Art</em> (London) issue of 16 July 1853 reports that at the 21 June 
        1853 meeting of the Linnean Society of London &quot;Mr. A. R. Wallace exhibited 
        drawings of <em>Leopoldina pulchra</em>, <em>Raphia taedigera</em>, <em>Bactris</em> 
        sp. &amp;c., as specimens of a work upon the palm-trees of the Amazon, 
        on which he is now engaged.&quot;</p>

      <p>--An entry for 15 August 1853 in the diary of Lewis
          Llewelyn Dillwyn (1814-1892), now in transcription online at https://collections.swansea.ac.uk/s/dillwyn-papers/page/dillwyn-diaries,
          notes an afternoon visit with &quot;Mr. Strickland and Mr. Wallace&quot; to show
          them &quot;my Labuan collections.&quot; I am not aware that Wallace, who was
          a follower of Hugh E. Strickland's ideas on classification, says anywhere
          that he actually ever met the man, but this record suggests he did,
          on this occasion. Dillwyn probably knew Strickland, as he had corresponded
          with him on several occasions, and Wallace knew Dillwyn; further, this
          date is just several months before Wallace departed for Singapore and
          Sarawak, and a discussion of the fauna of Labuan (a small island off
          the coast of northwestern Borneo) would have been of high interest
          to him (and Dillwyn later co-authored a book on Labuan faunas). Still, one cannot discount the possibility that some other
        &quot;Mr. Wallace&quot; was involved.</p>
		        <p>--On pages 22-26 of Wallace's <em>Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses</em> is a description of the species of the palm that produces the a&ccedil;ai beverage (then referred to as &quot;assai&quot;). Most of Wallace's discourse concerns the preparation and use of the extract, now an increasingly popular health drink additive.</p>
      <p>--<em>The Literary Gazette and Journal of the Belles Lettres, Science, 
        and Art</em> (London) issue of 11 March 1854 reports that Wallace was 
        made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society at their 27 February 1854 
        meeting.</p>
		</font>
      <p><font size="-1">--Page lxix of the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</em> for 1855 indicates that at their meeting of 26 February 1855 a "Letter from A. R. Wallace, Esq., F.R.G.S., the late explorer of the Rio Negro, to Dr. Shaw, dated Sar&aacute;wak, Nov. 1854, giving an account of Singapore and Malacca, as far as Mount Ophir, on his way to Borneo" was read. It apparently also was  read at that year's annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, as it appears in a list of presentations made in Section E, Geography and Ethnology, noted on page 5 of the 10 September 1855 issue of the <em>Glasgow Herald</em>. I have not found anywhere where the whole letter was printed.</font></p>
        <font size="-1"><p>--The 5 March 1856 issue of the <em>South Australian Register</em> (Adelaide) records that Wallace's paper 'On the Rio Negro' (S11) was discussed in some detail at the 24th monthly meeting of the Adelaide Philosophical Society, on 10 April 1855.</p>
      <p>--At a meeting held at Mitcheldean on 17 June 1856, the following words 
        were spoken (according to page vii of the <em>Proceedings of the Cotteswold 
        Naturalists' Club</em>, Volume 2, 1860): &quot;...These are 'hard times' 
        for those who will persist in drawing them, particularly when taken in 
        connection with a proposition of Mr. Alfred Wallace (referred to in the 
        [<em>Geological Quarterly Journal</em>, May, 1856, page lxvi-lxviii]) 
        'That every species has come into existence coincident both in time and 
        space, with a pre-existing closely allied species.' Although Mr. Hamilton, 
        the President, remarks that he thinks 'It may be doubted whether this 
        assumed law can be maintained as a universal generalization,' this is 
        a question which has not been and <em>must</em> be fairly worked out, 
        and must therefore long remain an open one amongst Geologists and Palaeontologists 
        who are <em>worthy</em> Members of such Associations as ours...&quot;</p>
<p>--The 18 April 1862 issue of the <em>Morning Post</em> reports that Wallace was elected a fellow of the Zoological Society of London at the monthly general meeting, held the day before at the Society's house in Hanover-square.</p>

			<p>--In Letter WCP1852.4051 in the Wallace Correspondence collection, Wallace to Darwin dated 30 September 1862, Wallace notes that he had returned from Devonshire to ("arrived" at) 5 Westbourne Terrace on "Saturday", presumably the 27th. This bears on assessing the length of his visit to Rajah Brooke's estate in the former location.</p>
	      <p>--Page 8 of the <em>Leicestershire Mercury</em> issue of 13 December 1862 reports on a paper Henry Walter Bates gave at a Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society meeting. Bates is quoted as saying &quot;In the autumn of 1847, Mr. A. R. Wallace, whose acquaintance I had made when he was one of the junior masters of the Leicester Collegiate School, proposed to me, that we should make together a voyage to explore the Natural History of the banks of the great river Amazon... Mr. Wallace was led to choose the Amazon, from having read a pleasantly written little book, which had been recently published on the subject by Mr. Edwards, a North American artist.&quot; </p>
      <p>--Page xlii of The British Association for the Advancement of Science's <em>(Annual) 
        Report</em> for 1862 (published 1863) notes the petition that &quot;Dr. Gray, 
        Dr. Sclater, Mr. Alfred Newton, and Mr. Wallace be a Committee to report 
        on the Acclimatization of Domestic Quadrupeds and Birds, and how they 
        are affected by migration.&quot;</p>
      <p>--Wallace was elected &quot;by acclamation&quot; to the Entomological Society of 
        London at their meeting of 1 June 1863.</p>
      <p>--Various British Association for the Advancement of Science <em>(Annual) 
        Report</em>s indicate that Wallace was elected to that body in 1863.</p>
      <p>--In 1863 Wallace was appointed to a committee to review the zoological
         nomenclature rules that had been set up by Hugh E. Strickland in 1842.
         According to a committee report in the <em>Report of the Thirty-Fifth
          Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement for Science</em> 
        (for the meetings held in 1865 in Birmingham), at that meeting &quot;Mr. Wallace
         had brought with him a written memorandum containing notes of what he
         thought could be altered or modified with advantange. The members present
         then read over the printed rules and recommendations one by one, and
        carefully  compared them with the memoranda above mentioned, as well
        as with many  letters from other naturalists...&quot; (p. 27). Gordon McOuat
        writes (&quot;Species, 
        Rules, and Meaning: The Politics of Language and the Ends of Definitions
         in 19th Century Natural History,&quot; <em>Studies in History &amp; Philosophy
          of Science</em> 27(4): 473-519, on p. 514): &quot;...Strickland had said
          in  1838 that 'A name whose meaning is glaringly false may be changed.'
          Among  those opposing this line was Alfred Russel Wallace, who wanted
          it deleted  from the 2nd edition of the Rules issued by the BAAS in
          1863. He was not  successful.&quot; </p>
      <p>--According to the 44th annual report of the Leeds Philosophical
          &amp; Literary Society, Wallace gave his talk 'On the Varieties of Man
          in the Malay Archipelago' before that body at a meeting during the
          1863-64 session. </p>
      <p>--on page 495 of a feature called 'London Correspondence' in Volume Three 
        of the <em>Canada Medical Journal</em>, Wallace is mentioned as having 
        resided during the 1865 Birmingham BAAS meetings with Dr. William Turner, 
        Professor R. P. Howard of Montreal, and Dr. Gibb of London.</p>
      <p>--According to Gerald E. Myers in his biography <em>William James: His 
        Life and Thought</em> (1986), James's first known publication as of that 
        date was his anonymous review of Wallace's paper 'The Origin of Human 
        Races and the Antiquity of Man...' (S93) for the <em>North American Review</em> 
        in July 1865.</p>
       <p>--According to a note in the 18 April 1866 issue of the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>, Wallace married Annie Mitten on 5 April 1866, in Hurstpierpoint, Sussex.</p>
	   <p>--According to a note printed in the 21 June 1866 issue of the <em>London Standard</em> Wallace's signature was included on a memorial presented to Gladstone &quot;expressing a negation of the statement that scientific men were universally opposed to the removal of the natural history collection from their present location in the British Museum, and stating their opinion that it is of fundamental importance to the progress of the natural sciences in this country that the administration of the natural history collection should be separated from the library and art collections, and placed under one officer, who should be immediately responsible to one of the Queen's ministers.&quot;</p>
      <p>--According to pages 210-211 of Volume 2 of C. J. F. Bunbury's <em>The 
        Life of Sir Charles J. F. Bunbury Bart.</em> (1906), Wallace was present at
        a party at the Lyell's house on 11 December 1866 which was attended by 
        many notables (and Bunbury first met Wallace there).</p>
      <p>--Wallace was elected a member of the Ethnological Society of London 
        in 1866 and was a Council member in 1869-1870.</p>
      <p>--<em>The Joint Stock Companies' Directory for 1867</em> lists

        to the Society entitled 'On the Climate and Vegetation of the Tropics' 
        and 'On the Animal Life of the Tropics.'</p>
      <p>--<em>The Spiritual Magazine</em> issue of June 1868 includes a lengthy 
        response by the electrician Cromwell Varley to a letter from John Tyndall 
        requesting information on spiritualism from &quot;men with heavy scientific 
        appendages to their names,&quot; and forwarded to Varley by Wallace.</p>
		<p>--The usually reserved Joseph Hooker included the following words in his presidential address at the British Association for the Advancement of Science annual meetings in Norwich in 1868 (as recorded in the <em>Report</em> for that year): "...Many of the metaphysicians' objections have been controverted by that champion of Natural Selection, Mr. Darwin's true knight, Alfred Wallace, in his papers on 'Protection' and 'Creation by Law', &c., in which the doctrines of 'Continual Interference,' the 'Theory of Beauty,' and kindred subjects, are discussed with admirable sagacity, knowledge, and skill. But of Mr. Wallace and his many contributions to philosophical biology, it is not easy to speak without enthusiasm; for, putting aside their great merits, he, throughout his writings, with a modesty as rare as I believe it to be in him unconscious, forgets his own unquestioned claims to the honour of having originated, independently of Mr. Darwin, the theories which he so ably defends."</p>
        <p>--An ad in the 24 September 1868 issue of <em>The
          Bradford Observer</em> lists Wallace as being scheduled to give lectures
          on the 20th and 22nd of October as part of a series sponsored by

          of Arts) that on the 13th met with British government officials on
          the subject of the planned museum of science and art in the East End
          of London. </p>
          <p>--The <em>Human Nature</em> issue of May 1869 reports: "The Conferences at Gower Street are still maintained with unabated vigour. Mrs Hardinge has contributed much to their success. Mr Home has occasionally lent his aid. Mr A. R. Wallace, the eminent scientist, gave a valuable lecture on April 12, which was listened to with much interest."</p>
<p>--The British Association's annual <em>Report</em> series lists Wallace 
        as a vice-president of Section D, Biology, for the August 1869 meetings

George Bacon, William Bean, Robert Glass, William Parsons, and Alfred R. Wallace, have just issued a report. It refers to the formation of the committee at a private meeting of some of the holders of first and second Mortgage Bonds of this undertaking, held on the 5th ultimo. The constitution of the committee is then described, and a good deal of pointed matter, which cannot fail to be interesting to the holders of all classes of this company's securities, follows...&quot; </font></p>
      <font size="-1"><p>--According to a note printed in the 21 April 1870 number of <em>Nature</em>,

        by <em>Calandra granaria</em> and <em>C. oryzae</em>&quot; held during the 
        4 April 1870 meeting of the Entomological Society of London.</p>
      <p>--At a meeting of the Entomological Society of London held 4 July 1870, 
        Wallace is said to have &quot;mentioned instances of protective mimicry in 
        insects, recently observed by Mr. Everett in Borneo,&quot; according to a note 
        printed in the 11 August 1870 issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>
    <p>--A note in the 26 November 1870 issue of <em>Athenaeum</em> goes as follows:
      &quot;Mr. A. R. Wallace writes to say that our statement that he has ready
      for publication 'An Answer to the Arguments of Hume, Lecky and others,
      against Miracles,' is calculated to mislead. The only foundation for it
      is the fact, that I lately read a paper with the above title at a private
      gathering; and a report of it, corrected by myself, had already appeared
      in print before your announcement.&quot;</p>
	  <p>--A note on page 3 of <em>The Dundee Courier & Argus</em> issue of 2 January 1871 mentions that the "following signatures have been recently received to the petition in favour of the medical education of women..."; Wallace's name is on the list.</p>
      <p>--An 1871 Land Tenure Reform Assocation pamphlet entitled 
        <em>Report of the Inaugural Public Meeting...</em> (held 15 May 1871,

      <p>--A note in <em>The Daily News</em> (London) issue of 30 May 1872 discusses the annual general meeting of the London Library the day before, including changes in the governing committee. Wallace is noted as having been replaced on that committee.</p>
        <p>--An ad in the 9 July 1872 issue of <em>The Standard</em> (London)
          indicates that at that point Wallace was one of four Directors of a
          company called Wood Close and Polgooth United Tin Mining Company (Ltd),
          whose object it was to develop a tin ore prospect in Cornwall. </p>
      <p>--The 28 November 1872 issue of <em>Nature</em> mentions that at the 
        18 November meeting of the Entomological Society &quot;Mr. Wallace forwarded 
        exuviae of some insect, apparently of the family <em>Tincina</em>, which 
        had committed ravages amongst the dried mosses and lichens collected by 
        Dr. Spruce, in Brazil.&quot;</p>
      <p>--According to a story appearing in the 31 October 1872 issue of <em>Nature</em>, 
        Wallace was named to a committee of the Royal Society formed to advise 
        on how the <em>H.M.S. Challenger</em> scientific expedition should be

      <p>--It is reported in the 30 January 1873 issue of <i>Nature</i> that Wallace 
        had just been elected to the Council of the Anthropological Institute 
        at their annual meeting.</p>

        February 1873, Wallace attended a lecture on 'The Failure of the
        Church of England a Reason for Its Disendowment' by Elias Bradford
        in Clayton on the 4th, and was given a place &quot;on the platform&quot; during
        the lecture.</p>
      <p>--A note in the 8 February 1873 issue of <em>Athenaeum</em> indicates
          that during the 4 February meeting of the Anthropological Institute
          a committee was set up &quot;for the purpose of promoting Psychological
          Research.&quot; Initial members included Wallace, Galton, Beddoe, Hyde
          Clarke, Forbes, Lubbock, and Tylor.</p>
      <p>--Issue No. 131 (21 November 1889) of the <em>Proceedings of the American 
        Philosophical Society Held at Philadelphia</em> indicates that Wallace 
        was Society Member no. 1724, elected 18 April 1873.</p>
		  <p>--According to a notice printed on page 1 of the 18 December 1873 issue of <i>The Morning Post</i> (London), Wallace was a Director of The Heatherside Nurseries Company (Limited), a company formed "for the purpose of purchasing and working the extensive and flourishing Nursery Grounds, situated at Heatherside, near Bagshot, Surrey."</p>
      <p>--Wallace was a member of the British National Association of Spiritualists, 
        and apparently was also a founder of the organization (it was formed in

      <p>--Catherine Berry's 1876 book <em>Experiences in Spiritualism</em> includes 
        the following passage on page 34: &quot;...On another occasion, we were at 
        a s&eacute;ance given by Miss Nichol, when the guitar was asked to be 
        placed on the table, whereupon the spirits began playing it, when a severe 
        blow was struck at one of the party, and the blood flowed from his temple. 
        The gentleman who was struck, Mr. Alfred R. Wallace, the eminent naturalist, 
        said--'It was my own fault entirely, I broke the conditions--the orders 
        were to join hands; and I was very curious to know what sort of hand was 
        playing the guitar, and that was the cause of the blow.' We again sat, 
        and saw no more of the wound, the spirits having used their endeavours 
        to heal it.&quot;</p>
      <p>--Wallace's help is acknowledged in the Preface to his friend Arabella 
        Buckley's book <em>A Short History of Natural Science</em>, published

        the information that <em>The Malay Archipelago</em>'s published price 
        was one pound eight shillings for the two volume 1869 edition, and seven

        edition sold for $2.50.</p>
      <p>--In a letter dated 2 July 1879 referring to Herbert Spencer's then newly-published 
        <em>Data of Ethics</em> (partially reproduced in the <em>Life and Letters 
        of Herbert Spencer</em> (1908)) Wallace writes: &quot;I must express my admiration 
        of the complete way in which you have developed the <em>true nature</em> 
        of ethics. On that aspect of the question I agree with you unhesitatingly 
        throughout . . . But I <em>doubt</em> if evolution alone, even as you 
        have exhibited its action, can account for the development of the advanced 
        and enthusiastic <em>altruism</em> that not only exists now, but apparently 
        has always existed among men . . . &quot;</p>
      <p>--Raphael Meldola's 27 January 1883 presidential address to the Essex 
        Field Club (reported in the June 1883 issue of the <em>Transactions of 
        the Essex Field Club</em>) includes mention that Wallace was still an 
        Honorary Member of the Club as of that time. According to its <em>Transactions</em>,

		<p>--A note in the June 1880 issue of <em>The Sentinel</em> (London) refers to a series of discussions held in February and March concerning the subject &quot;Art, Philanthropy, Spiritualism, Conversion, Roman Catholicism, Temperance,--their power over evil compared.&quot; &quot;Mr. A. R. Wallace&quot; is listed as having contributed a letter (which one assumes must have been read publicly) to the proceedings.</p>
        <p>--On page 249 of Volume 2 of the <em>Proceedings of the Birmingham Philosophical 
        Society</em> Wallace is mentioned as having given the lecture 'Probable

        <p>--According to the Essex Field Club's <em>Journal of Proceedings</em>, 
        Vol. 2 (1882), Wallace gave a winter Science Lecture entitled 'The Natural 
        History of Islands' to the Club at their meeting of 4 January 1881. It 
        notes that in response to a question he replied &quot;the essential point to 
        be decided was whether a fish, after being carried any considerable distance 
        in such a way [in a bird's stomach], could be disgorged alive, and asked 
        Mr. Harting whether he knew of such an occurrence.&quot;</p>
        <p>--Wallace is listed (in its proceedings) as an Honorary Foreign Member 
        of the Terzo Congresso Geografico Internazionale held 15-22 September 
        1881 in Venice (he did not attend). In 1890 and 1894 he is listed (in 
        their <em>Bollettino</em> series) as an Honorary Member of the Societ&agrave; 
        Geografica Italiana.</p>
      <p>--The <em>Land Nationalization</em> edition of 1909 indicates (on p. 
        210) that Wallace read <em>The Echo</em> as of October 1881; in 1877 <em>The 
        Echo</em> was called &quot;the most liberal of London newspapers&quot; on subjects 
        like agnosticism.</p>

        of lectures to that body as of that date: 'Nature in the Tropics' 
        (three lectures in 1867-68), and 'The Colours of Animals and Plants, 
        Their Causes and Their Uses' (two lectures in 1876-77).</font></p>
        <font size="-1"><p>--According to the news story &quot;The Nationalisation of the Land&quot; 
        that appeared in the 1 February 1882 issue of <em>The Freeman's Journal</em> 
        (Dublin), during an early meeting of the Land Nationalisation Society 
        on 31 January Wallace stated that &quot;one object of the society was 
        to support the particular scheme they had been discussing, and which he 
        had worked out some time ago.&quot; At the same meeting Henry George was 
        present, and reputedly &quot;urged them to unite on the broad priniciple, 
        and then not to fear to be too bold. He was in favour of the immediate 
        nationalisation of the land, and deprecated the awarding of any compensation&quot; 
        [i.e. for landlords].</p>
      <p>--According to Deborah Blum,<i> Ghost Hunters</i> (2006), p. 72, Wallace 
        attended the first meeting of the (British) Society for Psychical Research, 
        held 20 February 1882.</p>

          Mr. A. R. Wallace on the biological relations of New Zealand and Australia.&quot;</p>
      <p>--According to <em>The Belfast News-Letter</em> issue

Wallace, F.R.G.S., whose subject was 'The Natural History of Islands.' The theatre was crowded.&quot; </font></p>
          <font size="-1"><p>--According to a note in the 6 July 1882 issue of <i>Nature</i>, &quot;At 
        the summer commencements of the University of Dublin, held on June 29 
        last, the degree of LL.D. Honoris caus&acirc; was conferred on...Mr. Alfred 
        Russel Wallace.&quot; </p>
      <p>--The 1899 <em>Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</em> indicate 
        that Wallace was made an &quot;Honorary Member&quot; of that Society on 7 February 
        1883.</p>
      <p>--Wallace is listed as an &quot;Honorary or Corresponding Member&quot; of the Central 
        Association of Spiritualists, London, in the <em>Light</em> (London) issue 
        of 17 February 1883.</p>
      <p>--The <em>English Mechanic and World of Science</em> issue of 23 February 
        1883, page 564, indicates that &quot;On Monday evening, Mr. A. R. Wallace, 
        LL.D., lectured to the Birmingham and Midland Institute on 'Island Life.'&quot;</p>
		<p>--According to a note printed in the <em>Aberdeen Evening Express</em> issue of 27 March 1883, Wallace's signature was included on a memorial &quot;praying for the pardon of Prince Krapotkine,&quot; who had already been confined for five years.</p>
        <p>--<em>The Journal of Proceedings of the Essex Field Club</em>, Vol. 4 
        (1892), reports that on 31 March 1883 Wallace was made a member of the 
        Club's committee charged with exploration of Deneholes near Gray's Thurrock, 
        Essex. A field investigation took place during the period 13 October to 
        10 November 1883.</p>
			  
			  <p>--A story in the <i>Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette</i> issue of 6 June 1883 reports: "...I mentioned the name of Mr. Sellar, who was factor on the Sutherland estates. This gentleman was some relation--I am not sure that he was not the grandfather--of Mr. Craig Sellar, a respected and advanced member of the Liberal party in the present Parliament. The facts relating to the Sutherland estates were published first by Professor Wallace in his book, but at the solicitation of Mr. Craig Sellar this part of the work was expunged. Now, however, the full details are stated bluntly, and without either emasculation or concealment, in Mr. McKenzie's book, and in this form they will secure far wider currency than they would have done in the former volume. I suppose Mr. McKenzie is more independent than Prof. Wallace, or better able to bear the possible consequences of his strong writing. But there is enormous pressure brought to bear upon writers on these matters to prevent the free circulation of their opinions and the full statement of their facts..." </p>			  
			  
      <p>--<em>The Journal of Science</em> issue of August 1883 states that &quot;Mr. 
        A. R. Wallace has been elected a foreign member of the Dutch Society of 
        Sciences, at Haarlem.&quot;</p>
      <p>--The <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> issue of 11 October 1883 contains a long note titled &quot;The Nationalization of the Land&quot; on page 6 which begins: &quot;We have received a great number of letters in reply to Mr. Harrison's article on 'Nationalization of the Land.' Space does not permit of our printing them all, or any of them in full, but we give some of the many points of Mr. Harrison's critics:-- No part of Mr. Harrison's argument has provoked so much criticism as the assertion that the question was one with which the workmen in towns had no business to interfere. 'This most extraordinary statement,' writes Mr. Alfred Wallace, 'is a proof that Mr. Harrison has not sufficiently studied the works of Mr. George, or noted the growing feeling of householders in our large cities against the confiscation of their property by landlords or the grinding tyranny of agents.'...&quot; </p>
      <p>--<em>The Auk</em> issue of January 1900 contains a list indicating that 
        Wallace was elected an Honorary Member of the American Ornithologists' 
        Union in 1883.</p>
      <p>--As part of an advertisement for the book <em>The Natural
          Genesis</em> (by Gerald Massey; 1883) appearing at the book's end,
          a brief endorsement from Wallace (who apparently was privy to printers'
          proofs of the work) appears: &quot;Thanks for your great and wonderful work.
          I see it contains many things of profound interest. The sections on
          'Numbers' and 'Language' appear to me especially interesting.&quot;</p>
           <p>--Wallace  was possibly a vice-president of the London Society for the 
        Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination starting in March 1884. An unnumbered page following page 136 of the 1884 volume of <em>The Vaccinator Inquirer</em> contains a listing of the Society's officers, including what appear to be nearly fifty vice-presidents (although two of these are for some reason specially singled out under the &quot;Vice-Presidents&quot; category). </p>
      <p>--In the <em>Light</em> (London) issue of 9 August 1884 it is mentioned 
        that M. Madach Aladar's Hungarian translation of &quot;A Defence of Modern 
        Spiritualism&quot; is just appearing.</p>
           <p>--Page 8 of the <em>Belfast News-Letter</em> issue of 28 July 1885
          contains a quote from a Wallace letter replying to an invitation to
          attend the fourth International Anti-Vaccination Congress in Belgium:
          &quot;I beg to express my warmest sympathy with the cause which this Congress
          is assembled to advocate. I wish you speedy and complete success in
          overthrowing the cruel and despotic vaccination laws under which almost
          the whole civilised world now groans.&quot;</p>
		  <p>--In a note printed in the 8 August 1885 issue of the <em>Derby Daily Telegraph</em> it was reported that: &quot;At a conference on the land question on Friday evening [7 August 1885] it was resolved to urge the Government to appoint a land nationaliser on the proposed Royal Commission on the Depression of Trade. The names of Mr. W. Saunders and Dr. A. R. Wallace were submitted and approved.&quot;</p>
           <p>--A story in the 13 August 1885 issue of <i>Nature</i> relates how the 
        publisher Macmillan has decided to produce &quot;a new series of Geographical 
        Text Books&quot; to be edited by Archibald Geikie, and with the cooperation 
        of a number of figures, including Wallace.</p>
      <p>--The December 1885 number of <em>The Entomologist</em> includes a note 
        from Raphael Meldola dated 26 September 1885 that mentions he had stayed 
        &quot;at Lyme Regis in August, with my friend Mr. A. R. Wallace.&quot; At the 18 
        December 1886 meeting of the Essex Field Club, Meldola adds that &quot;they 
        had seen all round the coast the evidences of former landslips (some of 
        them being historical), the great masses of material slipping seawards 
        over the slippery beds of the Liassic Clays and then undergoing erosion 
        by the action of the sea&quot; (<em>Journal of Proceedings</em>, Vol. 4, cxcix).</p>
      <p>--Volume 40 of the <em>Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand 
        Institute</em> (1907) lists Wallace as having been made an honorary member 
        of the New Zealand Institute in 1885.</p>
      <p>--In a letter to the Editor published in the 30 January 1886 issue of 
        <em>Light</em> (London), William F. Barrett quotes a &quot;recent&quot; letter he 
        has received from Wallace: &quot;<em>I</em> am not at all dissatisfied with 
        the progress of the Society [for Psychical Research]'s work. The energy 
        of Messrs. Myers and Gurney is admirable, and I feel convinced that if 
        they go on much faster they will be classed with 'deluded Spiritualists,' 
        and will get no more attention from the literary public than the Spiritualists 
        themselves.&quot; Wallace would, however, increasingly sour on the Society's 
        approach.</p>
      <p>--According to a story in the 12 February 1886 issue of <em>Science</em>, 
        Wallace was involved in the initiation of the German spiritualism journal 
        <em>Sphinx</em>, along with William Barrett and Elliot Coues.</p>
      <p>--The 20 March 1886 issue of <em>Light</em> (London) describes in some 
        detail a paper delivered by Prof. William Barrett at the 6 March meeting 
        of the Society for Psychical Research. In the paper Barrett describes 
        a sitting he took part in with the medium Eglinton on 5 January 1878, 
        also attended by Hensleigh Wedgwood and his sister, F. W. H. Myers, and 
        Wallace.</p>
      <p>--<em>The Journal of Proceedings of the Essex Field Club</em>, Vol. 4 
        (1892), notes that Wallace attended the Club's 20 March 1886 meeting and 
        contributed to discussion on a lecture ('The Protective Value of Colour 
        and Attitude in Caterpillars') delivered on that date by Edward B. Poulton.</p>
      <p>--A story in the <em>New-York Evangelist</em> issue of 22 April 1886 
        reports that Wallace will be &quot;coming to the United States on the invitation 
        of Mr. Augustus Lowell of Boston, to deliver a course of eight lectures 
        before the Lowell Institute, in October . . . [and] will lecture in other 
        cities under the management of the Williams Lecture Bureau of Boston.&quot;</p>
      <p>--The Essex Field Club's <em>Journal of Proceedings</em>, Vol. 4 (1892), 
        indicates that Wallace gave a lecture entitled 'The Darwinian Theory: 
        What It Is, and How It Is Demonstrated' at the 2 October 1886 meeting 
        of the Club.</p>

R. Wallace, the distinguished English naturalist, now visiting this city...Much interest was shown by Mr. Wallace and other scientists present in a series of pictures representing the flight of a pigeon in a line slowly ascending. These pictures revealed a forward movement of the wings. Mr. Wallace suggested that a similar series representing the flight of a butterfly would afford an interesting study..."</p>
		  
<p>--A <em>Science</em> story from its 29 March 1889 issue indicates that 
        Wallace delivered a speech entitled 'The Great Problems of Anthropology' 
        to a 12 February 1887 special meeting of the Women's Anthropological Society 
        of America in Washington, D.C. (an event also mentioned in Wallace's <em>My

      <p>--The <i>Abstract of the Proceedings of the Anthropological Society</i> 
        (of Washington, D.C.) for 15 February 1887 indicates that Wallace gave 
        the talk 'Social Economy versus Political Economy' on their 
        119th regular meeting, on that date, at the Columbian University (now 
        Georgetown University). He was also elected an honorary member of the

Contrary to the general custom of the society, by which the managing committee select a theme for discussion, Prof. Wallace was given the privilege of choosing his own subject, and spoke upon "Modern Spiritualism," early giving evidence of being as strong an advocate of that phase of belief as of the theory of evolution, in connection with which he is better known to the public. Quite a spirited discussion followed his paper, participated in by Prof. Otis A. Mason, Prof. Eliot Coues, Judge and Mrs. A. J. Willard, Representative Wm. A. Springer and others...&quot;</p>

        237).</p>

      <p>--A note in the <i>Nature</i> issue of 10 October 1889
          indicates that Wallace was scheduled to present the first of a new
          series of twenty-one lectures sponsored by the Committee of the Sunday
          Lecture Society on 20 October at St. George's Hall, Langham Place,
          on 'The Origin
          and Uses  of the Colours of Animals.' An ad in the 19 October
          issue of <em>The Morning Post</em> (London) for the same presentation indicates
          that T. H. Huxley was the president of the Society, whose vice-presidents
          included George Darwin, George Romanes, Herbert Spencer, and John Tyndall.</p>

      <p>--A notice in the 2 November 1889 issue of <em>The York
          Herald</em> indicates that Wallace would give the first of a series of lectures
          sponsored by the Yorkshire Philosophical Society on the 8th of that
          month, on 'Colours of Animals.' </p>
      <p>--A note in the <i>Nature</i> issue of 5 December 1889 indicates Wallace 
        was presented with the degree of D.C.L., <i>honoris caus&acirc;</i>, from 
        Oxford, on 26 November 1889.</p>

        17 Feb. 1890: 6f; <em>The Medium and Daybreak</em> 28 Feb. 1890: 133a-135a).</p>
      <p>--A story in the 8 May 1890 issue of <em>The Dundee
            Courier &amp; Argus</em> reviews a lecture ('Colour in Animals--Its Origin and Use') Wallace
          gave under the auspices of the Castle Street Literary Society the night
          before. Profs. D'Arcy Thompson and Patrick Geddes were in attendance. </p>
      <p>--The 1890 volume of the <em>Proceedings</em> of the Dorset Natural History 
        and Antiquarian Field Club lists Wallace as a member of the club as of 
        that year; a note on page 7 of the 17 August 1889 issue of the <i>Southern Times and Dorset County Herald</i> states he had just been made a new member. However, a note on page 2 of the <em>Western Gazette</em> issue of 25 June 1909 states that he had just been made an &quot;honorary member&quot; of that organization. </p>
        <p>--Wallace was presented with the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's 
        Medal during their meeting of 23 May 1892.</p>
        <p>--A story in the 9 June 1892 issue of <i>Nature</i> reports that at the 
        Anniversary Meeting of the Linnean Society, 24 May 1892, Wallace was presented 
        with the society's Gold Medal &quot;in recognition of the service rendered 
        by him to zoological sciences by numerous valuable publications.&quot;</p>
        <p>--As part of a story printed in <em>The Californian</em> issue of September 
        1892, Elliot Coues mentions that during a trip to England in 1884 he &quot;had 
        the pleasure and the honor&quot; of being a guest at Wallace's house in Godalming.</p>
      <p>--A story in the 13 October 1892 issue of <em>The Dundee
          Courier &amp; Argus</em> indicates that Wallace was invited to take part in
          the funeral procession organized in honor of the death of Lord
          Tennyson (who died on the 6th). </p>
		  		  
<p>--On page 211 of her book <em>Recollections of a Happy Life</em> (1892), 
        Marianne North writes: &quot;...every one was against such an unconventional 
        idea, except my old friend Mr. Fergusson, and he wanted some good geographer 
        to make a model, and suggested consulting Francis Galton or Mr. Wallace... 
        Then I made a pilgrimage to see Mr. Wallace, and found him most delightful, 
        and much interested in my plan. He recommended asking Mr. Trelawney Saunders 
        to make my map, which he did...&quot;</p>
		<p>--A note on page 7 of the <em>Western Gazette</em> issue of 10 February 1893 indicates Wallace had just been &quot;appointed&quot; a vice-president of the newly-formed Chrysanthemum and Horticultural Society in the parish of Parkstone.</p>
        <p>--A story in the <em>Light</em> (London) issue of 4 March 1893 indicates 
        that Wallace was a member of the Advisory Council to the Psychical Congress 
        in Chicago, held 21-25 August 1893. Some others involved in the same capacity 
        included W. F. Barrett, Emma Hardinge Britten, William Crookes, Camille 
        Flammarion, Francis Galton, Ernst Haeckel, Carl Du Prel, Lord Rayleigh, 
        and Henry Sidgwick.</p>
        <p>--George H. Darwin (Charles Darwin's son) sent the following interesting 
        letter to the Editor of <em>The Times</em> (London), who printed it in 
        the 7 June 1893 issue: &quot;Sir,--The election of Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace 
        to the Royal Society last week has been commented on in the public journals 
        as showing the inefficiency of the method by which Fellows are elected. 
        It seems, therefore, only just to the Royal Society to state that it is 
        notorious that Mr. Wallace would have been elected at any time within 
        the last 35 years if he had ever allowed himself to be nominated.&quot;</p>
        <p>--In a 19 July 1894 letter to Norman Douglas printed on page 127 of Douglas's 
        1922 book <em>Alone</em>, Wallace indicates that he does &quot;not read 
        German.&quot;</p>
        <p>--On page 27 of the 1894 second edition of his <em>The History of Human 
        Marriage</em>, author Edward Westermarck adds excerpted quotes from a 
        Wallace letter he received concerning the relation between gestation periods 
        in apes and availability of food: &quot;...I have referred this important 
        statement to Mr. Alfred R. Wallace, who writes as follows: 'From the maps 
        of rain distribution in Africa in Stanford's &quot;Compendium,&quot; the 
        driest months in the Gorilla country seem to be January and February, 
        and these would probably be the months of greatest fruit supply.' As regards 
        the Orang-utan, Mr. Wallace adds, 'I found the young suckling Orang-utan 
        in May; that was about the second or third month of the dry season, in 
        which fruits began to be plentiful.'&quot; These remarks do not appear 
        in the first edition of the book.</p>
        <p>--Wallace is listed as an Honorary Corresponding Member of the Brooklyn 
        Ethical Association in their 1894-1895 By-Laws.</p>
        <p>--An anonymous letter to the Editor printed in the 25 May 1895 issue 
        of <em>Light</em> (London) mentions that theosophist Henry S. Olcott's 
        book <em>People from the Other World</em> is dedicated to William Crookes 
        and Wallace.</p>
		  
		  <p>--In <em>The Leeds Times</em> issue of 6 July 1895 there is an article on the then-recent deaths of Thomas Huxley (29 June 1895) and others ('The Tatler on Huxley and the God') in which the following words appear: "...each have completed the cycle of their years, and with the exception of Lord Kelvin and Russell Wallace, there is not now in England a pre-eminent voice to speak the authoritative parable of nature to the perplexed spirit of the time."</p>
		  
      <p>--An ad for the publishing firm Joseph Hughes
            and Co. placed in the 16 October 1895 issue of <em>The Standard</em> (London) includes mention of a book titled <em>Natural History for Infants</em>;
		  the author is given as Wallace's daughter Violet. <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> also lists the book in an ad in its 16 October 1895 issue, but I can find no other
            evidence of the existence of such a work.</p>
		  
		<p>--According to a note printed in the 23 November 1895 issue of <i>The Bournemouth Guardian</i>, Wallace played Joseph Henry Blake, an English chess master, in one of a series of simultaneous matches held earlier that month in Bournemouth. (Who won? The paper only says that Blake defeated "most" of his opponents...)</p>  
      <p>--The 1913-1914 volumes of the <em>Journal and Proceedings of the Royal 
        Society of New South Wales</em> lists Wallace as having been an Honorary 
        Member since 1895.</p> 
        <p>--Records at the College of Psychic Studies in London include the information 
        that Wallace signed as a &quot;Subscriber&quot; to the institution (then 
        called the London Spiritualist Alliance) on 13 August 1896, along with 
        several others (including Charles C. Massey and E. Dawson Rogers). A note in the 18 March 1911 of <em>Light</em> (London) reports that Wallace &quot;was one of the nine gentlemen who subscribed to the memorandum and articles of association when the London Spiritualist Alliance was incorporated in 1896.&quot;</p>
        <p>--According to <i>The Abridged Diaries of Charlotte Perkins Gilman</i> 
        (1998, p. 173) and <i>The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman; An Autobiography</i> 
        (1972, p. 211) Gilman visited Wallace at Parkstone on 24 October 1896, 
        during her lengthy visit to England. Wallace arranged and chaired a lecture 
        for her in a nearby hall; she spoke on 'Our Brains and What Ails 
        Them.' The second source indicates they &quot;played two games of 
        chess, one he won, one was a draw--which was better than I expected.&quot;</p>
        <p>--According to Volume 12 of the <i>Transactions of the the Hertfordshire 
        Natural History Society and Field Club</i> (1906) Wallace was elected 
        an honorary member of that group in 1896.</p>
		  
		  <p>--According to a story printed on page 4 of the <i>Yorkshire Factory Times</i> (Huddersfield) issue of 25 June 1897, Wallace felt "that both publisher and author [John C. Cobden] have rendered a great service to humanity in publishing" <i>The White Slaves of England</i>.</p>
		  
		<p>--The <em>Cheshire Observer</em> issue of 14 August 1897 notes that Wallace was one of several prominent scientists who had &quot;recently identified themselves with the [Cheshire Society of Natural Science] as honorary members.&quot;</p>
        <p>--A <em>Light</em> (London) notice in its 18 June 1898 issue indicates 
        that Wallace was the Chairman of the Thursday (23 June) afternoon session 
        of the International Congress of Spiritualists, in London. Papers were 
        presented by Prof. A. Alexander ('Brazilian Spiritism and Brazilian Evidence 
        for Psychic Phenomena') and Dr. Moutin ('The Relations Between Magnetism 
        and Spiritualism').</p>
		<p>--The <em>London Standard</em> issue of 28 June 1898 mentions a paper by Elis&eacute;e Reclus (revisiting his old idea of a giant scale model of the earth) read before the Royal Geographical Society the day before; it also notes &quot;Mr. A. R. Wallace wrote, vigorously maintaining his old project of a hollow globe.&quot;</p>
      <p>--A short note on page 6 of <em>The Daily Chronicle</em> (London)
          issue of 14 July 1898 reads: &quot;Dr. Russel Wallace asks why employers
          whose workpeople are done to death in dangerous trades should not be
          charged with manslaughter, and no doubt many people have asked themselves
          the same question...&quot;</p>
      <p>--On page 331 of an article by Charles Brodie Patterson titled &quot;Psychical Research&quot; in the September 1898 issue of <em>Mind</em>, Wallace is referred to as &quot;the greatest living English scientist.&quot; </p>
          <p>--<em>The Academy</em> (London) issue of 10 December
          1898 has a feature on pages 435-436 titled &quot;Favourite Books of 1898.
          Some Notable Readers.&quot; querying various celebrities on their two favorite
          books of the past year. Wallace was asked, and omitting novels, replied:
          <em>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</em>, and <em>Equality</em> (by Edward Bellamy).</p>
<p>--On page 23 of the 1898 volume of the <em>Proceedings of the Indiana 
        Academy of Science</em>, Wallace is listed as a &quot;Foreign Correspondent.&quot;</p>
        <p>--The <em>Light</em> (London) issue of 29 April 1899 carries a letter 
        to the Editor by &quot;Fiat Justitia&quot; concerning the magician J. Nevil Maskelyne's 
        &quot;exposure&quot; of a medium. Wallace's favorite motto was &quot;fiat justitia&quot; and 
        he later testified against Maskelyne in a court proceeding (see <a href="S637.htm">S637</a>), 
        so this letter may well have been by him.</p>
      <p>--An article in the 29 August 1899 issue of
            the <em>South Australian Register</em> (Adelaide) describes Wallace as &quot;foremost
          naturalist of the age.&quot;</p>
		  <p>--<em>The Daily News</em> (London) issue of 30 September 1899 notes that a &quot;National Memorial against the threatened war in South Africa&quot; had just been issued; Wallace was included among the signatories of the document.</p>

      on pages 723-724 titled &quot;Favourite Books of 1899. Some More
      Readers.&quot; querying
      various celebrities on their two favorite books of the past year. Wallace
       replied: <em>Elizabeth and Her German Garden</em>,
      and <em>Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform</em> (by Ebenezer Howard).</p>
      <p>--<em>The Twenty-Eighth Annual Report and Proceedings, for the Year 1898-99</em>, 
        of the Chester Society of Natural Science, Literature &amp; Art, Chester, 
        England (an organization founded by Charles Kingsley), lists Wallace as 
        an honorary member; later <em>Reports</em> also list him.</p>
        <p>--<em>The Times</em> (London) issue of 10 March 1900 carries a notice 
        on page 10 by The South Africa Concilliation Committee (a self-charged organization 
        dedicated to trying to &quot;re-establish goodwill between the British and 
        Dutch races in South Africa&quot; by monitoring facts and policy in that region) which names Wallace, along with many others, 
        as a member.</p>
        <p>--A story in the <em>Light</em> (London) issue of 13 October 1900 indicates 
        that on 16 September 1900 a meeting was held in Paris prior to the International 
        Congress of Spiritualists that year, and Wallace was elected an honorary 
        president for the meetings, which ended on September 27 of that year.</p>
        <p>--An article on T. H. Huxley printed in the
            6 December 1900 issue of <em>The Independent</em> (New York) contains
            the following comment, excerpted from a Wallace letter: &quot;Altho we
            had many differences of opinion, I never received from him a harsh
            or unkind word.&quot;</p>
        <p>--<em>The Academy</em> (London) issue of 8 December 1900 has a feature
        on pages 578-579 titled &quot;Favourite Books of 1900. Some 
        Readers.&quot; querying
        various celebrities on their two favorite books of the past year. Wallace
        replied: &quot;Mr. Richardson's <em>How It Can Be Done</em>, and Mr.
        Kenworthy's <em>Anatomy
        of Misery</em>. Both new editions, but unknown to me before.&quot;</p>
        <p>--A 1900 or later &quot;appeal for funds&quot; pamphlet from the Garden 
        City Association entitled <em>A Solution of the Problem of Depopulation 
        of Country Districts and Overcrowding in Large Cities</em> lists Wallace 
        as a member of that organization's Council.</p>
        <p>--In a story concerning the eating habits of celebrities printed in the 
        <em>Current Literature</em> issue of September 1901 Wallace reports that 
        he finds &quot;fish good for brain work,&quot; and that he believes, theoretically, 
        in vegetarianism.</p>
      <p>--A short editorial note in <em>The Garden</em> issue of 19 October
          1901 mentions a <em>Eucalyptus gunnii</em> Wallace has growing in his garden.
          A drawing of a twig from the tree accompanies the note.</p>
<p>--On page 279 of Minot Judson Savage's 1901 book <em>Life Beyond Death</em> 
        that author states &quot;Alfred Russel Wallace is the most famous scientific 
        man living on earth to-day.&quot;</p>
          <p>--In the Preface to A. J. Ogilvy's 1901 work <em>The Elements of Darwinism A Primer</em> appear the following words: &quot;Mr. A. R. Wallace...has kindly looked over my MS., and made some corrections and comments, so that it is not likely to contain any serious inaccuracies. At the same time I am not authorised to give it his imprimatur, because, as he remarks, 'There are some things in it with which I do not quite agree.'&quot; </p>
<p>--A note printed on page 5 of the 4 April 1902 issue of the <em>North Wales Express</em> reads: &quot;It will be learnt with regret that Dr. Alfred R. Wallace has declined to receive the honorary degree offered him by the University of Wales. Dr. Wallace is a native of Monmouthshire, so that his acceptance would have a special appropriateness, just as his refusal is doubly regrettable.&quot;</p>
</font>
          <p><font size="-1">--A note on page 4 of the <em>Western Gazette</em> issue of 24 October 1902 indicates that Wallace had been &quot;re-elected&quot; as a vice-president of the Branksome and District Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Society. </font></p>
          <font size="-1"><p>--In an article entitled &quot;The Man Who Is to Come&quot; by
    Benjamin Kidd published on page 141 of the <em>Current Literature</em> issue
    of 1 January 1903, Kidd refers to a letter he received from Wallace that
    included the comment: &quot;the interest of the fittest
    individual for the time being is the interest of the species.&quot;</p>
      <p>--The <em>Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research</em> for 
        February 1903 lists Wallace as an honorary member of the Society.</p>
      <p>--On the first page of the 26 December 1903 issue of <em>The
            Garden</em> (London)
          birthday greetings are offered (Wallace's eightieth) for &quot;this grand
            worker in the regions of science, whose name we hold in reverence
            and honour as one of the greatest of living Englishmen.&quot; Volume 64
            (July-December 1903) of this title was dedicated to Wallace.</p>
        <p>--In the <em>Year-Book and Record, 1903</em>, of the Royal Geographical 
        Society, Wallace is listed by that Society's Council as a referee for 
        &quot;Biological Distribution.&quot;</p>
        <p>--On page 138 of Nellie Beighle's 1903 book <em>Book of Knowledge</em> 
        the author describes Wallace as &quot;the foremost living European naturalist.&quot;</p>
      <p>--An editorial note appears on page 124 of the February
          1904 issue of <em>The Open Court</em>, stating: &quot;When Alfred Russell
          Wallace visited this country in 1886-1887 he sent his picture to Mr.
          [Edward A.] Brackett, requesting an interview, and when they met both
          found themselves to be in pretty close agreement&quot; [on matters
          of psychical research].</p>
<p>--A story in <em>The Times</em> (London) issue of 17 June 1904 reports 
        on the 63rd annual general meeting of the members of the London Library 
        the day before, and the election during it of Wallace as one of its vice-presidents. 
        <em>The Times</em> was still listing him as a vice-president of the institution 
        as of its issue of 1 August 1907, and he was apparently still one all the way through to his death.</p>
             <p>--A story in the 21 October 1904 issue of <em>Science</em> reports that 
        Wallace was to be one of the first vice-presidents of the newly-formed 
        Ethological Society. A note in <em>The Citizen</em> (Gloucester) issue of 6 October 1904 confirms this, and he is listed as a v.p. in the first number of the Society's <em>Journal</em>.</p>
          <p>--A note on page 732 of Volume 29 of the <em>Journal of the Royal Horticultural 
        Society</em> (1904-05) indicates that Wallace donated three plants of 
        <em>Eucalyptus gunnii</em> to the Society in 1904, and that these were 
        planted in their gardens at Wisley during that year. Are they possibly 
        still there?</p>
        <p>--In the Preface to the 1904 book <em>The Great &amp; Good, An Introduction 
        to Rational Religion</em>, the author (&quot;Great&quot;) says he is &quot;indebted 
        for advice and encouragement&quot; to Wallace.</p>
        <p>--In the feature &quot;100 Years Ago in The American Ornithologists' 
        Union&quot; in the January 2005 issue of <em>The Auk</em>, Wallace is 
        mentioned as having been an &quot;Honorary Fellow&quot; of the AOU as of 1905.</p>
        <p>--According to a story printed in the <em>Forest and Stream</em> issue 
        of 1 April 1905, Wallace was one of two honorary presidents of the Fourth 
        International Ornithological Congress, held in London between 12 and 17 
        June, 1905.</p>
		<p>--The 25 April 1905 issue of the <em>Aberdeen Journal</em> reports that Wallace was one of many who signed an &quot;address&quot; presented to Keir Hardie, and honoring him, at a &quot;demonstration of the Independent Labour party in Manchester&quot; on 23 April 1905.</p>
		<p>--A note from Dr. J. M. Peebles printed in the 13 May 1905 issue of <em>Light</em> (London) indicates that &quot;on the 23rd I am to spend a day and a night with that brave, regal-souled man, Alfred Russel Wallace.&quot; A Supplement to the issue of 3 June 1905 confirms that Peebles &quot;had just returned from a visit to Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, who reaffirmed what he said over thirty years ago, that the ministry of spirits to earth was as well established as any other fact.&quot;</p>
		<p>--The 14 July 1905 edition of <em>The Western Gazette</em>. carries a story on a public meeting held in Broadstone on the 11th, concerning local water supply issues; Wallace was apparently in attendance, and pointed out &quot;that to remove the rust from the mains it would be necessary to flush them to the amount of several gallons a day.&quot;</p>
        <p>--According to a feature entitled &quot;Phrenology and Scientists and 
        What They Say&quot; printed in the September 1905 issue of <em>The Phrenological 
        Journal and Science of Health</em>, Wallace wrote a letter in 1896 containing 
        the words &quot;I am still as I have been all my life a firm believer in Phrenology, 
        both in its scientific and practical aspects.&quot;</p>
		
          <p>--A note in the <em>Aberdeen Journal</em> issue of 14 October 1905: &quot;Dr Alfred Russel Wallace, the well-known scientist, speaking at Harrow [London?] last night, said he had been engaged in investigating the tunnel mystery by transcendental clairvoyance. He knew that the man who was with Miss Money was an old sweetheart of hers, and that she jumped from the train to avoid his approaches. Dr Wallace declared that he had since recognised the man.&quot; This refers to the famous (possible) murder of one Mary Money, whose body was found in the Merstham Tunnel, nineteen miles from London. The referral to our Wallace is incorrect, however: a different Wallace was involved in the psychic investigation.</p>
          <p>--A letter by Jas. R. Williamson to the Editor of the <em>Light</em> (London) issue of 4 November 1905 discusses a new book titled <em>Premature Burial</em>, edited by Dr. Walter R.

            views on human development, considers that there is little proof
            that man has advanced intellectually since the early dawn of civilisation,
            and looks to sympathetic education, and wiser selection through marriage,

        always be associated with Malayan regions, writes to me in regard to the 
        protective forest belts which have been, and are being, laid out through

              It may be recalled that his father first came out East with Alfred

              at Gaylang...&quot;</p>

            12 of the 10 December 1910 issue of <em>The Register</em> (Adelaide,
            Australia) includes the following comment: &quot;Dr. Wallace is to-day
            the greatest living representative of many famous men; and in spite
            of his advanced age, his intelligence is extraordinarily acute, and
            he is working hard, animated by unresting aspiration, and with a
            mind open to receive enlightenment from any and every quarter...&quot;
            'A bit over the top, perhaps, but still telling...</p>

        to know that we have among our number as companions in ignorance, four-fifths 
        of all the college professors throughout the world, every Socialist of 
        note, beginning with the peer of them all, Sir Alfred Russell Wallace 
        of England; also the most eminent men of letters in this and every other 
        country...&quot; </p>
        <p>--A. F. R. Wollaston's 1912 book <em>Pygmies &amp; Papuans; The Stone

Apparently Wallace objected to some wording in the address regarding the primacy of volunteerism in social advance: he did not consider "his [Kropotkin's] criticism of Darwin of much value," and added "I am a thorough Socialist, and I do not wish to be accused of having given it up for 'voluntaryism'--which is (I believe) hopeless as against our opponents of wealth privilege and monopoly."</p>

        <font size="-1"><p>--The 22 November 1913 issue of <em>The Miami News</em> carried
            a story on Helen Keller, in which she was quoted as saying: &quot;I prefer
            to use the eye and ear of the world which the printed page makes
            mine. I prefer to read the opinions of well-informed persons, clear

            Sir Oliver Lodge, H. G. Wells, William English Walling, Judge Lindsey,

     			<p>--In his obituary of Wallace that appeared at the end of the December 1913 issue of <i>Popular Science Monthly</i>, Henry Fairfield Osborn notes that Wallace sent him the following words in a letter dated 3 May 1912: "In accordance with your request I herewith send you a list of my published books. The delay has been caused by the only complete copy I had having been sent away for publication. I have always intended to make out a complete list of my various communications to periodical literature, but have hitherto been unable to find time to do so. All my scientific communications, however, will be found in the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers which no doubt you have access to."</p>

            much immorality, drunkenness, and crime...&quot;</p>
        <p>--On p. 436 of an article published in Volume 48 of
          the <em>American Law Review</em> in 1914, author Ernest G. Steven notes: &quot;The
          most distinguished scientist of recent years, Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace,
          Darwin's codiscoverer of natural selection, who has just died at the
          age...&quot;</p>
         <p>--It was widely reported in a number of newspapers in early 1914 that Wallace's estate was valued at 5823 pounds, of which 2884 pounds was deemed &quot;net personality.&quot; <em>T.

        <p>--A note on page 7 of the 18 August 1925 issue of <em>The
              Register</em> (Adelaide,
  Australia) includes the following: &quot;...Mr. Wilson's grandfather was an early
  settler, a lawyer, and a cultured man, who was a relative or connection of
              Alfred Russell Wallace, on whose work he lectured here in 1857.
              Mr. Wilson was an English barrister in a large way in England,
              but some grandiose land and building venture financially crippled
              him, and he came to South Australia. He was in the first Adelaide
              City Council, and became our second Mayor. His lectures on old
              silver and various art and other subjects were numerous in the
              early days. He lived in Finniss street, North Adelaide, and was
              one of the first to grow strawberries here. His son, Mr. C. A.
              Wilson, was a naturalist, who from his early youth wrote on his
              hobby in <em>The Register</em>.&quot;</p>
        <p>--The <em>Aberdeen Press and Journal</em> (Scotland) issue of 18 June 1928 carries the information that &quot;Clare Verus Pontifex, Bournemouth, who left 30,339 pounds, directed in his will that a collection of spirit photographs made by the late Alfred Russel Wallace should be offered to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.&quot;</p>
        <p>--According to a note on page 15 of the 31 October
            1928 issue of <em>The Advertiser</em> (Adelaide, Australia), &quot;Mr.
            Wilson, a solicitor, Adelaide's second Mayor, was the son of an English
            surgeon, and arrived in South Australia in 1838. He was for many
            years a partner in the legal firm of Smart and Wilson, and at the
            time of his death, at Kensington, in 1863, aged 76, was Clerk of
            the Court of Appeals, being the oldest member of the legal profession
            in Adelaide. Mr. Wilson was a musician, and of literary and artistic
            tastes. His wife was a sister of the mother of Alfred Russel Wallace,
            the naturalist.&quot;</p>
        <p>--<em>Notes and Queries</em>, issue of 8 November 1952, reports that 
        Wallace &quot;is a character in the novel <em>The Origin of Evil</em> by Ellery

        <p>--Yvonne Frost, a leader of the Church of Wicca, reputedly became a Spiritualist 
        in the early 1960s and claims to have had Wallace as her spirit guide!</p>
		<p>--In his 2005 book <em>The Weather Makers</em> author Tim Flannery refers to Wallace's use of the term &quot;the great aerial ocean&quot; as if he invented it himself. However, by Wallace's time the phrase had already long been in use, most notably by Matthew Maury, J. Frederick Daniell in 1823, and even earlier by von Humboldt in his English editions of <em>Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain</em> in 1814 and <em>Personal Narrative of Travels</em> in 1819.</p>
	<p>In the 2020s the website playback.fm has presented their survey results identifying ARW as the most famous person with the last name 'Wallace.' Another such site has identified Wallace as the most famous (name-recognition-wise) person who was born in 1823, and similarly who died in the year 1913.</p>

	<p>In a story reported on 3 October 2021, earth.com reports that "A species of hawkmoth from Madagascar, whose existence was predicted by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the 19th century, has recently been recognized as a new species. Known as Wallace's sphinx moth, the unique creature is considered to have the longest tongue of any insect, measuring up to 30 centimeters. The moth is the only insect that can reach the bottom of the nectar tubes of Madagascar's star orchid."</p>

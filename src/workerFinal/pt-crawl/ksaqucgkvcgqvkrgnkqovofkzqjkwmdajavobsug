      <p>The Glow-worm is Britain's only native species of firefly and has charmed people for generations.</p>
      <p>In this book, for the first time, the Glow-worm's fascinating life is described in detail from egg to adult and illustrated with colour photographs. There are sections on how it feeds (not a subject for the squeamish!); how it defends itself; how and why it produces its brilliant glow and how it attracts a mate.</p>
      <p>The second part of the book looks at the Glow-worm's world: its British and global distribution, its habitat and the need for suitable habitat management.</p>
      <p>The Glow-worm's possible decline in Britain is discussed, together with the threats that it faces and some of the questions which still remain unanswered.</p>
      <p>Finally there are sections on how to see Glow-worms for yourself, how to photograph them and how to take part in the <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~galaxypix/#Form" target="mybook" >National Glow-worm Survey</a>.</p>
      <p>The book is available from <a href="buybook.php">John Tyler</a> for a cost of £10 including postage and packaging.</p>

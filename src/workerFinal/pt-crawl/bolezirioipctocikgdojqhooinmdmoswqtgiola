Research and Teaching: My research takes a Critical Physical Geography approach combining political economy, STS, and fluvial geomorphology.  My previous projects focused on stream restoration, the political economy of environmental expertise, environmental markets, and the ways in which water policies shape fluvial systems in the US. My current work focuses on anthropogenic flooding in the US Midwest. I have published in journals ranging from Science to Social Studies of Science and am the author of two monographs: Fields and Streams: Stream Restoration, Neoliberalism, and the Future of Environmental Science (2012, University of Georgia Press) and Streams of Revenues: The Restoration Economy and the Ecosystems it Creates (2021 MIT Press; co-written with Martin Doyle). I have co-edited four volumes: the Handbook of Political Economy of Science (2017), the Handbook of Critical Physical Geography (2018), and two collections on Doreen Massey (2018).  Over the last five years, I have given 29 invited talks and keynotes (including four at the invitation of undergraduate or graduate student organizations) at institutions in Aotearoa/New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, and the US. Teaching is one of my favorite parts of academia. My courses combine physical and human geography approaches to the environment, particularly in relation to environmental conservation, ecological restoration, multispecies relations, and water resources. I was my department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies for eight years and have won multiple teaching awards. <br />
<br />
Public Engagement and Synergistic Activities: I co-founded EDGI (the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative), an international network started in in response to the 2016 US presidential elections, which provoked deep fears about the loss of environmental data collected and held by the US government and about the rollback of environmental protections more broadly.  I was the initial coordinator of EDGI’s website tracking team, which monitors, documents, and publicizes changes to tens of thousands of US federal agency webpages, particularly those related to climate change and environmental justice.</p>

Research: I research immigration, citizenship, refugee geopolitics, and migrant transnationalism. My recent collaborative NSF-funded research on the geopolitics of trauma examines the role of mental health and its governance in the admission and resettlement of Iraqi refugees in the U.S. A previous collaborative project analyzed how communities of faith in the U.S. South are engaged in the complex, racialized, and changing geographies of immigration and belonging. As a political and feminist geographer, I focus on the role of everyday spaces in these processes. External funding from the AAG, the University of Amsterdam, and several NSF grants have supported my scholarship. Much of my funded research agenda is collaborative, and I regularly disseminate my work through community outreach and public lectures to various local constituencies in Lexington, KY, and through teacher trainings and summer institutes in the U.S. and abroad. My work is published in Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, Ethnic and Racial Studies, Urban Geography, Progress in Human Geography, Antipode, Transactions of the IBG, Space &#038; Polity, Environment and Planning A, Gender, Place and Culture and Annals of the AAG.<br />
<br />
Advising, Mentoring, and Teaching: I am serving or have served as the advisor of nine Ph.D. and 17 M.A. students, and I have served/continue to serve on over 40 additional graduate student committees. My external grants have supported women, international students, and students from underrepresented groups. I have been advising a diverse group of graduate students, either through their Ph.D.s and the academic job market, or as they pursue alternative career choices. I (formally and informally) mentor early career women faculty and BIPOC colleagues in geography and cognate disciplines, and I hold a Certificate in Multicultural Mentoring from the University of Florida (2021). My teaching covers a full range of introductory and elective undergraduate courses and graduate seminars in my research areas. I also offer more specific professional courses on research design, grant writing, and publishing.</p>

Research and Teaching Interests: I am a physical geographer with research interests in large scale atmospheric circulation dynamics and their influence on Antarctic sea ice variability and global climate change and variability. Climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere cryosphere has significant implications for global climate and climate change.   <br />
<br />
Teaching is one of the most satisfying aspects of my career. It is my opportunity to introduce my undergraduate students to the exciting world of climatology in geography and environmental sustainability; an experience that, especially in these times, has potential to change their worldview. For my graduate students it is my opportunity make my science come alive and, in the process, introduce them to the joys of research, to sustain their interest and to bring them into the academy.<br />

                            <h5></h5>
                            <p class="bio">She is a feminist cultural-historical geographer and associate professor of geography at California State University, Fullerton. Her research focuses broadly on issues of landscape and memory in Los Angeles, California, and the United States—all places she is from, and to which she seeks to make a contribution, in research that is community engaged. Through in-depth qualitative research (both historical and contemporary) DeLyser has studied ghost towns, fiction-inspired places, and early women pilots; her current research explores how neon signs transform the American landscape. She serves on the boards of three non-profit organizations related to her research, and as a representative of her community to the City of Los Angeles on the Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Council. <br />
<br />
She is a strong advocate for geographical community through AAG. She regularly publishes in AAG journals, including three papers in the Annals and one in <em>The Professional Geographer</em>. She has served the AAG, including on the Harassment-Free AAG Taskforce, on the Archives and Association History Committee (including as its Chair), on multiple Local Arrangements Committees, and as Chair of the Nystrom Committee. During the pandemic she volunteered as a member of the AAG’s COVID-19 Rapid Response Task Force Committee to support students, and played a formative role in establishing and subsequently forwarding the online methods-training programs that the AAG has offered free to members. <br />
<br />
She earned her B.A. in Geography from UCLA in 1992, her M.A. in Geography from Syracuse University in 1996, and her Ph.D. from Syracuse University in 1998; she is a licensed pilot. Her service as Pacific Coast regional councilor will run through June 2025; her pilot’s license will never expire. </p>

<p>The AAG is organized into nine regional divisions representing different regions of the United States. The regional divisions promote the objectives of the association through meetings and activities in their respective areas. Each region is represented by a councilor who focuses on membership at a more local level, while coordinating activities with the AAG council and national office. They are elected to serve for three years. Take a moment to find out more about your current regional division councilor.</p>

                            <h5></h5>
                            <p class="bio">She is a feminist cultural-historical geographer and associate professor of geography at California State University, Fullerton. Her research focuses broadly on issues of landscape and memory in Los Angeles, California, and the United States—all places she is from, and to which she seeks to make a contribution, in research that is community engaged. Through in-depth qualitative research (both historical and contemporary) DeLyser has studied ghost towns, fiction-inspired places, and early women pilots; her current research explores how neon signs transform the American landscape. She serves on the boards of three non-profit organizations related to her research, and as a representative of her community to the City of Los Angeles on the Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Council. <br />
<br />
She is a strong advocate for geographical community through AAG. She regularly publishes in AAG journals, including three papers in the Annals and one in <em>The Professional Geographer</em>. She has served the AAG, including on the Harassment-Free AAG Taskforce, on the Archives and Association History Committee (including as its Chair), on multiple Local Arrangements Committees, and as Chair of the Nystrom Committee. During the pandemic she volunteered as a member of the AAG’s COVID-19 Rapid Response Task Force Committee to support students, and played a formative role in establishing and subsequently forwarding the online methods-training programs that the AAG has offered free to members. <br />
<br />
She earned her B.A. in Geography from UCLA in 1992, her M.A. in Geography from Syracuse University in 1996, and her Ph.D. from Syracuse University in 1998; she is a licensed pilot. Her service as Pacific Coast regional councilor will run through June 2025; her pilot’s license will never expire. <br />

                    <p>Geography is a field of study that examines the relations among people, places, and the more-than-human world. Geographical scholarship ranges from quantitative analysis to humanistic research undertaken in many different social and environmental contexts. Thus, in our research, teaching, and professional life, geographers are confronted with a wide variety of ethical considerations, each requiring careful reflection and thoughtful action.</p>
<p>This Statement on Professional Ethics outlines core principles to inform the ethical conduct of members of the American Association of Geographers (AAG) and the geographical community more broadly. These principles provide general guidelines applicable to geographers working in diverse professional settings. AAG members, in particular, are urged to familiarize themselves with, reflect on, and act in accordance with these principles when working in a professional capacity. Members of the AAG are required to abide by AAG’s Professional Conduct Policy and Procedures, and many geographers must also conform to ethical requirements related to research with human subjects as interpreted and enforced by institutions and funders. Geographers also belong to multiple professional communities, each with its own ethical standards. This Statement should therefore be viewed in conjunction with these other codes, statements, and standards.</p>
<p>This Statement is written with the intent to encourage active, thoughtful engagement with ethical issues in relation to the various circumstances that geographers encounter in their professional lives. These principles address general circumstances, priorities, and relationships, and should therefore be seen as starting points for consideration of the ethical issues attendant to our activities as professional geographers. Each of us must be ready and willing to make, and be equipped to defend, ethical choices that also go beyond the principles laid out here.</p>

                    <p>An overarching ethical principle, serving as the basis for all academic and professional activities of geographers, is that we should do no harm. Our activities inevitably affect the people and places we study, societies, ecosystems, biodiversity, climate and landforms, our students, and those who help make our work possible. It is imperative that both prior to and during the performance of our professional work – ranging across human geography, physical geography, nature-society geography, and GIScience – each geographer should think through the possible ways that our activities might cause harm. Harms include those affecting the dignity, livelihood, and well-being of human and non-human lives as well as the resilience and sustainability of ecosystems and environments. Beyond direct harms, we should also consider long-term and indirect implications, and possible unintended consequences, being willing to step back from or terminate those activities when harm feels unavoidable. The obligation to do no harm should supersede other goals of seeking or communicating new knowledge.</p>
<p>In making assessments of potential harm, geographers must be sensitive to the unequal power relationships surrounding our activities. We frequently occupy powerful positions relative to our research participants, and it is all too easy for us to be unaware of, or to forget, the impact that these power imbalances can have on those affected by geographical research. Our activities and reflections require special care when the subject matter involves Indigenous peoples, racialized or ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups, including when research is conducted with and by members of those groups. Potential issues include physical and social threat and danger to participants both from outside and within such communities, violation of their intellectual property, and threats to the viability of a group and its territory. These can stem not only from published data, but also from the data collection process itself. Information thus should not be extracted from such communities without their consent. Benefits to the community must be recognized as such by the community, and it is particularly important for researchers to consider whether they are accepting funds from sources whose agendas are seen as inimical to such communities.</p>
<p>Geographers’ activities and reflections about potential harm also require that we take special care when engaging with non-human individuals, groups, species, and ecosystems. Where methods and activities may be invasive or potentially cause long-term alterations to environments, strong justification and appropriate safeguards are reasonable obligations. In such situations, the costs and benefits of the research should be weighed carefully in advance, not just once the work is underway, and be continually reassessed throughout the research process.</p>
<p>Actions that pose serious risks to the dignity and well-being of participants or other affected parties fall outside the boundaries of accepted geographical scholarship and have no place within the academic study and professional practice of geography. Geographical scholarship depends upon the right to academic freedom, but academic freedom cannot justify violating the well-being of human and non-human lives. It thus follows that geographers should eschew collaborating with or seeking funding from public or private organizations known to participate in warfare or similar acts of violence – such as those associated with the military, intelligence, security, or police – without adequate ethical safeguards, since such participation can create risks for both researchers and the researched. When such collaboration is deemed ethical, geographers are responsible for prominently and publicly reporting such relationships.</p>

                    <p>Geographers should respect people, places, and the more-than-human world in all aspects of our work as professional geographers. Respect for well-being underlies the principle of doing no harm, actively affirming the responsibility of geographers to use our work to enhance the well-being of others, especially for those who are most vulnerable to harm. The principle of respect acknowledges that all geographical knowledge is situated and should depend on building relationships informed by an ethics of care for the well-being of both human and non-human lives as well as the places and environments they call home. Geographers should therefore make reasonable efforts to treat those with whom we interact with dignity and respect, conducting ourselves with honesty and integrity when engaging in academic and professional activities.</p>
<p>An important sign of respect and care in geographical scholarship involving human subjects is conducting research with, rather than on, participants and avoiding exploitative or extractive research. Geographers must be accountable not only to our own professional communities but to all of the relations involved in the production and dissemination of geographical knowledge. Geographers should also carefully reflect upon how we represent ourselves, research participants, and places in our research, teaching, and professional life. Respectful geographical scholarship is based upon an appreciation for reciprocity with research participants in the co-production of geographical knowledge. Reciprocal relationships are built through active listening and an obligation to share the benefits of geographical research with those it directly affects.</p>
<p>The principle of respect also extends to the treatment of non-human individuals, groups, species, and ecosystems affected by geographical research. Geographers have an ethical obligation to develop geographical knowledge that aims to alleviate the harms caused by anthropogenic environmental change. Geographers should seek to enhance the well-being of more-than-human lives and the environmental conditions conducive to their survival and capacity to thrive. In circumstances where the well-being of one living entity negatively impacts the well-being of another, geographical researchers should carefully consider how our own interventions may affect the well-being and survival of all parties before deciding whether or how to intervene.</p>

                    <p>Geographers must engage with colleagues, research associates, students, and staff in a respectful manner. This includes respect for the rights of others, a refusal to spread gossip, a commitment to discussing differences openly and honestly, and attention to the power asymmetries in which we are all embedded. Geographers must not plagiarize, fabricate or falsify evidence, or knowingly misrepresent information. Representations of others’ work should be devoid of prejudice or malice, notwithstanding differences of interpretation, personality, ideology, theory, or methodology. We should take time to reflect before posting online, avoiding cyberbullying and flame wars. However, raising ethical concerns about the conduct of others does not, in itself, constitute cyberbullying if there are reasonable grounds for such concerns and they are presented in a professional manner.</p>
<p>The scope of collaboration, rights and responsibilities of those participating, co-authorship, credit, and acknowledgment should be openly and fairly established at the outset. We must be particularly attentive to actual or perceived conflicts of interest, exercising care to protect the interests and well-being of the less powerful.</p>
<p>Geographers should strive to create and maintain a diverse, pluralistic, and inclusive professional community. It is our moral responsibility to respect the dignity of all, valuing a diversity of intellectual commitments and respecting individual differences. In particular, we should continually work to empower the voices and views of underrepresented communities. Diversity should also be central to teaching and advising. Instructors should strive to create a classroom environment that fosters respect for and engagement across different learning styles, interpretations, and theoretically informed perspectives, in ways that empower underrepresented positionalities and identities and create safe learning spaces. Instructors should take student perspectives that differ from or critique their own views as seriously as they are presented, bearing in mind the principles of respect and doing no harm, modeling for others the value of respectful disagreement and debate. Teaching assistants should be treated with respect, as full partners in delivering a course: instructors should actively mentor their development as teachers, provide clear instructions about expectations, timely feedback on their performance, and ensure that their workload does not exceed contractual obligations. Advisors should be attentive to students’ overall well-being, including mental health, standing ready to provide personal support and facilitate access to professional counseling when appropriate and allowable.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-body accordion-description-body">
                    <p>Geographers working with human communities must obtain free, prior, and informed consent of research participants. The consent process should be a part of project design and continue through implementation as an ongoing dialogue and negotiation with research participants. Minimally, informed consent includes sharing with potential participants the research goals, methods, direct and indirect funding sources or sponsors, expected outcomes, anticipated impacts of the research, and the rights and responsibilities of research participants. It must also establish expectations regarding anonymity and credit. Researchers must present to research participants the possible impacts of participation, and make clear that despite their best efforts, confidentiality may be compromised, or outcomes may differ from those anticipated.</p>
<p>Geographers whose research involves humans, based in countries where there is an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or similar process, must obtain institutional approval and follow its stipulations about informed consent, modification of research practices, reporting of adverse events, etc. Geographers should also familiarize themselves with relevant documents on which such consent is based; in the US, this is particularly informed by the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html" data-feathr-click-track="true"><strong>Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research</strong></a>. At the same time, geographers should be aware that considerations of ethics go beyond and may in some circumstances differ from such rules.</p>
<p>The informed consent process is necessarily dynamic, continuous, and reflexive. When research changes in ways that may directly affect participants, geographers must revisit and renegotiate consent. The principle of doing no harm means that the right to refuse research goes beyond specific individuals approached through the IRB process, and also includes the right of communities to refuse participation. Informed consent does not necessarily imply or require a particular written or signed form. It is the quality of the consent, not its format, which is relevant.</p>
<p>Whenever appropriate, results of research should be shared with research participants, local colleagues, host agencies, and affected persons and communities in a format that is accessible to them. Whenever possible, acknowledgement, including authorship, should be determined in a fair and transparent manner.</p>
<p>In general, geographers should make data and findings publicly available to the greatest extent allowable by funding agencies and by our ethical principles, and in a fashion that is consistent with the goal of doing no harm to the people, places, and environments we study. Thus, in some situations, generalization or other measures such as the use of pseudonyms will be necessary to protect privacy, confidentiality, and limit exposure to risks. Most funding agencies have guidelines for the use and distribution of data and research findings and may require a data use agreement as a condition for grant or contract awards. Such an agreement may include provisions designed to protect de-identified data from re-identification, and conditions relating to data storage, protection, publication, and transmission. Geographers should carefully document how datasets are collected, constructed, and managed, and carefully guard against any data breaches, while promptly notifying affected individuals or communities if a breach does occur. Geographers should reflect carefully on the potential problems that so-called “big data” pose with respect to data management, de- and re-identification, and privacy.</p>
<p>Geospatial technologies introduce further challenges with respect to potential violations of privacy and confidentiality of individuals and groups. In using these technologies, researchers should make reasonable efforts to protect the health, well-being, and privacy of research participants. Understandings, expectations, and preferences regarding privacy differ across and within societies. Further, privacy depends on the nature of the data, the context in which they were created and extracted, and the expectations and norms of those who are affected. Particular efforts should be made to guard against any breaches, especially when such data could be used to undermine the interests of communities or community members, and when specific agreements have been made to keep such data out of the public domain.</p>
<p>The following examples of research approaches involving geospatial technologies are particularly likely to raise issues of privacy and confidentiality, and therefore should be undertaken with special care: (1) automated tracking of the locations and movements of individuals or vehicles; (2) the use of images from satellites, aircraft, UAVs (drones), or ground-based sensors that are of sufficient resolution to identify individuals or vehicles; (3) the use of high resolution geographic location to link data in ways that violate personal confidentiality; and (4) any use of big data that compromises privacy, confidentiality, or violates other ethical principles in this Statement, even when such data is considered publicly available. The use of geospatial technologies and other geographical techniques within the context of warfare, or to support other acts of violence, is inconsistent with principles of doing no harm and securing free, prior, and informed consent, and is therefore outside the boundaries of ethical geographical research and practice.</p>

                    <p>Geographers should reject funding from any sponsor that compromises the principles of ethical research. The conditions under which data can be used, and restrictions on the use of data after the end of a research project, should be clarified prior to accepting funds. Ethical quandaries are particularly likely to be encountered when seeking funding from military, intelligence, security, and policing agencies as well as private corporations to support research or to undertake government- or corporate-sponsored projects. Geographers should be open and candid, avoiding undertaking any task that requires us to compromise our professional and ethical responsibilities.</p>
<p>All funding sources, affiliations, sponsorships, and partnerships should be fully disclosed in a comprehensible manner at the time that informed consent is requested from research participants, because prospective participants have the right to assess this information as they consider giving or withholding consent. Where relevant, geographers should undertake due diligence to trace and disclose not just intermediary but also original funding sources. Transparency and disclosure also mean reporting in a timely fashion any changes in funding sources, affiliations, or partnerships to affected individuals or communities during the course of research.</p>
<p>Disclosure and transparency must be practiced throughout the research process, from the first stages through to the dissemination of research results in journals and other publications. Such transparency in the disclosure of funding source reporting, affiliations, and partnerships also applies to presentations of geographical research at AAG and AAG-affiliated meetings as well as in other scholarly and professional forums. Both during the research process and in any related publications and presentations, geographers should make explicit the extent to which governments, corporations, or other funding entities have limited or restricted research efforts.</p>
<p>In addition to disclosure, geographers should bear in mind that there may be other ethical implications involved in accepting funding and sponsorships. Geographers should carefully consider with due diligence the ethical integrity of those sources as well as conditions or expectations implied by any particular funding, sponsorship, affiliation, or partnership, and be ready to defend our decisions on ethical grounds. Similarly, ethical judgements about funding sources may extend beyond research to teaching, such as teaching in specific programs that are externally supported. Individual geographers should encourage their departments or other units to evaluate, reflect upon, and engage in thoughtful debate regarding the ethical implications of accepting such funding support, particularly in relation to the principle of doing no harm.</p>

                    <p>Ethics are not based on absolute moral standards but are situational. This means taking into account the particular context of an act. In this spirit, geographers must weigh competing ethical obligations to research participants, students, professional colleagues, employers, and funders, among others, while recognizing that obligations to research participants are usually primary. These varying relationships may create conflicting, competing, or crosscutting ethical obligations, reflecting both the relative vulnerabilities of different individuals, communities, or populations, asymmetries of power implicit in these scholarly relationships, and the differing ethical frameworks of collaborators representing other disciplines or areas of practice. These considerations may also include geographers’ own safety, especially if they are a member of a marginalized group, or in cases where research participants, funders, or sponsors are in a position of power over the researcher.</p>
<p>Geographers must often make difficult decisions among competing ethical obligations while recognizing our obligation to do no harm. We remain individually responsible for making thoughtful and defensible ethical decisions. If geographers’ ethical responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing authority, we should clarify the nature of the conflict and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the principles of ethics laid out in this Statement on Professional Ethics.</p>

                    <p>The American Association of Geographers advocates a positive culture of inclusion and respect for the dignity of each individual. AAG members should exhibit appropriate professional conduct in their interactions with all individuals whom they encounter in connection with their professional roles, including colleagues, students, researchers, support staff, grantors, administrators, and others in the academic or research community. Non-members of AAG involved in AAG activities must also exhibit professional conduct in connection with those activities. AAG expects members, event attendees, and others involved in AAG activities to adhere to professional conduct expectations. Inappropriate professional behaviors include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrimination against or harassment on the basis of an individual’s race, age, religion, creed, color, ancestry, citizenship, national or ethnic origin, disability, military or veteran status, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal law.</li>
<li>Physical contact that is uninvited and, in the situation, inappropriate, and unwelcome or coercive sexual attention;</li>
<li>Intimidation, stalking, abusive or threatening behavior, or bullying;</li>
<li>Retaliation against individuals who raise conduct concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>AAG reserves the right to assess whether an individual’s behavior is consistent with these conduct expectations and, based on that assessment, the right to bestow, deny, revoke or limit participation in AAG-sponsored activities (e.g., meeting attendance, publication in AAG journals, recognition, and service on committees or in AAG leadership roles) or eligibility for membership or honors. Any action taken against an individual for violation of this policy shall be in accordance with AAG policies and procedures and other governing documents. This policy also applies to AAG members, AAG staff, event attendees, speakers, exhibitors, or event venue staff at any AAG-sponsored conference or meeting as well as AAG-sponsored social events.</p>

                    <p>Professional ideas and information are exchanged most effectively at the AAG Annual Meeting, other AAG events, in AAG journals, and online discussion fora in an atmosphere free of discrimination or harassment and characterized by courtesy and respect. To that end, the AAG expects all individuals who become AAG members or who serve as AAG staff to conduct themselves in a manner that is honorable, ethical, and professional. Similarly, the AAG expects all individuals who attend the national conference or who participate in other AAG-sponsored events to conduct themselves in a manner that establishes an atmosphere free from discriminatory practices. All AAG staff, AAG members and all participants at AAG-sponsored events are expected to treat others with respect and consideration, follow venue rules, and alert staff or security when they have knowledge of dangerous situations, violations of the Event Conduct Policy, or individuals in distress. The purpose of this policy is three-fold: to foster a positive, harassment-free environment; to offer support for targets of harassment, and to provide for accountability and disciplinary action for violations of the policy. This Professional Conduct Policy applies to all AAG staff, members, attendees and participants at any AAG-sponsored event, including online venues, and at AAG-sponsored meeting social events. All who are employed by the AAG, all who join as AAG members, all who register to participate, attend, speak at, or exhibit at an AAG event agree to comply with this Policy.</p>

                    <p>All AAG members are expected to aspire and adhere to the following standards of behavior:</p>
<p><strong>A. Principles</strong></p>

<p><em>Professional courtesy, equity, and fairness</em> in working with others</p>

<p><em>Unselfish cooperation in research </em>and<em> Legal compliance</em> in all aspects of research, including intellectual property</p>
<p><strong>B. Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> AAG Members will act with honesty in the interest of the advancement of science, take full responsibility for the trustworthiness of their research and its dissemination, and treat others with courtesy, equity, and fairness.</li>

<li><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> Members will disclose financial, personal, professional, and other conflicts of interest that could compromise the trustworthiness of their work on AAG committees, publications, research proposals, meeting presentations, and public communications as well as in all AAG honors and awards activities.</li>

<li><strong>Environment:</strong> AAG members are responsible for creating and upholding a safe, open, and professional environment for learning, conducting, and communicating science with integrity, respect, fairness, trustworthiness, and transparency at all organizational levels and in all scientific endeavors.</li>
<li><strong>Misconduct:</strong> AAG members will not engage in harassment, bullying, and prohibited behavior (see Section II.C for detail).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C. Harassment, Bullying, and Prohibited Behavior</strong></p>
<p>AAG prohibits any form of harassment, sexual or in other forms, at AAG events or in interactions by AAG members with individuals whom they encounter in connection with their professional roles, as set forth in its Professional Conduct Policy (see inset on p.2).</p>
<p>Accordingly, some behaviors are specifically prohibited, whether directed at other members, AAG staff, event attendees, speakers, exhibitors, event venue staff, colleagues, students, and others in connection with AAG activities or an AAG member’s professional role. The prohibitions in this policy do not apply to purely private interactions, even between AAG members, if unconnected to AAG activities or to the professional roles of the individuals.</p>
<p>Unacceptable behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical or verbal intimidation, including threats, stalking, or unwelcome following;</li>
<li>Any conduct that is harassing, abusive, discriminatory, or intentionally demeaning of a person by any attendees at the event and related event activities;</li>
<li>Personal attacks or other behavior during disagreements or in discussions;</li>
<li>Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, national origin, gender identity, or disability;</li>
<li>Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides);</li>
<li>Harassing or intimidating photography or recording;</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events; and</li>
<li>Unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention, including unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; unwelcome verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; an unwelcome display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; and offensive, unwanted physical contact such as patting, pinching, grabbing, groping, or constant brushing against another’s body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Member conduct that violates AAG’s Event Conduct Policy may also be considered a violation of this policy to the extent it violates the prohibitions in this policy.</p>

                    <p>Allegations of misconduct may be submitted to the AAG when the alleged action is directly connected to a program operated under the direction of the AAG, including its publications, presentations, meetings and events, or to the extent that conduct relates to the professional role of an AAG member.</p>
<p><strong>A. Scope and Purpose</strong></p>
<p>AAG recognizes that an allegation of misconduct does not constitute proof of misconduct. AAG recognizes that an allegation does, however, bear the potential to damage professional credibility and cast doubt on the entire career of an accused party. For that reason, the complainant and the accused party must maintain the confidentiality of their submissions to AAG and AAG’s communications with them about the matter during the pendency of the proceedings, and, when practicable in connection with its investigation, AAG staff and the Standing Committee will treat the submissions as confidential until a ruling on the merits by the Standing Committee and/or Council has been made, at which point confidentiality may or may not be preserved, depending on the case and the findings. Neither the complainant nor the accused party are prohibited from discussing with others the events that gave rise to the complaint, however.</p>
<p>This process is intended to determine whether a violation of the Code of Conduct Policy has occurred and if so, to decide on appropriate sanctions.</p>
<p><strong>B. Authorized Entities</strong></p>
<p>The AAG Council has appointed the members of the AAG Executive Committee (i.e., President, Vice President, Past President, Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Director) to serve as the members of the <em>Standing Committee on Disciplinary and Eligibility Matters for AAG Members</em>. The Executive Director is an ex officio member of the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>The Standing Committee is charged with investigating all complaints referred to it by the Executive Director that relate to violations by Association members of the Standing Rules on Professional Conduct, violations of other Association policies or Standing Rules, or that otherwise allege dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct by an Association member in relation to the Association or its activities, or to the professional role of the Association member. The Committee may also determine that a prospective member who has engaged in conduct in connection with the prospective member’s professional role that is contrary to the values of AAG, as reflected in its policies and Standing Rules, is ineligible for membership, based on a referral from the Executive Director. A determination by the Standing Committee that any such allegation is supported by the evidence shall warrant disciplinary action against a member as determined in the discretion of the Standing Committee, which may include but is not limited to suspension or temporary or permanent revocation of the membership and eligibility for membership in the Association of the subject of the complaint or restrictions on the member’s privileges and rights as a member, including temporary or permanent loss of eligibility to attend future AAG Annual Meetings or to hold leadership or Committee roles with AAG. With respect to prospective members, the Standing Committee may find the prospective member temporarily or permanently ineligible for membership.</p>
<p>The Standing Committee shall establish procedures for review of and decision on such matters that provide to the subject notice of the nature of the allegations and an opportunity to respond in writing. A member or prospective member who is the subject of an adverse finding may appeal to the Council a decision by the Standing Committee to impose a disciplinary revocation of membership or finding of temporary or permanent ineligibility for membership, by notifying the AAG Executive Director in writing within 30 days of being informed of the sanctions by the Standing Committee. If a decision of the Standing Committee is appealed, the Council will review the written record related to the matter and affirm, modify, or reverse the imposition of sanctions based on that review. Additional material that was available to the subject of the sanction but was not submitted to the Standing Committee will not be included in the record on appeal.</p>
<p><strong>C. Reporting a Complaint or Allegation</strong></p>
<p>Formal complaints or allegations regarding violations by Association members of the Standing Rules on Professional Conduct, violations of other Association policies or Standing Rules, or that otherwise allege dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct by an Association member in relation to the Association or its activities, or to the professional role of the Association member must be submitted in writing to the AAG Executive Director, Gary M. Langham, <a href="mailto:glangham@aag.org">glangham@aag.org</a> or Director of Operations, Candida Mannozzi, <a href="mailto:cmannozzi@aag.org">cmannozzi@aag.org</a> tel. 202-234-1450.</p>
<p>Complaints made under the Event Conduct Policy may be made orally to the Onsite Advocate or the Offsite Ombudsperson, but no action will be taken by AAG under this Professional Conduct Policy unless the complaint is also submitted in writing.</p>
<p>The Onsite Advocate is available to AAG meeting attendees and AAG members to provide advocacy-based counseling (safety planning, support, resource referral), stress management, and wellness resource navigation. Services will not include clinical mental health services (diagnosis, treatment planning, or psychiatric referral). Advocacy will be confidential and no records beyond a count of number of individuals served will be maintained. The Advocate will be available to consult with attendees about their institutional practices responding to harassment and general wellness needs. Consulting with the Advocate will not result in any further action by the AAG, unless a formal complaint is submitted to the AAG. However, as a Licensed Social Worker, the Advocate is bound to mandatory reporting requirements which would include unreported child abuse, unreported abuse of a vulnerable adult, an immediate threat of suicide, or a direct threat to a third party</p>
<p><strong>C. i. Filing a complaint or allegation</strong></p>
<p>Formal complaints or allegations must be signed by the complainant and must include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the person(s) submitting the complaint and the name and any other identifying detail (affiliation, etc.) of the person(s) alleged to have committed the violation.</li>
<li>A description of the event, including the date and circumstances of the alleged violation.</li>
<li>A statement explaining any relevant prior interactions or professional or personal relationship that the person filing has with the person(s) named in the complaint.</li>
<li>It is advisable for anyone submitting a complaint or allegation to keep notes on the names of potential witnesses. Allegations may be submitted in writing to Executive Director Gary M. Langham, <a href="mailto:glangham@aag.org">glangham@aag.org</a> or Director of Operations Candida Mannozzi, <a href="mailto:cmannozzi@aag.org">cmannozzi@aag.org</a> (with the subject line: AAG Policy Violation). Complaints may also be mailed in hard copy to:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Attn: AAG Conduct Policy Violation<br />
AAG<br />
P.O. Box 73158<br />
Washington, DC 20056<br />
USA</p>
<p>To the extent practical, the complainant should provide details, specific facts and documentation of the allegations. Additionally, the complainant should provide their contact information, including a phone number and email address.</p>
<p>The complaint must also include the following statement:</p>
<p>I authorize AAG to contact me regarding this complaint, if deemed necessary. I authorize AAG to release this complaint and all other supporting material I have provided or may provide in the future to the subject of the complaint, members of AAG’s Standing Committee on Disciplinary and Eligibility Matters for AAG Members, the AAG Council, AAG’s attorneys and others as deemed appropriate by AAG or as required by law. You may also file a grievance using our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexF-zPWPp5giIOORSBe2niG-HWjCsGwNS1w9nScNKHLRXZwQ/viewform">online complaint form</a>.</p>
<p><strong>C. ii. Preliminary Investigation</strong></p>
<p>The Director of Operations and Executive Director will review the allegations in the formal written complaint and determine whether the complaint, on its face, alleges a violation of the AAG’s policies. AAG has the sole discretion to determine which complaints should be pursued, how they should be pursued, and what action, if any, should be taken. If the alleged violations relate to conduct that occurred outside of AAG events or activities, AAG may, in its sole discretion, defer review of or action on the complaint unless and until the allegations have been investigated by a third party entity with jurisdiction over the actions and greater investigative authority than AAG, such as the member’s home institution or a court.</p>
<p>a) If the determination is that the allegations described in the complaint do not constitute a violation of applicable AAG policies, no further action will be taken and the complainant will be informed of this determination.</p>
<p>b) If the determination is that the formal written complaint alleges conduct in violation of applicable AAG policies the Executive Director will convene the Standing Committee on Disciplinary and Eligibility Matters for AAG Members and share the complaint with them for investigation. The Executive Director will also forward the complaint to the accused at the address(es) AAG has on file for the accused, unless the Standing Committee determines that consideration of the complaint should be deferred.</p>
<p>The accused may submit a written response to the complaint within 30 days after the date of the Executive Director’s notification. The response should be submitted to the Executive Director at <a href="mailto:glangham@aag.org">glangham@aag.org</a>. The Executive Director will forward the response to the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>After filing a complaint with AAG, a complainant may request that AAG provide protections from harassment, discrimination, or bullying at AAG activities. Such actions may include but are not limited to: barring the respondent from a complainant&#8217;s talk, barring a respondent from an AAG activity, or providing the complainant with an escort during AAG activities. If the complaint goes to a full investigation, AAG may consider further actions (such as providing an escort for AAG activities, or other steps deemed necessary to assure member safety) for harassment-related concerns that fall short of a formal complaint.</p>
<p>In some cases, an allegation may be resolved informally, such as through an apology and assurance that the action will not happen again (especially in cases of the respondent unknowingly causing offense), or it may best be resolved through mediation between the Complainant and the Respondent. The Complainant, or the Chair of the Standing Committee, may make a recommendation for mediation at any time during the investigation process, or as a final resolution after an investigation is completed.</p>
<p><strong>C. iii. Procedure for Investigation</strong></p>
<p>a) After receiving a complaint from the Executive Director, the Standing Committee will review the materials. During this time, the Standing Committee (chaired by the AAG President) may request additional information from the parties and may consult with AAG legal counsel in order to reach its decision. The Standing Committee may consider additional relevant information, including any information that is part of a member’s AAG record or information obtained from a third party. If AAG obtains additional information from a third party relevant to consideration of a complaint, that information will be shared with the subject of the complaint and it will be made part of the record. If the alleged violations relate to conduct that occurred outside of AAG events or activities, the Standing Committee may, in its sole discretion, defer review of or action on the complaint unless and until the allegations have been investigated by a third party entity with jurisdiction over the actions and greater investigative authority than AAG. In that event, the Standing Committee will notify the parties of its deferral decision.</p>
<p>b) The Standing Committee will meet to discuss the complaint and related information and submissions. Unless consideration or action by the Committee has been deferred, the Committee will make a determination, based on the evidence and its credibility determinations, about whether a violation of AAG policies has occurred. If the Committee finds a violation, the Committee will also determine the sanction that will imposed, in its discretion.</p>
<p><strong>C. iv. Sanctions</strong></p>
<p>Sanctions for a violation of the Professional Conduct Policy may include but are not limited to one or more of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Written reprimand or warning.</li>
<li>Removal from volunteer AAG position(s).</li>
<li>Placement of an author or reviewer on an AAG Editors’ watch list.</li>
<li>Suspension from publishing in AAG journals for a specific period, including permanently.</li>
<li>Suspension from attending or presenting at AAG-sponsored meetings for a specific period of time or permanently.</li>
<li>Suspension or temporary or permanent revocation of the membership and eligibility for membership in the Association.</li>
<li>Restrictions on the member’s privileges and rights as a member, including holding leadership or Committee roles with AAG.</li>
<li>If the offender is a prospective member, the Standing Committee may find the prospective member temporarily or permanently ineligible for membership.</li>
<li>Denial of eligibility for or revocation of AAG honors or awards.</li>
<li>Notification of offender’s employer.</li>
</ol>
<p>c) The outcome of AAG’s review of a complaint may or may not be made public.</p>
<p>d) Once the Standing Committee’s decision has been reached, the Executive Director or the Director of Operations will notify the involved parties in writing. Any adverse finding against the subject of the complaint will include a statement of the basis for the Standing Committee’s decision.</p>
<p>e) The subject of the complaint will have the opportunity to appeal a decision of the Standing Committee that suspends, revokes, or denies eligibility for membership, denies eligibility for or revokes an AAG honor or award. Appeals must be submitted in writing to AAG’s Executive Director within 30 days of the date of the notification of the adverse decision. Appeals must state with specificity the grounds on which the individual is requesting the appeal and must be signed. If an appeal is not postmarked or emailed within 30 calendar days of the notice of the Standing Committee’s decision, the Standing Committee’s decision shall constitute the final decision of AAG on the matter and shall not be subject to further review or appeal absent extraordinary circumstances, as determined solely by AAG.</p>
<p>f) In the event of an appeal, the AAG Council will review the written record related to the matter and affirm, modify, or reverse the finding of violation and imposition of sanctions based on that review. The review shall be limited to a determination of whether (1) a procedural error contributed to the Standing Committee’s decision or (2) the Standing Committee’s decision was arbitrary and capricious or was unsupported by the evidence. Additional material that was available to the subject of the sanction but was not submitted to the Standing Committee at the time of its deliberations will not be included in the record on appeal, and no new evidence will be considered after the date of submission of the appeal.</p>

                <h2>Standing Rules</h2>
<h5>PREFACE</h5>
<p>These Standing Rules have been documented under the provision of the AAG Bylaws (Section 12), which allows for the creation of a set of guidelines and additional information on the policies concerning the operation and administration of the Association. As such, they intend to provide guidance on procedural matters of business, drawn from past Council resolutions, historical practice, and the current context of ongoing association activities. This document does not represent a comprehensive description of AAG policies or procedures, but rather outlines a number of salient and frequently referenced matters related to how the association conducts its business. The Standing Rules are adopted by the AAG Council. Additions or updates to the Standing Rules appear in the published minutes of the Council as they are adopted. Changes to this document may be made by the AAG Executive Director and/or designee in accordance with future resolutions or policies that Council adopts. For the sake of clarification, it is important to note that the legal structure of the organization provides that exceptions to the Standing Rules may be made in coordination with the Officers (Executive Committee). In case of any contradiction, conflict with, or ambiguity about these Standing Rules, the AAG Constitution, Bylaws, or most recent council resolution on the matter will take precedence (see <u>Compilation of AAG Council Resolutions</u>).</p>

The Executive Director is an <i>ex officio </i>member of the Standing Committee.<br />
The Standing Committee is charged with investigating all complaints referred to it by the Executive Director that relate to violations by Association members of the Standing Rules on Professional Conduct, violations of other Association policies or Standing Rules, or that otherwise allege dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct by an Association member in relation to the Association or its activities, or to the professional role of the Association member. The Committee may also determine that a prospective member who has engaged in conduct in connection with the prospective member’s professional role that is contrary to the values of AAG, as reflected in its policies and Standing Rules, is ineligible for membership, based on a referral from the Executive Director. A determination by the Standing Committee that any such allegation is supported by the evidence shall warrant disciplinary action against a member as determined in the discretion of the Standing Committee, which may include but is not limited to suspension or temporary or permanent revocation of the membership and eligibility for membership in the Association of the subject of the complaint or restrictions on the member’s privileges and rights as a member, including temporary or permanent loss of eligibility to attend future AAG Annual Meetings or to hold leadership or Committee roles with AAG.

A member or prospective member may appeal to the Council a decision by the Standing Committee to impose a disciplinary revocation of membership or finding of temporary or permanent ineligibility for membership, by notifying the AAG Executive Director in writing within 30 days of being informed of the sanctions by the Standing Committee. If a decision of the Standing Committee is appealed, the Council will review the written record related to the matter and affirm, modify, or reverse the imposition of sanctions based on that review. Additional material that was available to the subject of the sanction but was not submitted to the Standing Committee will not be included in the record on appeal.</p>

In instances where a member or specialty group wishes to organize a field trip that explicitly excludes any group of AAG members, the organizer will petition the AAG Council for an exception to this policy by the date when field trip proposals are due. If Council grants the exception, notice will be given in the AAG Newsletter, along with an explanation of the reason for the exception. The substance of this resolution shall be included in the annual call for field trip proposals that appears in the AAG Newsletter.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Registration Fees</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>No complimentary annual meeting registrations will be granted (October, 1990).</li>
<li>No registration fee will be charged to non‑attending co‑authors of paper or poster presentations (May, 1986).</li>
<li>The Association will pay annual meeting registration fees for fifty-year members recognized at the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Other</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The AAG Annual Meeting will be held in Canada only at the invitation of the Canadian Association of Geographers and a Canadian university geography department (August, 1989).</li>
<li>The AAG shall henceforth avoid scheduling its annual meetings on major religious holidays (April, 1992).</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>. In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the AAG and its contracted facilities hotel&#8217;s management make reasonable accommodations to the extent possible when they are requested. Individuals requiring such accommodations are asked to make their needs known to the AAG and the hotel&#8217;s management as early as possible so they can make every effort to provide the requested accommodations.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Conduct</strong>. Professional ideas and information are exchanged most effectively at the AAG&#8217;s Annual Meeting in an atmosphere free of abuse or harassment and characterized by courtesy and respect. To that end, the AAG expects all individuals who attend to conduct themselves in a manner which establishes an atmosphere free from discriminatory practices and sexual harassment. The contents of annual meeting presentations by individuals or groups at the annual meeting are theirs alone. The American Association of Geographers neither endorses nor disclaims the conclusions, interpretations, or opinions expressed by speakers at its annual meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Union Hotels.</strong> Once the site for the annual meeting is chosen, the AAG will actively solicit and give preference to a suitable unionized hotel in cities selected for the AAG annual meeting. If on review, the AAG Executive Committee concludes that cost or other considerations indicate that a non-union hotel should be used in a city with a union hotel option, then the Executive Committee should detail the rationale for its choice to the Council and at the AAG business meeting. The AAG will continue to negotiate, and if possible strengthen, existing force majeure language in AAG annual meeting hotel contracts. (April, 2005).</li>

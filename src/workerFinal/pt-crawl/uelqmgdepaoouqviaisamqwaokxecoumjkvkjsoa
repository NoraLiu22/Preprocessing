These assumptions originate in casual or unscientific descriptions in the writings of Barclay Squire, Ramsbotham and Dom Anselm Hughes, and while many other things have been questioned, new theories have been constantly re-erected on the same foundations. It seemed to me that the only way of testing any of these hypotheses and, should they be found wanting, of seeking substitutes for them, was to start afresh on the manuscript itself.</p><p data-block-key="f6h47"><a href="/documents/1/Bent.pdf">Margaret Bent Dissertation</a></p><p data-block-key="44fry"></p><h3 data-block-key="pgsat">Jacques Boogaart, &#x27;O Series Summe Rata&#x27;.

Aside from these textual examples, the only source where the term appears specifically in connection with musical notation is LonBL 17802-5 (the Gyffard Partbooks) which includes three Masses entitled “Upon the Square,” one by William Whitbroke (c.1501-1569) and two by William Mundy (c.1528-1591). Based on these Masses and other fragmentary evidence, the term square has come to be defined by modern scholars as a melody in measured notation (usually for tenor voice range), that most likely originated as the lowest part of a previously existing polyphonic composition (usually for three-voices), and was extracted for use in one or more later compositions.</p><p data-block-key="csxix">Extant compositional evidence further suggests that squares derived from the practices of formulaic improvisation and ex tempore performance as described in contemporary theoretical treatises; perhaps as an “intermediary” phenomena, between preexistent melodies such as chant, and complex polyphonic compositions that are in turn based upon the preexistent melody. In other words, squares seem to have involved extemporizing or composing upon a melody that was once extemporized or composed upon a melody.</p><p data-block-key="9wzwk">This study explores the extent to which this practice was used within English preand post-Reformation sacred music. It concerns both the origin and creation of squares as an extension of the practical training used by period musicians, and the use of squares in further polyphonic settings throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. In particular, this study aims to demonstrate the variety of uses for these melodies, including how some squares may have been tailored for the liturgical needs of individual parishes and churches; as well as provide a window into the general methodology of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century elaboration and composition.</p><p data-block-key="ycp3j"><a href="/documents/674/Chisholm_PhD_Squares.pdf">Chisholm PhD Squares.pdf</a></p><p data-block-key="yzp0s"></p><h3 data-block-key="lf8my">Alice V.

However, the turbulent history of the Church in England has left few English sources for this deeply influential repertory. The developing narrative surrounding apparently English technical innovations has therefore often focussed on the recognition of English works in continental manuscripts, with these efforts most recently crystallised in Curtis and Wathey’s ‘Fifteenth-Century English Liturgical Music: A List of the Surviving Repertory’. The focus of discussion until now has generally been on a dichotomy between English and continental origin. However, as more details emerge of the opportunities for cultural cross-fertilisation, it becomes increasingly clear that this may be a false dichotomy.</p><p data-block-key="rec6x">This thesis re-evaluates the complex issues of provenance and diffusion affecting the mid-fifteenth-century cyclic Mass. By breaking down the polarization between English and continental origins, it offers a new understanding of the provenance and subsequent use of many Mass cycles.</p><p data-block-key="2iuh0"><a href="/documents/138/JamesCook_1.pdf">JamesCook_1.pdf</a></p><p data-block-key="k72ti"><a href="/documents/139/JamesCook_2.pdf">JamesCook_2.pdf</a></p><p data-block-key="utq0c"></p><h3 data-block-key="ozhaa">Karen M Cook, Theoretical Treatments of the Semiminim in a Changing Notational World c.1315–c.1440 (PhD, Duke University, 2012)</h3><p data-block-key="zbqee">A semiminim is typically defined as a note value worth half a minim, usually drawn as a flagged or colored minim. That definition is one according to which generations of scholars have constructed chronologies and provenances for fourteenth- and fifteenth-century music and the people who created it. ‘Semiminims’ that do not match this definition are often portrayed in modern scholarship as anomalous, or early prototypes, or evidence of poor education, or as peculiarities of individual preference. My intensive survey of the extant theoretical literature from the earliest days of the Ars Nova through c. 1440 reveals how the conceptualization and codification of notation occurred in different places according to different fundamental principles, resulting not in one semiminim but a plethora of related small note values.</p><p data-block-key="9ubyp">These phenomena were dynamic and unstable, and a close study of them helps to clarify a range of historical issues. Localized traditions have often been strictly bounded in scholarly literature; references to French, Italian, and English notation are commonplace. I explain notational preferences in Italy, England, central Europe, and the rest of western Europe with regard to these small note values but demonstrate that theorists educated in each of these places routinely incorporated portions of other traditions. This process began long before the ‘ars subtilior,’ dating at least to the time of Franco of Cologne. Rarely were regional traditions truly isolated; the various aspects of semiminim-family note values were debated and adapted for decades across these cultural and geographical boundaries. The central theme of my research is to show how and why the theoretical conceptualization of these myriad small note values is key to understanding the continual merging of these local preferences into a more amalgamated style of notation by the mid-fifteenth century.</p><p data-block-key="fmx9v"><a href="/documents/141/Cook-Diss.pdf">KarenCook-Diss.pdf</a></p><p data-block-key="k45p1"><a href="/documents/140/Cook-Diss-Corrigendum.pdf">KarenCook-Diss-Corrigendum.pdf</a></p><h3 data-block-key="75032">Andrew Cornall, The Practice of Music at Norwich Cathedral c. 1558–1649 (MMus, University of East Anglia, 1976)</h3><p data-block-key="3f25f">Tracks the cathedral and diocese as a whole chronologically, with a teble of musicians that is a reference point for all information dealing with dates and positions.

Earp, Scribal practice, manuscript production and the transmission of music in late medieval France: the manuscripts of Guillaume de Machaut (PhD, Princeton University, 1983)</h3><p data-block-key="bb5h2">This dissertation is a study of the seven principal MSS transmitting the musical works of Guillaume de Machaut. The first chapter refines our knowledge of the complex of musical and textual MSS, and the theoretical citations that witness Machaut•s works, as well as the evidence of lost MSS. In chapter two, new observations about the structure and internal. organization of the contents of the larger MSS have revised the current picture. MS Par. fr. 1584 (A} has an index prescriptive of an order not consistently carried out as the MS was copied, usually due to spacing requirements. The index order is compelling chronologically for a group of rondeaux, supporting Hoepffner•s thesis that Machaut•s works follow each other more-or-less chronologically in the MSS. On art historical grounds, Fran~ois Avril has recently placed the MS Par. fr. 1586 (C), formerly thought to be from the 15th century, in the early 1350s. The early date helps to bridge the chronological gap in sources for the polyphonic chanson. Scribal indications and literary evidence now suggest that polyphonic chansons by Machaut were first composed in the 1340s.</p><p data-block-key="k6gyo">Chapter three focuses on the copying of text and music-in the MSS. Regardless of the style of the music, text was always entered first. This was a guiding principle in French MSS throughout the 14th and early l5th century, and bears upon questions of texting in 15th-century sources. Chapter four considers aspects of the transmission of the works, both evidence from the texts of the narrative poems, and readings for musical works. Mechanical copying errors are distinguished from notational problems. Some notational irregularities can be tied to chronological developments, others seem to be designed to facilitate performance by less literate musicians. Particularly interesting are variants in many lais in the MS Par. fr. 9221 (E), copied in the 1390s. Radical rearrangement of the disposition of text and music suggests the intervention of someone actively interested in their performance.</p><p data-block-key="xjg8u">An appendix supplies information on the physical makeup of the principal MSS, and information on the disposition of miniatures among the HSS.</p><p data-block-key="a0y3m"><a href="/documents/31/Earp-diss.pdf">Earp-diss.pdf</a></p><p data-block-key="0idum"></p><h3 data-block-key="kvaxo">Warwick A.

Focusing on music theory sources and on other indirect testimonies, they have never satisfactorily approached the central question of the teaching of music in the Arts faculty of Paris.

The first part of this study re-examines the two principal sources (F-CH!564 and I-MOe5.24) of a partially shared ars subtilior repertoire and concludes that, despite the presence in part of a repertoire ostensibly composed north of the Alps (c. 1380-1395), these manuscripts were compiled in or close to major centres on the Italian peninsula (Florence and Pisa/Bologna/Florence respectively). These conclusions form the background to the second part of this study that identifies cultural tendencies/influences in the notation of musical rhythm in the ars subtilior repertoire.</p><p data-block-key="m12yo"><a href="/documents/47/Stoessel_v1.pdf">Stoessel_v1.pdf</a></p><p data-block-key="0olow"><a href="/documents/48/Stoessel_v2.pdf">Stoessel_v2.pdf</a><br/></p><h3 data-block-key="9ymwd">Brian Trowell, Music under the later Plantagenets (PhD, University of Cambridge, 1960)</h3><p data-block-key="8v2ii">Caveat: some parts of the pages are quite pale and difficult to read.

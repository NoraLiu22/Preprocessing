<p align="left">
New library resource discovery technologies have transformed the way in which students and scholars search for and access electronic library resources. Research has been carried out to explore the operation of these technologies, to improve their efficiency, and to establish the foundations for new discovery services, enabling a much richer and improved user experience in relation to access to information across the landscape of UK education and research. Evidence from libraries' annual statistical returns to the Society of College, National and University Libraries (SCONUL) suggests that changes in the usage of e-resources have been observed to coincide with the introduction of new Resource Discovery Systems (RDS). To date there has been little formal research into these changes. 
</p>

<p align="left">
<i><a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/infosci/lisu/pages/research/uksg-jisc.html">Assessing the Impact of Library Discovery Technology on Content Usage</a></i> is a research project commissioned by <a href="http://www.uksg.org/">UKSG</a>, with the support of <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a>, which seeks to examine in depth the outcomes for libraries, and in particular to quantify changes in the use of library resources, brought about when new RDS tools are introduced, and what this means for individual libraries, for publishers and resource providers, and for the wider library sector as a whole.
</p>

<p align="left">
The project has three main strands:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Survey of libraries:<br />
	We have conducted a brief survey of HE libraries in the UK to scope the project. With responses from 62 libraries, preliminary analysis shows that 11 per cent had chosen not to implement RDS at this stage, 11 per cent were in the process of implementing a system, and the remainder had systems in place, some dating back to 2007. The most common systems used are Summon, Primo and Ebsco Discovery Services. </li>
	<li class="spacetop">Library case studies:<br />
	We are conducting case studies with a small number of libraries using different RDS tools, all of whom have two years' experience and usage data available. Detailed analysis of aggregated usage data both before and after implementation will be supplemented by in-depth interviews with staff to obtain a rounded picture of the impact of RDS on resource usage from the library's point of view.</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Publisher case studies and stakeholder interviews:<br />
	We will also undertake a small number of case studies of individual publishers, analysing their usage data for the case study libraries, and interviewing relevant staff to obtain the publishers' perspective on the issues. Interviews are also planned with RDS suppliers and other stakeholders. </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">
All the evidence gathered will be synthesised (anonymously) into a final report, with preliminary results presented at the UKSG Global Forum on 15th November 2013 in London.

<p align="left">
The need to find good quality research has probably never been greater. Researchers need to find collaborators, research managers want to develop commercial partnerships, and funders have to demonstrate the value of their investments.</p>

<p>Discovering and tracking research outputs across different scholarly systems, however, is more difficult than it should be. The key to finding a solution to this problem is the systematic collection and use of good, standardised metadata &#150; information about the books, papers and articles that researchers produce.
</p>

<p align="left">
Over the years, various metadata schemas and models for scholarly outputs have emerged, but they have led to a very fragmented metadata landscape. Repositories have taken different approaches to metadata implementation &#150; some have gone down the tailor-made route, customising metadata fields to suit their own particular requirements or preferences, while others have simply adopted the default option with their software or applied known metadata schemas. This difference of approach has made interoperability between scholarly systems within institutions and those held by funders hard to achieve.
</p>

<p align="left">
So, in April 2013, <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> and <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/">UKOLN</a> launched the first release of a new Metadata Application Profile and associated guidelines. Known as <a href="http://www.rioxx.net/">RIOXX</a>, it will enable the efficient tracking of research outputs across scholarly systems. Crucially, RIOXX mandates the collection of metadata describing funder names and unique project identifiers. Reliably linking funding information with research outputs will benefit anyone needing to track research across scholarly systems.
</p>

<p align="left">
RIOXX takes into account the increasing use of Current Research Information Systems (<a href="http://www.eurocris.org/Index.php?page=concepts_benefits&amp;t=1">CRIS</a>) within universities and the use of funders' systems &#150; for example, Research Councils UK's Research Outcomes System (<a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/researchoutcomes/pages/ROS.aspx">ROS</a>). These various systems aim to capture a richer (but inevitably more complex) picture of how projects, people and outputs connect, and they increase the need for efficient data exchange and interoperability between systems.
</p>

<p align="left">
RIOXX has also taken into consideration widely used metadata schemas such as the Electronic Theses Online System (<a href="http://ethostoolkit.cranfield.ac.uk/tiki-index.php">EThOS</a>) and Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe (<a href="http://www.openaire.eu/">OpenAIRE</a>) metadata guidelines. And at Jisc, we are working to ensure that the RIOXX application profile can be expressed in <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/isc/reports/cerif-landscape-study-2012/CERIF-UK-landscape-report-v1.1.pdf">CERIF</a>, to support data exchange between repositories and CRISs.
</p>

<p align="left">
The launch of RIOXX coincided with the implementation of RCUK's <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/outputs.aspx">revised policy on open access</a> (OA), which requires publicly funded research to be disseminated via OA routes. In support of this policy Jisc's Vocabularies for Open Access (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/topics/digitallibraries/pals-group/v4oa.aspx">V4OA</a>) project is collaborating with a number of stakeholders such as the National Information Standards Organisation (<a href="http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</a>), Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (<a href="http://oaspa.org/">OASPA</a>), Society of College, National and University Libraries (<a href="http://www.sconul.ac.uk/">SCONUL</a>) and United Kingdom Council of Research Repositories (<a href="http://ukcorr.org/">UKCoRR</a>) to seek a common understanding of the OA terms required to support the efficient sharing of information.
</p>

<p align="left">
The V4OA expert advisory panel is soon to conclude its work: public consultation will follow in mid September. The recommendations of the V4OA should be useful to stakeholders across the scholarly communications landscape, and they will be incorporated into future releases of the RIOXX application profile and guidelines. This will support compliance monitoring with the Research Councils' policy. It is expected that the next release of <a href="http://www.rioxx.net/news/">RIOXX</a> will be towards the end of November 2013 &#150; as with the first release, plug-ins for EPrints and DSpace repository software will be provided to support implementation.

</i>
</p>


<p align="left">
The goal of this project is to develop an open source repository of good practices in the field of grey literature. That which originated in monographic form<a href="#Note1"><sup>1</sup></a> will now open and expand to include content from the global grey literature community. Such practices will range from the production and processing of grey literature through to its distribution, uses, and preservation. The repository will contain guidelines such as those in handling theses and dissertations, how to write research reports, metadata required for working papers as well as good practices in the subject areas of agriculture, health, education, energy, environment, <i>et cetera</i>. The purpose of an online repository of good practice in grey literature will provide the many stakeholders in government, academics, business and industry with the benefits of experience, sustained management, and proven results. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The procedure initially applied in this project deals with the design and development of a template that will capture data and information about published as well as proposed good practices within a standard format. While the metadata captured in the template are indeed standardized, their accompanying full-text documents need not be. Furthermore, the template seeks to identify intended users of a good practice, as well as metadata that will facilitate the search and retrieval of records in the repository. 
</p>

Technical developments related to the design and construction of the repository, its eventual platform as well as its maintenance are other related issues addressed in the project. While there are no direct costs associated with the project, each partner is committed to allocate human and material resources needed to carry out their related tasks. It is expected that the initial phase in acquiring records for the repository will rely on channels available through the Grey Literature Network Service. Populating the repository will be somewhat time-consuming and the first harvest will not produce an abundance of records. The project is long term; however, it is all the more worthwhile. The <a href="http://greyguide.isti.cnr.it/">GreyGuide</a> will provide a unique resource in the field of grey literature that is long awaited and that responds to the information needs of a diverse, international grey literature community.

<p align="left">
SPRUCE is a JISC funded project aiming to support digital preservation and make it sustainable via community approaches. Much of the resource behind digital preservation activities is project based and there are obvious difficulties associated with long term work that is supported with a finite or intermittent funding stream. Organisations with growing digital collections but no preservation infrastructure can struggle to make the leap that is necessary to secure their digital assets. A key aim for SPRUCE has been to support practitioners and middle managers in making the case within their organisations to adequately fund digital preservation.
</p>

<p align="left">
It's typical for senior management to request that a business case is prepared, if an organisation would like to change, adapt or expand its activities in a way that requires additional resources. It will outline what resources are required, what the resource will be used to achieve, and how this new investment will benefit the organisation. But making the case to prioritise work that may not have obvious or immediate benefits can be challenging.
</p>

<p align="left">
The new Digital Preservation Business Case Toolkit provides an array of helpful information to assist in the construction of a business case, from planning and preparation all the way through to polishing and communicating the finished case. No two business cases are alike, and there is no magic formula for creating one. The aim, stakeholders and context will vary significantly from one situation to another. The Toolkit therefore aims to ask all the right questions and assist a practitioner in thinking about what should go into their own business case.

</p>

<p>September 5, 2013 &#151; &quot;The National Information Standards Organization and UKSG announce the release of a draft for public comment of a revision to the <i>Knowledge Bases and Related Tools (KBART) Recommended Practice</i>. Issued in 2010, the original recommended practice provided all parties in the information supply chain with straightforward guidance about metadata formatting to ensure the exchange of accurate metadata between content providers and knowledge base developers. Building on the initial recommendations, the draft revision focuses on the more granular, complex issues that cause problems in metadata supply, including consortia-specific metadata transfer, metadata transfer for open access publications, and metadata transfer for e-books and conference proceedings....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The KBART Phase II draft is open for public comment through October 4, 2013. To download the draft or submit online comments, visit the KBART Information Hub at: <a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/kbart">http://www.niso.org/workrooms/kbart</a>.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">IMLS Announces Grant for National Forum on the Role of Public Libraries in Local Open Government
</p>

<p>August 28, 2013 &#151; &quot;The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) announced today a $99,713 grant to the <a href="http://www.idevmail.net/link.aspx?l=5&amp;d=73&amp;mid=333844&amp;m=1682">Center for Technology in Government at the University at Albany</a> for a national forum that will lead to a better understanding of how public libraries help citizens engage with local governments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More and more local governments are investing in open government initiatives. Public libraries are integral partners in these local open government 'ecosystems.' The ecosystems feature relationships of mutual interdependence with community organizations like social service nonprofits, civil society organizations, businesses, and libraries. As the public increasingly accesses government information and services at libraries, it is important for libraries and local governments to understand how best to work together to meet public needs. The project will include a concept paper, use of online tools to solicit input from stakeholders, a face-to-face workshop, and a widely distributed report.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Public libraries have always helped citizens find information about local government programs and services,' said IMLS Director Susan Hildreth. 'As government agencies provide more services online, public libraries are taking on an ever greater role in connecting the public to these services. We are pleased to be supporting a project that explores ways libraries and local government can collaboratively partner to enhance civic engagement.'&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Research Libraries UK Joins The European Library
</p>

<p>August 19, 2013 &#151; &quot;The UK consortium of scholarly libraries, Research Libraries 
UK (RLUK), has recently joined The European Library, a membership organisation that provides 
services to researchers, with access to more than 200 million records and digital items from all of 
Europe's national libraries and a growing number of research libraries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;RLUK's vision is to provide the best research library support in the world and to work with members 
and partners, nationally and internationally, in order to shape and realise the vision of the modern 
research library &#150; a vision importantly shared by The European Library. One of the founding principles 
of RLUK is recognition of the value that arises from cooperation amongst libraries and the sharing of 
resources and data. This agreement is a natural extension of that founding principle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The new cooperation will allow for the ingestion of data from RLUK's member libraries into The 
European Library portal, providing researchers across the globe with greater access to digital items 
and bibliographic records held by these libraries. The data provided by RLUK will also be 
disseminated via The European Library's API and developers will be able to create applications to 
search and display this data.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The data provided by RLUK will additionally be made available as Linked Open Data. This is part of 
The European Library's aim of working with its members to expose a set of their combined 
bibliographic metadata as a CC0 dataset &#150; a dataset openly available for any type of reuse. RLUK's 
valuable data will now be integrated into the larger European Library set, thereby providing a rich 
source of reusable knowledge from Europe's most prestigious libraries.&quot;</p>

The Declaration is the cornerstone document of Stripling's presidential initiative, Libraries Change Lives, which is designed to build the public will  and sustained support for America's right to libraries of all types &#150; academic, special, school and public. Stripling's initiative will focus on transformative library practices in literacy, innovation and community engagement.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stripling was joined by Kent Oliver, director, Nashville Public Library; Nashville library leaders and community members. All were among the first to sign the Declaration, which will serve as a strong public statement about the value of libraries as institutions that empower individuals, strengthen families, build communities and protect our right to know. Signings are being organized at libraries and other locations throughout the nation. The petitions will be presented to Congress by library supporters during National Library Legislative Day activities from May 5 - 6, 2014. Online signing of the Declaration will be made available later this summer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As many families continue to struggle to make ends meet, public libraries are positioned to play a critical role. According to the ALA's '<a href="http://www.ala.org/research/sites/ala.org.research/files/content/initiatives/plftas/issuesbriefs/issuebrief-weatherstorm.pdf">Public Library Funding and Technology Access Study</a> (PDF),' job seekers use public libraries to access the Internet to seek and apply for employment.  Each day an estimated 300,000 people receive job-seeking help at public libraries.  The report also shows that more than 62 percent of libraries report that they are the only source of free public access to computers and the Internet in their communities.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">ALA gears up for national Digital Inclusion Survey
</p>

<p>August 7, 2013 &#151; &quot;Starting this September, the <a href="http://www.ala.org/offices/ors">American Library Association (ALA) Office for Research &amp; Statistics</a> and the <a href="http://ipac.umd.edu/">University of Maryland Information Policy &amp; Access Center</a> will begin capturing information about the vital roles public libraries play in supporting digital inclusion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>Digital Inclusion Survey</i> will take the pulse of public library service in the areas of digital literacy, economic and workforce development, civic engagement, educational support, health information and public access to the internet....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Funded by a three-year, National Leadership Grant award from the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute for Museum &amp; Library Services (IMLS)</a>, the study builds on the long-running <a href="http://www.ala.org/plinternetfunding">Public Library Funding &amp; Technology Access Study</a>, which provided a 'state of the library' <a href="http://www.ala.org/research/plftas/2011_2012">report</a> on the technology resources brokered by libraries and the funding that enables free public access to these resources. The <a href="http://www.icma.org/">International City/County Management Association (ICMA)</a> and the <a href="http://www.ala.org/oitp">ALA Office for Information Technology Policy (OITP)</a> serve as partners on the grant....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The survey will provide national and state estimates, but more importantly, will interactively show public libraries in context with community-level data (e.g., graduation and unemployment rates). Survey participants will be able to identify community impacts of library public computer and Internet access; identify gaps in technology services based on community needs and demographics; and demonstrate library contributions to community digital inclusion efforts.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Connecting with People and Institutions at Digital Preservation 2013
</p>

<p>August 5, 2013 blog posting by Erin Engle, Digital Archivist, National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP)  &#151; &quot;How do people outside of our community think about digital preservation? In her opening, Hilary Mason, chief scientist at bit.ly and the first speaker at Digital Preservation 2013, posed this question, framing her talk from the perspective of computer engineers and those working in start-up businesses.  She went on to talk about the evolution of bit.ly and data archiving, noting that preservation without access is useless. Her thoughtful keynote set an excellent stage for the next few days of presentations and discussions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hilary was one of of two dozen speakers, including Lisa Green of Common Crawl, Emily Gore of DPLA and Rodrigo Davies of the MIT Center for Civic Media Labs, invited to share their views and work during our annual summer meeting. Some of the speakers were not directly involved in the preservation or long-term access to cultural heritage, scholarly or scientific digital materials. But we like to invite speakers who expose our audience to the perspectives of those organizations creating, consuming and accessing digital information. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One of the goals of our annual meeting is to support the development of expertise for digital preservation through education and training of working professionals and students. Hearing from a community of data producers and researchers as well practitioners and stewards of digital information, we can better understand together the current challenges and potential collaborative solutions of stewarding digital materials for future use and research value.  People getting together in person to discuss issues, share ideas and work together on solving shared problems is an activity we find invaluable and a core benefit to our work....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Aside from the great presentations, a couple of highlights for us at the meeting included:&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The release of the <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/07/the-2014-national-agenda-for-digital-stewardship-is-released/?loclr=blogsig">2014 National Agenda for Digital Stewardship</a>.  Micah Altman, director of research, libraries, MIT, rolled out the agenda, noting that the document integrates the perspective of dozens of experts and hundreds of institutions to provide funders and other executive decision-makers with insight into emerging technological trends, gaps in digital stewardship capacity, and key areas for development.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/06/and-the-winner-is-announcing-the-2013-ndsa-innovation-award-winners/?loclr=blogsig">Presentation of the NDSA Innovation Awards</a>.  The awards winners were officially recognized during the meeting. Each of the winners talked briefly about their work and projects, and we find that it's a nice way to mark achievements by organizations and individuals in the field.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>August 2, 2013 &#151; &quot;ARL has selected 26 individuals to participate in the 2013-2015 ARL Leadership Fellows program &#150; formerly the Research Library Leadership Fellows (RLLF) Program. This executive leadership program meets the increasing demands for succession planning for research libraries with a new approach to preparing the next generation of deans and directors. Library directors are seeking a cohort of well-trained and sophisticated candidates who possess the necessary experience and perspective to succeed in premier leadership positions in large, complex institutions. The ARL Leadership Fellows program provides such a cohort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This fifth offering of the program is being designed and sponsored by six ARL member libraries: University of Guelph Library, North Carolina State University Libraries, Purdue University Libraries, University of Toronto Libraries, Vanderbilt University Library, and University of Waterloo Library. The program begins in October 2013 with an orientation at the ARL Membership Meeting. The orientation provides an introduction to an in-depth 360-degree assessment designed to provide feedback to experienced library managers. The 2013-15 fellows will subsequently attend a Strategic Issues Institute at Vanderbilt University in November 2013.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The 2013-15 ARL Leadership Fellows applicant pool was highly competitive. The selection committee, composed of the ARL directors sponsoring the program, chose 26 fellows representing a broad array of backgrounds and experiences and from multiple ARL and non-ARL institutions.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">IMLS Announces Second Heritage Health Index
</p>

<p>July 19, 2013 &#151; &quot;Heritage Preservation, working in cooperation with IMLS, will conduct a second Heritage Health Index. The original survey, conducted nearly 10 years ago, was the first comprehensive study to assess the condition of U.S. collections. It examined the state of preservation across the entire spectrum of collecting institutions, large and small, from internationally renowned art museums and research libraries to local historical societies and specialized archives. The results were published in the groundbreaking <a href="http://www.idevmail.net/link.aspx?l=6&amp;d=73&amp;mid=333844&amp;m=1613">A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections</a> and reported that 4.8 billion artifacts held in public trust were at risk and that 190 million were in need of immediate care....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The new Heritage Health Index, HHI II, will use a similar instrument and methodology to the 2004 study to see what changes have taken place in collections care in the U.S. during the last ten years. HHI II will examine the extent and effectiveness of preservation activities and initiatives during that time and will recommend actions to improve the care of collections and ensure that they will be available for public access now and in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since the Heritage Health Index was first conducted, there has been a significant increase in museums and libraries collecting digital material or digitizing collections. HHI II will address this by including questions asking how institutions are caring for digital artifacts. It will also determine how creating digital surrogates may be improving access to paper, photograph, audiovisual, and other collections, while protecting them from damage due to handling.&quot;</p>

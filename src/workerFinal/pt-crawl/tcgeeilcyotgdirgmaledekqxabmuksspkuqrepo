<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>American Indian Sculpture, Carving, and Figurines</H1>


As with many American Indian arts, there were originally many different native sculpture traditions in North America. In the Southwest, Indian sculptors carved
small stone figurines in animal, human, and supernatural shapes, usually known as "storytellers" or "fetishes." Some, like 
Zuni fetishes, were totemic and
featured inlaid eyes and heart lines; others, like Navajo storytellers, were strung together 
into 'fetish necklaces' that served as mnemonics for traditional
stories.

 Pueblo artists carved figurines from clay and fired them in their pottery kilns, and the 
Hopi carved elaborate kachina dolls from whole cottonwood roots. 
In the Northwest, Indian woodcarvers are best known for their impressive totem poles and intricate bentwood boxes. The 
Ojibway and other northern Plains 
Indians carved pipes and ceremonial objects out of catlinite clay (known as pipestone). The Iroquois
tribes and their distant relatives the Cherokee were known 
for their elaborate wooden masks, and the Algonquian peoples of the east carved staffs 
and bowls primarily out of tree roots. Further to the north, the 
Inuit ("Eskimos") carved ceremonial dance masks from wood and figurines from ivory and soapstone. Of course, since there were lively trade routes throughout 
native North America, even in ancient times different American Indian sculpture styles spread beyond a single tribe or culture group, and after colonization,
displacement from their native lands made it hard for Indian sculptors to find their traditional materials, so fusion styles of sculpture arose. Today many 
contemporary Indian sculptors also use Western materials and techniques to depict native people, experiences, and themes.
<BR><BR>
If you are looking to buy sculpture, figurines, or carvings that were actually made by Native Americans--either because it's important to you to have the real thing 
or because you want to support native people with your purchase--then here is our list of American Indian sculptors whose carvings are available online. If 
you have a website of Indian sculpture to add to this list, <A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">let us know</A>. 
We gladly advertise any individual native artist or native-owned art store here free of charge, provided that all carvings were made by tribally
recognized American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists.
<BR><BR>
Thank you for your interest in Native American art!

Not many people are truly in the market for buying a 30-foot-tall, $75,000 work of art, but Northwest Coast and Athabaskan Indian artists are still
making these impressive sculptures in the traditional way today, and some of them carve smaller totem poles for sale (the one at left is about four feet high).

Kachina carving is a uniquely <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/hopi.htm">Hopi</a> art. Though commonly called "dolls" they are in fact stylized
religious icons, meticulously hand-carved from whole cottonwood roots by a small number of Hopi artists

if you are interested in buying some of the carvings featured on this page, please contact the artists directly. 
Though we have featured only Native American sculptures identified with the name and tribal affiliation of each artist, we haven't 
called the tribal offices to check up on any of them, and we only know a few of them personally. We also don't guarantee any of their products. 
This is not an exhaustive list of Native American sculpture--if you would like us to add your carving site to this page, please 
<A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">contact us</A> with your URL and tribal affiliation. We advertise any individual native artist or 
native-owned art business here free of charge. We do <U>not</u> link to masks which are not made by tribally recognized 
American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists, so please do not ask us to. And finally, websites do occasionally expire and change hands, so use 
your common sense and this general rule of thumb<B>:</b> if the creator of each individual artwork is not identified by name and specific tribe, 
you are probably not looking at genuine Native American sculpture.

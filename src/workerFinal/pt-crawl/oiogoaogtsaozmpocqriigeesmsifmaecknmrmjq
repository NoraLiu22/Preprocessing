        hspace="15" width="200" height="275"> Indonesia's largest and least developed province, Sumatra rests
                      along the equator, heavily forested and rich in rare wildlife.
                      The island's slow development has made it ideal for eco-tourism,
                      and numerous large reserves and preservation areas have
                      been set aside. Its most famous park, <a
        href="indono02.htm#mount" class="smalllinksunderline">Mount Leuser National Park</a>,
                      is one of the last refuges of the Sumatra Orang-Utan.</p>
                <p>Another distinguished
                      park is the Berbak Wildlife Reserve, which has one of Indonesia's
                      largest tiger populations. In the far north of the island
                      is <a name="indono02.htm#toba">Lake Toba</a>, an enormous and extraordinarily
                      beautiful crater lake.<font face="Verdana"><a name="indono02.htm#toba"></a></font></p>
                <p>A particularly enthralling adventure
                    experience in Sumatra takes place on the Alas River, which
                    winds its across North Sumatra through jungle, limestone
                    gorges, and native villages. The voyage begins in the Karo
                    Highlands and culminates with the Indian Ocean: a descent
                    ten times that of the Grand Canyon's Colorado River.</p>
                <p><br clear="all">
                <a name="bali"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Bali</b></span></p>
                <p>Bali is an island where art
                    and religion mingle in the daily lives of people in a way
                    unlike anywhere else on earth. Its culture overflows from
                    its temples and into the streets, where artisans of every
                    kind continue traditional methods of handicraft that have
                    been passed down for generations. </p>
                <p>This cultural concentration
                    in Bali can be traced back to the 14th century, when Islam
                    expanded in force across the nearby island of Java, pushing
                    the Hindu Majapahit court across the water to Bali and effectively
                    making it an isolated haven for Indonesian Hinduism. The
                    most famous of the many Balinese cultural traditions are
                    its poetic and ornate dances, which employ a graceful and
                    highly-sophisticated gestural language to narrate traditional
                    stories and legends. </p>
                <p>Bali's natural beauty is as
                    startling as its cultural riches. Bali Barat National Park,
                    which dominates the entire west end of the island, is home
                    to one of the world's rarest and most beautiful birds. The
                    beaches of Bali are world famous. Many are ideal for surfing,
                    and plenty of offshore reefs create good scuba diving environments. </p>
                <p><a name="kali"></a> <a
        name="sula"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Sulawesi</b></span></p>
                <p><img src="indo4.jpg" align="left"
        hspace="10" width="200" height="275"> With four huge peninsulas stretching
                    out haphazardly into the South Pacific, Sulawesi's infamous
                      shape has often been compared to that of a spider or an
                      amoeba. The island lies just east of Kalimantan and north
                      of Bali.</p>
                <p>The island is divided into two
                    regions, north and south, with its key city, Unjung Padang,
                    situated on the island's southwestern leg. North Sulawesi
                    and its [link]Bunaken Marine Park[link] is best known as
                    Indonesia's mecca for divers and snorklers, while South Sulawesi
                    harbors two of the country's most interesting cultures. In
                    the far south, in and around Ujang Padang, are the Bugi people,
                    long reknowned for their seafaring skills. Evidence of their
                    influence has been found as far as Australia, where they
                    had contact with the Aborigines. When the Portugeuse, British,
                    Spanish, and Dutch came, the daring Bugis would often attack
                    the huge colonial vessels on the open sea.</p>
                <p><br clear="all">
  South Sulawesi is also home to the Toraja people, who live in a picturesque,
      mountainous region called Tana Toraja, or Toraja Land. At the center of
      Toraja culture is a fascinating and complex belief system surrounding death
      and the afterlife. Death is an elaborate affair, and the prolonged funerals
      are a major interest to visitors, who can attend the ceremonies but should
      show the same respect that they would for their own. The funerals typically
      involve feasting, buffalo sacrifice, dancing and martial arts, culminating
      with a procession that carries the coffin to its final resting place in
      one of the many caves on the surrounding cliffs, which are guarded by rock
      statues.</p>
                <p>The Toraja's are equally famous
                    for their houses, which are called Tongkonan, or Family Houses.
                    The houses are built on stilts, and each end rises like the
                    horns of a buffalo, with the points always facing north and
                    south.</p>

        hspace="8" vspace="8" width="275" height="200"> The central link in the
                    archepelagic chain that begins with Sumatra and ends with
                    the scattering of
                      small islands east of Bali, Java is often referred to as
                      the heart of Indonesia. It is the historical center of
                      Bhuddhist and Hindu culture and home to the nation's sprawling
                      capital city, [link]Jakarta[link]. </p>
                <p>Java's three main regions are
                    simply East, Central, and West Java, and the island's many
                    roads and public transports make it easy to navigate. Though
                    Jakarta is the most visited destination in the west, there
                    are also major natural attractions, such as [link]Mount Gede-Pangrango
                    National Park[link]. In Central Java, the seat of major dynasties
                    throughout Indonesian history, are the cultural wonders of
                    the [link]Prambanan temple complex[link] and the magnificent
                    [link]Borobudur Temple[link]. Central Java is also the home
                    of Indonesia's famous shadow puppet dances, or wayang kulit,
                    and the craftwork center of [link]Yogyakarta[link]Finally,
                    there is East Java, where travellers encounter some of the
                    Indonesia's most extraordinary national parks, including
                    the wildly spectacular [link]Bromo-Tengger[link].</p>
                <p>                  <span class="subheading"><b>Borobudur Temple</b></span></p>
                <p>When scholars and historians
                    speak of the world's great Buddhist temples, no conversation
                    is complete without the word Borobudur. This monumental structure,
                    constructed in 9th century A.D., dominates an entire hill
                    in Central Java, and it is one Bali's national treasures. </p>
                <p>The temple is most famous for
                    its many stone-carved panels depicting the life and teachings
                    of Buddha. The narratives, over a thousand in all, are part
                    of the temple itself, helping to form the terraces that support
                    the temple's chambers. </p>
                <p>Interestingly, Borobudur was
                    lost to the world for many years. The temple was ultimately
                    abandoned with the rise of Islam, and the halls that once
                    echoed with the pilgrim footsteps of scholars, artists, and
                    priests were silently overun by nature. In 1814, the temple
                    was rediscovered, and later it was comepletely restored with
                    the help of the United States.</p>
                <p><a name="kali"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Kalimantan</b></span></p>
                <p>The Indonesian province of Kalimantan
                    occupies the greater part of the exotic island of Borneo,
                    where the world's most dense and remote rainforests can be
                    found. The island is famous for its rich concentration of
                    wildlife, and it is equally notorious for its legendary headhunters.
                    Indonesia's second largest province, Kalimantan has become
                    a source of substantial natural wealth for the country. Its
                    extensive oil reserves are now a key part of Indonesia's
                    economy, and diamonds, rare woods, rattan, and resin are
                    also harvested here. </p>
                <p>There are parts of Kalimantan
                    that to this day remain unexplored. Eighty percent of Central
                    Kalimantan (the largest sub-region) is thick jungle that
                    often clings to treacherous mountain slopes, hiding valleys
                    that remain utterly inaccessible. Although only the most
                    hardcore and experienced adventurers should consider a foray
                    into these regions, Kalimantan has plenty of less formidable
                    forests open to visitors. </p>
                <p>Kalimantan is also home to one
                    of Indonesia's most interesting indigenous cultures--the
                    Dyak. Although they no longer practice headhunting, the Dyak
                    continue to live much as they have for the last millenium,
                    occupying enormous communal longhouses which serve as the
                    residence for large family groups. An ideal way to tour Kalimantan
                    is by riverboat on the Mahakam River, where one can also
                    spot the world's only species of freshwater dolphin. Orang-utan
                    live in the surrounding jungles, and special tours for the
                    purpose of viewing the animals up close are available. </p>
                <p><a name="komodo"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Komodo National Park</b></span></p>
                <p>The main attraction of this
                    park is the legendary Komodo Dragon, a gigantic reptile found
                    nowhere else. The oldest, largest, and one of the rarest
                    reptiles, the Komodo is a gigantic Monitor lizard that grows
                    to lengths of more than three meters. It scavenges and hunts,
                    using its powerful club of a tail to tackle large prey. </p>
                <p>The island of Komodo, along
                    with those surrounding it, is dry and barren, with rainfall
                    occurring only between November and March. It lies about
                    500 km east of Bali, a location that places it between the
                    Asian and Australian bio-geographical zones and makes the
                    island an interesting crossroads for species. Birds from
                    both zones can be found on the island, such as the Noisy
                    Friar Birds of Australia and the Monarch Flycatchers of Asia. </p>
                <p class="subheading"><b>Bromo-Tengger National Park</b></p>
                <p><img src="indo5.jpg" align="right"
        hspace="10" width="275" height="200"> Long before there was a nation
                    called Indonesia, there was Bromo-Tengger. This mystic, volcanic
                      region was set aside by Hindus as a sacred place, and to
                      this day thousands make a yearly pilgrimage to the park
                      to honor Mount Semeru, which they consider to be a god. </p>
                <p>The landscape of Bromo-Tengger
                    is indeed heavenly. The park is situated around a group of
                    forest encrusted volcanoes that rise up thousands of feet
                    like gigantic, terrestrial limpets. At 3,676 meters, Semeru
                    is Java's highest mountain, and it is still active, erupting
                    once every eight minutes. Though Semeru is the highest mountain,
                    no less astounding is Bromo.</p>
                <p>Mount Bromo rests in what is
                    known as the sand sea, a vast, empty expanse of sand 10 kilometers
                    wide that is surrounded by interior slopes of another volcano
                    that became extinct long ago. Bromo is also active, but visitors
                    can trek to the mountain on foot or horseback and climb to
                    the edge of its caldera and experience the spacial wonder
                    of the sand sea below. </p>
                <p>                  <span class="subheading"><b>Bunaken Marine Park</b></span></p>
                <p>The reefs of Bunaken Marine
                    Park have been compared in richness to that of Australia's
                    Great Barrier Reef, which is visible from outer space and
                    is the largest concentration of life on the planet. At Bunaken,
                    nearly 900 square kilometers of prime marine habitat have
                    been set aside solely for the enjoyment of the diver, the
                    snorkeler, and the researcher.</p>
                <p>On a single dive in Bunaken,
                    the visitor is sometimes greeted by a dazzling palette of
                    nearly 50 species of coral. Barrier reefs, mangrove reefs,
                    and wall dives are all found here, and the visibility in
                    Bunaken's gentle currents generally <i>exceeds</i> 10 meters.
                    In addition to coral life, an abundance of fish and mammal
                    species thrive here as well: seahorses, three species of
                    turtle, rays, and sea snails. Also found here are the enormous,
                    bottom-grazing Dugongs, marine mammals that are closely related
                    to the manatee (and distantly related, like the manatee,
                    to elephants). The whale shark, the world's largest (and
                    completely harmless) fish, occasionally makes his royal appearance.
                    The island of Manado Tua provides a particularly vivid dive
                    locale: a crater lake within an extinct volcano. </p>
                <p><a name="bali"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Bali Barat National Park</b></span></p>
                <p>Occupying much of the western
                    extremity of Bali, the Bali Barat National Park is one of
                    Indonesia's best bird watching locales. The park's rarest
                    bird is the gorgeous Bali Starling, with its brilliant silver-white
                    feathers and striking lapis eye markings. A victim of rampant
                    poaching since the turn of the century, the starling now
                    clings to the threads of existence in the wild. In 1989,
                    about 30 individuals were tallied in the park, compared to
                    over 700 in captivity across the globe. </p>
                <p>Despite the starling's rarity,
                    the Bali Barat is rich in over 160 other species. Yellow-vented
                    Bulbul's are everywhere, as well as White-bellied Swiftlets,
                    Sacred and Javan Kingfishers, and Drongos. On the north coast
                    is a colony of Silvered Leaf Monkeys, and Pulua Menjangan,
                    or Deer Island, offers a rich variety of marine life for
                    snorkelers and divers. Dolphin watching is also a highlight
                    of Bali, as large, playful schools thrive off the north coast.</p>
                <p>There are a number of good guided
                    treks through Bali Barat's jungles, though because of the
                    starling's fragile existence no trekking is permitted on
                    the Prapat peninsula and Menjangan island. </p>
                <p><a name="mount"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Mount Leuser National Park</b></span></p>
                <p>Mount Leuser National Park is
                    most distinguished as the home of the Orang-utan, a highly
                    endangered and extremely intelligent primate. The park has
                    two distinct Orang-utan reserves within its boundaries, Bohorok
                    and Ketambe, both of which serve to rehabilitate animals
                    back into the wild after they have lived in captivity. </p>
                <p>Orang-utans are not the
                      only interesting mammals to grace Mount Leuser National
                      Park. Its whopping 10,000 square kilometers also provide
                      protected habitat for the Sumatran Rhino, along with elephant
                      and tiger. Overall, one can see 320 species of bird, 176
                      kinds of mammals, 194 reptile species, and 52 species of
                      amphibian. Plant life is even more diverse: over one half
                      all plant species on Sumatra can be found in the forests
                      of Mount Leuser.</p>
                <p><a name="toba"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Berbak Wildlife Reserve</b></span></p>
                <p>Dominating one-fifth of Sumatra's
                    east coast is the Berbak Wildlife Reserve, a dense, swampy
                    refuge on the edge of the Melaka strait. The reserve contains
                    Indonesia's largest peat forest, a unique environment caused
                    by an excess accumulation of organic matter on the forest
                    floor. Due to acidic soil, trees here rarely grow past 40
                    meters, allowing a substantial amount of light to pierce
                    the canopy. </p>
                <p>When heavy rains flood vast
                    areas of Berbak, its animals will often concentrate at higher
                    elevations, often in inaccessible areas. The best time to
                    come, therefore, is during the dry season from June to October.
                    The reserve's most famous and common resident is the tiger,
                    whose deep, thick roars are often heard in the distance.
                    There are also a good amount of birds here ---over 240 species,
                    as well as crocodile's and turtles. </p>
                <p><a name="jak"></a> <span class="subheading"><b>Jakarta</b></span></p>
                <p>Huge, international, and a cultural
                    hub, Jakarta has long been a meeting place of cultures. At
                    various times throughout history, it has been ruled by Hindus,
                    Muslims, Portugeuse, Dutch and Japanese. It is the gateway
                    to Indonesia and holds the special status of a provice, similar
                    to Mexico City or Washington, D.C. </p>
                <p>So many cultures have passed
                    through Jakarta, that it is no surprise that some of them
                    would leave a few things behind, especially the Dutch. Consequently,
                    no place in the world has a finer collection of old sailing
                    ships. The ships can be found in an area known as Sunda Kelapa,
                    the old Dutch port. In addition to a variety of well-preserved
                    colonial vessels, there are also splendid examples of native
                    Buginese ships. </p>
                <p class="subheading"><b>Lake Toba</b></p>
                <p>Lake Toba is the largest crater
                    lake in the world. Its surface area measures 1707 square
                    kilometers, so large that the island sitting in its center,
                    Samosir, has numerous towns and villages and even a lake
                    of its own. Surrounding the lake, which sits at an altitude
                    of 800 meters, is a ethereal ring of bright, rust-colored
                    mountains. </p>
                <p>The central island of Samosir
                    is home to the Batak people, a unique society known for its
                    graceful hospitality. The Batak love music, especially love
                    songs, and singing plays an unusually large role in the culture.
                    The island offers many fine walking trails and three peaks
                    of over 1000 meters that look out over the emerald waters
                    of Lake Toba.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: What kind of 
genealogy information is included in the biographies?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: The biographies were usually 
written while the subject was still living and will frequently include date and 
place of birth, name of father and mother (often including her maiden name), 
name of spouse (in some cases, successive spouses after the death of a spouse), 
name of children (in some cases including the names of their spouses if they 
were married), occupation, military service (a high percentage of the 
biographies are of Civil War soldiers and often include military unit and 
battles involved in.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Other information that is sometimes included 
are organization memberships, church membership, and political party affiliated 
with.&nbsp; Below is an example of a biography from the 1888 Goodspeed's <a href="Newton County.htm">History of Newton County, Missouri</a> (note: some 
biographies are considerably longer and more detailed than this example):</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: 15; margin-left: 15; margin-right: 15">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>William H. Wheeler,</b> farmer and 
stock dealer, and the son of Sanders and Mahalath (Holcomb) Wheeler, was born in 
McDonald County, Mo., December 19, 1846. The father, who was a merchant and sold 
goods at Enterprise, was born in Virginia, and died in 1856, while on his way to 
California; the mother, who is now a resident of McDonald County, was born in 
Jackson, Mo. William H. was reared in his native county, and received a fair 
education in the common schools. He then engaged in tilling the soil. During the 
last two years of the struggle between the North and South he was in the 
Confederate service, and after that he moved to Newtonia Township, where he has 
since remained. He married Elizabeth Annette Huffman, daughter of James Huffman, 
whose sketch appears elsewhere. To Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler were born the following 
named children: James Sanders, Eleanor, Edward H., William Morrow, Mary Jane, 
Oliver Price, Henry Lee, Minnie Huldah, David Cleveland, Weems and John. Mr. 
Wheeler has a small but good farm of forty acres, and, in connection with 
farming and stock raising, has raised some nursery stock. He is a member of the 
Farmers' Alliance, and has been a member of the school board of his district for 
the third term.</span></p>

here: <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mygenealogyhound.com/index.html">My 
Genealogy Hound</a></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Do the books on 
the CDs include Civil War history?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Yes, they do.&nbsp; The amount of 
information included will vary widely depending on the Civil War military 
history that occurred within a particular county.&nbsp; Some include very detail 
accounts of military campaigns, others will include very lengthy lists of 
soldiers (both Union and Confederate) from the county.&nbsp; Since the books 
were usually written within 20 to 30 years after the end of the Civil War, a 
very large number of the biographies are of former Civil War soldiers.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Will the CDs/DVDs 
work on a MAC computer?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: The files on our CDs/DVDs are in 
pdf format which is fully cross platform compatible.&nbsp; We do NOT however 
recommend them for MAC computers that have a slot loading CD/DVD drive.&nbsp; 
The best solution is to purchase the download version which eliminates the need 
for the CD and any issue with the CD/DVD drive.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: What is an Ebook?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: An Ebook (means electronic book) 
is simply a book that has been scanned and placed on a CD so that you can view 
and read the pages on your computer screen. The pages on your computer will look 
just like the original book pages. The books are on a CD which makes it easy and 
convenient to safely transport and store plus it is much less expensive than 
buying the actual printed book. Some of the original books can cost $350 or more 
(if you are lucky enough to find) while the CD can be purchased for only $9.95 
(or less, depending on the county) and usually includes maps and other materials 
that were not included in the original books.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Are the CDs 
available as downloads over the internet?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Yes, most of our the CDs/DVDs that we 
offer are available as downloads over the internet.&nbsp; Since many of our 
products are rather large files, you will need a high speed internet connection.&nbsp; 
For further details: <a target="_blank" href="internet-download-service.htm">
High Speed Downloads</a></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Can the pages be 
printed out on my desktop printer?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Yes, you may print out any or all 
pages without restriction.&nbsp; You will find that you are able to print out 
centered, nice looking pages when compared to the difficulty in trying to copy 
from a regular book on a copier at a library.&nbsp; Many libraries do not allow 
copies to be made from the books.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Is any special 
software required?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: The files require Adobe Acrobat 
Reader, version 5 or newer.&nbsp; This is a free program which is probably 
already installed on your computer.&nbsp; A full copy of version 6 is on each of 
CDs and should be installed on you computer if you do not have the program or if 
you have an older version. </font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: When Ebook 1, 
Ebook 2, Ebook 3, etc. is listed, do I order each separately?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: No, all of the Ebooks listed for 
any particular county are included on one CD for one price.&nbsp; For example, 
the Jasper County, Missouri CD has 5 separate Ebooks, all on one CD for a total 
of $9.95.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Do the books have 
an index? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Most of the books were originally 
published without an index.&nbsp; Many of the books have the biographies in 
alphabetical order.&nbsp; For the books that have the biographies in another 
order (such as by township), we have constructed an index to the primary 
biography subjects.&nbsp; All of the history books have a table of contents and 
a series of bookmarks to the major sections of the book.&nbsp; These are 
designed so that by clicking on the page number in the table of contents or by 
clicking on a bookmark will take you instantly to that page.&nbsp; All of the 
books are searchable so it is fast and easy to locate any name or location that 
is included. </font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: How can I tell if 
a CD listed is in stock?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: All of the CDs / DVD's listed  are always in stock and available 
for immediate shipment.&nbsp; This is also true for the Southeast Missouri, 
Ozark Region, and Median Iris titles.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Why does it take 
so long for a book to be scanned and placed on CD?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Actually, it is possible to 
quickly scan a book and place on CD in only a few days.&nbsp; The result of such 
quick scanning is that it can result in an inferior product.&nbsp; Our process 
takes longer due to the additional steps that we take.&nbsp; After scanning all 
of the pages, we individually straighten, crop, and clean each of the pages.&nbsp; 
Pages that were substantially darker or lighter than normal are optimized for 
the best quality possible.&nbsp; The result is a book that looks as near as 
possible to the original printing.&nbsp; We then add such features as a table of 
contents, bookmarks and in some cases, an index to the biographies.&nbsp; While 
these steps take considerable time, the result is a far superior product to book 
that has been merely quick scanned.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Q: Will County 
History CD's be available for other states?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Yes, they will.&nbsp; All 
counties in Missouri and Arkansas are now available. We are currently working on 
the states of: Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,  Texas,  Ohio, 
and Pennsylvania. We will also offer CD's for 
additional states in the future.&nbsp; </font>

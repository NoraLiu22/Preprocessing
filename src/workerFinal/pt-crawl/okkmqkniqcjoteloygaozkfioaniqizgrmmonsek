The data is presented as follows: at the center of the infographic is a circle with the European continent inside, and member states highlighted in blue. Arranged in a larger circle around the outside of the circular map are 30 evenly spaced points, each labelled with a unique country name and a corresponding percent. The location of these points relative to the central circle is correlated with their values, with lower numbers plotted closer to the and higher numbers plotted further away.

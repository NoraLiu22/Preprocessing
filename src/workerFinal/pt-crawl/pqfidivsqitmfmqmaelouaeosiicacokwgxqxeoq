            Eratosthenes of Cyrene
        </H1>
        <P>
            A versatile scholar, Eratosthenes of Cyrene lived
            approximately 275-195 BC.  He was the first to estimate
            accurately the diameter of the earth.  For several decades,
            he served as the director of the famous
            <A HREF="http://zoro.cis.temple.edu/~chs/paideia/alexandreia.html">
                library in Alexandria.
            </A>
            He was highly regarded in the ancient world, but
            unfortunately only fragments of his writing have survived.
            Eratosthenes died at an advanced age from voluntary
            starvation, induced by despair at his blindness.

            The Sieve of Eratosthenes

        <P>
            Eratosthenes also conceived the &quot;Sieve of Eratosthenes

                            the second run we mark all multiples of 3

                This is exactly what the applet does.  If the natural
                numbers are arranged in a rectangular array than marking
                the composites gives rise to interesting patterns.  The
                Figure nearby shows one of these patterns (the prime
                numbers from 2 through 12,743), but seeing the pattern
                develop is much more interesting than seeing the static
                final result.  Experiment with various options yourself!

                To see how it works, do the following:
            </P>
            <UL>
                <LI>
                    Click on the applet.  Two windows, called &quot;
                    Sieve of Eratosthenes Controls&quot; and &quot;The
                    Sieve of Eratosthenes&quot; will pop up on your
                    screen.  They should look like the images nearby on
                    this page and fit on your screen.  Arrange them
                    conveniently so that you can see both windows
                    without obstruction.  Let's call them <EM>the
                    control panel</EM> and the <EM> drawing window</EM>.
                    The boxes in the drawing window should form a 10 by
                    10 array representing the numbers 0 through 99
                    arranged as we read (i.e., from the top left corner
                    to the bottom right corner).  Check you
                    understanding by clicking on some of the black boxes
                    and seeing the corresponding numbers show up in the
                    textfield labeled <EM>pick:</EM> in the 3rd row of
                    the control panel.  The blue box corresponds to 1,
                    which as we saw is different from all other numbers.
                    The number zero is not shown since it isn't a
                    natural number.
                </li>

                <LI>
                    Move the cursor into the drawing window and hit the
                    key &quot;s&quot; (for &quot;step&quot;).  The
                    square corresponding to the number 4 is colored
                    white.  That means it is not a prime number (since
                    it is a multiple of 2).  Hit &quot;s&quot; again.
                    The number six square is colored white.  Do this a
                    few times until you see what's happening.
                </li>
                <LI>
                    Hit the key &quot;p&quot; (for &quot;prime&quot;).
                    The multiples of 2 will be finished off.
                </li>
                <LI>
                    Hit &quot;s&quot; again (or &quot;p&quot;) to see
                    what happens to the multiples of 3.
                </li>
                <LI>
                    Hit &quot;a&quot; (for &quot;all&quot;) to see the
                    rest of the process.  The prime numbers from 2 to
                    100 are now marked with black boxes.  Click on some
                    of them to see that they do indeed correspond to the
                    prime numbers.
                </li>
                <LI>
                    In the second row of the control panel, change the
                    number in the textfield labeled &quot;size&quot; to
                    2. (To do this, highlight the 20 that's in the
                    field, type 2, and hit return.) Then click on &quot;
                    do it all&quot; in the first row of the control
                    panel.  You'll see patterns emerge as the Sieve of
                    Eratosthenes proceeds, and the final picture (if you
                    didn't resize the drawing window) should look like
                    the pattern in the image above..
                </li>
                <LI>
                    If the process is too slow for your taste, do this:
                    <OL>
                        <LI>
                            Click on &quot;reset&quot; in the control
                            panel.
                        </li>
                        <LI>
                            Change &quot;Delay&quot; in the second row
                            of the control panel to 0.
                        </li>
                        <LI>
                            Click on &quot;Do it all&quot;.
                        </li>
                        <LI>
                            If this is still not fast enough, select
                            &quot; Fast&quot; in the upper right corner
                            of the control panel, click on &quot;reset
                            &quot;, and click on &quot;do it all&quot;
                            again.  Now the sieve will run as fast as it
                            can on your machine.

                    not trying to spy on you, but I am curious how much
                    the program is used, and I'm also fascinated by the
                    technology.  The count is obtained by sending an
                    inquiry to my system which returns the current
                    count.  This ability to communicate over the net
                    opens a lot possibilities which are as yet not even
                    recognized.  If my server daemon is down the program
                    runs fine without indicating a count.

                    Some actions during the drawing process cause the
                    computation to go faster, but at the expense of
                    resisting interruption, and omitting to repaint the
                    drawing window after covering or closing it.  These
                    actions include resizing the drawing window or and
                    clicking somewhere in the drawing window.  Until
                    this bug is fixed, perhaps you can look at it as a
                    feature!

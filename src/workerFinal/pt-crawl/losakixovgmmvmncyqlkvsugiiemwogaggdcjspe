Seti I's reign is today considered to be 11 years and not 15 years by both J. von Beckerath and Peter Brand, who wrote a biography on this pharaoh's reign. Consequently, it will be amended to 11 years or 1290-1279 BC. Therefore, Seti's father and predecessor would have ruled Egypt between 1292-1290 BC. Many of the pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes (designated KV).

Ceremonial burials of bulls indicate that ritual sacrifice was part of the worship of the early cow deities, Hathor and Bat, and a bull might represent her offspring, a king who became a deity after death.  He was entitled 'the renewal of the life' of the Memphite deity Ptah: but after death he became Osorapis, i.e. the Osiris Apis, just as dead humans were assimilated to Osiris, the ruler of the underworld.<br /><br />  Apis was the most popular of three great bull cults of ancient Egypt, the others being the cults of Mnevis and Buchis. All are related to the worship of Hathor or Bat, similar primary goddesses separated by region until unification that eventually merged as Hathor.

Their purpose was to repel the forces of evil which might threaten the deceased. This example, inscribed for a man named Djehutymose, was to be located on the east side of the chamber. <br /><br /> Four mud-bricks inscribed with spells from Chapter 151 of the Book of the Dead are often found in the burial chambers of royal and elite tombs dating from the New Kingdom. These bricks can be shown to represent the four bricks that supported women during childbirth. The use of bricks in a mortuary context is thus metaphorical, replicating the equipment of an earthly birth in order to ensure the deceased's rebirth into the other world. Such bricks may also have been used in the 'Opening of the Mouth' ritual, both at funerals and in temple foundation ceremonies. In connection with their role at birth, bricks also appear at the judgment a person faced after death. Like other artefacts surrounding birth in Egypt, bricks of birth had parallels in ancient Mesopotamia.<br /><br />During the New Kingdom, four magical bricks were often placed in niches in the burial chambers of royal tombs, and in some private tombs and burials of the Apis bull as well. The bricks and their associated figures were preserved in the tomb of Tutankhamun. <br /><br />Each of these four bricks was associated with one of four amuletic figures: a recumbent jackal on a shrine, a mummiform image, a reed that represented a flame, and a djed pillar. Usually the bricks bore the text of a spell from Chapter 151 of the Book of the Dead. <br /><br />Catalog:  Tomb of Djehutymose (Thebes) (?),  EA65845<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: &copy;  Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/ ,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br />Additional text:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Roth and Roehrig (2002)</span></a></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images41/IMG_8794seth.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/IMG_8794sethsm.jpg" alt = " IMG_8794sethsm" width="318" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br /> Seth</b><br /><br />  The god Seth shown with the head of an animal, arms dangling, with a shining crown, necklace, tripartite wig, loincloth, holding an ankh sign.

Information about his life was found on the back of this block statue. The information on the statue provides details about the education of young Egyptian noblemen at that time and the career of priests.<br /><br />According to the information inscribed on his statue, Bakenkhonsu was the son of Ipui, a priest of Amun (other sources suggest that he was the son of Roma, whose wife was also called Roma). His two younger brothers were Roma-Roi and Ipui. He spent four years at school, starting at the age of four, as was customary at that time. He then worked at the stables of Pharaoh Seti I for eleven years. There he learned to shoot with a bow and to drive a chariot. It is possible that he also served in the Pharaoh's army.<br /><br />Bakenkhonsu's career as a priest then began when he joined Amun's priesthood in Thebes where his father already served as a priest (Ipui later became Second Prophet of Amun). Bakenkhonsu served as a wab priest (lowest priestly rank) for four years. He was then promoted to the rank of prophet and, twelve years later, he was the Third Prophet of Amun, the third highest ranking priest in the most powerful priesthood of the era. Later he was promoted to second, then to first prophet or high priest, a position he held for twenty-seven years. He died in the last regnal year of Ramesses II, at the age of ninety, and was succeeded as High Priest by his brother Roma-Roi.<br /><br />Bakenkhonsu was responsible for several building projects for the Pharaoh , including the eastern temple in the Karnak Temple complex.<br /><br />Bakenkhonsu was married to Meretseger, who held the titles of Chief of the Harem of Amun.  Two of their sons, Paser and Amenmesse became governors of Thebes. Their daughter, Nefertari married Tjanefer, the Third Prophet of Amun and three of her sons and a grandson became high ranking priests (fourth, third, or second prophets of Amun). The family is related to another important family of priests which included Ramessesnakht, who was High Priest of Amun during the 20th dynasty, as Nefertari's son Amenemopet married Ramessesnakht's daughter Tamerit/Aatmerit.<br /><br /> Bakenkhonsu was buried in TT35 in Thebes. In the hallway there are several depictions of Bakenkhonsu and his wife Meretseger. A niche contains seated statues of Bakenkhonsu and his wife. The tomb also had a pyramid associated with it.<br /><br />  Catalog: Limestone, Thebes, Karnak, Gl.

She was also shown suckling the pharaoh through the New Kingdom and became a goddess of lust in later years, and  was associated with the cowrie shell, which resembled the vagina.<br /><br />Ceremonially, when the Nile started its annual flood, the Festival of Anuket began. People threw coins, gold, jewelry, and precious gifts into the river, in thanks to the goddess for the life-giving water and returning benefits derived from the wealth provided by her fertility. The taboo held in several parts of Egypt, against eating certain fish which were considered sacred, was lifted during this time, suggesting that a fish species of the Nile was a totem for Anuket and that they were consumed as part of the ritual of her major religious festival<br /><br />Height   275 mm, width 135 mm, depth 126 mm. <br /> <br />Catalog: Painted tamarisk wood, Deir el-Medina, West Thebes,  Aile Sully, salle 336, Le Nil,  Vitrine 7, N&nbsp;3534,  Salt&nbsp;n°559<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source and text: Original,  Louvre Museum, Paris, France, https://collections.louvre.fr/<br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><p><a href="images44/DSC06393pa_sh.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/DSC06393pa_shsm.jpg" alt = "DSC06393pa_shsm" width="572" height="1200"  hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Pa-sh</b> <br /> <br />  Limestone <!--Würtel -->statue of Pa-sh (i.e. 'He from the Lake')<br /> <br /> New empire, around 1200 BC.<br /> <br /><!-- Egyptologists call circular images of Hokkenden cube statues, whose bodies are wrapped in a long cube-shaped robe. -->The 'Royal Scribe and General' Pa-sh crouches behind a shrine with a statuette of Osiris.<br /> <br />Inv.

They were called benbenet in the Ancient Egyptian language, which associated the pyramid as a whole with the sacred benben stone. During Egypt's Old Kingdom, pyramidia were generally made of diorite, granite, or fine limestone, which were then covered in gold or electrum; during the Middle Kingdom and through the end of the pyramid-building era, they were built from granite. A pyramidion was covered in gold leaf to reflect the rays of the sun; during Egypt's Middle Kingdom, they were often  inscribed with royal titles and religious symbols. </p><br clear = "all"><p>Very few pyramidia have survived into modern times. Most of those that have are made of polished black granite, inscribed with the name of the pyramid's owner. Four pyramidia – the world's largest collection – are housed in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Among them are the pyramidia from the so-called Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III at Dahshur and of the Pyramid of Khendjer at Saqqara.<br /><br />The 19th dynasty (circa Seti I) royal writer Pauty is presumably buried in the Saqqara necropolis as the superstructure of the newlyweds graves there usually contains a small pyramid located at the back of the middle chapel. This clay pyramid is finished with a limestone pyramidion, like the great stone pyramids of the Old Kingdom era of Egypt. <br /><br />This aspect of the Old Kingdom solar cult was continued in the New Empire, where pyramids have also occurred in a non-royal context ever since. The inscriptions on this copy clarify the association with the solar cult. On the eastern side, Pauty glorifies the rising sun Re-Harakhte, and on the west side, the god Atum, the setting sun on  the western horizon. His wife Lyemoenoe is also mentioned. On the north and south side, sacrifices are dedicated to Osiris and Anubis.  <br /> <br />Catalog: limestone, Saqqara, circa 1&nbsp;275 BC, AM 7-c   <br /><!-- http://www.rmo.nl/collectie/zoeken?object=AM+7-c -->Photo: Rob Koopman, Wikimedia commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.	<br />Source and text: Original,  Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, National Museum of Antiquities, Leiden, http://www.rmo.nl/<br />Additional text: Wikipedia </p><br clear = "all"> <p><a href="images40/img_9937mutnedjmetcanopicjar.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/img_9937mutnedjmetcanopicjarsm.jpg" alt = "img_9937mutnedjmetcanopicjarsm" width="263" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br /> Queen Mutnodjmet</b><br /><br />Calcite canopic jar of Queen Mutnodjmet.

Pre-telescopic eclipse records are of considerablechronological interest; the total solar eclipse of 15 June 763 BC, for example, was recorded in Assyrian records (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Rawlinson (1867)</span></a> in <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Humphreys and Waddington (2017)</span></a>) and is now used as a key fixed point to date Assyrian kings objectively over most of the surrounding three centuries.<br /><br /> Recently a report by <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Humphreys and Waddington (2017)</span></a> has allowed the precise dating of Ramesses II, also known  as Ozymandias, and as Ramesses the Great.<br /><br /> The researchers write:<blockquote><i><a href="images36/eclipsepath.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/eclipsepathsm.jpg" alt = "eclipsepathsm" width="473" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />A puzzling event in The Bible that mentions both the Moon and the Sun can be interpreted as describing a solar eclipse. We have dated it to <b>30 October 1207 BC</b>, making it possibly the oldest datable solar eclipse recorded. The Merneptah Stele  mentions a campaign in Canaan in which Merneptah defeated the people of Israel.<br /><br />This enables us to refine the dates of certain Egyptian pharaohs, including Ramesses the Great. It also suggests that the expressions currently used for calculating changes in the Earth's rate of rotation can be reliably extended back 500 years, from 700 BC to 1200 BC.<br /><br />The map shows the path of the annular solar eclipse of 30 October 1207 BC, which passed directly over the land of Canaan in the afternoon. The shadow leaves the Earth's surface at sunset over modern day Iraq.<br /><br />The map is centred on Azekah, which is marked with a circle.<br /><br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> The dates agreed by mainstream Egyptologists for the reign of Ramesses II are c. 1279–1213 BC, with his son Merneptah reigning from circa 1213–1203 BC (Shaw 2003, Horning et al. 2006, Kitchen 2013). These dates are subject to some uncertainty, with the latest possible dates for Ramesses II being 1270–1204 BC, and for Merneptah 1204–1194 BC (Kitchen 2013). The fifth year of Merneptah was therefore probably circa 1209/08 BC, with the latest possible date being 1200/1199 BC.<br /><br />Thus Ramesses II reigned from 1276-1210 BC, with a precision of plus or minus one year, the most accurate dates available. <br /><br />The standard Egyptian chronology gives the dates of Merneptah as 1213 – 1203 BC, with the latest possible dates being 1204 – 1194 BC. If the confrontation with Israel was in year 4 of the reign of Merneptah, then his reign would have started in 1211/1210 BC, if in year 3, 1210/1209 BC, and if in year 2, 1209/1208 BC. <br /><br />Hence we can pinpoint the first year of Merneptah as 1210/1209±1 year. As the length of his reign is known from Egyptian texts, his reign would have lasted between 1210 BC and 1200 BC (with ±1 year in each case). The dates of the previous and subsequent pharaohs can be similarly adjusted; for example, the reign-dates of Ramesses II (Ramesses the Great) would be 1276–1210 BC ±1 year.</i></blockquote><br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><br /><br /><p><a href="images35/dsc00542ramessesii.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/dsc00542ramessesiism.jpg" alt = " Ramesses II " width="356" height="700" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramesses II</b><br /><br />Statue of Ramesses II<br /><br />Temple of Khnum, Elephantine, Egypt, Granite<br /><br />Dynastic rule began in Egypt in around 3&nbsp;000&nbsp;BC.

A decorated fillet, tied in the back, encircles the wig and ends with two streamers falling on the sides, each supporting a uraeus crowned by the sun disk. A ceremonial beard is attached under the royal chin. A broad collar, fringed by a row of drop-like pearls, surrounds his neck, and a bracelet adorns each of his wrists, the one on the right decorated with an incised 'wedjat' eye, symbol of soundness. <br /><br />The visage is almost round, with full cheeks. Under the wide forehead, the eyebrows, depicted in raised relief, form two symmetrical arches on the protruding brow-bone. A faint depression separates them from the heavy upper eyelids. The eyes, placed horizontally and framed by cosmetic bands, gaze slightly downward. The narrow root of the nose expands gently toward the base, which is broken. The mouth, slightly slanting, is articulated by well-defined edges. Two little hollows mark the corners of the lips. The rounded chin overlaps the top of the tapering beard. The neck is broad, the chest schematic, with large shoulders. On the arms of the sovereign are engraved his birth and throne names. <br /><br />Catalog: EA67, 1840, 1114.3, Elephantine, Temple of Khnum <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2017<br />Text: Card,   http://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 <br />Source: Exhibition by the British Museum at the National Museum of Australia, Canberra</p><br clear ="all"><p><a href="images35/dsc00577ramessesside.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/dsc00577ramessessidesm.jpg" alt = " Ramesses II " width="259" height="700" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images35/dsc00551rightside.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/dsc00551rightsidesm.jpg" alt = " Ramesses II " width="282" height="700" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramses II</b><br /><br />The statue of Ramesses II has two cartouches on the shoulders.<br />On the left shoulder: '<i>Ramesses-meryamun</i> - 'Ra is his creator, beloved of Amuni'.<br />On the right shoulder: '<i>Usermaatra-setepenra</i>'  -  'Strong in Right is Ra, Chosen by Ra'.<br /><br />The cartouches are surmounted by a double plume flanking a disk, and placed on the hieroglyphic sign for gold.

Roughly shaped and weighing some 20 tonnes, it was transported on sleds over land and on a purpose-built boat down the river Nile. Once erected, the finer sculpting was completed. Like all Egyptian statues, this was originally painted. Traces of pigment remain: black for the eye pupils, red for the skin, and blue and yellow for the stripes on the headcloth. <br /><br /> Ramesses II erected more colossal statues than any other pharaoh. Those at the Ramesseum are among the finest, showing the technical skills of the sculptors. Ramesses encouraged popular cults in which he was deified. Many of his colossi had their own name and were a focus for prayers.  <br /><br />  This statue was saved from almost certain destruction by the Italian explorer, engineer, and amateur archaeologist Giovanni Belzoni, 1778 - 1823.   <br /><br /> In early 1810,  Belzoni    learned from orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt about the Abu Simbel temple in Nubia and the statue of Ramses II, (above) known as the 'Young Memnon' in Luxor. Belzoni first went to Luxor, and with help from the British Consul in Egypt, Henry Salt, unearthed and removed with great skill the colossal bust of the 'Young Memnon' and shipped it to England. This was by no means an easy job, as the statue measured 9 feet high and Belzoni was equipped only with wooden poles and locally-made ropes. Belzoni somehow managed to transport the statue to the Nile River, where an England bound boat was waiting. Many agree that Belzoni probably saved the statue from a certain destruction, since the French had their eye on the statue for some time and had drilled the hole in it (in the right shoulder, as seen above) to remove it with dynamite.  <br /><br />   Catalog: Red granite,  EA1123<br />Photo (left, centre):  Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Photo (right): excellent digital reconstruction using the top part from the British Museum, and the bottom part in situ at the Ramesseum,   by Guy de la Bedoyere.<br />Permission:  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license.<br />Attribution: Bedoyere at English Wikipedia<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, https://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br />Additional text: https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />    <p><a href="images41/ramesseum.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/ramesseumsm.jpg" alt = "ramesseumsm" width="900" height="540" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramses II / Ramesses II</b><br /><br /> The Ramesseum is the memorial temple (or mortuary temple) of Pharaoh Ramesses II (Ramesses the Great, also spelled Ramses and Rameses). It is located in the Theban Necropolis in Upper Egypt, on the west of the River Nile, across from the modern city of Luxor.<br /><br />  The name – or at least its French form Rhamesséion – was coined by Jean-François Champollion, who visited the ruins of the site in 1829 and first identified the hieroglyphs making up Ramesses's names and titles on the walls. It was originally called the House of millions of years of Usermaatra-setepenra that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amon. Usermaatra-setepenra was the prenomen of Ramesses II. <br /><br /> The lower half of the statue of Ramses II shown above may be seen in this photo on the left of this image.

He made what he called 'sensitive paper' for 'photogenic drawing' by wetting a sheet of writing paper with a weak solution of ordinary table salt (sodium chloride), blotting and drying it, then brushing one side with a strong solution of silver nitrate. This produced a tenacious coating of silver chloride in an especially light-sensitive chemical condition. The paper darkened where it was exposed to light. When the darkening was judged to be sufficient, the exposure was ended and the result was stabilized by applying a strong solution of salt, which altered the chemical balance and made the paper only slightly sensitive to additional exposure. In 1839, washing with a solution of sodium thiosulfate ('hypo') was found to be the most effective way to make the results truly light-fast.</blockquote>Text above: Wikipedia<br /><br />  <p><a href="images41/ramsesiichetadefeat2g.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/ramsesiichetadefeat2gsm.jpg" alt = "ramsesiichetadefeat2gsm" width="900" height="408" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramesses II</b><br /><br />Ramesses II storming the Hittite fortress of Dapur.<br /><br />Ramesses extended his military successes in his eighth and ninth years.

He laid siege to the city before capturing it. <br /><br />Painting:  Unknown<br />Source:	German lithography published in 1879<br />Permission: Public Domain<br />Text: Wikipedia </p><br clear ="all"><br />    <p><a href="images40/DSC00894ramessesshabti.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00894ramessesshabtism.jpg" alt = "DSC00894ramessesshabtism" width="185" height="700" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images40/DSC00895shabtiramessesii.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00895shabtiramessesiism.jpg" alt = "DSC00895shabtiramessesiism" width="192" height="700" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramesses II shabti</b><br /><br />Wooden shabti of Ramesses II, remodelled as an Osirian statue. <br /><br />Reign of Ramesses II, circa 1279 - 1213 BC, remodelled in the 21st Dynasty, circa 1&nbsp;070&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;945&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Wooden shabti of Ramses II, reused as an Osiris-figure in the 21st Dynasty.

They were probably erected in the niches of the pyramidial graves of  private tombs. <br /><br />Setau was the Viceroy of Kush in the second half of Ramesses II's reign. Contemporary records show that Setau served in this position from Year 38 until at least Year 63 of Ramesses II's reign.<br /><br />Setau was '&#8239;a graduate of the royal school&#8239;' and already enjoyed an impressive record of royal service which is detailed in a long autobiographical inscription carved at Wadi es-Sebua. The temple of Wadi es-Sebua was built for Ramesses II by Setau around 1236 BC or Year 44 of this pharaoh's reign.  Eleven of his stela, now in the Cairo Museum, were found in the courtyard of this temple and make it possible to establish his career and understand the precise duties of a viceroy. Setau states:'&#8239;I was one whom his Lord caused to instructed....as a ward of the palace. I grew up in the royal abode when I was a youth...I was provided for with bread and beer from all the royal meals. I came forth as a scribe from the school, I was appointed to be Chief Scribe of the Vizier; I assessed the whole land with a scroll. I was equal to the task.&#8239;'Setau was determined to set out his mark in Nubia and records that he:'&#8239;directed serfs in their thousands and ten-thousands, and Nubians in hundred-thousands, without limit. I brought all the dues of the land of Kush in double measure. I caused the people to come in submission. Then I was commissioned to build the temple of Ramesses II in the Domain of Amun (&#8239;ie. Wadi es-Sebua)&#8239;'Apart from the temple of Wadi es-Sebua, Setau also erected another temple at Gerf Hussein on the West Bank of the Nile around Year 45 of Ramesses II. Setau's tomb (TT289) is located in the Dra' Abu el-Naga' area of the Theban Necropolis.<br /><br />Catalog:  Limestone, ÄM  2287 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, <!--  http://www.smb-digital.de/ --> (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br />Additional text:  http://www.aegyptologie.com/<!-- forum/cgi-bin/YaBB/YaBB.pl?action=lexikond&id=050421083518 --><br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear = "all"> <p><a href="images36/img_2404figurine.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/img_2404figurinesm.jpg" alt = "Figurine" width="240" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Young woman</b><br /><br />Standing  figure of   a young woman. <br /><br />Catalog:  Wood, Thebes   ÄM  8041 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,   <!-- http://www.smb-digital.de/ --> (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images39/dsc07216relieffivekings.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc07216relieffivekingssm.jpg" alt = "dsc07216relieffivekingssm" width="708" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Five Kings</b><br /><br />Relief fragment showing five enthroned kings of the Old Kingdom. <br /><br /></p><br clear = "all"><p>The reconstruction of the ancient Egyptian chronology is mainly based on rare kinglists mostly found in temples.

Ptahmai was an officer under Ramses II and was given the office of chief priest at the Ptah temple because of his age. To his left is his wife Hatshepsut, a 'singer of Amun', while on the right is his eldest daughter, a 'harem lady of Pharaoh'. <br /><br />There is also a son between the couple, who is called the 'servant of Pharaoh', and another daughter to the right of the father. She too was a 'singer of Amun' and holds a sistrum in her right hand as a sign of it. She is also the founder of the 'family group'.<br /><br /> Ptahmai is bald,  since he is a priest. He wears a pleated apron that extends from the hip to the calf. A sash runs over his left shoulder. He was twice awarded the 'Gold of Bravery' (chains of golden disc beads) by his king. The fat pads below the chest are a status symbol for its high rank. <br /><br />  Only the man's feet are in sandals, all other people are barefoot. The three women are dressed in ankle-length pleated robes and shoulder collars. Voluminous, multi-part wigs frame the faces. Unfortunately, only a little can be seen of the figure of the son. During the 3rd Dynasty and then again in the New Kingdom, it was customary to have the depicted sit on stools, and in the New Kingdom on armchairs with backrests, the structural details of which appear to be sculpted or at least painted on.<br /><br />The group figure of the Ptahmai has, as is usual for such sculptures, a high  backrest, but on both sides of the women at least on the outer sides, stools are depicted as seating furniture in the typical form of the time.<br /><br />A relief on the back surface of the backrest shows the couple's children sacrificing to their parents. With this sculpture, too,  the formal principles of ancient Egyptian panoramas are clearly visible. This explains the overlapping of the wife's right arm, which is placed around the waist of the man, or the daughter's left arm, which rests on the father's left shoulder. Due to the frontal orientation and the axial constraint of the figures, it was not possible to indicate these limbs in their correct proportions ...  the figures of this group have empty, expressionless, schematically shaped faces. <br /><br />From: Finneiser, Klaus, in: Priese, Karl-Heinz (Hrsg.), Ägyptisches Museum Berlin, Museumsinsel Berlin, Mainz 1991, S. 150.<br /><br />Catalog:  Limestone, Necropolis of Saqqara,  ÄM  2297 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,   <!-- http://www.smb-digital.de/ --> (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><h2>The Late Bronze Age collapse</h2><br /> <center><a href="images41/Bronze_Age_End.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/Bronze_Age_Endsm.jpg" alt = "Bronze_Age_Endsm" width="900" height="635"></a> </center></p><br clear = "all"><p>The Late Bronze Age collapse was a dark age transition in a large area covering much of Southeast Europe, West Asia and North Africa (comprising the overlapping regions of the Near East, the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa, with the Balkans, the Aegean, Anatolia, and the Caucasus), which took place from the Late Bronze Age to the emerging Early Iron Age.<br /><br />It was a transition which historians believe was violent, sudden, and culturally disruptive, and involved societal collapse for some civilisations during the 12th century BC. The palace economy of Mycenaean Greece, the Aegean region and Anatolia that characterised the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages. The Hittite Empire of Anatolia and the Levant collapsed, while states such as the Middle Assyrian Empire in Mesopotamia and the New Kingdom of Egypt survived but were considerably weakened.<br /><br />Competing and even mutually incompatible theories for the ultimate cause of the Late Bronze Age collapse have been made since the 19th century. These include volcanic eruptions, droughts, invasions by the Sea Peoples or migrations of Dorians, economic disruptions due to the rising use of ironworking, and changes in military technology and methods of war that saw the decline of chariot warfare.<br /><br />Text: Wikipedia<br />Photo: Alexikoua<br />Permission: Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.<br />Description: Migrations, invasions and destructions during the end of the Bronze Age (circa 1200&nbsp;BC), Topography taken from DEMIS Mapserver, which are public domain, other wise self-made.</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><br /><br /><big><b>Merneptah and the first skirmishes of the Late Bronze Age collapse</b></big><br /><br /><p><a href="images41/merneptastatuedenmark.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/merneptastatuedenmarksm.jpg" alt = "merneptastatuedenmarksm" width="304" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Merneptah</b><br /><br />Merneptah was already an elderly man in his late 60s, if not early 70s, when he assumed the throne.  Merneptah moved the administrative center of Egypt from Piramesse (Pi-Ramesses), his father's capital, back to Memphis, where he constructed a royal palace next to the temple of Ptah. This palace was excavated in 1915 by the University of Pennsylvania Museum, led by Clarence Stanley Fisher.<br /><br />Merneptah had to carry out several military campaigns during his reign. In the fifth year of his rule, he fought against the Libyans, who - with the assistance of the Sea Peoples - were threatening Egypt from the west. Merneptah led a victorious six hour battle against a combined Libyan and Sea People force at the city of Perire, probably located on the western edge of the Nile delta. His account of this campaign against the Sea Peoples and Libu (an Ancient Libyan tribe of Berber origin, from which the name Libya derives) is described in prose on a wall beside the sixth pylon at Karnak, KIU&nbsp;4246,  which states:<br /><br />[Beginning of the victory that his majesty achieved in the land of Libya]<br />-I, Ekwesh, Teresh, Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Northerners coming from all lands.<br /><br />Later in the inscription, Merneptah receives news of the attack:<br /><br />...the third season, saying: 'The wretched, fallen chief of Libya, Meryre, son of Ded, has fallen upon the country of Tehenu with his bowmen - Sherden, Shekelesh, Ekwesh, Lukka, Teresh, taking the best of every warrior and every man of war of his country. He has brought his wife and his children - leaders of the camp, and he has reached the western boundary in the fields of Perire.' </p><br clear = "all"><p>An inscription on the Athribis Stele, now in the garden of Cairo Museum, declares 'His majesty was enraged at their report, like a lion', assembled his court, and gave a rousing speech. Later he dreamed he saw Ptah handing him a sword and saying 'Take thou (it) and banish thou the fearful heart from thee.' When the bowmen went forth, says the inscription, 'Amun was with them as a shield.' After six hours the surviving Nine Bows threw down their weapons, abandoned their baggage and dependents, and ran for their lives. Merneptah states that he defeated the invasion, killing 6&nbsp;000 soldiers and taking 9&nbsp;000 prisoners. To be sure of the numbers, among other things, he took the penises of all uncircumcised enemy dead and the hands of all the circumcised, from which history learns that the Ekwesh were circumcised, a fact causing some to doubt that they were Greek.<br /><br />There is also an account of the same events in the form of a poem from the Merneptah Stele, widely known as the Israel Stele, which makes reference to the supposed utter destruction of Israel in a campaign prior to his fifth year, in Canaan: 'Israel has been wiped out...its seed is no more.' This is the first recognised ancient Egyptian record of the existence of Israel - 'not as a country or city, but as a tribe' or people. <br /><br />Photo: Daderot <br />Permission: Public Domain<br />Source: Thorvaldsens Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark <br />Text: Wikipedia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><!-- <a href="images35/img_9436setib.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9436setibsm.jpg" alt = "Seti" width="303" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images42/IMG_9436originalcroppedsmallgrid12.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/IMG_9436originalcroppedsmallgrid12smsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_9436originalcroppedsmallgrid12smsm" width="377" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>--><a href="images42/IMG_9436originalcroppedsmallgrid12morecolour.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/IMG_9436originalcroppedsmallgrid12morecoloursm.jpg" alt = "IMG_9436originalcroppedsmallgrid12smsm" width="352" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Merneptah</b><br /><br />Cast from the Tomb of King Merneptah<br /><br />(&#8239;<i>Note that these colours are highly subjective - we have no way of knowing  the brightness of the original hues.

Khabekhnet was buried along with his wife, Sahte, and their family in   tomb TT2   above and slightly to the south of his father's tomb.<br /><br />Khabekhnet's family was as extensive as Sennedjem's family. A stela found in the courtyard of the tomb contains  the names of Khabekhnet, his brother Khons and several children: Mose, Anhotep, Amenemheb, Isis and  Henutweret. <br /><br /><a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Davies (1999)</span></a> suggests that they all were Khabekhnet's offspring.<br /><br />The relief  comes from his tomb. It shows Khabekhnet standing in a gesture of adoration on the  right in front of a row of deceased kings. The purpose of this relief might lie in the fact  that he could have  been responsible for the care of their tombs.<br /><br />Catalog: TT2,  Deir el-Medine, Tomb of Chabechnet, Plaster on limestone,    ÄM  1625 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,   <!-- http://www.smb-digital.de/ --> (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br />Additional text: http://www.deirelmedina.com/lenka/NeuesMuseum.html</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <p>	<a href="images40/DSC00848vasehandles.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00848vasehandlessm.jpg" alt = "DSC00848vasehandlessm" width="362" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images40/DSC00847vase.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00847vasesm.jpg" alt = "DSC00847vasesm" width="287" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Calcite Jars</b><br /><br />Calcite storage jars for funerary oils. <br /><br />1&nbsp;210&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;204&nbsp;BC. <br /><br />These jars formed part of a cache of 13 calcite vessels discovered near the entrance to the tomb of Merneptah.

Instead he appears in the dress of daily life, perhaps to signal his rebirth as a 'sah'. Amenmose is equipped for eternity by the protective texts running around his coffin. Four horizontal bands of text, a format introduced in the New Kingdom, wrap around the coffin like mummy bandages and describe Amenmes as revered before a number of gods, including the Four Sons of Horus. <br /><br />For eternal protection, his image on the coffin holds the 'tyt'-girdle of Isis in his right hand, and the 'djed'-pillar of stability of the god of the Underworld, Osiris, in his left.

Most such shabtis with coffins were made of wood or clay, but this exceptional example, belonging to a man of some administrative status, is in glazed composition.The meaning of this coffined shabti is probably to be distinguished from that of the standard shabti that served until the late New Kingdom as a double of the deceased. Neither figure nor coffin carry the usual shabti agricultural implements nor the typical shabti inscription, Chapter 6 of the 'Book of the Dead'. Since the provenance of these coffined shabtis is generally unknown, determining their meaning is difficult. Some examples have been found as votive deposits.<br /><br />Catalog: Thebes(?)

Chaemwese wears a short, straight-edged chin-beard. The face is very full and round, as are other statues, which are certainly assigned to him, show. His eyes appear very small and shown close to the nose, but the mouth is not very wide and is surrounded by nasolabial and mouth folds. The prince's  hairstyle is about chin length and forms a straight edge on the forehead.<br /><br />From the top of the head, a braided plait runs along the right side of the head, which extends beyond the length of the fracture point of the statuary fragment shown here. This braid and the described beard characterise him as a high priest. Chaemwese held the office of the high priest of the god Ptah in Memphis for more than thirty years. <br /><br />On the left half of the body, Chaemwaset held a divine staff, of which there are remnants,   and which extended to the ground. In the British Museum in London (EA947) there is a comparable statue of the prince,  with a staff on each side of the body, so the Berlin head can also be reconstructed as a standing figure with a staff. <br /><br />Catalog: Quartzite, ÄM 13460<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text:  &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,  Jessica Jancziak at http://www.smb-digital.de/ (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p>	<a href="images40/DSC06169slaughtercattle.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC06169slaughtercattlesm.jpg" alt = "Son of Ramses II" width="818" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br /></b><b>Khaemwase</b><br /><br />Slaughter of cattle from the tomb of Prince Chaemwese, son of  Pharoah Ramesses II, circa 1&nbsp;240&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Catalog: Limestone, Saqqara, Inv.

The composite creature combines the physical strength of the lion with the worldly might of the king, thus creating a creature with terrifying power. A hawk-headed sphinx, also called a gryphon, wearing a royal lappet head-dress, is often shown as a representation of the king treading on his enemies. The statue shown here and a similar one (EA11) were set up near the Temple of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel.

A wooden shabti box which was painted with a scene showing Henutmehyt adoring two of the canopic deities  and receiving food and wine from the goddess Nut. There were four shabti boxes in total, containing shabtis made of both wood and pottery.<br /><br />A funerary papyrus was included in her burial as well. The text is Spell 100 from the Book of the Dead and is written rather unusually in red and white ink. The papyrus was placed over the outer wrappings of the mummy. These types of texts became more common after the New Kingdom.<br /><br />Magic bricks made of unbaked mud must have been placed in niches in the burial chamber. Henutmehyt's magic bricks were well preserved. They supported amuletic figures: a Djed pillar, the figure of Anubis, a wooden mummiform figure, and a reed. The bricks themselves were inscribed with magic spells.<br /><br />A wooden box, painted black and containing fowl wrapped in linen and meat possibly from a goat may also belong to the funerary equipment of Henutmehyt. The box contains enough food for a meal. <br /><br />Catalog: EA48001<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: &copy;  http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/ and card at the Museum, &copy;

Like tomb-statues, this type of coffin was believed to provide the spirit with a substitute body if the mummy should perish. The physical form, with crossed arms, together with the inscriptions and the figures of protective gods and goddesses all emphasised the identification of the dead person with the god Osiris. The implication was that, like him, they might experience resurrection.<br /><br />Henutmehyt's outer coffin provides a magnificent idealised image of the dead woman, adorned with her full wig.

They were positioned at the four cardinal points of the tomb (north, east, south and west). An amulet was set in each socket, standing so it faced the opposite wall. Each brick was inscribed with a portion of Spell 151 of the Book of the Dead. This spell identifies the deceased with Osiris, Isis and Nephthys. <br /><br />The four sons of Horus offer their protection; the amuletic figures of the magic bricks specifying the ways in which they will defend the deceased from attack. The brick beside the west wall contains a faience djedpillar, representing the backbone of Osiris. It was thus an amulet which promoted stability and endurance. The brick by the east wall is surmounted by a clay figure of the jackal god Anubis. He presided over the mummification process, and protected the necropolis (cemetery). The mummiform figure by the north wall is identified in the spell as a shabti. This amulet offers to perform agricultural tasks on behalf of the deceased. The brick by the south wall contains a reed to hold a torch, burning the path of those who wish the deceased harm. </blockquote>Text above: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Taylor (1999)</span></a><br /><br /><p><a href="images35/img_9495fourmagicbricks2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9495fourmagicbricks2sm.jpg" alt = "Henutmehyt" width="305" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Nineteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Henutmehyt</b><br /><br />All bricks are of unfired clay, only practical when they are in the sealed environment of a dry tomb, not exposed to the weather. <br /><br />EA41544:  Clay magical brick with a reed.

A juvenile form of Horus, the name Harpocrates is derived from the Egyptian Hor-Pa-Khered ('Horus-the-child')<br /><br />Harpocrates   was the god of silence, secrets and confidentiality in the Hellenistic religion developed in Ptolemaic Alexandria (and also an embodiment of hope, according to Plutarch). Harpocrates was adapted by the Greeks and Romans from the Egyptian child god Hor.<br /><br />The figure is of a male deity in a seated position. It depicts the god Horus, son of Osiris and Isis, as a child.   The figurine was possibly originally part of a larger figurine group, being seated on his mother, Isis', lap.<br /><br /> Horus is the most important of the avian deities who takes on so many forms and is depicted so differently in various inscriptions that it is nearly impossible to distinguish the true Horus. Horus is mostly a general term for a great number of falcon deities. However, the name 'Horus' will usually be found to designate either the older god of the first five,  or the son of Isis and Osiris who defeated his uncle Set and restored order to the land. <br /><br />Catalog: Aile Sully,   Room 334,  Materials and Techniques, Vitrine 2,  E 7735<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source and text: Original,  Louvre Museum, Paris, France,  https://collections.louvre.fr/ <br />Additional text: https://www.worldhistory.org/Horus/, Wikipedia </p><br clear ="all"><br /><p><a href="images42/DSC09711collosalheadmunich.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/DSC09711collosalheadmunichsm.jpg" alt = "DSC09711collosalheadmunichsm" width="362" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>19th - 20th Dynasty,  1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />A King's Head</b><br /><br />Head from a colossal figure of a king. <br /><br />Circa  1&nbsp;200&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;150&nbsp;BC.<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Catalog:  Pink Granite, Thebes West,  ÄS 7161<br />Source: Original, Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Text: Museum card,  © Ägyptischen Museum München</p><br clear = "all"><br /> <p><a href="images40/DSC00631falconheadeddeity.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00631falconheadeddeitysm.jpg" alt = "DSC00631falconheadeddeitysm" width="241" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>19th - 20th Dynasty,  1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Qebhsenuef</b><br /><br />Wooden figure of a mummiform falcon headed deity, Qebhsenuef, on a pedestal, coated in bitumen. <br /><br />The base, although made from an ancient wood, is a 19th century restoration. <br /><br />Dimensions: Height: 462  mm,  width  43 mm. <br /><br />Catalog:  Wood and bitumen,  Biban el-Muluk (Valley of the Kings - Thebes),   EA60393  <br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card at museum display, https://www.britishmuseum.org/,   &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />  <p><a href="images42/DSC00004bullstela.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/DSC00004bullstelasm.jpg" alt = "DSC00004bullstelasm" width="365" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"><a href="images42/DSC00005stela2bull.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/DSC00005stela2bullsm.jpg" alt = "DSC00005stela2bullsm" width="351" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> </p><br clear ="all"><p><b>19th - 20th Dynasty,  1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Mnevis-bull</b><br /><br />Circa 12th Century BC<br /><br />Two votive stelae for the Mnevis-bull<br /><br />Mnevis is the Greek name of an ancient Egyptian bull god which had its centre of worship at Heliopolis, and was known to the ancient Egyptians as Mer-wer or Nem-wer.<br /><br />Although initially a separate god, it was later assimilated with the god Atum-Ra as his physical manifestation, and also considered as the ba of Ra. Mnevis is often depicted as a black bull wearing a solar disk and uraeus.  As reported by Plutarch, the Mnevis bull was second only to the Memphite Apis bull in importance. Similarly to the Apis bull, the Mnevis bull's movements were thought to be driven by divine will, and used as an oracle. The priesthood of Mnevis also went as far as to claim that Mnevis was none other than the father of the more famous Apis. <br /><br />Catalog: Limestone, Heliopolis, ÄS 1399,  ÄS 1400<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock  2018<br />Source: Original, Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Text: Museum card, © Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><p><a href="images42/IMG_4177cubicstool.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/IMG_4177cubicstoolsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_4177cubicstoolsm" width="264" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>19th - 20th Dynasty,  1&nbsp;292&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Statuette of a Squatting Man</b><br /><br /> After their  shape, such statues were called 'cube stools'.

The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her. Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as 'Seven Hathors', or, less commonly, of many more Hathors - as many as 362.  For these reasons, Gillam calls her 'a type of deity rather than a single entity'.  Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the Egyptian perception of femininity. <br /><br />Catalog: Red sandstone, Inv.

The dates and names in the table are mostly taken from 'Chronological Table for the Dynastic Period' in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill, 2006. Many of the pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes (designated KV). More information can be found on the Theban Mapping Project website.<br /><br /><blockquote><b>Background</b><br /><br />Pharaoh Setnakhte was likely already middle aged when he took the throne after Queen Twosret. He ruled for only around 4 years when he was succeeded by his son Ramesses III. Egypt was threatened by the Sea Peoples during this time period, but Ramesses III was able to defeat this confederacy from the Near East. The king is also known for a harem conspiracy in which Queen Tiye attempted to assassinate the king and put her son Pentawere on the throne. The coup was not successful in the end. The king may have died from the attempt on his life, but it was his legitimate heir Ramesses IV who succeeded him to the throne. After this a succession of kings named Ramesses take the throne, but none would truly achieve greatness.<br /><br /><b>Tomb robberies</b><br /><br />The period of these rulers is notable for the beginning of the systematic robbing of the royal tombs. Many surviving administrative documents from this period are records of investigations and punishment for these crimes, especially in the reigns of Ramses IX and Ramses XI.<br /><br /><b>Decline</b> <br /><br />As happened under the earlier Nineteenth Dynasty, this group struggled under the effects of the bickering between the heirs of Ramesses III. For instance, three different sons of Ramesses III are known to have assumed power as Ramesses IV, Ramesses VI and Ramesses VIII respectively. However, at this time Egypt was also increasingly beset by a series of droughts, below-normal flooding levels of the Nile, famine, civil unrest and official corruption – all of which would limit the managerial abilities of any king. <br /><br />The power of the last king, Ramesses XI, grew so weak that in the south the High Priests of Amun at Thebes became the de facto rulers of Upper Egypt, while Smendes controlled Lower Egypt even before Ramesses XI's death. Smendes would eventually found the Twenty-First dynasty at Tanis. </blockquote>Text above from Wikipedia.   <br /><br /><br /><center><a href="images35/twentiethdynastyfamilytree.jpg"

On her head she wears the vulture head-dress of the goddess Mut, consort of the god Amun of Thebes, surmounted by a sun-disc and ostrich plumes. The cobra on her crown <!--  and the flail in her hand--> indicates her royal status. The lotus blossom was often held by deceased women, thought to be representing rebirth.

It is topped with a sun-disc. Amenhotep holds a crook and a flail, symbols of royalty, in his right hand. He holds an ankh, symbol of life, in his left hand. The king is shown wearing the classic shendjyt-kilt, and a longer see-through linen garment.<br /><br />Amenhotep I was the second Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. His reign is generally dated from 1&nbsp;526&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;506&nbsp;BC. He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari, but had at least two elder brothers, Ahmose-ankh and Ahmose Sapair, and was not expected to inherit the throne. However, sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I's 17th regnal year and his death, his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince.  He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years. <br /><br />He inherited the kingdom formed by his father's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant. He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionised mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his mortuary temple, setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom. After his death, he was deified as a patron god of Deir el-Medina. <br /><br /></p><br clear = "all"><p>Catalog: Deir el-Medine,  Inherkau's tomb, Grave TT 359, Nile mud, stucco, painted ÄM 2061  <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy;  Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, <!--  http://www.smb-digital.de/ -->(CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br />Additional text:  http://www.deirelmedina.com/lenka/TempleAmenhotep.html</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images40/DSC06178walltiles.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC06178walltilessm.jpg" alt = "DSC06178walltilessm" width="336" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images40/DSC06180walltiles.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC06180walltilessm.jpg" alt = "DSC06180walltilessm" width="539" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p><a href="images40/DSC06179walltile.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC06179walltilesm.jpg" alt = "DSC06179walltilesm" width="292" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twentieth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Wall tiles</b><br /><br />Six fragments of wall tiles.<br /><br />Ceramic with coloured glazes, circa  1&nbsp;160&nbsp;BC.<br /><br />Catalog:  Ceramic with coloured glazes,  probably from Medinet Habu (Thebes), Inv.

The nocturnal sun was represented as a man with a ram's head. Every 'hour' (i.e. every stage of his journey) was marked by a particular event: at the seventh hour, for example (right-hand side of the coffin), the sun confronts the snake Apophis, the 'evil serpent' of Egyptian texts, who tries to stop him on his course. <br /><br />The sun-god is portrayed armed with knives to destroy him. The left-hand side represents the eighth hour: on the lower register, the creatures of the Underworld are depicted, sitting on the ideogram for fabric (one of the essential funerary offerings). The texts referring to the sun's night-time journey ('Litanies of the Sun', 'Amduat', 'Book of Gates', 'Book of Night', etc.) were composed during the New Kingdom for the exclusive use of the king. <br /><br />As the pharaoh was associated with the sun god and his perilous journey through the night, the royal tomb featured representations of this recurrent event. After the New Kingdom, some of these texts (especially the Amduat) were also used for the benefit of priests and soldiers who were at the peak of their influence at that time (see the papyri in vitrine 4).</p><br clear ="all"><p>Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, Musée du Louvre<br />Text:  http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/sarcophagus-box-ramesses-iii</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images34/img_6246ramessesiiicoffin.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/img_6246ramessesiiicoffinsm.jpg" alt = "Sarcophagus of Pharaoh Ramesses III" width="326" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images34/img_6243ramessessescoffin.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/img_6243ramessessescoffinsm.jpg" alt = "Sarcophagus of Pharaoh Ramesses III" width="341" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twentieth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramesses III</b><br /><br /><b>Slapdash work</b><br /><br />Only two scenes from the Amduat are illustrated on the sarcophagus of Ramesses III, which is characterised by extraordinary carelessness on the part of the scribe who engraved the introductory text to the seventh hour (to the right of the figure of Nephthys). <br /><br />The phrases (and even individual words) are cut up into incoherent elements that cannot be understood without referring to the correct version featured in other tombs.

This figure is carved from sycomore fig and represents the king wearing the Nemes Headdress. The surface of this statue was finished using less costly materials than that of Ramesses I. Black paint took the place of resin, and polychrome paint was applied instead of gold leaf. The eyes and eyebrows were carved directly from the wood, instead of being inlaid. <br /><br />Catalog EA882<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: &copy;  Card with the display at the British Museum,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, Wikipedia, http://www.britishmuseum.org/<!-- http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=111489&partId=1  --></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images40/DSC00856ramses_ix8571.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00856ramses_ix8571sm.jpg" alt = "DSC00856ramses_ix8571sm" width="209" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twentieth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramesses IX</b><br /><br />Sycomore fig wood shabti of Ramses IX with a striped nemes, a modelled face, a collar and crossed hands in relief holding two incised hoes; nine rows of Hieroglyphic text on the leg section; incised seed-basket at the back; remains of a bitumen coating, circa  1&nbsp;126&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;108&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Dimensions:  Height: 310 mm, width 95 mm,  depth 74 mm<br /><br />Inscription: Hieroglyphic on leg section.<br /><br />Catalog: Sycomore fig wood,  Biban el-Muluk (Valley of the Kings - Thebes), Tomb of Ramses IX, EA8571<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum,   http://www.britishmuseum.org/,&copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><p><a href="images40/DSC00853ramsesix.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00853ramsesixsm.jpg" alt = "DSC00853ramsesixsm" width="217" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twentieth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramesses IX</b><br /><br />Wooden shabti of Ramses IX with incised detail: a striped nemes, a modelled face, a collar and crossed hands in relief holding two small hoes and the string of the seed-basket that hangs over the shoulder; the leg section is inscribed with nine rows of Hieroglyphic text, circa  1&nbsp;126&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;108&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Dimensions:  Height: 313 mm, width 91 mm,  depth 68 mm<br /><br />Inscription: Hieroglyphic text on leg section.<br /><br />Catalog: Wood,  Biban el-Muluk (Valley of the Kings - Thebes), Tomb of Ramses IX, EA8570<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum,   http://www.britishmuseum.org/,&copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><!-- Catalog:    Aile Sully, Room 334,  Materials and Techniques, Vitrine 4,  N&nbsp;4535, MR&nbsp;13, AF&nbsp;547<br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source and text: Original,  Louvre Museum, Paris, France, https://collections.louvre.fr/<br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear = "all"><br /> --><p><a href="images41/IMG_6269djed_ramses_ix.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/IMG_6269djed_ramses_ixsm.jpg" alt = "DSC00853ramsesixsm" width="306" height="550" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twentieth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;187&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;077&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ramesses IX</b><br /><br />Amulet in the form of a Djed pillar with the name of Ramses IX. <br /><br />Circa 1&nbsp;129&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;111&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Found in the  small subterranean rooms (Serapium = Serapium of Memphis), Saqqara North, in the second room on the left when entering the small subterranean rooms.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 41 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/egypt2d.html responseCode 3 200

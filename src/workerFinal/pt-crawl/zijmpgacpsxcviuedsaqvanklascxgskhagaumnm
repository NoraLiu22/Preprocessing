This volume presents research and theoretical discussion on domain specificity 
in human thought. "Domain specificity" is the idea that all concepts are not equal, 
and that the structure of knowledge is different in important ways across distinct 
content areas. The notion of domain specificity has received much attention in 
recent years, but surprisingly it has not yet been given a unified treatment. 
A sense of how widely this concept has been discussed can be seen by viewing the 
range of disciplines represented in this volume: philosophy, psycholinguistics, 
linguistics, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, developmental psychology, 
cognitive neuroscience, and education.

of representations. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 39-67. 
<p>
Abstract: Controversies have focused on the thesis that perceptual and linguistic 
decoding processes are modular much more than on the alleged nonmodularity of 
thought. However, thought processes might be modular too. Sperber articulates 
a modular view of human thought with the naturalistic view of human culture that 
he has been developing under the label "epidemiology of representations." He show 
how, contrary to the received view, organisms endowed with truly modular minds 
might engender truly diverse cultures.

category- and modality-specific deficits. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, 
pp. 68-84. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Abstract: How is lexical knowledge organized in the brain? The authors argue that 
evidence from the analysis of the performance of brain-damaged Subjects (34-67 
yr olds) provides the basis for far-reaching speculations, not only about the 
functional organization of lexical knowledge, but also about the relation between 
lexical knowledge and the brain. They review evidence suggesting that distinctions 
among different aspects of lexical knowledge -- for example, lexical form and 
semantic and grammatical categories -- are most likely subserved by distinct neuroanatomical 
structures. The evidence takes the form of selective impairments affecting restricted 
domains of knowledge-semantic and grammatical categories.

of domain specificity: The evolution of functional organization. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld 
& Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 85-116. 
<p>
Abstract: By establishing that domain-specific machinery is necessary to explain 
human cognitive performance, psychologists who advocate modular or domain-specific 
approaches have found themselves in an unanticipated situation. Quite unexpectedly, 
cognitive psychologists find their field intimately connected to evolutionary 
functionalist research. The proliferating connections tying together the cognitive 
and evolutionary communities promise to transform both fields, with each supplying 
necessary principles, methods, and a species of rigor that the other lacks. The 
origins of domain specificity can be located in the evolutionary process, in the 
selective advantages conferred by functional design in adaptive problem solving.

<a name="Leslie, Alan M."></a>Leslie, Alan M. ToMM, ToBy, and Agency: Core architecture 
and domain specificity. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 119-148. 
<p>
Abstract: Leslie proposes that the notion of Agency emerges from domain-specific 
learning and reflects properties of core architecture. In exploring the relationship 
between core architecture and our ability to understand the behavior of Agents, 
he postulates two processing devices: ToBY (Theory of Body mechanism), the seat 
of the infant's theory of physical bodies, and ToMM (the Theory of Mind Mechanism), 
the seat of the child's "theory of mind." Leslie presents a three-level theory 
of our understanding of Agency. Each of these levels corresponds to an information 
processing subsystem specialized for making certain kinds of information explicit:&nbsp; 
mechanical properties of Agents, Agents and the goal-directed actions they produce, 
and the mental states of Agents and their role in producing behavior.

Premack. Moral belief: Form versus content. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman 
(1994)</a>, pp. 149-168. 
<p>
Abstract: The Premacks attribute a moral domain to the infant and presents a model 
of the domain. They show how the primitives of the domain can provide an invariant 
form in which to express the diverse moral beliefs of different cultures. They 
raise the question of what is the source of these distinctly moral concepts -- 
of "right," "wrong," "ought," "responsibility," and the like and trace their origin 
to "knowledge" or expectancies of the human infant. The resulting model attributes 
to the infant capacities that concern what one individual expects of another. 
They discuss how the concepts of power, group, and possession affect those expectancies.

Domain-specific knowledge and conceptual change. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman 
(1994)</a>, pp. 169-200. 
<p>
Abstract: Spelke argues that human reasoning is guided by a collection of innate 
domain-specific systems of knowledge. There are at least three domains: physics, 
psychology, and number. Each system is characterized by a set of core principles 
that define the entities covered by the domain and support reasoning about those 
entities. She sketches one potential mechanism underlying conceptual change and 
raises the question of a central empirical problem for cognitive anthropology: 
to what extent is there cross-cultural universality in the domains covered by 
innate systems of knowledge?

<a name="Hirschfeld, Lawrence A"></a>Hirschfeld, Lawrence A. Is the acquisition 
of social categories based on domain-specific competence or on knowledge transfer? 
<a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 201-233. 
<p>
Abstract: Hirschfeld presents evidence and arguments suggesting that the acquisition 
of social category does not depend on a transfer from the biological domain and 
questions its constitutive role. Social categories appear to fall within the scope 
of a domain-specific competence, and are not brought into existence by mere analogical 
transfer. This issue is relevant both to classical concerns of anthropologists 
and to contemporary concerns of developmentalists working on knowledge transfer. 
Further insights from anthropology and psychology may be needed if we are to advance 
our understanding of this shared problem.

<a name="Keil, Frank"></a>Keil, Frank C. The birth and nurturance of concepts 
by domains: The origins of concepts of living things. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld 
& Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 234-254. 
<p>
Abstract: The revival of interest in domains of cognition, especially in the contexts 
of cross-cultural and developmental studies, is evidence of a new awareness of 
how different sorts of concepts and belief systems might become tailored to particular 
kinds of lawful regularities in our physical and socal worlds. To make much progress, 
however, this new emphasis requires more precise distinctions between types of 
domains and better descriptions of the ways in which each type might vary across 
development and cultures. Keil examines different sorts of domains and considers 
some distinctions and their implications for questions concerning the origins 
of concepts. His focus is on the emergence of biological thought, since concepts 
of living things may offer an especially clear illustration of how domains might 
be involved in the origins of more specific concepts, and conversely of how specific 
concepts become interwined within larger belief systems.

theory. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 257-293. 
<p>
Abstract: This chapter addresses the development of a single domain: everyday 
understanding of the mind in children, and suggests that this development is best 
understood as the formulation of a succession of naive theories. This "theory 
theory" can help to characterize cognitive domains more generally and to explain 
domain-specific development. The authors also join company with a number of recent 
discussions drawing parallels between theory change in science and cognitive development.

False analogies and neglected similarities. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman 
(1994)</a>, pp. 294-315. 
<p>
Abstract: Harris distinguishes among three types of cognitive activity: the cognitive 
processes of children (age ranges: 2-5 yr olds); the cognitive processes of individual 
scientists, and the collective, public enterprise that constitutes the history 
of science. He proposes that when we focus on individual scientists rather than 
the organized discipline within which they work, there are some neglected similarities 
between the way that they think and the way that young children think. This suggests 
that children (and adults) do not truly subscribe to wide-ranging theoretical 
principles but engage in a process of imaginative enactment or simulation. He 
discusses this proposal in terms of folk physics and folk psychology.

Evidence from systematics and Itza-Maya folkbiology. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld 
& Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 316-340. 
<p>
Abstract: The author examines the nature of specific cognitive domains common 
to ordinary folk, and&nbsp; the relationship between the structure of the most 
basic of these commonsense domains to the structure of corresponding scientific 
theories. For one such domain -- folk biology -- conceptual categories exhibit 
high internal cultural consensus, and significant cross-cultural correlation with 
scientific taxonomies. Panhuman and domain-specific taxonomic structure may be 
embedded in different belief systems and may be distinctly interpreted at various 
levels of expertise. Based on a comparative analysis of Itza-Maya folkbiology 
and corresponding aspects of systematics (the branch of biology that deals with 
the classification of animals and plants), he assesses relative agreement on judgments 
of taxonomic relatedness across: (a) a sample of Itza informants, (b) Itza men 
and Itza women, and (c) the Itza and (Western) science. The measures are also 
used to relate taxonomic similarity judgments to levels of: (d) agreement among 
Itza informants on inferences concerning reproduction, and (e) expertise among 
Itza men and women.

and theories. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 341-365. 
<p>
Abstract: The authors examine theory-like beliefs by discussing the unobservable 
constructs children invoke to account for biological properties and events. They 
focus on what D. Medin (1989; Medin and Ortony, 1989) calls "psychological essentialism" 
and review evidence for three of the more direct kinds of evidence for essentialism: 
appeal to invisible causal mechanisms (responses from 4 yr olds), assumption of 
innate potential (responses from preschool children), and maintenance of identity 
over superficial transformations. They consider alternative accounts of these 
data, and conclude that children appeal to theory-like entities that may derive 
from domain-general expectations.

<a name="Gelman & Brenneman"></a>Gelman, Rochel and Kimberly Brenneman. First 
principles can support both universal and culture-specific learning about number 
and music. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 369-390. 
<p>
Abstract: The authors offer a definition of a domain and a description of the 
innate principles that guide knowledge acquisition within certain domains. They 
review why an assumption of some innate knowledge in a domain does not rule out 
the need for learning in this domain, and provide the foundation on which to build 
the thesis that learning about both number and music is facilitated, but not guaranteed, 
by the presence of skeletal, domain-specific principles. They discuss the account 
of principle-first learning and return to the idea that innateness and cultural 
creativity are not opposites and indeed work together to guide the acquisition 
of human knowledge.

Natural ontologies and religious ideas. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, 
pp. 391-411. 
<p>
Abstract: The point of a cognitive approach to cultural representations is to 
put forward a series of causal hypotheses in order to account for certain features 
of cultural phenomena and show to what extent this framework can help reformulate 
classical anthropological problems. It aims to dispel certain conceptual ambiguities 
that are pervasive in the anthropological literature, notably as concerns (1) 
the subjective "unnaturalness" of religious assumptions, (2) their cognitive diversity, 
and (3) the extent to which they depend on cultural transmission. Boyer argues 
that if cognitive hypotheses are relevant in the explanation of religious ideas, 
then other aspects of cultural representations will be <i>a fortiori</i> amenable 
to such a description.

properties of children's mental models of the earth. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld 
& Gelman (1994)</a>, pp. 412-430. 
<p>
Abstract: Develops some ideas about domain specificity and cultural knowledge 
based on a series of studies of children's concept of the earth. The subjects 
are kindergarten-6th graders from the US, Samoa, Greece, and India. The authors 
argue that the concept of the earth is originally embedded within a naive theory 
of physics and is constrained by certain entrenched presuppositions that apply 
to physical objects in general. They describe some of the research providing the 
empirical evidence for this argument, starting with a general discussion of the 
theoretical framework guiding their choice of methodology, and proceed with a 
description of some of the results of the specific studies they have undertaken.

of the lexicon: The case of emotions. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, 
pp. 431-452. 
<p>
Abstract: Examines how basic everyday or "foundational" knowledge is stored and 
organized in the human mind. By studying the structure of the lexicon, researchers 
can discover what domains are and how they are organized. Discusses human emotion 
and concepts as cognitive domains with a specific semantic structure.

of children's minds and learning. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, 
pp. 455-473. 
<p>
Abstract: Do teachers have mental models of the structure of children's minds, 
of how the mind works when learning takes place, and of the roles of teaching 
in fostering that learning? We are interested in teacher education, and reasoned 
that studying teachers' understanding of the mind might be a window into what 
happens to what has been claimed to be children's models of the mind. We study 
two contrasting groups of high school teachers: (1) experienced versus novice 
teachers and (2) teachers of different subject matter -- the sciences and the 
humanities.

and social preparation for learning. <a href="#top">Hirschfeld & Gelman (1994)</a>, 
pp. 474-493. 
<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) examine the relations between 2 lines of thinking 
(biological and social preparation for learning), each commanding increasing attention 
among psychologists and social scientists, that appear to be contradictory; argue 
...that the rationalist and situationist views ...share important epistemological 
assumptions and can -- perhaps must -- be combined to provide a theory of cognitive 
development and functioning; develop a view of learning and development that (the 
author calls) situated rationalism, illustrate it with some examples from mathematics 
and science learning, and consider its implications for education.

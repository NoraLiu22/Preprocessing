<H2>Ariadne: What, Why, and Who</H2>

<P>Ariadne is a project funded under the Electronic Libraries Programme
(eLib), with the main purpose of providing a regular, parallel, Web <A HREF="#fn1">[1]</A>
and print <A HREF="#fn2">[2]</A> magazine for the UK Higher Education Library
and Information Science communities. </P>

<H3>The Electronic Libraries Programme: Cultural Change</H3>

<P>In 1993, an investigation into how to deal with the pressures on library
resources caused by the rapid expansion of student numbers and the world-wide
explosion in academic knowledge and information was undertaken by the Joint
Funding Council's Libraries Review Group, chaired by Sir Brian Follett;
This investigation resulted in the Follett Report <A HREF="#fn3">[3]</A>,
from which one of the key conclusions was: </P>

<P>&quot;The exploitation of IT is essential to create the effective library
service of the future&quot;. </P>

<P>As a consequence, the Higher Education Funding Bodies in the UK invited
proposals for projects which would &quot;transform the use and storage
of knowledge in higher education institutions&quot;. The original 30 projects,
and the 30 or so that would be funded later, would form the Electronic
Libraries Programme <A HREF="#fn4">[4]</A> (otherwise known as eLib); this
programme would be managed by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)
<A HREF="#fn5">[5]</A> on behalf of the funding bodies. </P>

<P>The driving philosophy behind eLib is more holistic than simply providing
a set of tools and resources; it is one of instilling a &quot;cultural
change&quot; in UK Higher Education (HE), making attitudes, confidence
and knowledge in the use of network-based technologies more positive and
widespread. Projects are encouraged to publicise their work throughout
relevant parts of HE, and to work in an open, consortium-based manner where
possible. The large number of Universities in the UK are involved in
at least one project; most of these are involved with several. </P>

<H3>Ariadne: Purpose and Goals</H3>

<P>The overall goal of Ariadne is to disseminate information about, and
raise awareness of, electronic library developments, resources and services,
to the HE and academic library communities. </P>

<P>Ariadne consists of a two-pronged approach to information dissemination:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>A print magazine is produced every two months, each issue consisting
of 12 pages. Every University library and Computer Centre,
 as well as other eLib projects, some UK centres of electronic
library research, and key University personnel such as Vice Chancellors
would receive copies. </UL>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>A Web-based parallel magazine, containing the same material as in the
print version, but using the facilities of the Web for enhanced accessibility,
is made available at the same time as the equivalent print issue.
The Web version also contains a wider range of material, to exploit
the lack of space limitations and the more varied audience who were able
to read it. 
</UL>

<P>The Web version is not the only freely available regular publication
for the Library, Information Science and Digital / Electronic libraries
communities. In the UK, for example, there is the Newsletter of resources
at Heriot-Watt <A HREF="#fn6">[6]</A>, the US, however, is the home of most
of the rest, including D-lib magazine <A HREF="#fn7">[7]</A>,
 PACS review <A HREF="#fn8">[8]</A>,
the Journal of Academic Media Librarianship <A HREF="#fn9">[9]</A>, LIBRES
<A HREF="#fn10">[10]</A>, the Katherine Sharp Review <A HREF="#fn11">[11]</A>
and several others. Some of these are peer-reviewed, some are not. All
have their own individual target audiences, styles and scope of content.
We originally hoped that Ariadne would not overlap significantly with any
of these publications; instead, we would seek to do collaborative work
and cross-publicity wherever possible. </P>

<P>Ariadne's overall goal originally broke down into the following roles: </P>

<UL>
<LI>disseminating relevant news of JISC-funded information services and eLib
developments to the UK HE community, and especially to those
people working within library and computer centres. A movement is underway
to converge such services, increasingly resulting in separate library/computing
facilities being replaced by one &quot;Information Resource Centre&quot;
in each University; the people in these centres form Ariadne's core audience.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>informing the target audience of a wide range of up to date and relevant
concepts, resources and technologies, in the fields of electronic library
research, networking and the use of IT in HE and libraries.
This would be through resource and service reviews, interviews with key
library or information science people, training tips, commissioned articles
and regular columnists. </UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>impartiality. Ariadne should not shy away from controversial issues,
nor be afraid to commission material that criticises itself, its funding
programme or other LIS services or resources. Examples of such material
are the review of BUBL <A HREF="#fn12">[12]</A>, the 
 right of reply taken up by the BUBL service <A HREF="#fn13">[13],</A> and John Lindsay's
article <A HREF="#fn14">[14]</A> on networking in the UK. </UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>liveliness. Where space permits, more offbeat material, such as a cartoon
<A HREF="#fn15">[15]</A> or an irreverent review of a conference trip <A HREF="#fn16">[16]</A>, 
 have been featured to lighten the tone of the publication. Fewer space  
 constraints in the Web version has meant that regular features
such as a popular caption competition <A HREF="#fn17">[17]</A> (which has
the added bonus of making people &quot;interact&quot; with Ariadne
when they submit entries) have been developed. 
</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>&quot;newsy-ness&quot;. Ariadne is not a peer-reviewed journal.
Instead, its nature sits somewhere between a newsletter and a magazine,
with a much shorter article turn-around time than a journal. For example,
most of the articles in the Web version are processed and made public within
2 or 3 weeks of the editor receiving such material. 
</UL>

<P>As the project has developed, so the audience has
grown to be more international, with many  people from the LIS communities
of other countries now reading the Web version. With this in mind, an additional role was added: </P>

<UL>
<LI>the web version should highlight the use of JISC-funded services, networks and network-based
technologies, especially those in HE and academic libraries,
to relevant organisations, academics, libraries and locations in the
world. As well as promoting developments in UK Electronic Library research
and usage, it is hoped that such dissemination will result in more international
collaboration with eLib projects and other network services and resources.

</UL>
<P>
<H3>The Ariadne Team: Opposite Corners, Common Goals</H3>

<P>Ariadne is produced in two institutions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>UKOLN <A HREF="#fn18">[18]</A> - the UK Office for Library and Information
Networking - this is based in the University of Bath, in the south west
area of England. The Web version is produced, mounted and maintained at
this location. The original staffing of a Web Editor and Co-director has
been recently bolstered by a proof reader/interviewer, and a technical
advisor who identifies potential Web-based technologies to incorporate
into the production or interface of Ariadne. </ul>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Information Services <A HREF="#fn19">[19]</A>, based in the University
of Abertay, Dundee, in the north east area of Scotland. The Print version
is produced and distributed from this location. 
 The original staffing of a Print Editor and Co-director/Managing
Editor has been recently bolstered by an administrative assistant. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In addition to the team, the project has an active editorial board of
16 people, who are all based in strategic positions, institutions, or services in the UK Library and
Information Science field. The roles of the editorial board are to commission
or write articles, interviews and reviews, to publicise Ariadne, and comment
on all matters of content, style and accessibility to the team. 
The members of the board
have been very active and enthusiastic in all of these roles, despite having
their own full-time jobs to contend with. 
For example, Emma Worsfold recently observed, through the
evening and night, a parallel Web version of an issue of the Daily Telegraph
<A HREF="#fn20">[20]</A> being produced for a future article in both versions of Ariadne. </P>

<P>None of the staff who work on Ariadne do so on a full-time basis;
this, combined with two groups based at diametrically opposed corners of
the country, makes physically meeting logistically and financially difficult.
Our usual approach is
to meet at conferences that most or all of us attend for some other reason,
though we have already had one (successful) experiment with video conferencing.
Because of the large costs involved, it has only been possible to have
one combined meeting of both camps and the editorial board to date; this produced many suggestions
regarding content and style which are being implemented in both the Print
and Web versions. We would hope, when the Mbone becomes easier to use,
more reliable and more widespread, to have regular editorial board meetings
using this, or some other video conferencing facility. </P>

<H2>Web Design: Access, Navigation, and Pretty Colours</H2>

<P>When the Web version of Ariadne was designed, with issue 1 in mind,
the main principle was simplicity. There were some 15 articles in the issue,
so a single level contents page was constructed. Graphics were kept as
simple as possible, as we were unsure of how much traffic Ariadne would
generate; simple icons and graphics, using the eLib colours of blues and
white, were constructed using PaintShop Pro. </P>

<P>By the time issue 4 was being constructed, the growth in size of the
Web version meant that reading the contents page, as indicated by feedback,
was time-consuming. In addition, links to non-article sections, such as
&quot;About Ariadne&quot; or the news section, were not clear.  A redesign
was due. </P>

<P>Each category of articles in Ariadne was given its own sub-menu. From
an individual article, the reader could jump to either the sub-menu, the
main menu, or one of the non-article sections via a set of icons to be found 
at the top and bottom of the article. If the article was in a regular column,
additional icons allowed the reader to move between the column in different
issues, without having to go through any content or issue menu's. A test
run of the new format indicated that the navigation was improved, but some
people still preferred having one contents page, no matter how long; therefore,
both the sub- menu and the one content page system were combined to form
the current menu-article structure. </P>

<P>The graphics were also redesigned to look more attractive, while at
the same time not being too large as to significantly slow down Web page
access. Rather than use pictorial icons, which run the risk of being unclear
or ambiguous, icons overlaid with textual descriptions were designed; see Figure 1. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="omni-example.gif" ALT="Example of how icons are used in an article" 
HEIGHT=478 WIDTH=782>
<BR>
<h5>Figure 1.  The top of an article, showing the navigation bar of icons</h5> </P></CENTER>

<P>Individual articles and menus are marked up in a deliberately simple
form of HTML for two reasons: </P>

<UL>
<LI>to make accessibility possible to as wide a variety of browsers (and
their differing versions) as possible </LI>

<LI>to make it easier for future technologies, such as style sheets, to
be used in page (re)design and construction </LI>
</UL>

<P>Several other changes have been made to the design of the Web version.
The two most common negative comments that have been received about articles
in this version is that: </P>

<UL>
<LI>it is unclear how to respond to an article </LI>

<LI>if an article is printed off, it loses some value in that hyperlinks
on a printout are useless </LI>
</UL>

<P>From issue 7, a large number of the discussion-oriented articles have
a response form clearly attached, where people could either send email
to the authors of the article directly, or send a comment to be published
as an article response. In addition, URLs are now explicitly referenced
in articles. As a point of principle on the equality of network and paper
based material, references to all kinds of resources (eg. Web, journal, book)  
are included in the same reference section.
</P>

<P>
From issue 1, Ariadne has contained a search facility <A HREF="#fn21">[21]</A>; however 
several problems have recently become apparent with said  
facility: </P>

<UL>
<LI>many readers searched Ariadne in an odd way; some people entered very
specific phrase-based queries, which nearly always resulted in no hits.
Some readers searched on very vague terms e.g. &quot;Web&quot;, while others
searched on irrelevant terms e.g. &quot;backrubs&quot;. Some notes on effective
searching have recently been added to the search page. </ul>
<p><ul>
<LI>searching is relatively slow. This is mainly due to the index and search
engine used, which is having difficulty coping with the recent growth in
size of Ariadne. Evaluation of potential replacement search engines is
underway; in the meantime, an alternative is offered, in that people can
search Index Morganagus through Ariadne; this is an index of 36 LIS resources,
including a recent index of Ariadne, which can be searched through one
form. 
</UL>

<P>As new developments with network-based deliverables emerge, we evaluate
the more promising examples to see if they can enhance navigation or general
accessibility, for the Ariadne reader. For example, we have experimented
with a Javascript pop-up window to add an extra method of navigation around
a single issue <A HREF="#fn22">[22]</A> of Ariadne. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="script.gif" ALT="Example of a Javascript application" HEIGHT=513 
WIDTH=709>
<BR>
<h5>Figure 2. Example of a Javascript pop-up menu, used to add navigational facilities</h5>
</P></CENTER>

<P>In addition, offering articles, or the whole issue, in a format different
 from HTML, needs to be investigated to see if any of our target audience
are better served by one of these formats. The increasing use of PDF as
an electronic journal delivery format <A HREF="#fn23">[23]</A> needs to
be monitored, though with issues of the (smaller) print version of Ariadne
being around a Megabyte in size in PDF format, there are obvious network implications.
</P>

<P>The main criteria of any such access-enabling technology is that it
should be relatively easy to use, add significantly to accessibility or
navigation, be inexpensive, and should not add significantly to the time
taken to produce an issue. </P>

<H2>Content</H2>

<P>Content for the Web version of Ariadne is obtained from the following
sources: </P>

<UL>
<LI>all of the material in each parallel Print issue is included in the
Web version. Occasionally, some of these articles are in an extended format,
which are indicated in their Web version. This material consists largely of interviews,
discussion articles and progress reports from three or four eLib projects.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>material produced by the editorial board - most of this goes in both
the print and Web versions. </ul>
<p><UL>
<LI>unsolicited material - a large amount of material, or ideas for material,
is emailed to the editor; for example, there were 109 ideas, or submissions of material,
in the two months before issue 5. 
However, most of this is undesirable,
 as it is often irrelevant material, thinly veiled adverts for products, or from people
describing very niche research which is not of interest to nearly all of
the target audience. 
Although a substantial amount of time is spent sifting through such
material and ideas to extract potential material, rarely do more
than three or four of these &quot;over the transom&quot; contributions
make it into an issue</UL> 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>regular columns 
 --- nine people now write columns for every issue of the Web version. These columnists cover a diverse 
array of issues, including
public library networking, electronic copyright, HTML development and accessibility
for the disabled, and new search engine developments. Some of the articles
from these regular contributors have appeared in other publications at
later dates. Regular columns have the advantage that they give Ariadne
some content stability; for example, many people interested in medical informatics
read the OMNI corner <A HREF="#fn24">[24]</A> column in every issue. </UL>
<p><UL>
<LI>articles commissioned by the Web editor, who periodically looks at
a range of sources for relevant material. These sources include deliverables
produced by other eLib projects, other IT or network based programmes or
projects in UK HE, high profile overseas Digital Library programmes, announcements
on key lists of new services or resources, and an occasional rummage through
lists of pointers to digital libraries resources and initiatives, such
as the excellent IFLA Digital Libraries resources and projects <A HREF="#fn25">[25]</A>
list.
</UL>

<P>In addition to the main articles, there are several other areas within
the Web version: </P>

<UL>
<LI>news - a small news section is maintained, through which news of eLib
and other electronic library developments are announced every week or fortnight.
</UL>
<p><UL>
<LI>checkout - this is a section of reviews of books and Web sites, most
of which are LIS related. Every print issue contains two reviews (with
more from issue 8); in addition, extra reviews that either were
too late for press, or were commissioned by the editor, are included in the Web version of Ariadne. </UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>about Ariadne - here, details of the background to Ariadne,
how to read it or submit article ideas, and who is involved in the project
are displayed. </UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>back issues - summary details of the main articles in each of the back
issues are available on one page. 
</UL>

<P>These areas are due for a review and a redevelopment, and so may be
different in style or content in a few months time. One problem we have
with any redevelopment is the permanence of URL's; as various Ariadne URL's
have been mentioned in the print media, and some people will have bookmarked
pages they wish to read at a future date, we have to be careful when redeveloping
the structure of the Web pages. </P>

<H2>Production Mechanisms</H2>

<P>When the first few issues of Ariadne were produced, the number of articles
 meant that time could be taken over article proof-reading, and
negotiating with the authors over changes. However, from issue 4 onwards, with
the increase in size of the Web version, the time required to produce an
issue has become an acute problem. </P>

<P>Despite not being a refereed journal, there still needs to be some element
of quality control, in terms of the content of articles, how each article
is constructed and how it is presented to the reader. How the various elements
that constitute an issue, such as articles, sub-menu's, multimedia files
and navigational controls, are checked and linked together, is also a quality control issue. 
</P>

<P>Articles that are not in the equivalent print version (and therefore
are already proof-read), from regular (trusted) columnists, or produced
in-house (e.g. the caption competition) are read to check for potential
copyright, slander, technical accuracy and irrelevance. In some
cases, articles are sent to editorial board members who specialise in the
relevant subject area for their comments; some articles are returned for
partial rewrites, or are rejected outright (though we do say to the author,
in fairness, why they are rejected). </P>

<P>When an article is deemed to be acceptable, it is put into an appropriate template
file. The article then
enters a &quot;proof dusting&quot; process, which has been updated for
the production run of the next issue. Proof dusting will now be a multi-stage
process of spell checking (twice, for errors that creep in during production),
HTML checking, and making essential grammar alterations. In addition,
the &quot;proof duster&quot;, having read the article, constructs a one-line
description of the article which is used as the article leader, and the link to the article from the main 
contents page and section menu.  
 The editor finishes the process by adding and checking any references. </P>

<P>Why &quot;proof dusting&quot;? One of the attractions emphasised to potential authors of material for 
Ariadne is that their work will be only lightly edited (with, of course, checks make for spelling, technical 
accuracy, grammar, copyright infringement, slander, and relevance). This is especially important in reviews, 
or discussion
articles, where very minor changes in words or structure can potentially have a large
effect on the overall tone of the article, and may not be to the author's liking. In addition, intense proof 
reading would result, with time limitations, in articles either having to be submitted
several months before publication, thus losing their immediacy and &quot;news
worthiness&quot;, or for a drastic reduction in the number of articles
accepted for publication; neither of these scenario's is compatible with
the aims of Ariadne. </P>

<P>As with evaluating technologies for their use in improving accessibility
or navigation to the reader, so we have to evaluate technologies that help
improve the quality and efficiency of issue production. For example, we
are currently evaluating &quot;Bobby&quot; <A HREF="#fn26">[26]</A>. This
is a validation system with a difference; the service, given a URL, checks
the associated Web page to see how compatible it is with Web browsers used
by the visually impaired. In addition, the page can be checked for compatibility
against a wide range of versions of popular browsers. The downside of this
service is that it is painfully slow to use, probably because of it's location
rather than any problems with the service itself. To use such a service
on all the articles in an issue of Ariadne would be very time consuming,
though we are considering obtaining the source code. Ideally, such a service
should be mirrored in the UK for easier evaluation of its usefulness. </P>

<H2>Publicity and Feedback</H2>

<P>Publicity of Ariadne is a vital task, more so when one of the criteria
is for Ariadne to help effect &quot;cultural change&quot; in Higher Education.
</P>

<H3>Publicising the Web version</H3>

<P>The Web version of Ariadne is publicised in several ways, including:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>through the parallel print version - this contains a section indicating
some of the articles to be found in the parallel Web version of the same
issue. In addition, the URL of Ariadne is emblazoned on top of the front
cover of every issue. Due to the limitations on space, the Print version
does not carry URLs for any of the articles or reviews, so people have
to visit the Web version for these, as well as for any extended-length
or Web-only articles. </UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>mailing lists - issues and major updates are advertised on three types
of mailing lists. Through the first two of these we hope to reach a substantial
number of librarians in UK Higher Education and libraries; the third type
allows us to promote Ariadne and JISC-funded services to a more global
audience, and hopefully to alert potential overseas partners and collaborators
to ongoing eLib work. <p></LI>
<OL>
<LI>large traffic-member library lists, such as lis-link <A HREF="#fn27">[27]</A>,
which is the main debating forum for academic librarians in the UK, lis-elib
<A HREF="#fn28">[28]</A> which is a debating forum and announcement board
for people interested in, or affected by, eLib, and the more global Web4Lib
<A HREF="#fn29">[29]</A> list for librarians interested in Web-related
issues. <P></LI>

<LI>speciality lists, dealing with e.g. public library networking, or electronic
copyright issues - individual articles by regular contributors are publicised
through several of these lists, partially in the hope that some of the
first-time readers will explore other parts of Ariadne. <P></LI>

<LI>national library mailing lists - using the Liszt <A HREF="#fn30">[30]</A>
index, about 20 mailing lists were discovered relating to electronic library
developments in other countries or continents. Discreet adverts for Ariadne
are occasionally put on these lists; surges in accesses from the regions
covered by the lists are often apparent. <P></ol>

<LI>internal mailing lists within library schools - every few issues, a
posting is sent to key people within various UK library schools, which
is forwarded to students on internal mailing lists. I personally see this
is as a crucial area where awareness of eLib, digital library developments,
network services and cultural changes needs to be raised, as these students
will be the ones using and teaching these services and practises inside
academic libraries in the future. 
</ul><P>
<ul>
<LI>conference announcements - conferences and workshops of a Library and
Information Science nature are not only a fertile environment to publicise
Ariadne, but also a good source of material for future articles and contributors.
Speakers at events are encouraged to use Ariadne as an example in their
presentations, where appropriate.</ul>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>other JISC-funded services - copies of the Print version of Ariadne
are often available at workshops run by the Netskills <A HREF="#fn31">[31]</A>
and SOSIG <A HREF="#fn32">[32]</A> eLib projects. This allows us to reach
various students and library staff who might otherwise &quot;slip through
the Ariadne publicity net&quot;.</UL><P> 
<UL>
<LI>editorial board - The members of the editorial board promote Ariadne
through their own institutions, jobs and work. As many of 
them have key strategic roles within the Library and Information Science
community, for example editing other LIS publications or organising/speaking
at relevant conferences, the board are a valuable means of publicising
Ariadne.
</UL>

<H3>Conscious feedback -- What we see and hear</H3>

<P>A lot of feedback is received about Ariadne in general, either through
email, or verbally at events. Unfortunately, rather less feedback is received
about individual articles, despite easy-to-use feedback forms being included
in several of the articles from issue 7 onwards. Feedback tends to come
from a core group of enthusiastic members of the HE library community,
and is mainly concerned with the overall content of Ariadne (usually,
though not always, such feedback is positive). 

A survey was also carried out in both the
print and Web versions which, though not producing a large response, was  
 still useful. The survey results, which concentrated
mainly on how much people liked individual sections in the print and Web
versions,
 editorial board comments and
other feedback have led to a minor reorganisation of the structure and
content of issue 8 of the print version (with a subsequent effect on the
&quot;common material&quot; in the parallel Web version). </P>

<P>Finding out where Ariadne has been mentioned has become an important
task, because of our nature as a Web-based magazine. There have been several
instances of print publications and list emails mentioning the Web version
of Ariadne. Complete with incorrect URL. We have managed
to work around some of these errors, by setting up new domain names (www.ariadne.ac.uk, for
example, currently points to the UKOLN home page, from which Ariadne is
clearly flagged), or dummy home pages. However, domains such as www.ariadne.edu,
we can do little about. Mentions of Ariadne are often indicated by a flurry
of emails or requests from related readers/organisations - for example,
several emails from Russia which recently arrived over a few days indicates
some probable mention of Ariadne in the former Soviet Union. </P>

<P>Links to Ariadne from prominent LIS sites no doubt help casual readers
to stumble across Ariadne, as well as raising its profile. By using the command 
link:http://ukoln.bath.ac.uk/ariadne/ in search engines such as AltaVista and Infoseek, it is to identify Web 
pages that have links to Ariadne. Pleasingly,
there are many of these, and they include prominent sites such as the Library
of Congress <A HREF="#fn33">[33]</A> and IFLA <A HREF="#fn25">[25]</A> resource
listings. </P>

<H3>Unwitting feedback - Web statistics analysis</H3>

<P>Some information on how readers navigate through Ariadne can be gathered
from analysis of the log file of accesses. For every file accessed in Ariadne,
be it an article, picture, icon or some other object, an entry in the log
file notes the date, time, file ID, client browser used and various other
information. However, the use of caches at either a national level (in
the UK, a significant number of file requests from academia are served
from the Hensa <A HREF="#fn34">[34]</A> cache), or at an organisational
level (such as a University or an Internet Service Provider), means that
many accesses to Ariadne are not recorded in our log file. Analysis
of the log file has to be undertaken with the caveat of these &quot;hidden
readers&quot; kept in mind; it is more therefore more accurate to usually
look for &quot;trends&quot; in any statistical analysis, rather than hard
numerical access statistics. This is very frustrating, as we cannot establish
exactly how many people in the UK HE and Library
communities read the Web version of Ariadne. </P>

<P>Several facts and trends do emerge from a cursory analysis; we have
logged accesses from over 100 countries; of these, substantial numbers
originate in the US, Australia, Canada, Scandinavia, Germany and the Netherlands.
42% of the logged accesses are from the UK; however, as a relatively large 
proportion of UK accesses are served by caches, the real proportion is
probably significantly higher. </P>

<P>In the near future, we will be starting to use one of the many Web statistical
analysis packages now available to carry out more detailed analysis of
the logged accesses. Several questions we hope to answer are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Does the order in which articles are listed affect which ones are read?
A slight, though not significant bias has been noticed towards articles
listed nearer the top of the contents page. This may be accounted for by
casual readers getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the style/content of Ariadne;
a much more significant effect on accesses occurs when individual articles
are mentioned on mailing lists - the &quot;AltaVista vs Lycos&quot; article
<A HREF="#fn35">[35]</A> from issue 2, referenced on several &quot;Web
searching&quot; discussion mailing lists, is the most accessed article
 across all issues of Ariadne by a considerable margin. </UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>Do a significant number of readers favour articles in certain sections?
Seeing if readers tend to read articles within a particular section, rather
than access articles across an issue in a seemingly random manner, may
indicate whether putting articles in particular sections (or whether the
criteria for the sections is correct) was a good idea. It would also be
interesting to see if a significant number of people, once they found an
article they liked, read articles by the same author/in the same column
in previous issues. </UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>What kind of articles do librarians and library school students tend
to read? Every file access in the log has some identification of which
machine requested the file. This identification often carries clues about
 where the machine is based; it is very likely that most of those identifiers
that contain the string <B>lib</B> are referring to accesses from libraries -
however, some such accesses will not have been made by librarians/library
students, while many librarian accesses will not contain this string. Despite
these compromises, analysis of which files were accessed by machines with this
identifying trait may still indicate what sort of content is more popular
with our target audience. 
</UL>
<p>
<H2>The Future: 1997 (The Year of Living Dangerously) and Beyond</H2>

<P>Ariadne was originally funded for two years, from the summers of 1995
to 1997. At the time of writing, this gives us only half a year under our
existing funding remit, which has forced us to ask the question: &quot;how
can you financially sustain a newsletter for the Library and Information
Science communities&quot;? To even start to answer this, we have to look
at the bigger picture. </P>

<P>The issue of future funding is set against an increasing backdrop of
political, economical and technological turbulence and uncertainty in the
United Kingdom. On the technological front, emerging bandwidth hungry applications,
such as the Mbone, the increase in student numbers
and the use of network-based technologies in mainstream academic research
and teaching are resulting in unprecedented demands on bandwidth, and for
hardware and software. Which costs money; a lot of money. On the political
and economic front, 1997 is election year, with the outcome uncertain;
the loser of our two main political parties seems likely to suffer
deep trauma and undergo fragmentation and/or coalitions with other parties.
However, the winner seems barely better off, with some painful choices
to make regarding tax, what gets funding in the public sector, and what
doesn't - the question is, how much of that pain will be borne by academia?
</P>

<P>Upshot: more money needed; less money available; much uncertainty. However,
amidst this uncertainty, a few facts can be stated with confidence: </P>

<UL>
<LI>In the next few years, network funding and charging mechanisms for
the UK academic environment will change. This, combined with the effects
of probably no increase, and possibly a decrease, in central funding for
academia, mean that how we access, use, maintain and perceive network based
technologies will change dramatically in a relatively short space of time.
</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>Commercialisation may become more involved in filling any funding gap.
This could involve private business running more of the infrastructure
and administration of the UK, or an increasing number of essential networked-information
providers charging for information, or the burden of funding shifting to
the student (customer?). For example, a student can currently access one
of a number of subject gateways and quickly locate a number of relevant
resources; but what of the near future? Being forced to watch a 4 minute
Java Applet-enabled advert? Or being asked for your credit card number
(&quot;Get UniversityCard today - 10 air miles with every subject search&quot;)?
</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>New charging mechanisms, new technologies, converged library and computing
services, new network-based resources - the learning curve of front-line
library / &quot;information resource centre&quot; staff will not level
out for the foreseeable future. Overheard at the enquiry desk of a UK University
library last week: &quot;I've found this book on the Net - it's exactly
what I need for my dissertation, but they want me to pay by credit card
- is it safe for me to type in my card number?&quot;. Overheard, again
in a University library, this week: &quot;My mate told me about this great
site with loads of stuff and pictures of bats you can get and print off
- I can't find it, where is it and how do I print off the pictures? My
coursework is due in 30 minutes&quot;. How many front-line staff in your
University library have the skills to answer these questions? How many
will soon need these skills? 
</UL>

<P>This isn't just cultural change; like it or not, it's cultural revolution.
</P>

<P>For Ariadne, this cultural revolution is a curate's egg. First, the
bad parts; how does the Web version of Ariadne, and other similar types of publication, get funding to 
continue?
What are some of the alternative possibilities to a centrally-funding scenario?
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Advertising: Adverts on the Web? Tricky - being dedicated to the Library
and Information Science communities drastically reduces the number of potential
clients. Many clients who would be interested in our audience would, if
they advertised in Ariadne, instil a suspicion of loss of editorial impartiality
or independence in that same audience. </UL>
<UL><P>
<LI>Payment: This could take many forms; Universities as a whole could
pay a flat fee, or people could be charged to download versions of individual
articles; more complex, multi-level payment systems, such as that suggested
 in a previous D-Lib article <A HREF="#fn36">[36]</A> are also possibilities. But how much of the
audience (both at an institutional and an individual level) would be repulsed,
disenfranchised, or not think it worth the cost, of paying for a product
they are used to accessing online for free? The experiences of several
other Web-based journals <A HREF="#fn37">[37]</A> do not bode well. </UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>Product spin-off: Ariadne the CD-ROM (a collection of articles from
several issues)? Ariadne the book (a collection of the best articles, converted
 [some might think perversely] from original Web to Print)? Again, sufficient
institutions or individuals would have to put hand in pocket and pay for
it. </UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>Merger: Ariadne merges with another project, or resource, which has
mutually compatible aims and audiences; an international merger, to produce
a more global electronic library developments newsletter / dissemination
resource is more exciting, but presents additional problems. Also, though
merging is one possibility, it doesn't actually address the issue of where
the dollars come from to pay for issue production. 
</UL><P><UL>
<LI>Benefactor: A kindly library school, university or company takes us
under their wing and provides funding. Less likely to happen in academia
(see aforementioned gloom on funding); more likely in the commercial world.
As with advertising, there are problems with the perception of content
independence. 
</UL>

<P>All of the options above have disadvantages - the first three would
require a significant amount of extra administration, possibly bigger than
the current project (remember, Ariadne currently consists of a few part-time
staff; a marketing department would be a significant development). Overall,
there would seem to be a trade-off between making people or organisations
pay to access Ariadne, and the perceived or real editorial independence
of such a publication. </P>

<P>To complicate matters, there is the relationship with the Print version;
how should that be funded? Differently? Not at all (i.e. by revenue brought
in by the Web version)? And how does the content interchange between both
versions alter - should they be completely different versions? Or become
completely identical? Or the Web version offer &quot;tasters&quot; (snippets)
of material in the Print version? </P>

<P>To complicate matters further, what are the other LIS publications of
a similar nature up to? Are any of them duplicating to a large degree what
we cover (current answer: occasionally, in some sub-areas, but never frequently)?
Will someone in the UK launch a &quot;rival&quot;, free, Web-based publication
for the academic LIS communities, covering the same sub-subject fields
(current answer: who knows)? Deciding on the best strategy, in terms of
acceptable funding (for our audience, and for us to sustain Ariadne), editorial
independence, change of content, style and produce delivery and change
of interaction between the Web and Print versions is very much a &quot;non-trivial&quot;
task. </P>

<P>But what of the good parts of the curate's egg? Well, journalists say
that &quot;no news is bad news&quot;, and with the cultural revolution
we find ourselves stuck in, there is no problem for the foreseeable future
in finding relevant, useful content for our core and greater audiences.
Sitting down every week and thinking &quot;what's happening in the digital
library movement&quot;, looking at what is announced and what people have
submitted, the problems are not trying to flesh out Ariadne, but deciding
what to include, what is relevant and useful now, and what will be relevant
and useful in the near-future. This is good; we have a purpose, and we
have content. </P>

<P>What of the future? As many eLib projects (and perhaps Ariadne) start
to emerge from under the blanket of eLib funding, blinking and groping
in the harsh and brightly lit world of self-funding autonomy, one lesson
most will learn is that evolution does not end with eLib funding. System
development, transfer of technologies, responding to rapidly changing audience/customer
requirements and demographics; all of these will be ongoing and unending.

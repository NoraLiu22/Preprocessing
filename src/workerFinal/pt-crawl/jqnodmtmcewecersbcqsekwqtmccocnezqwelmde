  <h1 class="page-title">GDPR Compliance Statement</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The General Data Protection Regulation is a complex EU regulation that stipulates many points for protecting private data of
    users on the Internet. Even though this is an EU regulation, it has a worldwide impact due to the nature of the Internet.
    The MetaBrainz Foundation with its collection of projects is also affected by this regulation. We’ve been learning and adapting
    our sites to be compliant with the GDPR – sadly this regulation isn’t entirely black and white and there is an incredible
    amount of room left for interpretation of these rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    The good news is that this regulation is roughly in line with our established practices: We’ve always held private information
    in a high regard and applied the sort of rules to ourselves as we wish to have our own private data treated. Luckily, this
    makes our compliance effort considerably easier. We’ve made two significant changes to how we treat your data and also adopted
    terminology as used in the GDPR in order to use the same languages that many other sites are now adopting. Please keep reading
    to find out the exact details of what we are doing to comply.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we do ask for your compassion and help in our process of complying with the GDPR. As we already mentioned, the GDPR is
    a complex set of rules that are not fully clarified yet. We’ve taken action on the steps that are clear to us and we’re following
    ongoing conversations on points that are in gray zones or unclear to us. We’ve made our best initial effort on compliance and
    promise to keep working on it as the picture becomes more clear. If you believe that we could improve our compliance, please
    <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and let us know what we can do to improve. It would also help us if you
    could provide concrete discussion or examples to help us understand and take action on your suggestion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, below are the key sections of the GDPR as we understand them and how they affect your data in our ecosystem. Where
    possible, we provide links for deeper understanding, links for you to examine our relevant code and links to tickets to follow
    the process of improving our compliance.
  </p>

  <h2>Right to be forgotten</h2>

  <p>
    Summary: <i>Provide the user with the ability to remove their private data from our services</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most important aspect of the right to be forgotten is the ability to delete your account. Once you request for us to delete
    your account, we will remove any personally identifying information you may have provided us from your account (name, email
    address, gender, biography, URL, etc.). The visible name on your account will be changed to “Deleted User #####” and effectively
    the account will no longer be identifiable as your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, given the nature of our projects where we work on collaborative databases, your contributions that are not personally
    identifying are valuable assets to our database and these contributions will not be removed from our databases. But we will
    ensure that these contributions no longer contain personally identifying data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our process of automatically deleting your accounts across the MetaBrainz ecosystem is not complete yet (see below for a set of
    tickets where you can track our progress). If you would like to delete your accounts in the MetaBrainz ecosystem or mark a
    donation that is currently public as a private donation, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
    and we will address your request as soon as possible.

         <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/CB-307">CritiqueBrainz</a>.
     </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Restriction of processing</h2>

  <p>
    Summary: <i>To allow the user to control how their personally identifying data is being used.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Except for the ListenBrainz and AcousticBrainz projects, we do not process personally identifying data. Any personally
    identifying data that our projects store is for the purpose of being able to contact you about your contributions to our database
    (email address) or for voluntarily showing information about you to other users (biography, homepage, location, etc).
  </p>
  <p>
    The ListenBrainz project differs in that the Listens (metadata about what music you have listened to) are stored on our servers
    and <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/data">made available to the public</a>. We believe Listens to be personally identifying
    data and furthermore, we have goals of creating open source recommendation engines with this data, which involves processing the
    user’s data. These two points are fundamental goals of the ListenBrainz project and we do not see a reasonable way to reach another
    compromise position.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, we are going to require users to either acknowledge that we may process their Listen data or alternatively to
    delete their account, including all of their Listens. Please note that if you decide to delete your ListenBrainz account, it may
    take up to two weeks for all of your listens to no longer be included in our efforts to build a recommendation engine. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We have always made it clear that the data in ListenBrainz was to be public and that we plan to build new tools with your data, so
    this should not come as a surprise to our users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AcousticBrainz project does not track who submits data to the database. If you create an account and use our data creation
    tools (e.g. create a dataset or participate in a challenge) then we link your participation and the things that you create to
    your account. If you choose to delete your account then we keep the non personally identifying data that you create, but anonymize
    it so that it cannot be linked back to you.
  </p>

  <h2>Right to data portability / exporting your data</h2>

  <p>
    Summary: <i>You have the right to access/download the data we store about you</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Except for the ListenBrainz and AcousticBrainz projects, we do not store personally identifying data beyond the
    information that is available in your public profile on each of our projects. Since this data is plainly available in your
    profile we do not provide a means for you to export this data.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are the following exceptions to this:
  </p>
  <ul>
     <li>
        <b>IP addresses</b>: If you visit one of our sites the IP address of your computer is stored in our web logs for 7 days
        before our servers automatically delete them. This data is almost never used by anyone: the only time we look at the
        IP addresses is if our sites are adversely impacted by the actions of some unknown users. In that case, we may investigate
        the logs to identify the IP address that needs to be blocked in order to restore the stability of our service.
        This data is not available to anyone but the contractors of the MetaBrainz Foundation and is not available to download
        to anyone at all.
     </li>
     <li>
        <b>ListenBrainz Listen data</b>: Users may <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/profile/export">export their ListenBrainz Listen
        data</a> directly from the site. The user Listen data is also included in the <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/data">ListenBrainz
        data dumps</a> that are available for public download.
     </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All of the non personally identifying data, such as your metadata contributions, are publicly visible, available for download
    and available via the project APIs. For details about this data, downloads and APIs please check the documentation for the
    respective projects you are interested in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyone wishing to get a list of financial donations they have made to the MetaBrainz Foundation, please
    <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and provide your MusicBrainz editor name so that we can look up
    your donations.
  </p>

  <h2>Right to rectification</h2>

  <p>
    Summary: <i>You have the right to correct your data</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of our projects allow their users to update their personally identifying information in their profiles. Furthermore, most
    of our projects allow the editing of their own metadata contributions. If you find that some of your data is incorrect, please
    feel free to edit the data since we provide the tools to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    If anyone who has made a financial donation to the MetaBrainz Foundation would like to make their donation private, please
    <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Right to be informed</h2>
  <p>
    Summary: <i>You have the right to be informed about how we use your data in plain English</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our privacy policy, as well as other policies, have always been written by humans for human consumption. We abhor legalese and
    not speaking in direct terms.

  <h2>Right to access</h2>

  <p>
    Summary: <i>You have the right to access the data that we collect about you</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of our projects make all of the data we collect on your behalf, privately identifying or not, available to you. The
    only exception to this are the IP addresses we store for 7 days – see above for details.

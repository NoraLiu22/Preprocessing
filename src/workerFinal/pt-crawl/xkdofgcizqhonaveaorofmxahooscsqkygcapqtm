<P>Among the Pomoman&ouml; of the island of Pomo'ua in Micronesia, there
arose in the early seventies a heated debate about where their ancestors
had come from. Fu Kow, at the time an ambitious and talented young man,
did a detailed and extensive study demonstrating convincingly that the
popular belief that they had come in boats was most vociferously upheld
and propagated by the families and friends of the boat builders. Although
the study refrained from drawing any explicit conclusions, it was clearly
in the cards that the old doctrine served no nobler purpose than to boost
the social standing of this already highly privileged group of people,
from which Pomo'ua's leaders were routinely drawn. From then on, any such
claim, even if not made by a boat builder or any of his friends and family,
was looked upon with great suspicion, and became the subject of entertaining
tales at the beach-side bonfire gatherings that was the mainstay of Pomomam&ouml;
social life. Soon it was nearly impossible to claim that the ancestors
had arrived on the island by boat, and the ancient craft of boat building
fell into such disrepute that young people frequently abandoned their parents'
profession and took the lead in denouncing the ancient boat-building elite.
In the 70s and mid-80s, whole families not only willingly abandon their
livelihood but collectively joined in the communal boat-burnings, which
came to mark its instigators most convincingly as true men of the people,
gaining them access to the choisiest bits of roast pig during the festivals.

<P>Of course, living on a relatively small island, totally abstaining from
using a boat was both impracticable and tedious, even for the most virtuous
of the Pomomam&ouml;. However, it was considered good practice to poke
one or several small holes in the boat every time you went out, to signal
that you despised the very vehicle you depended on. These continually punctured
boats were still usable, but making a trip in one became primarily a means
of public display--ideally, a tall jet of water would be visible above
the rim of the boat as you paddled, as a way of making a political statement.
A new fashion arose of building extremely elaborate and stately boats out
of the most unlikely material, or according to the most novel principles,
and putting them out to sea during the evening feasts. The reformed builder
would then pretend to be going somewhere in it, while everyone on the beach
would be watching and applauding as it pitifully sank, thus establishing
beyond any doubt that the boat builder had thoroughly dissociated himself
from the oppressive and deluded regime of his self-serving predecessors.
The whole field of boat building became performative rather than practical,
a mode of display rather than a mode of conveyance.

<P>The puzzle of how their ancestors had in fact come here, it was further
argued by Fu Kow's follower Ri Da, was itself an issue that would only
be posed by a boat builder--the question itself was wrong. The whole notion
of an 'ancestor' that had 'come' was part and parcel of the tissue of stories
the old elite had constructed to bolster their position. Since they had
been dominant for so long, Ri Da acknowledged it was almost impossible
not to think in their way; however, was it necessary to think in any particular
way at all? The people on the beach were having a great time, and the old
'ancestralism' debate itself was thoroughly discredited.

<P>Occasional visitors from the neighboring islands, including the traders
that supplied the island with highly-prized pigs, found the Pomomam&ouml;'s
behavior puzzling and paradoxical, but on the whole they minded their own
business. Na&iuml;ve and thoughtful critics alike, in any event, were dismissed
with a shrug, since it was glaringly obvious that the very means by which
they had come was highly suspect, and even if they did not realize it themselves,
that fact alone made them errand boys of the old dispensation. The visitors,
finding the ears of the Pomomam&ouml; no more attuned to their words than
the shells on the beach, traded their pigs, loaded their coconuts, and
paddled home. Tales of boat-burnings and hole-punching soon made the rounds
of their own beach-side bonfire feasts.

<P>Only once did one of them decide to play the Pomomam&ouml; a trick.
So Ka had been listening to Pomomam&ouml; stories for years, frequently
participating in their feasts. He was just as enthusiastic as the locals
when it came to celebrating their liberation from the stuffy boat-builder
elite of old. Recently, however, some daring story tellers had begun attacking
the pig traders, claiming that their boats were just as full of holes,
and that they really served no other purpose than to show off and perhaps
even intimidate. For So Ka, who prided himself on the tradition of boat
building that allowed him to cross the large body of open water between
the islands, this was going too far, and because he did not want their
cause to be entirely discredited among the other islands, he set about
to teach them a lesson.

<P>Whenever he could, he would join in the feasts and listen to the latest
story tellers describe how his own people built boats--not in accordance
with some obscure principle of "waves" and "ocean", but according to personal
quirks and interests, social prejudices, fortuitous events, and the desire
to curry favor with the big chiefs. Working secretly, So Ka built a great-looking
boat, using materials from his own island, but putting them together in
the Pomomam&ouml; way. When he explained that his own people had come to
realize that their boats were social constructions, just as the Pomomam&ouml;
said, the local chiefs of one of the festivals agreed to let him perform
the boat, treating him, with some misgivings, as an honored guest from
another island who had seen the truth of the Pomomam&ouml; way. On the
day of the feast, however, So Ka invited people from the other islands
too, telling them in confidence that he was just making fun of the story-tellers,
to shame them. Just when the Pomomam&ouml; were shouting their approval
for his wonderful expos&eacute; of the pig-traders' false boat-building
pretensions, he told everybody how silly and ridiculous they were to think
one could trade pigs in a boat like that.

<P>That day and in the following weeks, the Pomomam&ouml; were the laughing
stock of all the islands, and many lost no time in denying they had ever
thought you could trade pigs in boats like theirs. Some of them are starting
to study the craft of boat-making again, but most people appear to feel
the ways they have become accustomed to are more fun. Though worried at
times they will run out of pigs, the Pomomam&ouml; continue to throw great
parties.

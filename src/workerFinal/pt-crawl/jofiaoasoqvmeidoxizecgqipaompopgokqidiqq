</p>

<p>
In the DLGrid project supported by <a href="http://www.mellon.org/" target="_blank">The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>  we plan to enhance key infrastructure components of the OAI (<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_blank">Open Archives Initiative</a>) framework by building a 'Grid' of digital libraries and a cluster computer to support a high performance OAI-federated search service. The <a href="http://www.grid.org/home.htm" target="_blank">Grid</a> is an emerging technology for infrastructure that enables the integrated, collaborative use of high-end computers, networks, and databases owned by multiple organizations. Recently, there has been interest in using the Grid for managing large data sets by creating and storing descriptive metadata, which is used for discovery [<a href="#Sin03">Sin03</a>].  
</p>

<p>
Google does an incredible job at providing discovery services of the 'shallow' web' to the general public; we envision a similar quality, sustainable, free discovery service for students and researchers for parts of the 'deep' web [<a href="#Berg01">Ber01</a>].  The parts of the deep web we refer to in this vision are digital libraries and collections that are exposing their metadata using OAI-PMH (Protocol for Metadata Harvesting). A high performance federated search service that exploits the resources of a Grid will make available a large amount of information that is distributed amongst heterogeneous digital libraries.  A search user will be able to access a research paper, preprint, a technical report, an image of a renowned painting, or a musical performance in a few seconds from thousands of libraries scattered all over the world.
</p>

<p>
Assuming that a rapid increase (e.g., several orders of magnitude) in the adoption of OAI-PMH occurs, we now have a different problem:  how to efficiently discover, harvest and index the burgeoning OAI-PMH corpus.  Since grid nodes by definition have unused capacity, no new hardware needs to be acquired and we can, in essence, piggyback the onus of maintaining the infrastructure on the efforts to maintain the Grid. The second advantage of this approach is availability of the service. The current <a href="http://arc.cs.odu.edu/" target="_blank">Arc</a>, a service federating existing OAI data providers,  is running on a single processor without any redundancy and it has rapidly deteriorated over the last year in performance due to an increase in the number of archives it harvests. In the new approach, we plan to use hardware redundancy by exploiting the Grid technology for harvesting. For searching, we plan to exploit parallelism by partitioning the indices amongst a cluster of PCs. A user query will be executed in parallel across these partitions resulting in high performance. For supporting parallel indexing and searching, we will extend the open source Apache Jakarta Lucene search engine.
</p>


<p>
This project has just started and is expected to be completed with a dozen gridnodes in a feasibility testbed that will harvest the current Arc members and a search cluster of 16 nodes that will provide parallel indexing and query merging. More details can be found at our ODU DL research group site (<a href="http://dlib.cs.odu.edu" target="_blank">http://dlib.cs.odu.edu</a>) under the DLGrid project.

<p>
Lawpaths (<a href="http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/lawpaths/default.htm" target="_blank">http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/lawpaths/default.htm</a>) is a three year project (2002-2005) funded by the JISC (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/</a>) under the Exchange for Learning (X4L) programme (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=programme_x4l" target="_blank">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=programme_x4l</a>). Lawpaths intends to provide a resource bank of legal information skills materials such as tutorials, workbooks and pathfinders for use by law librarians and law teachers. 
</p>

<p>
Lawpaths' project partners are the University of Kent, the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies and the UK Centre for Legal Education, in collaboration with the University of Bristol, Cardiff University and the Institute for Learning and Research Technology. The project director, Sarah Carter, is law librarian at the University of Kent. 
</p>

<p>
In Higher Education (HE) institutions, law librarians are required to teach students legal information skills, which enable students to conduct legal research. In Further Education (FE), librarians or law teachers may undertake this instruction. In particular, students face the problem of knowing which of the many available law resources (hard copy and electronic) to select. Law librarians and law teachers have been creating legal information skills guides (e.g., how to locate cases) for students locally; effectively their efforts are being duplicated as staff around the country are creating similar types of guides. These guides may be in hard copy, or increasingly, in electronic format. They need to be updated frequently, as the currency of legal information is vital, which is time consuming, Further, law librarians may themselves not have a legal background, so they will have to acquire legal knowledge. In many institutions, librarians may also have responsibility for other subjects, as well as law. 
</p>

<p>
Lawpaths will support the teaching of legal information skills by providing a resource bank of legal information skills guides. The materials are aimed at law librarians and law teachers in HE and, to a lesser extent, FE. The project will explore the potential to make these materials customisable so that institutions can adapt them for use within their local learning environments. Customisation could include inserting institutional logos or details of local holdings and subscriptions. This will reduce the need for law librarians and law teachers to produce guides themselves. 
</p>

<p>
The resource bank of guides will be freely accessible through a searchable database (currently in development) on the Lawpaths website. A user community database is also being developed; users of Lawpaths' resources will be required to register on this. We anticipate the user community database will have three benefits. Firstly, registered users will be sent updates on Lawpaths. Secondly, the project will be able track user statistics, which will allow us to evaluate and remodel our service accordingly. Thirdly, we hope that users themselves will contribute guides they consider to demonstrate good practice in teaching legal information skills. 
</p>

Finally, electronic datasets, such as LexisNexis and Westlaw, are important resources for law students. Many of the legal information skills guides produced locally by law librarians and law teachers that we found through our research were guides to such services. Lawpaths has approached the service providers of three legal datasets to create guides to their products. These would be freely available, maintained by the services providers and accessible without needing to access the datasets. The response from the service providers has been encouraging so far. Our research amongst the user community in HE, in particular, indicates that this development would be a significant output from the Lawpaths project.

<p>
The SURF Foundation has awarded funding to the 'Community website for SCHOLAR(S)' project of the Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA).  This is a result of a competitive call for tender for service projects of the national Dutch DARE (Digital Academic Repositories) initiative. See the SURF/DARE website: &lt;<a href="http://www.surf.nl/en/themas/index2.php?oid=7" target="_blank">http://www.surf.nl/en/themas/index2.php?oid=7</a>&gt;.
</p>
 
<p><b>A community website for scholars</b><br>
The project will develop a community website for a research institute based on the Open Archives model.  The community website has a national and international ambition and will consist of a publication site that will bring together the relevant scholarly publications for that specific community.  The community website will also offer services such as research news, a discussion platform, an overlay journal with an editorial board and a portal to relevant bibliographical databases.  The goal of the project is to arrive at a model that can be used by a variety of research communities.
</p>
 
 
<p><b>A community website for SCHOLAR</b><br>
The project has been set up in collaboration with the research program SCHOLAR at the Faculty of Economics and Econometrics (UvA).  The SCHOLAR group conducts research on the match between schooling and the labor market in a context of life-long learning.  The SCHOLAR research program is directed by Prof. Dr. Henriette Maassen van den Brink and started in 1997 as a Priority Program of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). SCHOLAR has become an internationally reknown research group that includes about 20 researchers.           
Researchers from the Tinbergen Institute (Erasmus University Rotterdam, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit), SEO Amsterdam Economics (Universiteit van Amsterdam) and the Labour research group of the Vrije Universiteit who are active within the SCHOLAR research area will also participate in the community website project.

<H4>Digital Preservation Program Launches Research Grants Initiative</H4>

<p><b><i>Library of Congress Partners with National Science Foundation to Fund Advanced Research into Preservation of Digital Materials</i></b></p>

<p>&quot;The National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program of the Library of Congress (NDIIPP) is partnering with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish the first research grants program to specifically address the preservation of digital materials. NSF will administer the program, which will fund cutting-edge research to support the long-term management of digital information.This effort is part of the Library's collaborative program to implement a national digital preservation strategy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'One of the most critical issues we face in the preservation of digital materials is a need for better technology and methods to manage these objects over long periods of time,' said Associate Librarian for Strategic Initiatives Laura E. Campbell, who is directing this initiative for the Library. 'We are very pleased to be working with the National Science Foundation to encourage important research breakthroughs. This will help the Library of Congress, as well as our network of partners who are working with us, to preserve America's digital heritage for future generations.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The research program announcement coincides with the signing today of a memorandum of understanding between the Library of Congress and NSF to collaborate over the next decade in a broad set of research activities related to digital libraries and digital archives. The formalized collaboration arose from a joint Library of Congress and NSF workshop in April 2002 that developed a research agenda in these areas. Through their leadership, NSF and the Library will encourage other government agencies to continue research support for improving the state of knowledge and practice of digital libraries and digital archiving.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The new Digital Archiving and Long-Term Preservation research program, which expects to make approximately $2 million in initial awards using NDIIPP funds, has three main focus areas for which proposals are sought:</p>

   <ul>
	<li>Digital repository models</li>
	<li>Tools, technologies and processes</li>
	<li>Organizational, economic and policy issues.</li>
</ul>


<p>The NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, will issue a call for proposals shortly; check the NSF Web site at &lt;<a href="http://www.cise.nsf.gov/div/index.cfm?div=iis" target="_blank">http://www.cise.nsf.gov/div/index.cfm?div=iis</a>&gt; for current information.&quot;</p>

<H4>Library of Congress Announces Joint Digital Preservation Project with Four Universities</H4>

<p><b><i>Library to Work with Old Dominion, Johns Hopkins, Stanford and Harvard Universities</i></b></p>

<p>June 9, 2004 - &quot;The Library of Congress has entered into a joint digital preservation project with Old Dominion University, Department of Computer Science; The Johns Hopkins University, Sheridan Libraries; Stanford University Libraries &amp; Academic Information Resources; and Harvard University Library to explore strategies for the ingest and preservation of digital archives. The project is supported by Information Systems Support Inc.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Archive Ingest and Handling Test (AIHT), is designed to identify, document and disseminate working methods for preserving the nation's increasingly important digital cultural materials, as well as to identify areas that may require further research or development. The AIHT is part of an initiative, led by the Library of Congress, to build a network of preservation partners through the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;
The AIHT participants are investigating and applying various digital preservation strategies, using a digital archive donated to the Library by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. The archive is a collection of 57,000 digital images, text, audio and video related to the Sept. 11, 2001 events. The transfer of these 12 gigabytes of digital content is being used to emulate the problems that arise in digital preservation and to test possible solutions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Participants in the AIHT range from fully operational repositories to an advanced research project investigating methods for preserving digital objects; additionally one institution is comparing multiple technical solutions within one environment. A broad array of current open-source and proprietary digital-object management and preservation technologies are deployed in the test....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...At the end of the 12-month test, the Library and its partners will publish a final report detailing both current practices for digital preservation and future areas of research. Further information about the project will be posted periodically at &lt;<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov" target="_blank">http://www.digitalpreservation.gov</a>&gt;.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information, please see the press release at &lt;<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/about/pr_060904.html" target="_blank">http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/about/pr_060904.html</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>&quot;The ISO MPEG Rights Data Dictionary (RDD) provides the basis for a resource to create widely understood, consistent meaning for Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems. The RDD will be available to all those involved in building and deploying DRM systems to ensure that the terms used in permissions granted by the systems can be interpreted consistently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The RDD specification is intended to support the ISO MPEG Rights Expression Language. Together, the two standards equip the DRM world with interoperable ways of expressing rules and interoperable ways of communicating the meaning of these rules. This is to the benefit of rights holders, who can be confident that business rules can be interpreted consistently and to consumers, who can be sure that usage permissions will not vary unpredictably across different systems. Manufacturers can also benefit because their systems can interoperate without detailed negotiation on the interpretation of permissions.&quot;</p>

<H4>Elsevier permits postprint archiving</H4>

<p>June 2, 2004 - Excerpt from <i>SPARC Open Access Newsletter</i>, Issue 74. &quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In a May 27 email to Stevan Harnad, Karen Hunter announced an important change of policy at Elsevier.  The world's largest publisher of scientific and scholarly journals now permits postprint archiving.   Elsevier authors may now provide open access to the final editions of their full-text articles by posting them to their personal web sites or their institutional repositories.  They may not deposit them to repositories elsewhere.  The archived or OA edition must be author-made, not Elsevier's PDF or HTML, and must include a link either to the journal's home page or the article's DOI.  Hunter is Elsevier's Senior Vice President for Strategy....&quot;</p>

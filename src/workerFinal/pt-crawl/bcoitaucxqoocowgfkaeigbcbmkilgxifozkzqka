understanding and, anxious forits own perfection, strives with all its might to discover the causes ofthe amazing events.&nbsp; For there is within the human mind an innatedesire to seize on goodness and truth....<p>To attain this end we have listened to the opinions of many modern expertson astrology and medicine about the causes of the epidemic which has prevailedsince 1345....<p>We, the masters of the faculty of medicine at Paris ... have decidedto compile, with God's help, a brief compendium of the distant and immediatecauses of the present universal epidemic ... and of wholesome remedies;drawing on the opinions of the most brilliant ancient philosophers andmodern experts, astronomers as well as doctors of medicine....<p>We say that the distant and first cause of this pestilence was and isthe configuration of the heavens.&nbsp; In 1345, at one hour after noonon 20 March, there was a major conjunction of three planets in Aquarius.&nbsp;This conjunction, along with other earlier conjunctions and eclipses, bycausing a deadly corruption of the air around us, signifies mortality andfamine....<p>Aristotle testifies that this is the case in his book <i>Concerningthe causes of the properties of the elements</i>, in which he says thatmortality of races and the depopulation of kingdoms occur at the conjunctionof Saturn and Jupiter, for great events then arise, their nature dependingon the trigon in which the conjunction occurs....<p align="center"><b>Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter (1300-1490)</b><center><table BORDER=0

in ahot, wet sign, as was the case in 1345.&nbsp; For Jupiter, being wet andhot, draws up evil vapors from the earth and Mars, because it is immoderatelyhot and dry, then ignites the vapors, and as a result there were lightnings,sparks, noxious vapors and fires throughout the air.<p>These effects were intensified because Mars -- a malevolent planet, breedinganger and wars -- was in the sign of Leo from 6 October 1347 until the endof May this year, along with the head of the dragon, and because all thesethings are hot they attracted many vapors; which is why the winter wasnot as cold as it should have been.&nbsp; And Mars was also retrogradeand therefore attracted many vapors from the earth and sea which, whenmixed with the air, corrupted its substance.</td>

<td><p>Mars was also looking upon Jupiter with a hostile aspect, that is tosay quartile, and that caused an evil disposition or quality in the air,harmful and hateful to our nature.&nbsp; This state of affairs generatedstrong winds ... which gave rise to excess heat and moisture on the earth;although in fact it was the dampness which was most marked in our partof the world.&nbsp; And this is enough about the distant or universal causefor the moment.<p>Although major pestilential illnesses can be caused by the corruptionof water or food, as happens at times of famine and infertility, yet westill regard illnesses proceeding from the corruption of the air as muchmore dangerous.&nbsp; This is because bad air is more noxious than foodor drink in that it can penetrate quickly to the heart and lungs to doits damage.&nbsp; We believe that the present epidemic or plague has arisenfrom air corrupt in its substance and not changed in its attributes.&nbsp;By which we wish it be understood that air, being pure and clear by nature,can only become putrid or corrupt by being mixed with something else, thatis to say, with evil vapors.<p>What happened was that the many vapors which had been corrupted at thetime of the conjunction were drawn up from the earth and water, and werethen mixed with the air and spread abroad by frequent gusts of wind inthe wild southerly gales, and because of these alien vapors which theycarried, the winds corrupted the air in its substance, and are still doingso.&nbsp; And this corrupted air, when breathed in, necessarily penetratesto the heart and corrupts the substance of the spirit there and rots thesurrounding moisture, and the heat thus caused destroys the life force,and this is the immediate cause of the present epidemic.<p>And moreover these winds, which have become so common here, have carriedamong us ... bad, rotten and poisonous vapors from elsewhere:&nbsp; fromswamps, lakes and chasms, for instance, and also (which is even more dangerous)from unburied or unburnt corpses -- which might well have been a cause ofthe epidemic.&nbsp; Another possible cause of corruption, which needs tobe borne in mind, is the escape of the rottenness trapped in the centerof the earth as a result of earthquakes -- something which has indeed recentlyoccurred.&nbsp; But the conjunctions could have been the universal anddistant cause of all these harmful things, by which air and water havebeen corrupted....<p>We must ... emphasize that although, because everyone has to breathe,everyone will be at risk from the corrupted air, not everyone will be madeill by it but only those, who will no doubt be numerous, who have a susceptibilityto it; and very few indeed of those who do succumb will escape.<p>The bodies most likely to take the stamp of this pestilence are thosewhich are hot and moist, for they are the most susceptible to putrefaction.&nbsp;The following are also more at risk:&nbsp; Bodies bunged up with evil humors,because the unconsumed waste matter is not being expelled as it should;those following a bad life style, with too much exercise, sex and bathing;the thin and weak, and persistent worriers; babies, women and young people;and corpulent people with a ruddy complexion.&nbsp; However those withdry bodies, purged of waste matter, who adopt a sensible and suitable regimen,will succumb to the pestilence more slowly.</td>  </tr></table><center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="600" ><tr>  <td>&nbsp; </td></tr><tr><td

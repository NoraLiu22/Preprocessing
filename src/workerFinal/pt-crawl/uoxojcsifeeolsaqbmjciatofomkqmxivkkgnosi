    <b>I have prepared this page is for my students and others who are
      interested in
      finding reliable information about the problem of climate change
      and
      possible remedies.<br>
      <br>
      Even though average
      temperatures are increasing, I avoid the term
      "global warming." This is because climate is very complex, and it
      is
      not helpful to think in terms of temporally gradual and spatially
      even
      temperature increases. The future -- and indeed the present -- is
      more
      likely to feature uneven shifts in temperature, precipitation, and
      wind
      behaviors, some of them rather rapid.<br>

              href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on
              Climate Change</a> is a team of leading experts from many
            fields,
            organized
            by the United Nations Environmental Program and the World
            Meteorological Organization. The IPCC has written four
            comprehensive
            reports since 1990. In its Fourth Assessment Report,
            released in 2007,
            scientists
            from 113 countries
            have concluded that no doubt remains that
            human activity is forcing unprecedented climate change.<br>
            <br>
            The IPCC web site is the most authoritative source of
            information on
            climate change, including causes, consequences, and
            mitigation. It is
            also a great source for graphics. The one shown to the left
            is number
            5-2 in a <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/present/graphics.htm">gallery
              of
              authoritative images</a> in several formats. It indicates
            that CO2
            levels have indeed varied somewhat in the years prior to
            industrialization. In an 800-year period, that variation was
            fairly
            random and on the order of 20 parts per million. In the more
            recent
            200-year period, the variation has been in one direction
            only (upward)
            and on the order of 80 parts per million. This is really not
            at all
            surprising -- the human has increased about ten-fold since
            1800, with
            the fossil-fuel use per person increasing steadily.<br>

            efforts to educate the general public about climate change.
            I use the
            film to introduce the topic to students and civic groups.
            The Climate
            Crisis web site is the official site of the film, and of
            Gore's
            organizing efforts around the film. The site includes
            educational
            materials, latest news.<br>
            <br>
            If you have not seen the film, I encourage you to do so. If
            you have
            seen it, please visit the web site for more information. If
            you have
            the DVD, have a look at the special features, which include
            a short
            piece about developments since the film's release.<br>
            <br>
            The presentation of science in the film is not flawless; if
            anything,
            it is too optimistic. Gore covers remedies too superficially
            and
            uncritically. He gives the impression -- unintentionally, I
            think --
            that freezing carbon emissions
            near current levels is relatively easy and will be
            sufficient. Neither
            part of this is true: it will be hard to freeze emissions,
            and in fact
            dramatic reductions are needed -- perhaps 80 percent by
            2040.<br>
            <br>
            Although the major thrust of the film reflects scientific
            concensus, a
            few details are dubious, and have been the subject of an
            unfavorable

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">Most households in the United
            States get electricity from the burning of fossil fuels,
            including
            coal, oil, and natural gas. Taking a home, school or office
            off of the
            grid is a good way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but
            it is not
            always practical. Reducing electricity usage by using more
            efficient
            lighting and appliances (and simply turning off these things
            when not
            in use) is also helpful.<br>
            <br>
            Offsets are no substitute for conservation, but they do
            provide a way
            for those consumers still on the grid to reduce their
            impact. Through <a href="http://www.renewablechoice.com/">Renewable
              Choice</a>, consumers
            can buy wind energy for the grid, in an amount comparable to
            the
            carbon-based energy they are taking off the grid. We have
            taken this
            step at our house, and since we use a lot less energy than
            the average
            household, we are probably offsetting ourselves and part of
            a neighbor!<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">One of the most encouraging
            responses to climate change since Al Gore's movie has been
            the rapid
            adoption of compact fluorescent lighting in the United
            States. They had
            already been widely used in other countries and by committed
            environmentalists in this country, but the relatively high
            purchase
            price had been a barrier in our math-challenged society.
            Since they
            last ten times as long as regular bulbs and use less than
            one-quarter
            of the energy, they have always been a bargain. Now major
            retailers
            (including Walmart, which is desperate to repair its <a
              href="../badbusiness.html">image</a>) have introduced a
            much wider
            variety of the lights at a much lower cost, so that there is
            no real
            reason not to use them.<br>
            <br>
            Over a period of seven years, each bulb being used on the
            regular
            electric grid saves carbon equal to 1,000 miles of driving
            an average
            car. I offset the carbon emissions from all of my family's
            automobile
            driving each year by giving away these bulbs (and begging
            people to
            install them). Since we drive 18,000 miles per year, I give
            away 18
            bulbs. Organizers of large meetings can do something similar
            -- giving
            away bulbs to each participant more than offsets the amount
            of carbon
            used to drive to the meeting. If participants already have
            replaced all
            of their bulbs (as we have), they can pass them along.<br>
            <br>
            As the prices continue to drop, of course, giving away bulbs
            will no
            longer be possible. I will have to find ways to go even
            further in
            carbon reduction!<br>
            <br>

    I found this version of the Keeling Curve on a Weather Underground <a
      href="http://www.wunderground.com/education/gore.asp">review</a>
    of <span style="font-style: italic;">An Inconvenient Truth</span>.&nbsp;
    I post
    it here because it represents the most compelling evidence of human
    forcing of climate on a global scale. In the middle of the Pacific
    Ocean, far from any significant source of carbon dioxide, a steady
    increase in carbon dioxide has been observed. The absolute value is
    small throughout this period -- the concentration in 1958 is as low
    as
    310 parts per million (ppm), which is, after all, only 0.031
    percent.
    By the end of this record, the concentration at the same time of
    year
    is just over 370 ppm, or only 0.037 percent. In fact, it is the very
    fact of carbon dioxide's small concentrations that has made it
    possible
    for humans to alter its global levels. Humans could never have such
    a
    great impact on a more abundant gas, such as oxygen or nitrogen.<br>
    <br>
    The zig-zag nature of the trend line reflects the regular, annual
    fluctuation in global carbon levels, as seasons change. It is true
    that
    the variation in carbon dioxide levels within a given year (about 6
    ppm
    summer to winter) are greater than the average annual increase
    (about 1
    ppm), but it is clear that the trend is inexorably upward.<br>

<strong>D.F.</strong> Is someone with Wernicke's aphasia able to write?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> The ability to write is usually affected in 
someone with Wernicke's aphasia. The effect on writing will depend on 
the exact size and location of brain damage and can vary between people.</p>

<strong>B.W.</strong>: I want to do a science event at my daughter's 
school with a booth and I thought this would be so cool to use the 
opportunity to show an organ like a cow lung. What options do I have for 
showing an organ. </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> I think the science event would be a great 
opportunity for the students to see real organs.  Human organs are a bit 
difficult to come by, but you can purchase some animal organs for a 
fairly low price.  Here are two ways:</p>

<ol> <li> Ask your local butcher or at the meat counter of your local 
grocery storee -- they may have cow, pig, or chicken hearts, lungs, 
kidneys, and maybe even brains.</li>

<li>Purchase these online from a supply company such <a 
href="http://www.carolina.com"> Carolina Biological Company</a>. As you 
will see, these preserved organs are not too expensive.</li></ol>

<strong>K.L.</strong>: What is the name of the space (the little dent) 
just above the upper lip, below the tip of the nose?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> That area is called the "philtrum."</p>

<hr />

<p id="q152"> <img src= "gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />
<strong>D.L.</strong>: What neurotransmitters are used by the 
parasympathetic nervous system?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> As described on the Neuroscience for Kids web 
site about the <a href="auto.html">autonomic nervous system</a>:</p>

<p>"The preganglionic fiber from the medulla or spinal cord projects to
ganglia very close to the target organ and makes a synapse. This
synapse uses the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. From this
ganglion, the post-ganglionic neuron projects to the target organ and
uses acetylcholine again at its terminal."</p>

<strong>T.D.</strong>: Why is sodium abbreviated with Na and why is 
potassium abbreviated with K?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Sodium and potassium ions are critical for 
the generation of <a href="ap.html">action potentials</a>.  It is unusual 
that these elements are abbreviated with letters that do not begin the 
words.  The chemical symbol for potassium (K) comes from the Latin word 
"kalium" which may have come from the Arabic word "qali" meaning alkali.  
The chemical symbol for sodium (Na) comes from the Latin word 
"natrium" which may have come from the arabic word "natri."</p>

<p id="q150"> <img src= "gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />
<strong>A.Z.</strong>: Are there any ganglia in the somatic nervous 
system?</p>


<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, there are ganglia (the dorsal root 
ganglia and trigeminal ganglia) that are part of the somatic nervous 
system.  These ganglia contain the cell bodies of sensory neurons entering 
the spinal cord (dorsal root ganglia) and brain stem (trigeminal 
ganglia).</p>

<strong>K.T.</strong>: I'm in the process of creating a kit to use 
when I visit schools with a presentation about the nervous system, but I 
am having difficulty finding a "pool float toy" to represent the action 
potential in the <a href="chmodel.html">giant model neuron</a>. Do you 
have any suggestions of what I could use for this and where I could 
purchase it?
</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> For my giant neuron model, I use a pool float 
that I bought at a pool supply store for less than $10.  The float is from 
a string of floats and ropes used to mark lanes in a pool.  If you cannot 
find one of those, you may be able to make something similar using an 
empty paper towel roll -- you know, the cylindrical cardboard tube at the 
center of a paper towel roll.  You could reinforce the cardboard tube with 
duct tape to make it strong.  Make sure that it slides down the rope 
easily.  The pool float I use works nicely because it is strong (all 
plastic) and slides smoothly along the rope.</p> <hr />

<strong>L.P.</strong>: I was wondering if you can  tell me
more about neuroscientists  and what their responsibilities are, duties 
they have, best colleges to attend,  and education/training required. 
</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong>  Here are two articles on the <a 
href="neurok.html">Neuroscience for Kids</a> site that discuss these 
issues:</p>

<strong>E.F.</strong>: Is it true that there are more synapses in the 
brain than stars in the universe?</p>

<p>It is unlikely that there are more synapses in the brain than stars in 
the universe.  Here's why:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEM75BS1VED_index_0.html"> 
European Space Agency</a> estimates that there are 100 thousand million 
(100 billion or 10^11) stars in just our galaxy, the Milky Way.  And there 
are 10^11 to 10^12 galaxies in the universe.  Therefore, there are 
approximately 10^22 to 10^24 stars in the entire universe. </p>

<p>In brain, there are about 86 billion neurons.  In the cerebral 
cortex, there are about 60 trillion (6^13) synapses.  <a 
href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/03/050308134939.htm"> One 
estimate</a> is that there are 100 trillion (10^14) synapses in the entire 
brain, but I have seen estimates of the number of synapses in the entire 
brain as high as 10^15 (source:  <i>Body: the complete human: how it 
grows, how it works, and how to keep it health and strong</i> by Patricia 
Daniels, Richard Restak, Trisha Gura, Lisa Stein, National Geographic 
Press:  Washington, D.C., 2007)</p>

<p>So, the number of stars in the universe is much larger than the number 
of synapses in the brain.</p>

<strong>Joey</strong>: How does the synaptic terminal of the presynaptic 
neuron stay in the correct position relative to the postsynaptic neuron?
</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> The synaptic cleft (gap) is filled with a
fibrous extracellular protein. The protein matrix helps the pre- and
post-synaptic membrane stay together. Also, remember that the space
between pre- and post-synaptic neurons is very small, only 20 to 50
nanometers.</p>

<strong>J.S.</strong>: I am a high school soccer coach.  Do you know what 
players (by position) suffer from the most head injuries?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> In a study of 20 FIFA tournaments between
1998 and 2004, researchers found that head and neck injuries in MEN were
suffered in the following proportions:  defender (40%), forward (23%),
midfielder (22%), goalkeeper (15%).  In WOMEN, the proportions of head and
neck injuries were:  defender (34%), forward (29%), midfielder (29%),
goalkeeper (9%).  In another study of high school athletes, for boys
soccer teams, forwards and halfbacks had 66.1% of the concussions and
goalkeepers had 11.9% of the concussions;  in high school girls soccer
games, forwards and halfbacks had 70.3% of the concussions and goalkeepers
had 18.8% of the concussions.  Remember that the number of players in each
position varies, except there is only one goalkeeper.</p>

<strong>M.B.</strong>: I am a 6th grade teacher and would like to have a
neuroscientist or a patient with a neurological disease visit my class and
speak to my students.  Where can I find a speaker?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> You can find neuroscientists who are
interested in working with teachers and students at the Society for
Neuroscience (SfN) <a
href="http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=neuroscientistTeacherPartners">Neuroscientist
Teacher Partner Program</a>.  You might also find neuroscientists through
the various <a
href="http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=locationsAndContacts">local
chapters of the SfN</a>.</p>

<p>You could find patients willing to visit your class through local
patient support groups. These groups often have speaker bureaus that will
send speakers to schools.  Don't know how to find a local support group?  
Don't worry. Go to the <a
href="http://www.dana.org/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=18988">Dana
Alliance</a> web site that shows NATIONAL chapters for various disorders.  
Go to one of the national chapter web sites to find a local chapter or
just do a web search.  Or have your students do a bit of research on their
own to find a local patient support group for a particular neurological
disorder.</p>

<strong>A.W.</strong>: When do infants develop corneal reflexes?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> According to Snir et al. (Tactile corneal
reflex development in full-term babies, <i>Ophthalmology</i>, 109:526-529, 
2002), 10% of the babies tested had a tactile corneal reflex in at least
one eye at 2 days of age, 25% at 1 week, 50% at 3.5 weeks, 75% at 6 weeks,
and 100% at 12 weeks.</p>

<strong>A.P.</strong>: What is the acronym for the four questions a
bystander should ask a person suspected of having a stroke?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> According to the <a
href="http://www.stroke.org/site/DocServer/STROKE_101_Fact_Sheet.pdf?docID=4541">National
Stroke Association</a> the acronym for these questions is 
<strong>FAST</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>F = FACE Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face 
droop?</li>
<li>A = ARM Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift 
downward?</li>
<li>S = SPEECH Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Does the speech 
sound slurred or strange?</li>
<li>T = TIME If you observe any of these signs, its time to call 9-1-1 or get 
to the nearest stroke center or hospital.</li>

<p id="q137"> <img src= "gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" /> 
<strong>R.B.</strong>: Are there four or six lobes of the brain?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Most people know the four lobes of the
cerebral cortex that are defined by the bones that overlie them:  
temporal, parietal, occiptial and frontal lobes. These four lobes are
visible on the surface of the brain.  Two additional lobes are buried
deeper into the brain:  limbic lobe and insular lobe.  By the way, the
cerebellum is also divided into several "lobes":  anterior lobe, posterior
lobe, flocculonodular lobe.</p>

<strong>G.B.</strong>: What is an abstract?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> An abstract is a brief (usually one
paragraph) summary of a research project.  Scientific papers usually place
abstracts before the introduction.  Scientific meetings often require
abstracts that describe the research that will be presented.</p> <hr />

<strong>W.R.</strong>: Are there any medications that would cause a 
false positive drug test response for <a href="pcp.html">PCP?</a></p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.  High doses of dextromethorphan, a drug
used in many cough medicines, can cause a false positive response for PCP
(phencyclidine). </p>

<p>(References:  1. Schwartz, R.H., Adolescent abuse of dextromethorphan,
<i>Clin Pediatr.</i>, 44:565-568, 2005; 2. Schier, J. and D?az, J.E.,

<strong>S.K.</strong>: What is the first sense to develop in the fetus 
during pregnancy?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Touch is the first sense to develop. The
developing fetus responds to touch of the lips and cheeks by 8 weeks and
to other parts of its body at 14 week. The sense of taste may develop by
12 weeks and that of sound at 22-24 weeks. (Reference: Hepper, P.,
"Unraveling our beginnings", The Psychologist, 18:474-477, 2005.)

<strong>K.P.</strong>: Can pets get Lyme disease and what symptoms would 
they have?</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, pets (and wild animals) CAN get Lyme
disease.  Dogs, cats, horses, mice, cattle, deer, squirrels, opossum and 
raccoons can be infected.   Many wild animals infected by the bacteria 
that cause Lyme disease do not show any symptoms.  Dogs, however, may 
develop a fever and have pain in the joints.  This can cause them to limp 
when they walk.</p>

<strong>T.L.</strong>: Is it possible for a single neuron to release more
than one neurotransmitter? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. According to Kandel et al.  
(Principles of Neural Science, New York:  McGraw Hill, 2000):</p>

<p> &#34;Neuroactive peptides, small-molecule transmitters, and other 
neuroactive molecules can coexist in the same neuron.&#34;</p>

A.</strong>: How much cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) does an average adult 
have? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Humans have 125 to 150 ml of CSF.  The CSF 
is replaced several times each day as 400 to 500 ml of CSF is produced 
every day. </p>

<strong>J.S.</strong>: Are people who suffer from <a href="ms.html">multiple
sclerosis</a> more likely to have falls and break bones? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Many people with MS have trouble walking 
and maintaining their balance. Therefore, they may fall more often and 
break bones.  Osteoporosis also puts people with MS at risk for broken 
bones.</p>

<strong>R.B.:</strong> If the spinal cord ends at L1, how can lumbar punctures
be done at L4?  How far do the meninges continue after the end of the
spinal cord? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> The purpose of the lumbar puncture is to
collect cerebrospinal fluid, not to enter tissue of the spinal cord.  
Therefore, it is much safer to insert the needle below the end of the
spinal cord.  By inserting the needle at L4, the needle might touch only

will not be at risk of injury. Also, see: </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> According to The Handy Science Answer
Book compiled by the Science and Technology Department of the Carnegie
Library of Pittsburgh, babies are born with 300 to 350 bones.  Many
of these fuse together to give us a final count of 206 bones when we are
adults. </p>

<strong>M.M.:</strong> You mentioned that the highest recorded body 
temperature was 115<sup>o</sup>F?</p> <p>Did this person survive? </p> 

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> According to the Guinness Book of World
Records (New York: Bantam Books, 2000, p. 263), the person with the
highest body temperature who lived to tell about it is Willie Jones. On
July 10, 1980, Mr. Jones was admitted to the hospital with heatstroke. His
temperature was 115.7<sup>o</sup>F (46.5<sup>o</sup>C). After 24 days in
the hospital, he was discharged. </p>

<strong>K.L.:</strong> How large are the different lobes of the brain relative 
to each other? </p> 

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> The percentages of total cerebral cortex 
volume for the different lobes are: </p>

<p> frontal lobe = 41% | temporal lobe = 22% | parietal lobe = 19% | 
occipital lobe = 18% </p>

<strong>Y.G.</strong> I saw a program on the Animal Planet called <strong>Eaten Alive</strong>. It told about all kinds of worms that live inside the human body.  One kind of worm lives in some people&#39;s brain. They showed a patient who had this worm for three years before it was removed. Can you tell me more about this? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> It is likely that the problem you describe
was &#34;neurocysticercosis.&#34; Neurocysticercosis is caused when the pork
tapeworm, Taenia solium, makes it way to the brain.  Most people
who get this parasite do so by eating raw or undercooked pork that is
infected by eggs of the tapeworm.  Common symptoms of neurocysticercosis
are seizures, epilepsy, headache, nausea, pain, sensory disturbances and
vomiting.  For more information about neurocysticercosis, see: </p>

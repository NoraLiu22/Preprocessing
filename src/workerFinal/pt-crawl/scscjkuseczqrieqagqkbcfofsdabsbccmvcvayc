  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not only have Erich von D&auml;niken and Graham Hancock adopted the theories of Charles Hapgood on the Piri Reis map and other medieval and Renaissance maps.<br>
      <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavio_Barbiero" target="_blank">Flavio Barbiero</a> (1942- ) has indeed published a book, &quot;<b><a href="http://www.ozoz.it/village_voice/vv17/ghiaccio.htm" target="_blank">A Civilization Under Ice</a></b>&quot;, which suggests that the legendary Atlantis is to be found buried under the ice of Antarctica.  Barbiero is an engineer who joined the Italian Navy in 1961, reaching the rank of Admiral.  He spent most of his professional career in Navy and NATO research centers.  Unfortunately, in the middle of a book otherwise serious and documented, he cannot resist the temptation to see in the old maps that which never was.</font></p>
  <p>In addition to the map of Piri Reis, Barbiero published several medieval globes. The author argues that the land represented there is Atlantis, identifiable with Antarctica. Recognizing the Ross Sea, the Bay of McKenzie, the Weddell area and other parts of the continent surrounding the South Pole he contends that some maps represented Atlantis / Antarctica 10,000 years ago, and others represent it during the Pleistocene (the period between 1,600,000 and 11,000 years ago).</p>
  <p>All this is postulated regardless of the fact that in those documents appear clearly not only geographical names in Europe, Asia and Africa, but also depictions of mythical places like the Garden of Eden, or tombs of the Apostles, etc. Let us view some examples of maps that pretend to represent Atlantis.</p>

            What it is instead is one of the common medieval depictions made according to the tripartite scheme Asia (top) Europe (bottom left.), Africa (bottom right). The world is centered on Jerusalem and surrounded by ocean, beyond which it depicts the twelve winds. We also notice many fortified cities (Rome, Athens, Istanbul, Nazareth, Damascus, Babylon, Alexandria) and different regions (Spain, England, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, Sardinia, Sicily, Cyprus, etc.) all have their names clearly evidenced.<br>
            He also represented the mythical Gog and Magog (Ezekiel 38-39), as the Earthly Paradise.<br>
            This type of globe did not take much account of geographical knowledge but was intended as an idealized and philosophical representation and was based on the <a href="part4/Schema-T.htm" target="_blank">            O-T diagram </a>.

  This document reflects the philosophy of Hugh of St. Victor, who conceived of the world as an Ark for all mortals. In it we can read more than 200 names, mostly classical and biblical, names in Asia and Africa, and modern ones in Europe. You can see people setting sail from Brindisi to Jerusalem (always set as the world&rsquo;s center [in medieval times]), and perhaps the first mention of the Gotthard Pass. Bottom left is England, drawn in red with plenty of detail, and full of pictures of the city. In the empty rectangle at the top [(East)] the cartography may have left a place, as in similar maps, for the earthly paradise. The Red Sea is designed with great emphasis in red.</font></p>

This map (of which there are two other variants) has some modern features, such as the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe derived from pilot books (nautical maps). Some names are derived from Ptolemy's Geography of Asia and in noteworthy names one sees the influence of Marco Polo.</p>
          <p>Around the [margins of the] world there is a calendar of years 1448-1494, with ability to calculate the day of Easter.

The coasts of England (bottom left), Denmark, the Peloponnese, France and Spain are represented more realistically than on other maps of the time. It contains information of an encyclopedic nature, classical and biblical. The map shows the migration of Jews and cites the City of Bethlehem. This is not a typical Garden of Eden; Gog and Magog are confined behind a wall in the north-east Asia. Griffins, men drawn with dog's heads and a lion drawn in Africa are visible.</p>

    <p align="left">Barbiero included reproductions  of other maps in the book, all identified with the mythical Atlantis, in all cases without any basis or proof of these statements. The only &quot;science&quot; used by the author is to note the similarity of these images. But since these planispheres are still nothing like Antarctica today, he states that they represent the Pleistocene Antarctic/Atlantis of hundreds of thousands of years ago. According to Barbiero &quot;<em>all medieval planispheres are simply more or less stylized reproductions and adaptations of ancient maps of Antarctica&quot;.</em></p>
    <p align="left">But what Barbiero did not see is that many of these<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <a href="part4/Schema-T.htm" target="_blank">medieval maps</a> </font>clearly represented, in the southern hemisphere, the mythical Terra Australis, with a great sea that [encircles and] separates the then-known world (Europe, Asia, Africa).</p>

    <p align="left">Barbiero&rsquo;s theory that <em>all medieval planispheres</em> represent an ancient depiction of Antarctica is not possible if they contain within another representation of Antarctica itself. These medieval world maps were based on faith, on sacred texts and on mythological stories, but not on phantom maps of Atlantis, preserved by unknown methods for more than 10,000 years and ending up in the hands of monks in Europe. Of what material would such maps be made to last? And if those ancient Atlantis maps had survived through the ages, what became of them?</p>
    <p align="left">By the time those documents were designed, and this should shed light on their purpose, there were already more accurate maps that were based on observations, measurements, and travel reports. In the middle of '300 for example (about the time of the planispheres of Saint Denis and Hidgen and before that of Andrea White) arose the wonderful <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/LMwebpages/235mono.html" target="_blank">Catalan Atlas</a></font>. The Mediterranean is beautifully drawn while Asia still has the typical imaginative features of the old T-type globes.</p>

    <p align="left">The medieval world maps that we saw above on this page were not made by sailors or cartographers, but almost always by monks in the monasteries for religious and symbolic purposes, not for practical use. They represented a spiritual world, based on Scripture and the teachings of the Church, what was then thought a reality consistent with their faith. Medieval planispheres were not strictly geographical, much less ancient diagrams of Antarctica.</p>

    <hr>
    <p align="left"><em>Postscript 2007</em>:</p>
    <p align="left">On August 1, 2006 a beautifully illustrated book by Alessandro Scafi,  dedicated to those medieval maps, was published by University Of Chicago Press: &quot;<em><strong><a href="http://www.brunomondadori.com/scheda_opera.php?ID=2337" target="_blank">Il paradiso in terra - Mappe del giardino dell'Eden (Heaven on earth - Maps of the garden of Eden)</a></strong></em>&quot;. The scholar discloses that the purpose of such maps, far from &ldquo;practical&quot; navigation, was the location of sacred places of the Bible. Theologians especially argued that the Garden of Eden had really existed and still was extant at the remote borders of the known world.</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;<em>The depiction of paradise came to play an important role in mapping expressing a vision founded on the Bible. The world maps produced in monasteries and cathedrals of Western Europe were not, however, exposition of theology, pastoral documents and statements of devotion, unlike our modern and scientific representations of the Earth, neither were they instruments of religious propaganda or preaching in visual form. They were rather representations of the world according to a particular concept, a concept that took account of the text of Scripture and the teachings of the Christian faith. Assessed according to their criteria, medieval maps of the world were actually less &quot;scientific&quot; than any other document. (...) It is 'important to understand that to Christian scholars of late antiquity and the Middle Ages the Bible provided the key to all forms of knowledge. In the Sacred Scriptures was certainly the spiritual and religious, but also the most authoritative guide on the creation of the world and history of the human race. The Bible might not provide a great deal of geographical information, but it was the key reference in the study of cosmology, philosophy and history</em>&quot; (Alessandro Scafi 2007).</p>

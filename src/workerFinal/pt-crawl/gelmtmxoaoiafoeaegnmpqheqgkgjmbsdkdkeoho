        Truth about Chinese Fengshui</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">This will not be
        a standard exposé. I do not seek to discredit a movement
        or any particular proponent of a movement. Instead, as a
        scholar of ancient China who has studied the origin and
        development of Chinese fengshui, I feel it is my duty to
        educate rather than excoriate. There is so much
        misinformation being supplied to the public by uninformed
        individuals that someone needs to step forward and set
        the record straight. I will try in this essay to correct
        the errors and clarify the misunderstanding.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">So what exactly
        is fengshui? Is it an art or a science? Is it a religion
        or a philosophy? In order to answer these questions, we
        will need to look more closely at the practice of
        fengshui. Complicating our task is the fact that there is
        more than one kind of fengshui, and more than one purpose
        for conducting fengshui readings. For our purposes, I
        will accept the common generalization that there are two
        major schools of fengshui--the Form School, where the
        physical aspects of the landscape are the focus, and the
        Compass School, where the astrological or cosmological
        orientation of the site is the focus of examination. The
        earliest texts on the subject of fengshui deal almost
        exclusively with the geophysical environment, and that is
        how I shall begin the analysis.</font></p>
        <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"
        style="text-align:center"><font face="Arial"></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Let me begin the
        discussion of the external environment of fengshui by
        invoking the image of the dragon. From a Western
        perspective we can say that the dragon is a metaphor that
        represents the lay of the land. We name our landforms in
        a similar fashion. So, near the town of Wimberly, Texas,
        is a feature called the Devil's Backbone. However, for
        the Chinese, describing a topographical feature as a
        dragon is not simply descriptive of its profile against
        the horizon. The physical environment is perceived to be
        a living entity, and the external resemblance is a
        manifestation of the internal life. Therefore, in
        traditional China the physical environment is perceived
        to be a real dragon, and the ultimate purpose of fengshui
        is to locate the cave or lair of the dragon.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The earliest
        Chinese text to discuss the physical environment of
        fengshui is the <i>Book of Burial</i>, written in the 4<sup>th</sup>
        century AD. It discusses the placement of tombs rather
        than residences, but the procedures for locating both
        were basically the same. Let's see how the <i>Book of
        Burial</i> describes the dragon:</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">Arteries spring from low land terrain; bones
        spring from mountain terrain. They wind sinuously from
        east to west and from south to north. Thousands of feet
        high is called forces; hundreds of feet high is called
        features. Forces advance and finish in features. &#133;
        Where forces cease and features soar high, with a stream
        in front and a hill behind, here hides the head of the
        dragon. &#133; Where terrain winds about and collects at
        the center, this is called the belly of the dragon.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">This is the
        geophysical character of the dragon, but there is also a
        very important meteorological element in the physical
        description of the site. The following passage from the <i>Book
        of Burial</i> is the first time in recorded history that
        the term <i>fengshui</i> is used:</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">Qi rides the wind (<i>feng</i>) and
        scatters, but is retained when encountering water (<i>shui</i>).
        The ancients collected it to prevent its dissipation, and
        guided it to assure its retention. Thus it was called <i>fengshui</i>.
        According to the laws of fengshui, the site that attracts
        water is optimal, followed by the site that catches wind.
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">As we can see
        here, fengshui does not mean &quot;the way of wind and
        water.&quot; Instead, wind and water are means by which
        qi is controlled. Wind scatters qi, so we should block
        its ingress. Water collects qi, so we should encourage
        its presence. This will ensure that sufficient qi
        surrounds the tomb or house. A proper translation of
        fengshui therefore is &quot;(hinder the) wind (and hoard
        the) water.&quot;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">So what is
        qi?&nbsp; One of the earliest descriptions of qi,
        appearing in a 4<sup>th</sup> century BC text, reads as
        follows:</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"
        style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><font
        face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Water is the root of all things and the source of all
        life&#133;. Water is the blood and breath [<i>qi</i>] of
        the earth, functioning in similar fashion to the
        circulation of blood and breath in the sinews and veins. <i>Guanzi</i>,
        ch. 39.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Here, qi is
        breath, and water is the blood and breath of the earth.
        The <i>Book of Burial</i> elaborates:&nbsp; &#147;Where
        the ground holds auspicious qi, the earth conforms and
        rises. When ridges hold accumulated qi, water conforms
        and accompanies them.&#148; Ridges in this passage is a
        physiological term referring to the arterial branches or
        vessels of the dragon veins. Where water flows on the
        surface, qi flows beneath the surface.&nbsp; When the
        flow of qi is discovered, then we must look for the
        location where that flow slows down and pools or
        accumulates. The <i>Book of Burial</i> clarifies in this
        fashion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">Where the earth takes shape, qi flows
        accordingly; thereby things are born. For qi courses
        within the ground, its flow follows the contour of the
        ground, and its accumulation results from the halt of
        terrain. &nbsp;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt"><font
        face="Arial">This pooling or concentration of qi is an
        ancient concept that also began as an explanation of
        human physiology. The following passage is from a 4<sup>th</sup>
        century BC Daoist book of philosophy called the <i>Zhuangzi</i>
        (ch. 22): &#147;Man's life is the assembling of qi. The
        assembling is deemed birth; the dispersal is deemed
        death.&#148; Which of course is why a pool of qi is
        advantageous for the lair. According to the <i>Book of
        Burial</i>: &#147;Life is accumulated qi. It solidifies
        into bone, which alone remains after death. Burial
        returns qi to the bones, which is how the living are
        endowed.&#148; Somehow the pooling of qi around the
        interred bones affects the lives of the descendants of
        the deceased. This final passage reveals the metaphysical
        aspect of qi--its ability to enhance the lives of people
        in its proximity. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The process
        whereby the bones are energized is called &quot;mutual
        resonance.&quot; According to a 2<sup>nd</sup> century BC
        text: </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">All things are the same as their qi; all
        things respond to their own class. &#133; Things within
        the same class mutually move each other; root and twig
        mutually respond to each other. <i>Huainanzi</i>, chs. 3,
        4</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The standard
        proof of mutual resonance given by the ancient
        philosophers is this: if a string on one lute is plucked,
        the same string on a nearby lute will simultaneously
        vibrate. It follows, then, that the qi of the interred
        corpse and the qi of the living descendants are
        identical. Therefore, when the vital, life-giving qi of
        the burial site surrounds the bones, they are energized
        like a dead battery being recharged, and the lives of the
        descendants are thereby endowed. We might be tempted to
        speculate that it is the spirit of the deceased that
        consciously bestows rewards or punishments, based on the
        ability of the living to properly orient the tombs of the
        dead. But this is not the case. Ancestor worship is
        directed mainly toward the patriarch, while fengshui is
        not so sexist! Even if grandma&#146;s spirit was not
        worshiped, it was still important to properly orient her
        tomb.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">When we realize
        that the unplucked lute string vibrates because it is
        tuned to the sound waves produced by the plucked string,
        we may speculate that fengshui is a science, and qi some
        type of energy wave. Another analogy may prove helpful
        here. The Chinese believe that qi flows through meridians
        within the human body just like it flows within ridges
        and branches in the earth. The acupuncture point on the
        human body is also called a cave or lair, so we can say
        that the mountain lair is simply the acupuncture point on
        the earth. When the grave is excavated or the foundation
        of the house is dug, the geophysical meridians are tapped
        just like those reached by the acupuncture needle in the
        human body. Acupuncture has been proven to work, although
        scientists have not been able to discover how. In other
        words, science has yet to prove the existence of a qi
        force flowing in the human body.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">What about a qi
        force flowing in the body of earth? Certainly there are
        forces at work within the earth that cannot be seen or
        consciously felt by humans--especially magnetic fields.
        Certain creatures do have an affinity for magnetic
        waves--dolphins, whales, sea turtles, and homing pigeons
        all have magnetite in their brains that gives them a
        magnetic sense of direction. It is possible that humans
        are influenced on some level by magnetism. Is it possible
        that an electromagnetic radiation of some kind is the
        focus of fengshui? The compass was invented by the
        Chinese specifically to assist in the reading of
        terrestrial fengshui. So it appears that the Chinese knew
        early on that the unseen force called qi was
        electromagnetic in character. Unfortunately, modern
        science has been unable to determine the influence of
        such waves on the well being of humans. If qi could be
        proven to exist, or if magnetic fields could be proven to
        influence human life, then fengshui might be considered
        an environmental science.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The subject of
        direction is a convenient segue to the discussion of
        Compass School fengshui. As we have seen in the <i>Book
        of Burial</i>, mountainous landscape is the optimum
        environment in which to trace the flow of qi. But not all
        landscape is mountainous, so there had to be a way to
        detect qi when the topographical forms and features did
        not protrude sufficiently to locate the hidden dragon
        veins. The Chinese believed that the realms of heaven,
        earth, and man were infinitely correlated. So the qi of
        any given locale or any given person on earth was capable
        of being read in the stars.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;In ancient
        China there was no distinction between astronomy and
        astrology, because the stars in the night sky were
        celestial deities. Those with an understanding of the
        movement of stars therefore gained an understanding of
        the will of heavenly spirits. This was crucial
        information for the emperor, who was the center of the
        human realm as was Shang Di, or God on High, the center
        of the heavenly realm. Shang Di's celestial throne was
        the Big Dipper, around which all other stars revolved.
        The handle of the Dipper was the sword of God, which was
        capable of dealing death and destruction in the direction
        to which it pointed. The Chinese accordingly created an
        instrument that was capable of determining the
        configuration of the Big Dipper in the sky at any time of
        day or night. This was the <i>shipan</i>, or cosmograph,
        pictured here: </font></p>
        <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"
        style="text-align:center"><font face="Arial"></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The instrument
        consists of a square fixed earth plate on bottom and a
        rotating heaven disc on top. Around the circumference of
        both plate and disc are arranged the names of the 28
        constellations of the Chinese zodiac. In the center of
        the dial is a representation of the Big Dipper. The
        function of the instrument is similar to a
        planisphere--which allows the user to locate any star or
        constellation in the sky at any moment of the year,
        except that it is only the stars of the zodiac and the
        Big Dipper that are represented on the cosmograph. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">While the Big
        Dipper in the center of the heaven plate is clearly the
        focus of the instrument, each of the four sides of the
        earth plate is marked with one of four greater
        constellations, each made of seven of the lesser
        constellations. There is the Green Dragon (composed of
        the Horn, the Neck, the Heart, and the Tail, for
        example), the Red Bird (composed of the Beak, the Gullet,
        the Crop, and the Wings, for example), the White Tiger,
        and the Dark Turtle.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">So what does the
        cosmograph have to do with fengshui? A passage from the <i>Book
        of Burial </i>reads as follows:</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">The Dark Turtle hangs its head,</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">The Red Bird hovers in dance,</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">The Green Dragon coils sinuously,</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font
        face="Arial">The White Tiger crouches down. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">In the period of
        time between the invention of the cosmograph and the
        writing of the<i> Book of Burial</i>, a space of some six
        or seven centuries, the celestial deities came down to
        earth. The deities now represent topographical formations
        surrounding the lair or tomb site--the coiled dragon
        toward the east, the crouching tiger toward the west, the
        hovering bird in the south, and hanging turtle in the
        north. The Big Dipper on the cosmograph transformed into
        the needle of the magnetic compass as the <i>shipan</i>
        evolved into the <i>luopan</i>, or fengshui compass. The <i>luopan</i>,
        illustrated below, is the standard tool of the fengshui
        master.
			How is the <i>luopan
        </i>used to determine the fengshui of a particular site?
        In the most popular type of Compass School
        fengshui--called Nine Star after the stars of the Big
        Dipper--the cardinal directions of the square, its four
        corners, and the center are all assigned characteristics
        based on Chinese correlative cosmology. The Chinese are
        masters of correlations based on the microcosm of man and
        the macrocosm of heaven and earth. For example, there is
        the two-term system <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>, the
        four-term system of cardinal directions and seasons, the
        five-term system of the Five Elements or Phases--wood,
        fire, earth, metal, and water, and so on. Each ring of
        the <i>luopan</i> represents one or more of these
        correlative systems. When a particular location is
        oriented by means of the compass, its various elevations
        could then be correlated according to any number of
        factors. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"
        style="mso-hyphenate:none;tab-stops:-.5in"><font
        face="Arial">While correlative cosmology can be quite
        complicated, one of the correlative systems--the Five
        Elements--is the basis of fengshui as practiced in the
        U.S. According to this philosophical concept, qi
        naturally progresses through five different phases as
        time progresses. Furthermore, each year has a particular
        elemental character.&nbsp; So, based on year of birth,
        every individual has his or her own characteristic
        element. Two primary systems of phase shift are as
        follows:</font></p>

        face="Arial">According to fengshui, any process that can
        be considered generative or productive will produce good
        fortune. Destructive processes, on the other hand,
        produce bad luck. For example, a person born under the
        element of metal would not want to live in a house facing
        the direction south, because south belongs to the element
        fire, and fire melts metal in the destruction order of
        the elements. A good direction for this person's house to
        face would be southwest, because southwest belongs to the
        element earth, which harbors ores, thus producing metal. </font></p>

        face="Arial">Compass School fengshui makes use of many
        philosophical concepts, most notably Five Elements
        theory. But for fengshui to be considered a legitimate
        philosophy, then its component theories would need to be
        universal and comprehensive. While the phase shift orders
        of the five elements are fascinating explanations of
        phenomenal change, they have no basis in scientific fact.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">Thus far we
        have determined that fengshui cannot be considered a
        science unless qi can be proven to exist. It is not a
        religion because qi is not a spirit. And it is not a
        philosophy because its component theories have no basis
        in fact. That only leaves one possibility. Fengshui is an
        art, and its individual practice is a work of art. From
        the vantage of an aesthetic worldview we do not have to
        judge the reality of a phenomenon in order to derive gain
        from it. It is not principles of rational order that
        should solely determine the value of our vision, but the
        capacity of our vision to satisfy our responsibility for
        ethical order. It doesn't really matter if the dragon is
        a living, breathing creature draped with the features of
        the landscape, or just a fanciful image. It doesn&#146;t
        matter if qi is spirit or electromagnetic energy or
        &#147;psychophysiological&#148; breath. The mere
        perception of an integrated system functioning in our
        environment according to the aesthetic principles of
        fengshui is enough to satisfy the mind of the perceiver.
        And such pleasure is its own reward.</font></p>

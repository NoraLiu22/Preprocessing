      <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">==&nbsp; A brief overview
of this site&nbsp; ==</span></big><br>
      <br>
This website presents the Columbia cars, both electric and<br>
gasoline (or, as it was sometimes printed, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">gasolene</span>!),<br>
manufactured in Hartford, CT, from 1897-1913 by<br>
Pope Manufacturing Company (1897-1899),<br>
Columbia Automobile Company (1899),<br>
Columbia &amp; Electric Vehicle Company (1900),<br>
Electric Vehicle Company (1901-1909), and<br>
Columbia Motor Car Company (1909-1913), which became<br>
a division of United States Motor Company (1910-1913).<br>
      <br>
This site was put together by Bruce Duffie, a grandson of Lawrence
Duffie<br>
(who is pictured above-left), and the son of Burton Duffie, who was<br>
named for Bert Holcomb (the other driver in the photo above).<br>
Included in these pages is some family memorabilia, plus other items
acquired<br>
from various sources - photos, ads, articles, catalogues, and
interesting<br>
odds and ends which relate to this significant and important<br>
portion of the birth of the automotive history.<br>
      <br>
The first group of pages deals with the cars and drivers which made the
runs from<br>
Chicago to New York, establishing the Record in 1903 and re-taking it
in 1904.<br>
The photo above is from that second year.&nbsp; The next few pages
continue<br>
      </big></big><big><big>the narration, though not in strict
chronological order.</big></big><br>
      <big><big><br>
After those opening pages, there begins a comprehensive history of the<br>
Columbia cars, from the inventors and businessmen who organized<br>
the company, right though to the end of production in 1913.<br>
      </big></big><big><big><br>
Each main page has a link to the next one at the bottom.&nbsp; There
are also links<br>
within several main pages to "spur" pages, which amplify and illustrate<br>
details, or show supporting documentation of what is being presented.<br>
The final page is an <a href="http://www.kcstudio.com/colindex.html">annotated
index</a> with links to all pages.<br>
      <br>
      </big></big><big><big>Just a very few years into the development
of the automobile, there already were<br>
several magazines and journals devoted to the topic.&nbsp; Throughout
this website<br>
there are accounts and presentations from many of those publications.<br>
The items which have been selected display many aspects of the<br>
Columbia vehicles as they helped guide the way into the<br>
future of transportation.</big></big><br>
      <big><big> <br>
      </big></big><big><big>New material is added when it is received
or found, mostly additional items<br>
on existing pages, though once in awhile an entirely new page is
inserted.<br>
I have tried to gather things in a logical way and present them so as to<br>
tell the story clearly and succinctly.&nbsp; Because of the ongoing
nature<br>
of this effort, however, some items might stray, or something<br>
could be better in a different location.&nbsp; Any and all ideas<br>
about this will be seriously considered.<br>
      </big></big><big><big><br>
      </big></big><big><big>***If you find any errors or mistakes -
misspellings, typos, broken links,<br>
missing pictures, anything at all - <span style="font-style: italic;">please
let me know</span> so that they can<br>
be fixed.&nbsp; I am eager to make and keep this site as correct as
possible.<br>
Further input and suggestions are also welcome at any time.***<br>
      <br>
Thanks!<br>

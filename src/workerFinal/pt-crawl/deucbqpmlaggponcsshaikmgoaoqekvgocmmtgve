<a name="Heading3"></a><b>HERESY AS ORTHODOXY: WERE THE FOUNDERS
PROGRESSIVISTS?</b></h1>
<h4 align="center">
<a name="Heading4"></a><b><i>Greg Craven*</i></b></h4>
<h2>
<a name="Heading5"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
<p>Probably the most basic contemporary controversy over the interpretation of
the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is that between the methodologies of
originalism (or intentionalism)<sup><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> and
progressivism. According to the first, the fundamental task of the Courts (and
especially the High Court) usually is regarded
as being to interpret the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> so as to give effect to the intentions of those who framed
it at the great Conventions of the 1890s, commonly referred to as 'the
Founding
Fathers' or (as here) 'the
Founders'.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Progressivists, on the
other hand, believe that a search for historical intention is at best incidental
in the process of constitutional
interpretation, and that the Court should
construe the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>so as to bring it into accord with modern needs
and exigencies. Between the two sides in this fiercely contested debate
stretches
a vast chasm both of theoretical approach and
rhetoric.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> A third approach,
literalism, despite a hallowed history in Australian constitutional
law<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> and its routine deployment in
virtually all important cases concerning federal legislative
power,<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> today largely is
overshadowed in the minds of constitutional lawyers by the fascinations of its
two rivals.</p>
<p>The central importance of progressivism as a potential constitutional
methodology is clear. By wielding the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a 'living
force',<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> the Court can mould its
provisions so as to permit the judicial disposition of an entire range of
important social and policy questions,
ranging from the scope of particular
powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, to the constitutional recognition and
protection of selected
human rights. Traditionally, the operation of
progressivism as a constitutional force has tended to be disguised by the
deployment
of some more conventional forms of legal reasoning, such as
literalism,<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> but increasingly it has
of late dared openly to speak its
name.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> Equally clear is the basis of
the opposition to progressivism. To its critics, progressivism is objectionable
primarily on two grounds,
each rooted in a version of democratic
theory.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> First, progressivism is a
device whereby unelected judges assume power over a range of matters not
confided to them by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, matters which properly fall for
disposition by elected legislatures. Second, and even more fundamentally,
progressivism&#8212;at
least in its more potent
forms<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>&#8212;involves nothing
less than the judicial amendment of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>in usurpation of the
rights of the electors of the Commonwealth and the states acting under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128.</a> It is these charges, that progressivism represents an assault by
stealth on traditional conceptions of constitutional democracy,
that gives the
debate much of its academic and political intensity.</p>
<p>Within this fiercely contested discussion, however, one issue has received
relatively little attention. This is the question of whether
the Founders
actually intended that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should be interpreted more or
less strictly in accordance with their intentions, or to put the matter the
other way around, whether
the Founders themselves might not have intended that
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should be interpreted progressively. While it might be
just possible to support an intentionalist theory of constitutional
interpretation
in the absence of any Founders' intent to that
effect,<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> it is implicit in
virtually every articulation of intentionalism that the Founders of the
<i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> intended, positively, that the document should be
interpreted in accordance with their intentions as to its meaning; and
negatively,
that it should not be the subject of progressive interpretation. In
any event, if only as a matter of constitutional rhetoric, any
intentionalist
theory that could not itself be intentionally supported would be profoundly
unpersuasive. The attitudes of the Founders
to progressivism, therefore, are of
considerable significance within current constitutional debate, and it hardly is
surprising that
some Australian progressivists are beginning to hint that the
Founders should have been counted among their own ranks from the
beginning.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is the central question addressed in this article: did the Founders
intend that the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> should be the subject of
progressive interpretation? First, the notion of progressivism itself will be
explored, its different strands
and levels isolated, and its relationship with
Founders' intent identified. In particular, the increasingly frequent (if vague)
suggestions
that the Founders did indeed contemplate some form of progressive
constitutional interpretation will be noted. Second, and critically,
these
assertions that the Founders were supportive of progressive constitutional
interpretation will be tested against a detailed
analysis of the original
Convention Debates. The general conclusion drawn in this context will be that,
while the Debates do undeniably
disclose certain statements progressivist in
tone, these are isolated, ambivalent and heavily affected by context. </p>
<p>Third, a similar assessment as to progressive tendencies will be made of
three important sources of contemporary material from the
period immediately
after Federation: some of the more influential constitutional commentaries
written in the wake of the passage
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>; the debates on the
Judiciary Bill 1902-3 (Cth) in the Commonwealth Parliament; and some of the more
significant constitutional decisions
of the early High Court. The conclusion
reached here will be that, while the debates on the Judiciary Bill in particular
contain
more than one contribution that is progressivist in flavour, such
statements generally are qualified both by their context and their
own content,
as well as being balanced by other (generally less well known) statements
extremely hostile to progressive interpretation.
Moreover, it is highly
significant that the early constitutional decisions of the High Court are
markedly inconsistent with any acceptance
by the Founders of a progressive
approach. The final conclusion drawn from an examination of all these sources
will be that there
exists no plausible evidence that the Founders in general or
a significant number of them envisaged progressive judicial interpretation
of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading24"></a><b>PROGRESSIVISM AND FOUNDERS' INTENT</b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading25"></a><b>Australian constitutional progressivism</b></h3>
<p>The central idea behind progressivism as articulated above is relatively
straightforward. It lies in the notion that, in interpreting
the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, judges (and especially the Justices of the High Court)
consciously should strive to construe the document so as to keep its provisions
aligned with the developments, needs and values of contemporary
Australia.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> The essence of
progressivism thus is that it involves, to a greater or lesser extent, a
constant process of judicial up-dating of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.</p>
<p>Thus stated, there always have been broadly progressive elements in
Australian constitutional interpretation, some of them relatively
confined in
character and generally uncontroversial. For example, the High Court has long
employed the technique of connotation-denotation,
whereby a constitutional
expression includes not only the specific instances which fell within that
expression in 1900 (denotation),
but also any further instances which have come
into being since that time but which are nevertheless within the idea
represented
by the expression in question
(connotation).<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> The chief effect
of this technique has been to allow the legislative powers of the Commonwealth
Parliament some scope to expand so
as to comprehend new developments and
technologies as and when they are deployed. </p>
<p>Rather more widely, judicial statements to the effect that the Court's
reading of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> must take account of the sweep of history are
not unknown, or confined solely to recent years. Perhaps one of the most
oft-cited
High Court dicta in this regard is that of Windeyer J in <i>Victoria v
Commonwealth </i>(the <i>&#8216;Payroll Tax
Case&#8217;)</i>,<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup> to the effect
that the repudiation of the jurisprudence of the first High Court in the
<i>Engineers Case</i> represented merely a natural process of reading the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>in a 'new light' shed by political and social developments in
the years since Federation.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup>
Admittedly, avowals of judicial revisionism in Australian constitutional history
usually have not been so open. The reality, however,
is that a strong element of
covert progressivism has informed a good deal of the constitutional
jurisprudence of the High Court.
Most notably, the 'ultra-literalism' that
emerged from the <i>Engineers Case </i>has had the practical effect that the
legislative powers of the Commonwealth have inexorably expanded simply by virtue
of the fact
that the interpretative technique of literalism inevitably favours a
legislative domain delineated by express enumeration (that of
the Commonwealth)
rather than one defined by way of general residue, as is the case with that of
the states. <i>Engineers</i>-style literalism thus has allowed the Court to
pursue a functionally progressivist agenda in favour of the centralization of
power
while appearing to engage in a value free, formal
legalism.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The recent emergence of progressivism as a widespread, explicit force in
Australian constitutional interpretation essentially has
corresponded with the
discovery by the High Court in the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>of 'implied
rights'.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup> On any real analysis,
this process has represented large-scale judicial modification of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, although as the terminology of 'implication' indicates, the
general position of the Court has been that its new rights discourse
is linked
to traditional norms of constitutional exegesis, and even in a very artificial
way to notions of the Founders' intent.
Nonetheless, in seeking to justify what
undoubtedly was a dramatic departure from its previous highly literal approach
to constitutional
interpretation, particular members of the Court increasingly
have enunciated theoretical positions that are openly progressivist,
or whose
logic tends inevitably in that direction.</p>
<p>Probably the most dramatic and best-known instance of this tendency was the
enthusiastic articulation by Deane J in such cases as
<i>Theophanous,</i><sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup> of a theory
of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a 'living force'. Heavily relying on the largely
overlooked writings of Founder Andrew Inglis
Clark,<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup> Deane J ridiculed
reliance upon historically-based methods of interpretation as submitting to the
clutch of the 'dead hand' of the
past. The<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>was to be
interpreted as a 'living force', to be adapted as required by the march of
history to new developments and exigencies. The
views of Deane J hardly
represented the consensus of the Mason Court, but, in their disdain for
historically derived constitutional
analysis, were to find sympathisers among
both judges and commentators.</p>
<p>Although the enthusiasm of the High Court for the creation of implied
constitutional rights seems to have waned (at least
temporarily),<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup> the preparedness
of some of its members to articulate an essentially progressivist methodology
has not. Most notably, Kirby J in
<i>Wakim </i>propounded a form of
progressivism just as potent as that of Deane J:</p>
<blockquote>
The makers did not intend, nor did they have the power to require, that their
wishes and expectations should control us who now live
under its protection. The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> is read by today's Australians to meet, so far as its text allows,
their contemporary governmental
needs.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This is a
theme that has been almost ritually re-expressed by Kirby J (with minor
variations) both in his judgments and his extra-curial
writings.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even McHugh J, often regarded as a constitutional conservative on the basis
of his repeated injunctions that the process of constitutional
interpretation
should be literally and historically
based,<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup> occasionally has seemed
to stray into a progressivist hinterland of his own. Most notably in
<i>Wakim</i>, he enunciates an open-textured constitutionalism which, while more
cautiously expressed than the open revisionism of Kirby J, logically
operates in
similarly progressivist directions in self-consciously maximizing the range of
constitutional choice open to the Court:</p>
<blockquote>
Many words and phrases of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> are expressed at such a level of
generality that the most sensible conclusion to be drawn from their use in a
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> is that the makers of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> intended that they should
apply to whatever facts and circumstances succeeding generations thought they
covered.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Again in
<i>Eastman</i>,<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup> after a rather
convoluted exposition of the task of constitutional interpretation that
contained nods in the direction both of hard-line
originalism and radical
progressivism of the type espoused by Kirby
J,<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup> McHugh J stated:</p>
<blockquote>
Our <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> is constructed in such a way that most of its concepts and
purposes are stated at a sufficient level of abstraction or generality
to enable
it to be infused with the <i>current</i> understanding of those concepts and
purposes. This is consistent with the notion that our <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> was intended
to be an enduring document able to apply to emerging circumstances while
retaining its essential
integrity.<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup></blockquote><p>As
will be suggested below,<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup> the
practical difference between this type of open-textualism and the overt
progressivism of Kirby J often will be limited.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading56"></a><b>Levels of progressivism</b></h3>
<p>The reality, therefore, is that progressivism remains a significant feature
of the High Court's current constitutional jurisprudence,
and this situation is
unlikely to change. Indeed, the rise of progressivism over the past decade from
guiltily unstated premise to
occasional cheerful avowal suggests that it will
play an increasingly prominent part in Australian constitutional interpretation.
It is, however, important to recognize that there are a wide variety of elements
of constitutional interpretation that may be regarded
as containing some element
of progressivism, and that these range widely, from the relatively
uncontroversial, to the type of dramatic
constitutional activism espoused by
Kirby J.</p>
<p>At its weakest and most modest level, progressivism may be regarded as
comprehending such phenomena as the High Court's traditional
utilisation of the
connotation-denotation
technique.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup> As noted above, this
technique indisputably has permitted the continuous extension of the
Commonwealth legislative power to moderately
novel factual situations. On the
other hand, its application is, at least in theory, strictly limited by virtue
of the fact that
the central idea of the provision in question&#8212;the
connotation&#8212;is set by reference to the meaning of the relevant terms
in
1900, and thus by reference to the historic intentions of the Founders.</p>
<p>At a slightly higher level of progressivism is the notion that, where a
constitutional provision genuinely is ambiguous, it should
be interpreted so as
to produce the result most in accord with contemporary standards and values in
Australia. Rarely overtly articulated,
there is little reason to doubt that this
technique is part of the interpretative armory of the High
Court.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup> Moreover, cautiously and
genuinely applied, it probably would arouse relatively little ire, even among
moderate originalists. The
difficulty that arises in this correction is not with
the modernist resolution of admitted ambiguity, but with the concept of
ambiguity
itself: it will be all too easy for a right-minded Court to ritually
determine ambiguity as a prelude to the application of its progressivist
methodology.</p>
<p>This leads directly into the next and rather higher level of progressivism
that would seem in practical terms to flow from a determined
application of the
'open textualism' sometimes expounded by McHugh J. While there is room for doubt
in view of some of his other
pronouncements on the subject of constitutional
interpretation that McHugh J actually would embrace the full implications of
such
an approach,<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> the logic of
that methodology is that where constitutional provisions are to be seen as
little more than equivocal capsules of indeterminate
meaning, waiting to be
filled by the understandings and expectations of current generations as
identified by the High Court, any
real distinction between liberal
interpretation and open progressivism will be extremely tenuous. Such a
distinction will lie, if
anywhere, largely in the fact that it will be more
difficult under such approaches as that of McHugh J to erect constitutional
conceptions
that are not directly attributable to some specific piece of
constitutional language. An example would be the creation of further
implied
rights in such directions as
equality.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup> It is with this type
of open-textualism that one reaches the level of what might be termed 'strong'
progressivism, whether or not
those enunciating it have fully anticipated or
would endorse its potential in this direction. This is a term that also may be
applied
to the two further variants of progressivism now considered, and it is
this strong progressivism&#8212;and its place in the minds
of the
Founders&#8212;that is the subject of this
article.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>A step further into the realm of strong progressivism lies what might be
termed the 'extrapolatory' approach classically deployed
by Deane J in
association with his 'living force' analysis. Under this approach, contentious,
highly generalised constitutional intentions
ostensibly are deduced from the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a whole and the circumstances surrounding Federation, and
from these are extrapolated such desired primary premises as that the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>embodies the central doctrines of the common law, together with
the equally desired secondary proposition that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
</i>derivatively contains, for example, a right of
equality.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup> The language of
intention as used within this interpretative genre essentially is a device for
the development of a progressivist
judicial position that largely is unconfined
by the requirement for textual support inherent in the approach of those such as
McHugh
J.</p>
<p>Finally, one comes to the bald, if straightforward, progressivism espoused by
Kirby J, according to which it is the simple duty of
the Court to read and
re-read the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>in the light of contemporary circumstance,
without any necessity to support what essentially are conclusions of policy by
recourse
to implausibly ascribed intentions on the part of the Founders. Even
Kirby J acknowledges that the text of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>will impose
significant limits upon the course of such
progressivism,<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup> but if Australian
legal history reveals anything, it is that constitutional text is highly
manipulable.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading70"></a><b>Progressivism and founders' intent</b></h3>
<p>In these circumstances of increasing judicial espousal of one or other of the
strong versions of progressivism, it is entirely natural
that corresponding
attempts will be made by its proponents to furnish it with an acceptable
theoretical base. Indeed the chief difficulty
facing progressivism is the lack
of an immediately obvious theoretical platform justifying its usage. In the
absence of such a platform,
the charges that progressivism simply is
anti-democratic (on the basis that it usurps the power of popular amendment
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128)</a> and anti-constitutional (on the same grounds) are plausible
ones, and the methodology easily is presented merely as an unprincipled
series
of decisions rendered according to the policy preference of the individual
judge, the very charge so devastatingly levelled
against the first High Court by
Isaacs J in the joint judgment in the <i>Engineers
Case.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>It is in this context that progressivist judges and commentators have begun
to claim an intentionalist lineage for progressivism.
As stated earlier, if the
Founders actually intended that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>be interpreted
progressively the claims of intentionalism can be accorded little weight, while
progressivists can argue that they
are doing no more than giving effect to the
Founders' wishes. Such a claim has long been something of a staple of
progressivist literature
in the United
States.<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup> It thus hardly is
surprising that the two unequivocal judicial exponents of progressivism cited
above, Deane J and Kirby J, together
with McHugh J as an at least occasional
judicial apologist for a method of constitutional interpretation that tends to
much the same
practical effect as progressivism, all have based their claims for
a progressive style of constitutional interpretation to some extent
upon the
assertion that such an interpretative methodology is firmly based in the
interpretative intentions of the Founders.</p>
<p>So much is immediately and strikingly obvious of the comments of Deane J in
<i>Theophanous</i>, where he elevates Andrew Inglis Clark to the status of a
super-Founder, and attributes a (disputable) progressivist version of Inglis
Clark's views on constitutional interpretation to the Founders as a
whole.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup> Paradoxically, therefore,
Deane J's 'living force' progressivism, with its dismissal of the Convention
Debates and excoriation of
the 'dead hand of the past', draws much of its
theoretical validity from its assertion of a progressivist interpretative
intention
on the part of the Founders. The intermittent open-textualism of
McHugh J is similarly dependent upon the Founders' intent. His argument,
as
expressed in such decisions as
<i>Wakim</i><sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[40]</a></sup> and
<i>Eastman</i>,<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup> seems
essentially to be that the Founders, mindful of the march of history, purposely
filled the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>with highly generalised expressions of which they
fully intended future generations to make what they would. Once again, a key
component
of McHugh J's argument thus is the proposition that the Founders
intended this progressive approach to constitutional interpretation,
with
specific reference at one point being made to some useful comments of Sir John
Downer from the Debates of the Convention at
Melbourne in
1898.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup> Similarly, in the case of
Kirby J, the articulation even of radical progressivism is given a vague
intentionalist pedigree, with
his Honour carefully observing not only that the
Founders had no power to project their constitutional wishes and expectations
indefinitely
into the future, but also that '[t]he makers did not intend ... [to
do so]'.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Corresponding efforts have been made by progressivist and quasi-progressivist
commentators. For example, writing after his retirement
as Chief Justice, Sir
Anthony Mason observed of an 'evolutionary' (ie a moderately progressive)
interpretation of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>that it was based upon the notion that
the Founders intended that at least parts of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>would
'evolve' over time, on this occasion citing Alfred Deakin himself in
support.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup> Kirk, also writing in
support of a moderate version of progressivism that he terms 'evolutionary
originalism', cautiously observes
that it cannot be pre-supposed that the
Founders intended the application of a 'purely originalist
approach',<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[45]</a></sup> and draws upon the
Convention Debates to suggest that at least Isaacs, Higgins and Cockburn might
have acknowledged the possibility
and 'perhaps the desirability' of a wider
approach.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[46]</a></sup> Crawford has suggested
that the Founders may have been quite comfortable with the type of
open-textualism later advanced by McHugh
J 'on the basis that the text
deliberately left room for expansion and development to meet future
needs.'<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[47]</a></sup> Donaghue, in doubting
that the Founders were strict originalists, cites the comments of Downer in the
Convention Debates as evidence
of contemporary support for a wider
interpretative approach,<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[48]</a></sup> while
Thomson refers to the comments of Isaacs in pondering whether the 'original
intention may itself indicate that (judicial) interpreters
are not to be
confined to the framers' intentions and
meanings.'<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[49]</a></sup> Unsurprisingly, these
attempts to furnish progressivism with an acceptable historical and intentional
pedigree have not met with
the approval of commentators more tolerant of
intentionalism. Craven,<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[50]</a></sup>
Patapan<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[51]</a></sup> and (implicitly)
Goldsworthy<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[52]</a></sup> all look askance at
any suggestion that the Founders intended that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>be
interpreted from a progressivist perspective.</p>
<p>It thus is apparent that the intentionalist credentials of progressivism are
an important component in the wider debate over that
constitutional methodology.
It should be noted that, thus far, judicial and extra-judicial statements upon
this issue have not been
grounded in any real degree of detailed historical
analysis. Rather, they have been much more shallowly based, on general
historical
impression (Kirby, Craven); isolated historical instances (Deane,
McHugh, Donaghue, Mason, Thomson) or relatively limited analyses
of historical
materials (Crawford, Kirk). What is attempted here is a rather deeper foray into
a number of historical resources,
with the first of these being the Convention
Debates. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading92"></a><b>THE CONVENTION
DEBATES</b><sup><b><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[53]</a></b></sup></h2>
<p>Any analysis of the Convention Debates on the issue of
progressivism<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[54]</a></sup> needs to begin
with the identification of a number of what might be termed 'structural'
considerations which should be regarded as
militating against any too-ready
assumption that the Founders favoured progressive (or at least strongly
progressive) interpretation
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. These considerations do
not as such prove that the Founders were opposed to progressivism, but do pose a
threshold of plausibility
that must be crossed by modern-day historical
apologists for that phenomenon.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading100"></a><b>The Convention Debates&#8212;structural
considerations</b></h3>
<p>The first of these considerations is that it is not unreasonable to assume in
respect of any legislative document that, in the absence
of strong contrary
evidence, those who framed it regarded that document as broadly dispositive, in
the sense that its terms were
to be applied to circumstances, persons and things
according to the intentions of the drafters as conveyed by the language they
employed,
and not by reference to the unspecified insights of future
interpreters. Such is the standard approach to the interpretation of ordinary
Acts of Parliament.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[55]</a></sup> True, the
circumstances of constitutions are special, and those of the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> very special indeed, but the rebuttable presumption that the
Founders meant what they meant and meant what they wrote is a fair starting
point.</p>
<p>Second, and following from this, the <i>Commonwealth of Australia
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Act</i> <i>1900 </i>is an Act of the Imperial Parliament, albeit an
unusual example of such an Act. The ordinary rules for the interpretation of
Imperial
Acts were well known to the Founders as embodying a general approach of
textual intentionalism,<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[56]</a></sup> and thus
were highly unsympathetic to a progressivist methodology, notwithstanding the
accepted doctrine that constitutions (and
especially constitutional powers) were
to be interpreted 'broadly'.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[57]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Third, the overwhelming determination of the Founders in respect of the High
Court was that it should be the custodian of federalism,
and crucially, that it
should protect the states.<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[58]</a></sup> This
notion of the Court as on-going constitutional protector of the states, together
with the Founders' constant concern to protect
states' rights under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, is difficult to reconcile with any vision of the same Court
as a progressivist entity that can decide which aspects of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
</i>(including those protective of the positions of the states) are or are not
of contemporary relevance. </p>
<p>Fourth, the Founders' determination that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>not be the
subject of excessively easy amendment, and in particular that no alteration of
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should take place without popular endorsement by the
electors of both the Commonwealth and the
states,<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[59]</a></sup> obviously sits
uncomfortably with any argument that they cheerfully contemplated an
interpretative method that effectively would
comprise on-going, extensive
judicial adjustment of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. </p>
<p>Fifth, the entire approach of the Founders to the drafting of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, involving as it did a long drawn out, fiercely debated,
pain-staking and sometimes painful series of attempts to formulate
constitutional
language applicable to the raft of issues facing federating
Australia, does not readily suggest a group of legislators comfortable
with the
idea that their hard-won concessions and compromises could be judicially
revised. </p>
<p>Finally, the essentially progressivist idea that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
</i>produced by the Founders represents little more than series of generalised
guidelines for the future<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[60]</a></sup>
clearly is over-stated in the face of the reality of the text. Putting aside the
necessarily broad expression of the Commonwealth's
legislative powers&#8212;and
even here, 'foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed
within the limits of
the
Commonwealth'<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[61]</a></sup> clearly is a quite
different power in spirit than one simply with respect to
'corporations'&#8212;much of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>is drafted in a degree of
detail that seems to preclude extensive judicial
supplementation.<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The result is that any analysis of the Debates themselves with a view to
demonstrating on the part of the Founders a predilection
towards progressivism
must be undertaken against this rather less than propitious background. In
particular, the significance of
isolated statements which might be thought to
favour such a conclusion must be carefully assessed within this wider historical
and
conceptual framework.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading116"></a><b>The Convention Debates&#8212;general
impressions</b></h3>
<p>What, then, are the general impressions to be drawn from the Debates in this
context? The first broad point must be that there are
indeed a number of
contributions from individual Founders reflecting upon the future role of the
High Court in the interpretation
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and doing so in a
manner that reveals at least some element of progressivist thought. Previous
considerations of the Debates on
this point have not been particularly detailed,
and sometimes have focused upon glancing comments that were not specifically
directed
to the issue of constitutional
methodology.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[63]</a></sup> However, a small
but significant group of Founders did explicitly address the particular question
of constitutional interpretation,
including among their number
Dobson,<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[64]</a></sup>
Downer,<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[65]</a></sup>
Symon,<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[66]</a></sup>
Glynn,<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[67]</a></sup> and
Barton.<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[68]</a></sup> Overwhelmingly, these
comments were made in the context of discussion of what was to become the
Judicature Chapter of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>during the Melbourne session of
the Convention in 1898, although there also were isolated comments during the
debate on the general
resolutions at both Sydney in 1891 and Adelaide in 1897,
and one important intervention (that of Glynn) came during debate on the
amendment clause at Melbourne. Admittedly, most of these comments were confined,
and their exact import often uncertain. Nevertheless,
at least Downer, Isaacs
and Symon each made significant interventions that might be regarded as
furthering the historical claims
of progressivism, while Glynn made a
little-known but important speech in precisely the opposite direction. All of
these major contributions
are analysed in detail
below.<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>A second observation is that virtually all of the 'progressivist'
contributions from the Debates bear the very obvious mark of Lord
Bryce and his
near adulation of the Supreme Court of the United States and its great Chief
Justice John Marshall.<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[70]</a></sup> Bryce
regarded the Supreme Court as the chief and benevolent means of constitutional
amendment in the United States, elevating Marshall
to the status of 'a second
maker of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>', and referring rapturously to his 'majestic
intellect' and the 'elevation of his character', while praising his judgments
for their
'philosophical breadth' and 'luminous
exactness'.<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[71]</a></sup> To Bryce, however
much Americans might 'shut their eyes... and conceal the reality of change under
the continued use of time-honoured
phrases',<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[72]</a></sup> it was the Supreme
Court that directed the constitutional future of the United States. The general
influence of Bryce upon the deliberations
of the Conventions is well
known,<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[73]</a></sup> but his markedly
progressivist views in relation to the United States Supreme Court clearly
affected the mind-set (or at least the
rhetoric) of some of the Founders. Echoes
of Bryce are particularly obvious in the contributions of Symon (who likewise
eulogises
Marshall for introducing judicial flexibility into the United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>),<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[74]</a></sup> Isaacs (who
singles out for praise not only Marshall but also Jay and
Storey)<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[75]</a></sup> and Downer (who also is
deeply impressed by the contribution of
Marshall).<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[76]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A third general point is that the existence of what amounts at least to
progressivist tendencies on the part of some of the leaders
among the Founders
undeniably is striking, particularly when they are first assembled together from
out of the swirling depths of
the Debates. Indeed, the existence of these
statements in the face of the negative structural considerations identified
above, and
against traditional assumptions concerning the interpretative
expectations of the Founders, only serves to emphasise&#8212;even to
the most
dedicated originalist&#8212;their somewhat singular contents. Committed
literalists might be even more off-put: there is
remarkably little evidence in
the Debates that the Founders were committed to a strict <i>Engineers</i>-style
literalism. On the contrary, not only those Founders seemingly inclined towards
some version of progressivism,<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[77]</a></sup>
but also a number of others,<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[78]</a></sup>
appeared to envisage a style of constitutional interpretation that drew heavily
upon the spirit of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and was not confined to the four
squares of the document itself. </p>
<p>All of these general observations might be regarded as tending in the
direction of suggesting that the Debates as a whole have a progressivist
flavour. Other equally general factors, however, undermine any such conclusion.
First, as will be seen, while collected together
the arguably progressivist
statements in the Debates seem to have a certain mass, they are in context
vastly less impressive. The
somewhat depressing truth from a lawyer's
perspective is that the judicial provisions of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a
whole were of relatively limited interest to the Founders: Deakin was later to
observe that they were in 'an even more imperfect
form' than their financial
equivalents.<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[79]</a></sup> The result is that,
notwithstanding the fascination of the present High Court with all aspects of
Chapter III, discussion on the
whole topic of the judiciary throughout the six
fat volumes of the Debates does not represent much more than 250 out of their
around
6000 pages. Even within this limited debate, only three out of the 78
delegates who served in the Conventions between 1891 and 1898
made interventions
that contain even a serious hint of progressivist tendencies. Were all of these
interventions to be combined,
they might comprise a single page of the debates.
No progressivist contribution can be discerned on the part of such leading and
well-informed members of the Convention as Barton, Griffith, Clark, Deakin
(remarkably, in view of his later comments on the Judiciary
Bill),<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[80]</a></sup> O'Connor, Higgins, Wise
or Quick. The statements fondly quoted out of the Debates by modern-day
progressivists are, in terms of representativeness,
a drop in the ocean. </p>
<p>A further general note of caution that must be sounded in relation to these
statements concerns two issues of context. First, as will
be seen, virtually all
occurred within debates where those making them were critically concerned to
stress the importance and claims
of the future High Court with a view to
protecting it against those who would reduce its status. Thus, the apparently
progressivist
statements of
Downer<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[81]</a></sup>,
Isaacs<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[82]</a></sup> and
Symon<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[83]</a></sup> all were made in support
of the High Court during a rather tense debate over the desirability of its
permanent constitutional establishment,
which included considerable discussion
as to the likely relative merits of the Court, the Privy Council and the state
Supreme Courts.
The consequence of all this is that there was an obvious
potential for supporters of the Court to exaggerate the centrality of its
role.
Secondly, and following from this, their context imparts to each of these
statements the profound imprecision inherent in oratory:
while they may well be
progressivist in tone, it typically is difficult to determine exactly what level
of progressive constitutional
interpretation is being advocated, and, in
particular, whether they are intended to convey much more than an endorsement of
what
today would be termed the technique of connotation-denotation. </p>
<p>Finally, these strands of progressivism from the Debates need to be placed
firmly in the context of those matters concerning the High
Court that undeniably
were a subject of fundamental interest and constantly recurring discussion by
the Founders. Outstanding among
these was the near obsession of the Founders
that the High Court should act as a guardian of federalism and the states, a
matter
beside which any hint of tolerance for progressivism fades into
insignificance.<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[84]</a></sup> It was this
unqualified determination that the High Court should safeguard states' rights, a
determination that, as has been noted,
sits uneasily (if at all) with a
progressivist methodology, that constantly was articulated by the Founders,
including some of those
apparently most inclined towards constitutional activism
by the Court. Indeed, it was this primary conception of the Court as upholder
of
the federal balance that produced such embarrassingly unfashionable speculations
in the Debates as those concerning the future
capacity of the Commonwealth to
stack the High Court bench in its own
interest,<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[85]</a></sup> and the potential
pro-Commonwealth bias of High Court
judges.<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[86]</a></sup> Thus, if the Debates
contain hints of progressivism, and they do, they veritably celebrate the High
Court as protector of the states,
and the relative importance of these two
topics in the minds of the Founders needs to be fully appreciated in
appreciating the role
envisaged by them for the Court. All of these broad
considerations need to be kept in mind in assessing the weight and meaning of
the individual contributions now addressed.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading147"></a><b>The Convention Debates&#8212;major
interventions</b></h3>
<p>When assertions of a progressivist intention on the part of the Founders are
made, perhaps the most often cited Convention delegate
is Sir John
Downer.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[87]</a></sup> The relevant comments
occurred during a speech against an amendment to what was to become <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s71.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 71</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, proposed by the Legislative Council of South Australia.
The basic thrust of the amendment would have been to make the continued
existence of the High Court (and indeed, the subsistence of significant portions
of the judicial settlement contained in Chapter
III) dependent upon the will of
the Commonwealth Parliament.</p>
<p>After an entirely typical defence of the High Court on the grounds that it
would be a principal bulwark of states
rights,<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[88]</a></sup> Downer went on to stress
the dignity and importance of the Court by characterizing its judges as:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he men who will have the greatest part in forming this Commonwealth ...
although we form it in form, they form it, to a large
extent, in substance. With
them rest the vast powers of judicial decision, in saying what are the relative
functions of the Commonwealth
and of the States. With them rest the
interpretation of intentions which we may have in our minds, but which have not
occurred to
us at the present time. With them rests the obligation of finding
out principles which are in the minds of this Convention ... and
applying them
to cases which have never occurred before, and which are very little thought of
by any of
us.<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[89]</a></sup></blockquote><p>After
re-emphasising his principal theme<b> </b>of the High Court as protector of the
states,<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[90]</a></sup> Downer went on to assert
the inevitability of constitutional unclarity and the consequent need for
judicial interpretation, observing
that 'there may be some circumstances for
which, with all our ingenuity, we shall be unable to
provide.'<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[91]</a></sup> In the meantime,
Downer believed 'we have to do the best we can to make matters so clear that
there need be no necessity to go to
courts.'<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[92]</a></sup> </p>
<p>What is one to make of this contribution? Clearly, it represents a relatively
fluid approach to constitutional interpretation, and
on its strength
constitutionalists prepared at least to flirt with progressivism such as
Donaghue and (on occasions) McHugh
J<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[93]</a></sup> are inclined to identify
Downer as some form of proto-progressivist. A thorough analysis of his words,
however, reveals the weakness
of such a claim. In the first place, Downer's
speech is heavily intentionalist in flavor. He speaks of the Court interpreting
the
'intentions' of the Founders, twice refers to what the Founders had in their
'minds', and again to the 'thoughts' of the Founders.
Whatever else Downer was
contemplating, it apparently was none of the stronger versions of progressivism,
divorced as they are from
genuine historical intent. Consistently with this,
what emerges most plausibly from Downer's words is not support for strong
progressivism,
but a willingness to embrace the relatively uncontroversial
technique of connotation&#8211;denotation. This seems the most sensible
rendering of his reference to 'finding out the principles' and 'applying them to
cases which have not occurred before', words which
appear logically to be a
paraphrase of his own previous rather opaque reference to interpreting
intentions which had not yet occurred.
On this analysis, Downer is no more a
progressivist than any High Court judge who has applied the
connotation&#8211;denotation distinction.</p>
<p>This conclusion is reinforced by other factors. Downer's comments quite
literally are bracketed by his strong (and habitual) references
to the High
Court as indispensable guardian of the states, a position which (as has been
noted)<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[94]</a></sup> does not sit at all
easily with one of strong progressivism, though it certainly is consistent with
a moderate application of connotation&#8211;denotation.
Perhaps most tellingly
of all, the plausibility of Downer's speech at Melbourne in 1898 as a
progressivist apologia is seriously
undercut by an overlooked contribution made
by him at the Sydney Convention in 1891. There, in arguing for an enhanced right
of appeal
from the High Court to the Privy Council, Downer revealed a far less
benign view of the Court as constitutional interpreter:</p>
<blockquote>
it occurred to me that if the federal judicature were the only tribunal to
decide finally what authority the federal government had,
then the federal
parliament might go beyond what was contemplated&#8212;beyond the provisions of
the statute creating it, and by
the power of judge-made law and judicial
construction extend the original intention and the ambit of jurisdiction, as
undoubtedly
Chief Justice Marshall did in America, as it happened in that case,
to the infinite benefit of the
republic.<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[95]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Notwithstanding
the obligatory flattering reference to Chief Justice Marshall, which is itself
strictly confined to the particular
circumstances of the United States, Downer's
remarks plainly are suspicious, rather than supportive of High Court
constitutional
activism. Unsurprisingly in view of the generally
states-protective positions taken by him during the two Conventions, he emerges
in this passage as particularly intolerant of progressive interpretation that
would operate against the Court's fulfilment of its
role as guardian of the
states. Clearly, when this earlier contribution by Downer is placed beside his
comments at Melbourne, their
already thin credentials as a declaration of
strongly progressivist inclination are stretched still
further.<sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[96]</a></sup></p>
<p>If Sir John Downer is not to be made to carry the banner for progressivism at
the Conventions, the next most logical choice must be
Sir Isaac Isaacs, whose
statements at the Melbourne session of the Convention sometimes are referred to
in this connection as betraying
a more fluid approach to constitutional
interpretation.<sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[97]</a></sup> Again speaking
against an amendment proposed by the Legislative Council of South Australia to
the forerunner of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s71.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 71</a> that was highly antipathetic to the status of a
future High Court, and within a debate where that institution was the subject of
unflattering comparison both to the Privy Council and the state Supreme Courts,
Isaacs was at pains to stress the centrality of the
Court to the whole scheme of
Federation in the following terms: </p>
<blockquote>
We are taking infinite trouble to express what we mean in this
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>; but as in America so it will be here, that the makers of
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>were not merely the Conventions who sat ...but the
judges of the Supreme Court. Marshall, Jay, Storey, and all the rest of the
renowned
Judges who have pronounced on the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>have had just as
much to do in shaping it as the men who sat in the original
Conventions.<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[98]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It
is quite clear from this statement that Isaacs was well aware and admiring of
the amplificatory constitutional work of the United
States Supreme Court, and
had a lively appreciation of the undeniable reality that the shape of the
<i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would be strongly influenced by judicial
interpretation. His statement is, on its own terms, rather more strongly
progressivist than
that of Downer. Nevertheless, to attempt to treat it as a
close ancestor of the radical progressivism of a Deane J or a Kirby J is
to draw
a very long bow indeed.</p>
<p>The starting point again must be to place the speech within its context.
Isaacs, like Downer, was seeking to defend the institution
of the federal
judiciary from those who sought to downgrade its future and status, and to this
end was making every effort to emphasise
its constitutional importance by
expansively delimiting its role as interpreter of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. The
quoted portion of his speech is strongly rhetorical, markedly so in the case of
a Convention delegate much better known for
his pedantic logic than flights of
Deakin-esque oratory. In any event, even taking his words at face value, while
Isaacs clearly
contemplates an element of dynamism in the process of
constitutional interpretation, there is little to suggest that he had in mind
some strong form of progressivism, as opposed to such less radically expansive
constitutional techniques as connotation and denotation,
or perhaps the
progressive resolution of constitutional ambiguity.</p>
<p>Moreover, whatever sympathy is displayed by Isaacs towards progressive
constitutional interpretation, this passage is much more closely
directed to the
past American, rather than toward any future Australian, judicial experience.
Thus, the central import of his remarks
is not that progressivism is a good (or
bad) thing but that, to the extent that Australian constitutional conditions
parallel those
of the United States, some element of progressive interpretation
would prove unavoidable. This is an important point, as on a number
of occasions
during the Convention Debates, Isaacs made it very clear that he regarded
Supreme Court activism in the United States
as the inevitable consequence of the
practical impossibility of amending the <i>United States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, while
also expressing the view that the process for the amendment of the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would not be similarly
frozen.<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[99]</a></sup> Consequently, the
plausibility of Isaacs' comments as an endorsement of progressivism in an
Australian context is seriously reduced
when it is understood that they only can
be so interpreted if one accepts that Isaacs regarded the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> as beyond amendment in the same manner as that of the <i>United
States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, which he patently did
not.<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, while Isaacs obviously discloses some tolerance towards a
progressive approach to constitutional interpretation, particularly
in an
American context, his speech to the Convention certainly does not reveal him as
a thoroughgoing progressivist in his conception
of the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. This conclusion is consistent not only with some of his other
contributions to the Convention, where he displayed a certain wariness
of the
United States Supreme Court as the alleged 'master of the
constitution',<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[101]</a></sup> and as the
victim of undesirable manipulation by executive
appointment,<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[102]</a></sup> but also with
his complete failure to adopt a progressivist stance during debate on the
Judiciary Bill<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[103]</a></sup> and his
adamantine literalism as a High Court
Justice.<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[104]</a></sup> Put simply, Isaac
Isaacs is not a plausible candidate as a Founding progressivist.</p>
<p>The last major contribution to the Debates that arguably could be regarded as
revealing a real commitment to progressivism is that
of the highly intelligent
and equally querulous Sir Josiah Symon. Symon was a major participant in debates
upon judicial topics at
the Conventions, and was a dedicated admirer of the
United States Supreme Court. In Adelaide in 1897, during the opening debate on
Barton's general resolutions, Symon observed that the High Court would be
charged with the interpretation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, '...the most noble
as well as the most distinctive feature of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>of the United
States'.<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[105]</a></sup> He went on to praise
extravagantly the work of the United States Supreme Court, in the process
drawing a supportive intervention
from
Barton.<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[106]</a></sup> In 1898, in
Melbourne, Symon pursued a similar theme. Arguing strongly against any extended
right of appeal from the High Court to
the Privy Council, Symon approvingly
quoted Bryce on the work of Chief Justice Marshall:</p>
<blockquote>
That admirable flexibility and capacity for growth which characterize it (the
American <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>) beyond all other rigid or supreme constitutions is
largely due to him, yet not more due to his courage than to his
caution.<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[107]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>Symon had already scathingly criticised the Privy Council's
interpretation of the constitutional instrument of the Canadian federation,
the
<i>British North America Act 1867 </i>(Imp):</p>
<blockquote>
they are guided by a more rigid adherence to what is literal, as though they
were interpreting simply an Act of Parliament, rather
than by a regard for those
great constitutional principles which throw light upon and assist in the
interpretation of a
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[108]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>Symon's comments are of considerable interest, partly because
they reveal a developed view to the effect that constitutions should
be
interpreted not 'literally' but by reference to fundamental principles, and
partly because his subsequent comments in the Commonwealth
Parliament during
debate on the Judiciary Bill indicate that, of all the Founders (including
Deakin), Symon may have come closest
to espousing a genuinely strong
progressivist position.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[109]</a></sup> Yet
even in his case, an analysis of Symon's contributions to the Convention Debates
provides only modest evidence of a progressivist
position.</p>
<p>Thus, while his reference to 'great Constitutional principles' may to a
modern ear herald some of the 'living force' reasoning of
those such as Deane J,
such terminology would be equally if not more aptly applied to the implicatory
approach of the first High
Court, with its fundamental constitutional doctrines
of reserved powers and implied immunities. Again, Symon's references to the
work
of the Supreme Court of the United States in expanding that country's
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> clearly are highly laudatory, yet Symon&#8212;a notedly
belligerent delegate from the small colony of South Australia&#8212;was
paradoxically
fixated upon the necessity that the High Court rigorously should
protect the interests of the states, a constant theme in his addresses
to the
Convention.<sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[110]</a></sup> Consequently,
whatever else Symon may have believed concerning the latitude to be accorded the
High Court in constitutional interpretation,
it is very difficult to imagine
that in 1898 he would have countenanced a progressively-inspired diminution of
state powers of the
type accomplished in such decisions as the <i>Tasmanian Dams
Case</i>. Finally, Symon's comments, like those of Downer and Isaacs, are
heavily conditioned by their context: he was vitally concerned to
limit appeals
from the High Court to Privy Council, and correspondingly disinclined to
deprecate that Court's future constitutional
role. </p>
<p>Pausing here, it may be observed that, after an assessment of the
contributions to the Convention Debates by the three principal candidates
for
designation as a progressivist Founder, the argument that the Debates disclose a
significant progressivist agenda is desperately
weak. Neither Downer, Isaacs nor
Symon confidently may be pointed to as a strong progressivist on the basis of
their speeches to
the Convention. As demonstrated, all of their speeches are
subject to external and internal factors that seriously undercut their
credentials as expositors of progressivism. Beside this conclusion also must be
set the utter lack of statements sympathetic to a
progressive methodology by
such key figures as Barton, Griffith, O'Connor and even Inglis Clark and Deakin.
Finally, it is somewhat
striking that those searching for a historical basis
upon which to ground progressivism have overlooked a highly significant
contribution
to the Debates that is sternly critical of any move by the Court in
that direction.</p>
<p>This was the contribution at Melbourne in 1898 by the Galway-born South
Australian delegate Patrick McMahon Glynn. Interestingly,
unlike the other
speeches referred to here, this was delivered not during debate upon the
judiciary clauses of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but on its amendment provision. In
other words, progressivism was being considered not primarily as a judicial
activity but as a
potential means of altering the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, which is
of course the reason for its fundamental constitutional relevance. Glynn's
essential argument was that unless the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> were
sufficiently flexible on the point of amendment, the High Court inevitably would
fill the constitutional vacuum thus created
by the making of judicial
amendments. He based his argument closely upon American experience, and in so
doing was far less adulatory
of the Supreme Court and Chief Justice Marshall
than many of his colleagues. Thus, Glynn asked:</p>
<blockquote>
What will be the result if we do not make more elastic provision for the
amendment of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>? We are creating a Judiciary which will
become
legislators.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[111]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Referring
to the activities of such judges as Marshall in the 'expansion' of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> 'necessitated by the changed conditions of the people',
Glynn described them as '...manifest evils of the difficulty of the restricted
power of amendment.'<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[112]</a> </sup>There
must have been some grinding of teeth in the Bryce-soaked Convention when Glynn
went on to cite Jefferson's famous critique
of the American federal judiciary
'...in the enlargement of its powers, advancing with noiseless steps, like a
thief, over the field
of
jurisdiction.'<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[113]</a></sup> Glynn went on
to make his own view of judicial progressivism in a specifically Australian
context crystal clear:</p>
<blockquote>
We ought not to create the evil of making the Judges not merely interpreters,
but the extenders of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and we ought to give the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> such a degree of elasticity as will render it capable of
being moulded to the changed conditions as time goes on, and prevent the
dangerous alternative of judicial
expansion.<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[114]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Glynn's
contribution quite obviously represents an attack on progressivism in terms
vastly stronger and clearer than any of the speeches
supposedly supportive of
that approach. Thus, there can be no question that Glynn is unequivocally
opposed to a future progressive
High Court, and that he rejects the precedent of
a constitutionally active American Supreme Court. Indeed, his contribution is
such
a classical repudiation of progressivism that, notwithstanding his penchant
for elaborate historical allusion, it would not seem
out of place if uttered
within contemporary Australian constitutional debate. It is true, of course,
that Glynn's speech is colourful
and rhetorical, and just as Symon and Downer
arguably inflated the importance of the Court with a view to protecting the
judicial
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Bill, so it is arguable that Glynn
magnified his fears as to its future mode of operation in the interest of
securing a more flexible
power of amendment. What remains striking about his
contribution, however, is that even allowing for an element of tactical
exaggeration,
he clearly regarded judicial progressivism as an eventuality to be
avoided at all costs.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading202"></a><b>The Convention Debates&#8212;conclusions</b></h3>
<p>The general conclusion concerning evidence of progressivism to be derived
from the Convention Debates therefore must be that any such
evidence is
extremely thin. Certainly, there is no material to support a view that the
Debates reveal a significantly progressivist
mindset among the Founders, or even
among a substantial number of them. The most that can be said is that a small
number of Founders
make relatively isolated statements which, when viewed in
isolation, might be regarded as containing appreciably progressivist strands.
However, when these statements are analysed carefully and in context, they are
at best highly equivocal on the point of progressivism.
Against these ambiguous
statements must be placed the brutally clear anti-progressivism of Glynn.</p>
<p>Perhaps the crucial point in this context is that none of these vaguely
progressivist statements conceivably could be regarded as
overcoming the
constitutional burden of proof imposed by the hostile structural considerations
previously identified.<sup><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[115]</a></sup> More
than an admiration for the work of John Marshall and imprecise references to
'shaping' and 'forming' the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>would be required to harmonise
an adherence by the Founders to some concept of strong progressivism with their
habitual pre-occupation
over such fundamental constitutional imperatives as the
protection of the states, maintenance of the federal balance, constitutional
alteration by dual popular will and so
forth.<sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, this is not to say that the contributions of Downer, Isaacs and
Symon do not involve some element of progressivist constitutional
thought.
However, what emerges most clearly from these contributions is far removed from
the robust progressivism articulated in
some contemporary judicial and academic
quarters. Rather, the 'progressivist' contributions of the Founders considered
here are most
obviously consistent with an interpretative approach that, in its
degree of expansiveness, would excite little comment from any Australian
constitutional observer since Federation. That approach would comprise a
recognition that constitutions are to be read more broadly
than other
statutes&#8212;hardly a controversial proposition&#8212;together with an
acceptance of correspondingly generous techniques
of constitutional
construction, such as the existence of an implied incidental power, and the
application of the technique of connotation&#8211;denotation.
The tendency of
modern authorities to discern in the Founders' relatively mundane formulations
of a liberal interpretative approach,
the exciting presence of strong
progressivism or something approaching it, is one that is noted at a number of
points in this article.<sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[117]</a></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading209"></a><b>AFTER THE CONVENTIONS</b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading210"></a><b>Writings of the Founders </b></h3>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly for a group most of whose members were involved in the
difficult establishment phase of a new nation in the
years immediately after
Federation, Australia's Founders produced relatively few reflective pieces that
dwelt upon the arcane process
of constitutional interpretation. With one or two
clear exceptions, therefore, there is little to be extracted from their formal
post-Convention writings upon the issue of progressivism.</p>
<p>Typically, the writings of the Founders show no obvious sympathy towards
progressive interpretation by the High Court. Extending the
analysis to writing
produced before Federation, neither of the two constitutional primers produced
specifically for the use of delegates
to the Conventions&#8212;Baker's
<i>Manual</i><sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[118]</a></sup>and Garran's
<i>Coming
Commonwealth</i><sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[119]</a></sup><i>&#8212;</i>contain
the least advocacy for a progressivist position. The great bible of Australian
constitutional law, Quick and Garran's <i>Annotated <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the
Australian Commonwealth, </i>written by one of the leading Founders and the
Secretary to the Drafting Committee of the second Convention, is similarly
unsupportive.
In a highly conventional analysis, Quick and Garran make the usual
points concerning the need to interpret a<i> </i>constitution<i> </i>broadly and
liberally,<sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[120]</a></sup> but the entire
emphasis is on the interpretation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, having regard to
its special objects, as an Act of the British
Parliament.<sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[121]</a></sup> No breath of
progressivism emerges, although Sir Robert Garran, after a distinguished career
as a servant of the Commonwealth, later
was to be understandably tolerant of the
High Court's extension of Commonwealth
power.<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[122]</a></sup> Quick and Groom's
<i>The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth</i> likewise does not contain any hint
of progressivism in its analysis of constitutional
interpretation.<sup><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similar comments may be made of other pieces of sustained writing by the
Founders. Nothing in Higgins' <i>The Australian Commonwealth
Bill</i><sup><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[124]</a> </sup>advances the cause
of progressivism. Silent also is Deakin's <i>The Federal
Story</i>.<sup><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[125]</a></sup> Cockburn's
<i>Australian
Federation</i><sup><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[126]</a></sup><i> </i>does
not advert to the possibility of progressive interpretation, something also true
of Wise's <i>The Making of the Australian
Commonwealth</i>.<sup><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[127]</a></sup> Indeed, the
chief purpose of this litany of disinterest must be to demonstrate that
post-Federation writings by the Founders that
are progressively flavoured are
very much the exception, rather than the rule.</p>
<p>This brings us to the case of Andrew Inglis Clark. Inglis Clark appears to be
the only Founder to have written at some length in favour
of a form of
progressivism. Despite the fact that he was a not a major figure in the federal
movement after the 1891 Convention,
and was not even a delegate to the second
Convention that met between 1897 and 1898, Inglis Clark has achieved a
contemporary constitutional
significance chiefly by virtue of his identification
by Deane J in <i>Theophanous</i> as the pre-eminent figure among the Founders on
the issue of constitutional
interpretation.<sup><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[128]</a></sup> That
identification was made overwhelmingly on the basis of Inglis Clark's congenial
comments on the process of constitutional interpretation
contained in his book
<i>Studies in Australian Constitutional Law </i>published in
1901.<sup><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[129]</a></sup></p>
<p>These comments certainly reveal Inglis Clark as being progressively minded,
although as will be seen, his degree of enthusiasm for
that methodology can be
greatly overstated. Unquestionably, Inglis Clark was a passionate admirer of the
<i>United States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and that country's Supreme Court, and his
attachment to progressivsm seems to have been influenced heavily by this
fact.<sup><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[130]</a></sup> Inglis Clark's comments
concerning progressivism appear in the context of a long and thoughtful
discussion of judicial interpretation
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, by no means
all of which is progressivist in tone. During that discussion, for example,
Inglis Clark makes numerous uncontroversial
comments concerning the
interpretation of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a British statute, and the
functioning of constitutional courts of
appeal.<sup><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[131]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The passages which excite modern progressivists, however, are considerably
more striking. Inglis Clark argued that:</p>
<blockquote>
the social conditions and the political exigencies of succeeding generations of
every civilized and progressive community will inevitably
produce new
governmental problems to which the language of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> must be applied,
and hence it must be read and construed, not as containing a declaration of the
will and intentions of men long
since dead, and who cannot have anticipated the
problems that would arise for future generations but as declaring the will and
intentions
of the present inheritors and possessors of sovereign power, who
maintain the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and have the power to alter it, and who are in the
immediate presence of the problems to be solved. It is they who enforce the
provisions
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and make a living force of that which would
otherwise be a silent and lifeless
document.<sup><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[132]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>After referring approvingly to the work of the Supreme Court in
the United States, Inglis Clark concluded by quoting the words of
Cooley<sup><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[133]</a></sup> in relation to the
American <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, and applying them to its Australian counterpart:</p>
<blockquote>
as the people change, so does their written constitution change also: they see
it in new lights and with different eyes; events may
have given unexpected
illumination to some of its provisions, and what they read one way before they
read in a very different way
now.<sup><a name="fnB134" href="#fn134">[134]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Clearly
enough, Inglis Clark's comments suggest a degree of sympathy for progressivism
unparalleled by anything in the Convention
Debates, and as such have been seized
upon eagerly by latter day progressivists as historical support for their
position. As Goldsworthy
has
noted,<sup><a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[135]</a></sup> however, a closer
analysis of those comments suggests that Inglis Clark's position was
considerably less favourable towards a strong
version of progressivism than
those such as Deane J have maintained. In the first place, Inglis Clark's
comments are subject to significant
intentionalist qualifications. Immediately
after his much-quoted 'living force' passage, Inglis Clark goes on rather to
spoil the
progressivist effect by writing:</p>
<blockquote>
But so long as the present possessors of sovereignty convey their commands in
the language of their predecessors, that language must
be interpreted by the
judiciary consistently with <i>a proper use of it as an intelligible vehicle of
the conceptions and intentions of the human mind, and consistently with the
historical
associations from which particular words and phrases derive the whole
of their meaning</i> in juxtaposition with their context. (emphasis
supplied)<sup><a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[136]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>This is the terminology, not of progressivism, but of
historically conditioned intentionalism. Perhaps even more pointedly, in a
passage
that preceded those quoted, and one not cited by Deane J in
<i>Theophanous</i>, Inglis Clark opined:</p>
<blockquote>
It has been repeatedly stated that the fundamental rule for the interpretation
of a written law is to follow the intention of the
makers of it as they have
disclosed it in the language in which they have declared the
law.<sup><a name="fnB137" href="#fn137">[137]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Again,
this is conventionally expressed constitutional intentionalism. Inglis Clark
goes on to consider the application of this rule
in the context of unforeseen
developments in terms that likewise are deeply respectful of the historical and
intentional genesis
of constitutional terminology:</p>
<blockquote>
In many cases it will be perfectly evident that the particular act or the
particular set of circumstances in respect of which the
question is to be
determined could not have been in the contemplation of the makers of the law,
and therefore it cannot be said,
in the strictest sense of the words, that the
makers of the law have expressed any intentions in regard to the matter. In
every such
case it becomes necessary to apply to the language of the law a
method or process of interpretation which is usually described as
<i>construction</i>, and which consists in examining the law for the purpose of
ascertaining whether it is such as we may reasonably believe the makers
of the
law would have regarded as sufficient to embrace the particular act or set of
circumstances in question if it had been foreseen
by
them.<sup><a name="fnB138" href="#fn138">[138]</a></sup></blockquote><p>These
passages, quite as much part of Inglis Clark's approach to constitutional
interpretation as those cited by Deane J, sit very
ill with the claim that
Inglis Clark was a doctrinaire progressivist. On the contrary, they are couched
more in the language of a
liberal intentionalist comfortable with the technique
of connotation-denotation, and Inglis Clark's 'progressivist' comments must
to
this extent be read with extreme caution. Indeed, on one analysis, they may
represent little more than a somewhat oratorical exegesis
of quite pedestrian
views in favour of the expansive, but historically faithful interpretation of
constitutional terminology.</p>
<p>Secondly, Inglis Clark quite obviously stresses the primacy of formal
constitutional amendment, as opposed to judicial revision, as
a means of
altering the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Thus, even the most progressivist passage of
his work refers to 'the present inheritors and possessors of sovereign power,
who maintain
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>and <i>have the power to alter it</i>'
(emphasis supplied).<sup><a name="fnB139" href="#fn139">[139]</a></sup> Indeed,
Inglis Clark's reference to the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a 'living force' is
connected directly to this celebration of popular amendment of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
In other words, to Inglis Clark, the living force of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>was
expressed through popular amendment, not judicial alteration. It thus is ironic
that his 'living force' imagery should be advanced
as a rhetorical device in
favour of one of the cruder forms of judicial progressivism.</p>
<p>The ultimate conclusion to be reached in relation to Inglis Clark, therefore,
is that while he clearly favoured an expansive approach
to constitutional
interpretation, his adhesion to some strong form of constitutional progressivism
is quite uncertain. While Inglis
Clark clearly would have had little difficulty
in stretching the central idea contained within a Commonwealth power to embrace
new
developments within its genre, there ironically is good reason to suppose
that he would have looked askance at the extrapolatory
progressivism of his
modern-day champion, Deane J. Thus, even without entering into a debate about
Inglis Clark's claim to rank as
'primary architect of our
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'<sup><a name="fnB140" href="#fn140">[140]</a></sup>&#8212;as noted,
he did not even attend the second Convention, and was highly atypical among the
Founders in his depth of attachment
to and knowledge of the <i>United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i><sup><a name="fnB141" href="#fn141">[141]</a></sup>&#8212;it is
apparent that his work hardly provides a strong basis for the attribution of a
progressivist intent to the Founders.</p>
<p>In fact, arguably the most persuasive evidence in immediately post-Federation
constitutional writing of a tolerance for strong progressivism
comes not from
among the ranks of the Founders themselves, but from an academic contemporary.
William Harrison Moore was Dean of
Law at the University of Melbourne, and was
not deeply involved in the drafting of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB142" href="#fn142">[142]</a></sup> However,
his <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the Commonwealth of Australia</i>, published in
1902,<sup><a name="fnB143" href="#fn143">[143]</a></sup> was an authoritative
early work on Australian constitutional law. Writing generally of the judicial
power contained in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, Harrison Moore observed that the
tendency in the Conventions, based on the benign experience of judicial review
in the colonies,
had been to exaggerate rather than to underrate the controlling
power of the courts.<sup><a name="fnB144" href="#fn144">[144]</a></sup> He went
on:</p>
<blockquote>
In general, the power was regarded with singularly little jealousy or suspicion,
a phenomenon entirely in accord with the tendency
of the day to submit to
judicial authority problems which are more economical or
political.<sup><a name="fnB145" href="#fn145">[145]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This
seems to suggest that Harrison Moore regarded the Founders as conscious
progressivists, although the impression is somewhat undercut
by his later,
rather hopeful statement, that alteration of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
would be so easy that its development would be much less guided by judicial
interpretation than had been the case with the <i>United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB146" href="#fn146">[146]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Harrison Moore was to elaborate upon his theme. Writing towards
the end of his life, and admittedly after having observed
nearly thirty years of
the interpretation of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>by the High Court, he was to
observe in a strikingly modern vein that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> 'can be little
more than a framework of government ... its vigour lies peculiarly in its
acceptance by the people.' <sup><a name="fnB147" href="#fn147">[147]</a></sup>
He went on to argue that:</p>
<blockquote>
A constitution, brief and allusive, with its background of history, practice and
principles of government, presents to the judiciary
a task which, while it is in
form the interpretation of a statute, is in substance comparable with the
development of the common
law, wherein the courts are avowed <i>conditores
juris</i>.<sup><a name="fnB148" href="#fn148">[148]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
terms that would warm many a modern judicial heart, Harrison Moore concluded
that, in interpreting the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, judges should follow the practice
of the great Marshall and 'mingle with the lawyer's vigour the statesman's
breadth of view'.<sup><a name="fnB149" href="#fn149">[149]</a></sup></p>
<p>This notion of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as little more than a set of guiding
principles to be developed in much the same way as the common law is strikingly
and unmistakably
progressivist in a way that even the strongest statements of
Inglis Clark, read in context, definitively are not. Harrison Moore's
usefulness
in demonstrating a progressivist intention on the part of the Founders is,
however, strictly limited by two obvious factors.
First, he was not himself a
'Founder'. He was not a delegate to the Conventions, took no part in their
debates, and was not directly
engaged in the drafting of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. His
comments concerning the intentions of the Convention thus are those of an
informed academic commentator, but no more. Certainly,
his belief that the
Convention was uniformly benign towards the pretensions of an activist judiciary
sits ill with some contributions
to the Debates that already have been
noted.<sup><a name="fnB150" href="#fn150">[150]</a></sup> Secondly, Harrison
Moore's advocacy of progressivism is much stronger in 1933 than in 1902. It is a
not unreasonable inference that
his later comments were as much influenced by
the actual practice of constitutional interpretation in years after Federation,
and
particularly the continuous expansion of Commonwealth legislative power by
the High Court, as by any conviction as to the intentions
of the Founders on the
subject.</p>
<p>The conclusion after an admittedly brief survey of some of the more
considered writings of the Founders on the subject of constitutional
interpretation therefore must be that it demonstrates no strong support for a
progressivist methodology. Generally, the Founders'
statements on the topic are
conservative and unremarkable, as exemplified in the treatment of Quick and
Garran. Only Inglis Clark
among the Founders may be claimed with any degree of
plausibility as a progressivist writer. Yet even that claim has been grossly
over-stated, and Inglis Clark's importance as a framer of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
</i>correspondingly exaggerated. The comments of Harrison Moore, while
interesting and even prescient, shed little light on the state
of mind of the
Founders.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading270"></a><b>The Judiciary Bill debates</b></h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, the debates over the Judiciary Bill introduced into the first
session of the Commonwealth Parliament on 8 March 1902
by the Barton Government
comprise the best hunting ground for progressivist statements by the Founders,
as well as by their close
parliamentary colleagues. Indeed, the contrast between
these parliamentary debates and the Convention Debates is quite marked in
this
respect, though this is not entirely surprising. First, the hundreds of pages of
debate over this important bill are specifically
focused upon the federal
judiciary, affording its functioning a degree of attention that it never
received during the Conventions.
Second, after Federation, many of the Founders
passed from being a group of individuals trying to make a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, to being
a group of individuals trying to make a<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>work. In this
context, the potential inconveniences and difficulties involved in amending
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> may have struck some of them with
renewed force, and caused them to develop an enthusiasm for at least a degree of
judicial creativity
in a constitutional context.</p>
<p>It should be noted at the outset that the tone of the debates upon the
Judiciary Bill is very much set by their contemporary political
context. A
central purpose of the Bill was to establish the High Court, and to establish it
on a firm basis in terms of personnel
and resources. The Bill was a key measure
of the Barton Government, and the flagship measure of Attorney-General Deakin.
As such,
it was bitterly attacked by the opposition forces of the day, both from
within Reid's Free Trade alliance, and the fledgling Labor
Party. The chief
basis of their attack was the accusation that the proposals contained in the
Bill were outrageously wasteful and
extravagant, and would involve the creation
of a High Court the expense and pretensions of which would be out of all
proportion to
that body's actual workload and real
importance.<sup><a name="fnB151" href="#fn151">[151]</a></sup> Within this wider
attack were made disparaging comparisons between the future High Court on the
one hand and the Privy Council and
the state Supreme Courts on the
other.<sup><a name="fnB152" href="#fn152">[152]</a></sup> In this fraught
context, it was incumbent upon the supporters of the Bill to stress the
indispensability of the High Court to the
federal scheme, together with the
overwhelming importance of its future interpretative role, and this they did
with a will. Consequently,
just as attacks upon the Court tend to be over-blown
denigrations of it as a 'luxurious' superfluity, so some defences of it tend
rhapsodically to exaggerate its functions. Without discounting them, the more
progressivist contributions to the Judiciary Bill<i> </i>debates need to be read
with this political context in mind. They also need to be set beside such
conservative comments as those asserting
the basic role of the High Court as
guardian of the states, comments which are just as common in the Judiciary Bill
debates as they
were in the
Conventions.<sup><a name="fnB153" href="#fn153">[153]</a></sup></p>
<p>Deakin's speech introducing the
Bill<sup><a name="fnB154" href="#fn154">[154]</a></sup> undoubtedly comprises
one of the most cited pieces of evidence that the Founders' intent on the point
of constitutional interpretation
was
progressivist.<sup><a name="fnB155" href="#fn155">[155]</a></sup> The speech
today is widely regarded as one of Deakin's oratorical masterpieces, as it was
by his friends in 1902. His parliamentary
opponents, however, mocked it as
exaggerated and over-done. Quick uncharacteristically poked fun at the speech,
saying that Deakin
had 'almost exhausted the federal
vocabulary',<sup><a name="fnB156" href="#fn156">[156]</a></sup> while Reid
entirely characteristically sniggered over Deakin's
earnestness.<sup><a name="fnB157" href="#fn157">[157]</a></sup> The broad tone
of the speech is genuinely progressivist, though as will be seen, not so
strongly progressivist as sometimes is suggested.
Deakin's essential theme was
that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>is a large canvas, painted with broad-brush
strokes. It thus is best regarded as an outline, with the function of the Court
being
to flesh out these bare bones. In so doing, it will be the particular role
of the Court to adapt the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>to changing circumstances. As
might be expected, Deakin's speech contains a number of flattering references to
the work of the United
States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The key passage from Deakin's speech probably is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
That<i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> was drawn, and inevitably so, on large and simple
lines, and its provisions were embodied in general language, because it was felt
to be an instrument not to be lightly altered, and indeed incapable of being
readily altered; and, at the same time, was designed
to remain in force for more
years than any of us can foretell, and to apply under circumstances probably
differing most widely from
the expectations now cherished by any of us.
Consequently, drawn as it of necessity was on simple and large lines, it opens
an immense
field for exact definitition and interpretation. Our <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
must depend largely for the exact form and shape which it hereafter will
hereafter take upon the interpretation accorded to its various
provisions. This
court is created to undertake that
interpretation.<sup><a name="fnB158" href="#fn158">[158]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Later,
enlarging upon his theme, Deakin stressed the role of the High Court in ensuring
the contemporary relevance of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>:</p>
<blockquote>
It is as one of the organs of Government which enables the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> to grow
and to be adapted to the changeful necessities and circumstances of generation
after generation that the High Court operates.
Amendments achieve direct and
sweeping changes, but the court moves by gradual, often indirect, cautious, well
considered steps,
that enable the past to join the future, without undue
collision and strife in the
present.<sup><a name="fnB159" href="#fn159">[159]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Without
question, Deakin's speech is a progressively minded exposition of the task of
constitutional interpretation. Similarly, its
progressivist rhetoric is notably
stronger than that to be found in any of the contributions in the Convention
Debates. Indeed, Deakin's
silence on the issue during the Conventions is
somewhat puzzling in light of the depth of feeling that he reveals here.
However,
to move from the point that Deakin's speech falls somewhere within the
range of progressivist thought to arguing that he was a staunch
adherent to the
strong progressivism of a Deane J or a Kirby J, or even that he would have been
supportive of the open textualism
sometimes advanced by McHugh J, would be
highly implausible.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, good reason not to regard Deakin's speech as an espousal
of radical progressivism. Thus, for all its rhetorical
breadth, it seems to be
aimed at minor judicial adjustments to constitutional dispositions rather than
major revisions. Probably
the clearest indication of this comes when Deakin
contrasts the 'direct and sweeping' changes to be achieved by formal
constitutional
amendment with the 'indirect, cautious, well considered steps'
involving neither 'undue collision or strife' that will comprise constitutional
change through judicial interpretation. Such a description would be difficult to
apply to the progressivist rights agenda of a Deane
J, or the radical
progressivism of a Kirby J. A similar impression that Deakin had in
contemplation only judicial expansion of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>that was
instrumental and relatively modest in character is conveyed by the fact that he
was prepared to advance the remarkably mundane
argument that such 'elasticity'
was defensible on the grounds that it would be less expensive than the
alternative of conducting
constant
referenda.<sup><a name="fnB160" href="#fn160">[160]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Much the same sense emerges from two exchanges that occurred between Deakin
and parliamentary critics during his speech. The first
was between Deakin and
the Labor representative Conroy, which took place immediately after the passages
quoted above.</p>
<blockquote>
Mr Conroy: But we cannot read into the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> something which is not
there.<br>
Mr Deakin: Perfectly true ...
<sup><a name="fnB161" href="#fn161">[161]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Deakin went
on immediately to observe of the <i>American <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> (and by analogy
the Australian) that its 'script is read with the full intelligence of the time,
and interpreted in accordance with
the needs of the
time',<sup><a name="fnB162" href="#fn162">[162]</a></sup> but his fundamental
response to Conroy's interjection stands: that which is not already in the
<i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> cannot be placed there by judicial
interpretation. The second exchange likewise is revealing, and took place
between Deakin and McDonald,
concerning the relationship between Deakin's
espousal of a degree of judicial activism and the necessity for formal
constitutional
amendment by referendum:</p>
<blockquote>
Mr McDonald: Is the Attorney-General opposed to the referendum?<br>
Mr Deakin: Certainly not; but I am pointing out that by the interpretation of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> by competent courts, we may secure decisions which will render
it unnecessary to amend, except for specific
changes.<sup><a name="fnB163" href="#fn163">[163]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Noticeably
in this exchange, Deakin seems to downplay the degree of judicial activism that
he is advocating. Once again, one gains
the impression that what he has in mind
is a relatively modest judicial elucidation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and a
smoothing-out of the <i>Constitution's</i> inevitable rough patches as it
emerged from the drafting workshop of the Convention, rather than a sweeping
power of on-going constitutional
revision.</p>
<p>Indeed, as was the case with the comments of such Founders as Isaacs and
Downer at the Conventions, it is worth speculating whether
the contribution of
Deakin during debate on the Judiciary Bill really constituted anything much out
of the ordinary in terms of constitutional
interpretation, at least when it is
placed within its contemporary political context, stripped of its purely
rhetorical flourishes,
and analysed in its entirety, as opposed to being
assiduously trawled for signs of progressivist inclination. In this sense, it is
highly arguable that Deakin's remarks do not go a great deal further than
reflecting the interpretative predilections of someone
who believes that the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should be construed broadly, in conformity with standard
British interpretative practice; according to its spirit as well as its text,
rather than its text alone; with the deployment of such amplificatory techniques
as the distinction between connotation and denotation;
and with a sensitivity
towards ensuring that, so far as is conformable with its text and spirit, the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should answer modern needs without recourse to unnecessary
referenda. This is much more the approach of a Griffith J or a Barton J&#8212;in
whose appointment to the High Court Deakin was intimately involved&#8212;than a
Deane J or a Kirby J. Interestingly, there is some
internal evidence to suggest
that Deakin may have felt that his speech introducing the Bill had been somewhat
overdone on the point
of judicial adaptation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. In his
later interventions in the debate he was markedly more guarded, reflecting upon
the judicial function in uncontroversial
terms,<sup><a name="fnB164" href="#fn164">[164]</a></sup> and stressing the role
of the High Court as guardian of the
states.<sup><a name="fnB165" href="#fn165">[165]</a></sup> His speech in reply
at the conclusion of the second reading stage was subdued, and contained no
rhetorical celebrations of the interpretative
role of the
Court,<sup><a name="fnB166" href="#fn166">[166]</a></sup> while his comments at
the third reading contained little more than conventional praise of the work of
the United States Supreme
Court.<sup><a name="fnB167" href="#fn167">[167]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In any event, whatever its intended effect, Deakin's speech sparked what
probably was the first sustained debate on constitutional
interpretation in
Australian legal history. In some ways, that debate is startlingly modern in its
lively appreciation that there
is more than one way to interpret a constitution,
much more closely resembling constitutional discussion of the last decade than
the repeated elucidation of literalist certainties that dominated Australian
constitutionalism in the wake of <i>Engineers</i>. Probably the simplest way to
approach this debate is to divide consideration of it between those who
supported (or extended) Deakin's
broad vision of the role of the High Court, and
those who opposed it.</p>
<p>Those most strongly committed to the notion of a constitutionally active High
Court were to be found in the Senate. Senator Gould
enthusiastically took up
Deakin's theme, arguing that no matter how clear the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>might
be 'it nevertheless entails the necessity of interpretation from time to time,
and probably at times the necessity of considerably
extending the powers given
therein.'<sup><a name="fnB168" href="#fn168">[168]</a></sup> Referring to
American experience indicating that the idea that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>could
be amended only formally was a delusion, Gould observed 'and so it will be found
to be a delusion in regard to the Commonwealth
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> as years go
by.'<sup><a name="fnB169" href="#fn169">[169]</a></sup> On any analysis, this is
the rhetoric of progressivism, even if one might pose the same queries as to
scale that were posed in relation
to Deakin. However, Gould's progressivism
apparently did not extend beyond a certain point. When asked facetiously (and
pointedly)
by Labor's McGregor whether it would be permissible for the High
Court simply to 'interpret' out of existence the Constitution's
stipulation that
the federal capital should be in New South Wales, Gould rather lamely replied
that the Court would have the power
to adapt the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>'but this
adaptation must be kept within certain limits and certain
bounds'.<sup><a name="fnB170" href="#fn170">[170]</a></sup></p>
<p>Probably the strongest exposition of progressivism within the
debate&#8212;and certainly stronger than that of Deakin&#8212;came from
Sir
Josiah Symon. Symon's comments essentially represent a considerable
intensification of the position he had expressed during the
Convention
Debates.<sup><a name="fnB171" href="#fn171">[171]</a></sup> Once again, he
approached the issue from a perspective of near worship of the United States
Supreme Court. Symon argued that the
High Court should be composed not of rigid
lawyers but of judges who, like their counterparts in the United States, would
'by the
legitimate exercise of the powers of judicial exposition, make this
instrument, without amendment, beneficiently cover all the advances
the
Commonwealth might make.'<sup><a name="fnB172" href="#fn172">[172]</a></sup> In
terms reminiscent of McHugh J, Symon asserted that, following the example of the
United States, 'the framers ... put into the<i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> only the
fundamental rules and principles' and that 'the expansive force of the<i>
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> within legitimate limits, is exerted through the calm
atmosphere of a judicial
tribunal'.<sup><a name="fnB173" href="#fn173">[173]</a></sup> When Senator
Dobson interjected that the United States Supreme Court dealt in politics rather
than law, Symon responded haughtily
that the High Court would be 'dealing with
a<i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and instrument of government&#8212;which no-one pretends
is complete in itself, but which merely lays down broad general principles'
and
that in interpreting the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>a court 'must be animated ... by a
far higher and broader apprehension than the mere lawyer who is dealing with an
ordinary Act of
Parliament.' Symon's characterisation of such an approach,
derived by reference to the work of the United States Supreme Court, was
that it
would be 'statesmanlike'.<sup><a name="fnB174" href="#fn174">[174]</a></sup>
There is no obvious way to understand this contribution other than as one
revealing a commitment to a form of progressivism, at times
resembling the open
textualism of McHugh J, at others seeming to be a forerunner of the
extrapolatory approach of Deane J, or the
radical progressivism of Kirby J.
Indeed, in his call for United States-style 'statesman' judges, Symon seems a
more plausible (if
less romantic and profound) hero for modern day
progressivists than either Inglis Clark or
Deakin.<sup><a name="fnB175" href="#fn175">[175]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Symon represents the high-water mark of progressivism in the Judiciary Bill
debate, but his enthusiasm was very nearly matched by
that of Senator Harney.
Harney adopted an approach similar to that of Symon (and similarly reminiscent
of the open textualism of
McHugh J) in arguing that the Founders had so framed
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>that it was 'moulded in elastic', thus permitting it to
expand and adjust at the hands of the High Court. His view was that the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>was composed of 'broad, far-reaching, loosely-termed, abstract
political conceptions', and in tones that certainly would have appealed
to Deane
J, was 'intended to be the foundation of a growing tree of rights'.
Consequently, the High Court should be composed of judges
who are 'entuned to
its high purposes'.<sup><a name="fnB176" href="#fn176">[176]</a></sup> Again,
this undeniably is the language of high progressivism. Harney was, however,
forced to acknowledge some limits to his favoured
constitutional approach. When
he continued in his theme that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should be consciously
developed by the judges, O'Connor&#8212;seemingly concerned that his colleague
was allowing his rhetoric in
support of the Bill to carry him away&#8212;sharply
interjected that this development could only occur in keeping with the rules
of
legal interpretation. Harney accepted O'Connor's
correction.<sup><a name="fnB177" href="#fn177">[177]</a></sup></p>
<p>The contributions of Gould, Symon and Harney together comprise the strongly
progressivist content of the Judiciary Bill debate. There
are, however, other
contributions that contain some progressivist elements. Naturally, all were made
by parliamentarians supporting
Deakin's Bill. In the House of Representatives,
Groom defended the role of the United States Supreme Court, praising it as the
'living
voice' of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, and arguing that the Australia required a
similar institution.<sup><a name="fnB178" href="#fn178">[178]</a></sup> His
fellow member, Edwards, also supported the notion of a constitutionally active
High Court, but like Deakin seemed to envisage
only relatively minor
adjustments:</p>
<blockquote>
probably, as has been the case in the United States, the decision of the court
will in effect amend the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> to meet the popular will in several
particulars to which it is not worth the trouble and expense of going through
the forms of
amendment.<sup><a name="fnB179" href="#fn179">[179]</a></sup></blockquote><p>More
obliquely, O'Malley eulogized Chief Justice Marshall as the man 'who galvanized
the United States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, which to a large extent we have copied, into
life.'<sup><a name="fnB180" href="#fn180">[180]</a></sup> Bruce Smith observed,
a little vaguely, that the decisions of the United States Supreme Court 'led in
many cases to the introduction
of meanings which possibly were never
contemplated by its framers' and that the 'same difficult work will have to be
undertaken here'.<sup><a name="fnB181" href="#fn181">[181]</a></sup> In the
Upper House, Senator Best was of the view that, as with its American
counterpart, the High Court would 'interpret and develop'
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>,
while in the specific case of the Commonwealth's enumerated legislative powers,
the Court would have to perform 'enormous work in
order to ascertain what they
mean and to develop them in such a way that they will be completely consistent
with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.' All this, however, had to be consistent with the Court's
fundamental duty 'in the preservation of states
rights.'<sup><a name="fnB182" href="#fn182">[182]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pausing briefly to summarise the pro-progressive elements of the Judiciary
Bill debate, it is clear that debate reveals broadly progressivist
sympathies on
the part of a number of the participants. Moreover, the degree of sympathy thus
revealed is considerably greater than
was the case with the Convention Debates.
However, this conclusion should not be overstated. The debate on the Judiciary
Bill is
not the hotbed of progressivism sometimes suggested by the triumphant
citation of Deakin's speech. Out of around one hundred members
of Parliament,
only three&#8212;four if one counts Deakin himself&#8212;adopted a strongly
progressivist position, with another five
making statements consistent with some
(unspecified) degree of support for that position. This hardly constitutes
general approval
among the members of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth
for a progressivist approach to constitutional interpretation. </p>
<p>This is made painfully clear when one turns to an assessment of explicit
opposition to the concept of progressivism as revealed in
the Judiciary Bill
debates. Unlike Deakin's famous speech, this opposition rarely is referred to,
but was intense and wide-ranging.</p>
<p>Hostility towards progressivism and Deakin's championing of a
constitutionally activist High Court came primarily from two groups.
The first
of these were parliamentarians opposed to Deakin's grand vision for the High
Court on the grounds of constitutional and
legal principle; or because its
achievement would involve excessive expense; or simply because such opposition
provided an ideal
ground upon which politically to test the Barton Ministry. The
greater part of this group was composed of George Reid and his Free
Trade
alliance. The second grouping consisted of members of the Australian Labor
Party. They tended to be deeply suspicious of a
High Court composed of
conservatively minded judges whom Deakin seemed to envisage operating less as
lawyers than as political theorists.
 </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, probably the most determined contribution from the
non-Labor critics of progressivism came from Glynn, who since
the Conventions
had lost none of his hostility towards a progressivist High Court. Ridiculing
Deakin's pretensions for the Court,
Glynn warned against an activist Court by
likening its activities to those of the United States Supreme Court, again
drawing upon
Jefferson for the dramatic image of the federal judiciary advancing
like a nocturnal thief across the field of its jurisdiction.
He accused Deakin
of seeking to erect a tribunal that would distort the operation of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, one that 'will probably amplify according to your growing
necessities the interpretation of the provisions of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'.<sup><a name="fnB183" href="#fn183">[183]</a></sup> This was a
theme that was to recur throughout the debate.</p>
<p>The first of the Labor members to speak on the Bill was William Morris
Hughes, who attacked the notion of a progressivist High Court
in terms even more
vehement than Glynn. He accused Deakin of wanting a High Court that would not
merely interpret the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, but make it:</p>
<blockquote>
Here is an empty building, the appointments of which are evidently to be left to
the tastes of the tenants from time to time, and
the Judiciary is to be
entrusted with the task of finishing and completing the
structure.<sup><a name="fnB184" href="#fn184">[184]</a></sup></blockquote><p>To
Hughes, it was not the doubtful points of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>that Deakin
wanted resolved by the High Court. Rather, the Court was to be the means by
which the substantive dispositions of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>could be
undermined without the requisite referendum through 'some sort of patchwork
amendment by a convenient interpretation of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'.<sup><a name="fnB185" href="#fn185">[185]</a></sup> Hughes's
polemical attack on the whole notion of a constitutionally activist High Court
is a neglected classic within its genre.
</p>
<p>Curiously, Hughes seems to draw no distinction between a Court actively
imbued with a desire constantly to adapt the needs of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>to
current exigencies, and one determined to enforce the unexpressed intentions of
the Founders, conflating the two and railing equally
against both as emanations
of Deakin's perfidious plans.<sup><a name="fnB186" href="#fn186">[186]</a></sup>
This does raise the tantalising question, impossible now to resolve, of whether
some of the expansive expositions of the judicial
role by those such as Deakin
(and even Symon) paradoxically might have been meant to smooth the way for such
intentionally founded
but non-textual doctrines as reserved powers and the
implied immunity of instrumentalities, rather than for their constitutional
polar opposite, progressivism. Significantly, Hughes' simultaneous opposition
both to extra-textual intentionalism and progressivism
has the effect that his
speech is a passionate avowal of rigorous constitutional literalism of the type
that was to be adopted in
<i>Engineers</i>, possibly the first sustained
formulation of that
position.<sup><a name="fnB187" href="#fn187">[187]</a></sup></p>
<p>In any event, Glynn and Hughes had between them fired the opening round of
what was to become something of a sustained attack upon
Deakin's conception of
the High Court. Other Labor members joined Hughes in lambasting the notion of a
Court that would as much create
as construe the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. In the
House of Representatives, Conroy said that Deakin's evident intention was to
appoint judges to the Court to 'absolutely make
law' under cover of construing
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB188" href="#fn188">[188]</a></sup> In
other words, argued Conroy, Deakin was proposing of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>that
the High Court would 'take it upon itself to alter its provisions' in defiance
of the requirement that this not occur without
a
referendum.<sup><a name="fnB189" href="#fn189">[189]</a></sup> In the Senate,
their colleague Pearce more politely stated that he did 'not think that we
should accept the view that the High Court
is going to develop the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'
and that he trusted 'the people will develop the<i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
themselves.'<sup><a name="fnB190" href="#fn190">[190]</a></sup> McGregor, as we
have seen, satirically interrupted Gould's rhapsodic account of the operations
of a progressivist judiciary to ask
whether the location of the federal capital
would be secure under such an
approach.<sup><a name="fnB191" href="#fn191">[191]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other members of Parliament were similarly sceptical of or at least cautious
towards Deakin's claims. Interestingly, that radical
Founder Higgins was
generally deflating of the claims of the Court, and patronisingly said of the
attempts of those such as Deakin
and Symon to analogise between the great judges
of the United States Supreme Court and the future judges of the High Court:</p>
<blockquote>
in that country the Judges have made a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> as a sort of addition to the
old instrument. But those Judges spoke as statesmen, and not as lawyers; no
lawyer in these days would
speak as did those Judges from time to
time.<sup><a name="fnB192" href="#fn192">[192]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In the
Senate, Barrett was highly critical of any tendency to create an excessively
powerful judiciary on the basis that 'we shall
make it even greater than the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.'<sup><a name="fnB193" href="#fn193">[193]</a></sup> He bluntly
observed that:</p>
<blockquote>
If we love liberty and right, let us reserve to the people themselves the right
to amend the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> ... Let not that power rest with the Judiciary
...<sup><a name="fnB194" href="#fn194">[194]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Shortly
after these comments, Dobson, who during the Convention had reflected on the
role of the Supreme Court of the United
States,<sup><a name="fnB195" href="#fn195">[195]</a></sup> observed tersely that
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>simply should be interpreted according to the
'principles of
construction.'<sup><a name="fnB196" href="#fn196">[196]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two other Founders must be counted as having displayed at best limited
enthusiasm for Deakin's progressivist tendencies. Downer, who
hardly emerges as
a radical progressivist at the Conventions, spoke in a similarly restrained vein
during debate in the Senate on
the Judiciary Bill. Having reasserted the general
position of Deakin that the High Court should interpret the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
</i>so as to meet the demands of altered circumstances, he went on heavily to
qualify that position as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
We are not appointing these Judges for the purpose of making a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> for
us, but for the purpose of interpreting what we have done; interpreting it
strictly, undoubtedly, but in its interpretation they
must have immense
latitude.<sup><a name="fnB197" href="#fn197">[197]</a></sup></blockquote><p>O'Connor
seems to have had a similar view. In his speech during the Second Reading
debate, he praised the work of the United States
Supreme Court, and by analogy
the future work of the High Court, in ensuring constitutional
adaptability.<sup><a name="fnB198" href="#fn198">[198]</a></sup> His speech,
however, also contained references to the sanctity of popular amendment by
double majority,<sup><a name="fnB199" href="#fn199">[199]</a></sup> and the
crucial role of the High Court in protecting the
states.<sup><a name="fnB200" href="#fn200">[200]</a></sup> Moreover he twice
intervened during debate to deny that the Court would have a power of
constitutional revision. When Barrett said
during his attack on the concept of
judicial activism that the judiciary should not have the power to 'supersede'
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, O'Connor bluntly interjected '[n]obody is claiming that'. To
similar effect, he interrupted Harney's progressivist exposition to
insist that
judicial interpretation of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should keep within the rules
of legal interpretation.<sup><a name="fnB201" href="#fn201">[201]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, one may note the deeply non-committal performance of Prime Minister
Barton. Barton hardly could repudiate the progressivist
rhetoric of his
Attorney-General, but he likewise made no attempt to adopt it. Instead, he
characteristically stressed the fundamental
importance of the High Court as
protector of the federal balance. Barton, too, desired a Court that would do
more than merely interpret
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but not in the sense of a
Court that would revise that document. To Barton, the Court was to be not merely
the interpreter of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but its 'guardian', and the guardian
of the federalism that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
</i>enshrined.<sup><a name="fnB202" href="#fn202">[202]</a></sup> In the context
of a debate where Barton's own Attorney-General arguably had made such a feature
of the legitimacy of constitutional
activism by the High Court, this was a
curiously detached performance. Similar comments may be made of Isaacs, who
spoke closely
after Hughes's stinging attack upon Deakin's envisaged role for
the High Court, but made no attempt to defend the progressivist elements
of that
vision.<sup><a name="fnB203" href="#fn203">[203]</a></sup></p>
<p>What conclusion, then, is to be drawn from this analysis of the Judiciary
Bill debates? Probably the most important is that they do
not comprise the
parade of progressivist opinion that might be suggested by the occasional
references to Deakin's second reading
speech. On the contrary, the contributions
of Deakin and such like-minded members as Symon were matched blow for blow by
the determined
rejection of progressivism by those such as Glynn and Hughes.
Indeed, the battery represented by those members either explicitly
opposed to
the progressivist sentiments of Deakin or at least evidently uneasy with them is
formidable. It includes such Founders
as Glynn, Higgins, Dobson,
Quick,<sup><a name="fnB204" href="#fn204">[204]</a></sup> Downer and O'Connor,
as well as such significant political figures in the early history of the
Commonwealth as Hughes, Pearce and
McGregor. The disinclination of Barton and
Isaacs to enter the debate on Deakin's side also is notable.</p>
<p>In purely numeric terms, ten members who took part in the debate made some
comment inconsistent with support for a form of strong
progressivism, as
compared with only nine who explicitly associated themselves (in varying
degrees) with Deakin's comments. However,
an impressionistic analysis of the
debate probably is even less favourable to the progressivist forces. Reading the
printed debates,
it is hard to resist the conclusion that in his understandable
eagerness to stress the importance of the High Court with a view to
securing its
adequate establishment, Deakin made the rhetorical miscalculation of overstating
its role as a means of informal constitutional
revision. This brought down upon
his head a series of attacks from constitutional legitimists such as Glynn, and
from Labor opponents
of an over-mighty Court, such as Hughes. In turn,
supporters of Deakin such as Gould and Harney, and to a much lesser extent those
such as Groom and Bruce Smith, were compelled to defend Deakin's position
against these attacks as part of a jurisprudential debate
essentially extraneous
to the specific purposes of the Bill. Others of his close associates, such as
Downer and O'Connor, expressly
placed limitations upon the progressive role of
the Court while Barton and Isaacs, in supporting the Bill, chose to say nothing
in
support of a progressive High Court. In the final analysis, the Judiciary
Bill debates are suggestive less of a crucial constitutional
measure adopted on
the basis of a progressivist exposition by Deakin, than of the Bill being passed
in spite of Deakin's more provocative
comments.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact remains that the debates on the Judiciary Bill do reveal
a significant number of contributions in favour of progressivist
interpretation,
within a surprisingly modern debate between at least some identifiable
progressivists, intentionalists, and literalists.
These progressivist
contributions are important, but again their significance should not be
overstated. All were made in a context
where the tendency to exaggerate the role
of the High Court was understandable. The contributions of Deakin's supporters
were made
after Deakin himself had effectively backed them into a progressivist
corner. Even then, only Gould, Symon and Harney delivered speeches
that amounted
to sustained defences of progressivism, and only Symon's was one of unwavering
support for that method of interpretation.
As has been demonstrated, even
Deakin's own speech was far from constituting an unqualified endorsement of
strong progressivism,
and contained a number of elements that suggest he had in
mind an altogether more modest constitutional agenda for the High Court.
In the
final analysis, while the Judiciary Bill debates raise some interesting
questions concerning attitudes to constitutional interpretation
in the decade
after Federation, they definitively do not provide evidence for a wide
acceptance of a progressivist methodology.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading370"></a><b>Early High Court decisions</b></h3>
<p>All that is attempted here is a very brief survey of some of the more
important decisions of the early High Court with a view to determining
whether
they reveal some significant articulation of progressivist methodology.
Certainly, were one to assume a prevalent progressivist
inclination on the part
of the Founders, it reasonably might be expected that this predilection would
emerge prominently upon the
early High Court bench, constituted as it was in its
early years exclusively by Founders: initially Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor
JJ, supplemented in 1906 by the appointment of Isaacs and Higgins JJ. Moreover,
if one takes the view that Deakin's speech on the
Judiciary Bill represented a
widely acclaimed espousal of progressivism, the time for the establishment of a
progressivist High Court
hardly could have been more propitious than in 1903
when the Court, composed of three judges all appointed by Deakin as Prime
Minister
and operating pursuant to the provisions of that very Bill, now an Act,
first began to sit.</p>
<p>It therefore is singular, to say the least, that one discerns not the
slightest degree of overt, strong progressivism in the early
judgements of the
High Court. On the contrary, the interpretative methodology of that Court was
profoundly intentionalist, though
less idiosyncratic in its intentionalism than
has commonly been supposed in the aftermath of its comprehensive demolition
in<i> Engineers</i>. Effectively, the first High Court applied standard British
rules of statutory interpretation in construing the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, though
these rules were modified both by reference to the character of the document as
a constitution, and more specifically as
a federal constitution. </p>
<p>Thus, the Court's starting point was the necessity to discover the
legislative intent behind the words in question. This, however,
was not some
generalised search: in accordance with ordinary interpretative practice, it was
to the constitutional language itself
that the Court turned in order to discern
the relevant intention. So much emerges with absolute clarity from the Court's
first general
exposition of its constitutional method in <i>Tasmania v
Commonwealth</i>.<sup><a name="fnB205" href="#fn205">[205]</a></sup> In that
case, Griffith CJ stated that the Court would adhere to the usual practices of
statutory interpretation in construing the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>according to its
intent, with the words of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>comprising the best guide to
that intention.<sup><a name="fnB206" href="#fn206">[206]</a></sup> In rejecting
a constitutionally active role for the Court he propounded that the meaning of
the<i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> was to be ascertained 'from the language of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and all we have to do is interpret that
language.'<sup><a name="fnB207" href="#fn207">[207]</a></sup> Barton J was
equally dismissive of any suggestion that the Court might have a role in
constitutional revision. While cheerfully conceding
that 'the intention of a<i>
</i>constitution is rather to outline principles than to engrave
details'<sup><a name="fnB208" href="#fn208">[208]</a></sup> he indignantly
observed that:</p>
<blockquote>
It would be an enormity to hold that a Judge who thinks that a certain course,
laid down with apparent clearness in an Act of Parliament,
is absurd, may use
every means to get rid of that literal meaning which, to the minds of
responsible legislators, who were in an
equal position to judge of its
absurdity, appeared to be
reasonable.<sup><a name="fnB209" href="#fn209">[209]</a></sup></blockquote><p>and
went on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
It seems to me plain enough that we cannot construe Acts of Parliament by what
might possibly have entered into the minds of the
framers had their attention
been called to the construction afterwards sought to be placed on their
language.<sup><a name="fnB210" href="#fn210">[210]</a></sup></blockquote><p>O'Connor
J likewise displayed no progressivist enthusiasm, insisting that the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>be interpreted by reference to its intention as derived from
its words, these words to be understood in light of the contemporaneous
circumstances in which they had been
drafted.<sup><a name="fnB211" href="#fn211">[211]</a></sup> Consistently with
this position, O'Connor J in <i>Deakin v Lyne and Webb</i> strongly asserted the
integrity of the popular will as expressed in the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>against
all forces other than formal amendment:</p>
<blockquote>
Until that will as so expressed is altered by an amendment of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>,
we can have no regard to any other expression of the will of the
people.<sup><a name="fnB212" href="#fn212">[212]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>The
dicta in <i>Tasmania v Commonwealth</i> thus may be regarded as making it
adequately clear that the judges of the first High Court had no interest in
articulating an interpretative
methodology of strong progressivism.</p>
<p>Precisely the same was to prove true of Isaacs and Higgins JJ when they
joined the bench. It may be noted that it was not with any
of the quite
straightforward approaches to constitutional interpretation outlined above that
Isaacs and Higgins JJ subsequently were
to take issue. As strong textualists,
they were themselves entirely comfortable with the Court's emphasis upon the
constitutional
text. Similarly, as textualists, they also necessarily were
derivative intentionalists, regarding the text as mirror of the relevant
constitutional intent.<sup><a name="fnB213" href="#fn213">[213]</a></sup>
Critically in the present context, neither Isaacs nor Higgins during the period
in which they were vigorously contesting such doctrines
as that of reserved
powers expressed any obvious inclination towards progressivism. On the contrary,
their professed literalism made
them extremely wary of suggestions that the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>should be interpreted by reference to extraneous
considerations, whether in the form of non-textually derived intent, or
progressivist
arguments of policy. This hostility towards progressivism was made
quite clear by Higgins J in the <i>Union Label Case</i>. In relation to the
notion of trade marks as contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(xviii)</a> he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
No matter how circumstances may change, no matter what may be the developments
of science, of the arts, of business enterprise, and
of society to the end of
time, the Parliament is confined forever (unless there be an alteration to the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>) to such trade marks as the Court enforced in the year
1900.<sup><a name="fnB214" href="#fn214">[214]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In the
same case, Isaacs J noted&#8212;in terms prescient of <i>Engineers</i>&#8212;'no
considerations of expediency or desirability springing from any source whatever
are permissible to the Court in determining
the limits of an express and
substantive power.'<sup><a name="fnB215" href="#fn215">[215]</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as Isaacs and Higgins JJ were comfortable with the first High Court's
general approach of non-progressive textual intentionalism,
so they were
supportive of its application of two rules of British statutory interpretation
of special relevance to the interpretation
of written constitutions. First, the
five initial judges of the Court all were agreed, at least at a conceptual
level, that while
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>was an Act of the British Parliament
it was a highly unusual Act, and that as the constituent document of a great
federation it was
to be read expansively, rather than
narrowly.<sup><a name="fnB216" href="#fn216">[216]</a></sup> Of course, what the
'expansive' interpretation of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> meant in
practice varied prodigiously from judge to judge. In the case of Griffith CJ, a
broad and unpedantic reading of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>produced the doctrines
of reserved powers and implied immunity as expressions of its intended
fundamentally federal
character.<sup><a name="fnB217" href="#fn217">[217]</a></sup> For Isaacs J, by
way of contrast, an expansive approach towards the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>led, via
the rule in <i>R v
Burah,</i><sup><a name="fnB218" href="#fn218">[218]</a></sup><i> </i>to the
inexorable expansion of Commonwealth legislative power finally effected in
<i>Engineers</i>.<sup><a name="fnB219" href="#fn219">[219]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In either case, however, expansive interpretation had nothing conceptually in
common with progressivism. To judges like Griffith CJ,
the declaration of such
doctrines as reserved powers and implied immunity could not have been further
from the self-conscious development
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Rather, they
were viewed as being embedded in the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a matter of its own
internal logic from the very moment of its inception. As he remarked of the
implied immunities doctrine in
<i>D'Emden v Pedder</i> 'a right of sovereignty
subject to intrinsic control is a contradiction in terms', so that the doctrine
should be regarded as nothing
more than 'the essence of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'.<sup><a name="fnB220" href="#fn220">[220]</a></sup> In other
words, so far as Griffith CJ (and Barton and O'Connor JJ) were concerned, these
doctrines were fully intended outcomes of
the Conventions, as was concluded by
La Nauze.<sup><a name="fnB221" href="#fn221">[221]</a></sup> Similarly in the
case of Isaacs, the application of the principle in <i>R v Burah</i> to expand
the legislative powers of the Commonwealth was defended, not on the basis that
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>was consciously to be 'up dated' by the judiciary in
line with modern developments, but rather on the grounds that it was to be
construed
in accordance with common law rules for the interpretation of a
specialised type of statute, the application of these rules to the
particular
case of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> logically being attributable to the
contemporaneous intention of the enacting
legislature.<sup><a name="fnB222" href="#fn222">[222]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second generally agreed refinement to the process of constitutional
interpretation concerned connotation-denotation. All the members
of the first
High Court, and the two additions of 1906, were entirely comfortable with the
use of the technique of connotation and
denotation in interpreting the
legislative powers of the Commonwealth. As Griffith CJ remarked in the <i>Union
Label</i> C<i>ase</i>, the meaning of the terms comprising the subject matters
of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>remain fixed as they were in 1900, but 'with
advancing civilisation new developments, now unthought of, may arise with
respect to
many subject
matters.'<sup><a name="fnB223" href="#fn223">[223]</a></sup> Of course, as
already has been noted,<sup><a name="fnB224" href="#fn224">[224]</a></sup> a
willingness to resort to the historically and intentionally delimited procedure
of connotation-denotation is a very different thing
to support for one or other
of the versions of strong progressivism, and the attachment of the early High
Court to this largely uncontroversial
interpretative technique is unremarkable.
</p>
<p>What is considerably more interesting, perhaps, is the language used by the
members of the Court in formulating this relatively mundane
tool of
constitutional construction. What is striking here is that this language not
infrequently is highly reminiscent of the more
prominent examples of
'progressivist' rhetoric contained in the Convention Debates, the debates on the
Judiciary Bill, the writings
of Inglis Clark, and elsewhere. This again raises
the question of whether many of the utterances of the Founders commonly put
forward
in support of their progressivist inclination were little more than
flowery expositions of connotation-denotation. </p>
<p>To take two examples of the Court's own judicial rhetoric in this context, we
already have noted that in the <i>Union Label Case</i> Griffith CJ rather
grandly expounded the connotation-denotation distinction in terms of 'advancing
civilisation' and 'new developments,
hitherto unthought of'. This is language
strikingly similar to that used by Inglis Clark in his famous 'living force'
passage,<sup><a name="fnB225" href="#fn225">[225]</a></sup> and to that adopted
by Deakin in his famous speech on the Judiciary
Bill,<sup><a name="fnB226" href="#fn226">[226]</a></sup> yet it is being
deployed by Griffith<i>&#8212;</i>hardly himself a progressivist&#8212;in
justification of nothing more exciting than the standard application of
connotation-denotation
reasoning to the legislative powers of the Commonwealth.
Exactly the same observation may be made of the exposition of
connotation-denotation
by O'Connor J in the same case, which had it occurred
during the Convention or Judiciary Bill debates undoubtedly would be advanced
today as evidence of his commitment to some version of strong progressivism:</p>
<blockquote>
[the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>] ... was intended by means of its broad general terms to adapt
itself as far as possible to the changing conditions of trade and
commerce, and
to the new conceptions of legal rights and obligations which might in the
ordinary course of things be expected to
be evolved in the development of
Australia.<sup><a name="fnB227" href="#fn227">[227]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Again,
in words deeply evocative of Deakin, Inglis Clark and Symon, O'Connor in reality
is doing nothing more than expressing the
rationale for a standard application
of connotation-denotation: indeed, in the specific circumstances of the <i>Union
Label Case</i>, he was not even prepared to expand the concept of a 'trade mark'
through the application of that technique. These two passages should
be enough
at least to make us query how far beyond a sensibly liberal application of
connotation-denotation those such as Inglis
Clark and Deakin actually intended
that the High Court should go, and whether we are not discerning within their
words our own, rather
than their, preference for a strongly progressivist
methodology.</p>
<p>The final matter that has to be addressed in relation to progressivism and
the early High Court is the overthrow of central tenets
of the jurisprudence of
the first High Court by Isaacs J and his allies in the <i>Engineers</i>
C<i>ase</i> in 1920. Isaacs J had long loathed such implicatory doctrines as
reserved powers and intergovernmental immunities, based as they
were upon the
finding of an extra-textual intention through the 'reading of the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>as a whole'.<sup><a name="fnB228" href="#fn228">[228]</a></sup>
Certainly by 1920, Isaacs J's distaste for these aspects of the constitutional
oeuvre of the first High Court on purely legal grounds
would have been
compounded by a conviction that it was out of step with the contemporary needs
of Australia for more cohesive central
government. The departure of Griffith CJ,
Barton and O'Connor JJ from the Court and their replacement by younger men far
closer to
Isaacs J in constitutional temperament presented him with the
opportunity finally to suppress what he regarded as deeply aberrant
elements of
the constitutional legacy of the founding Justices of the Court.</p>
<p>In terms of the possible overt articulation of a progressivist methodology by
the High Court, this was a pivotal moment and something
of an ideal opportunity.
It generally is accepted that the <i>Engineers</i> revolution was prompted at
least as much by considerations of perceived national necessity as by the
logical imperatives of constitutional
law.<sup><a name="fnB229" href="#fn229">[229]</a></sup> Given this fact, it
theoretically would have been open to the Court to have articulated its
abandonment of reserved powers and intergovernmental
immunities by announcing
its adhesion to a progressivist vision of constitutional interpretation, and
declaring that these doctrines
no longer answered the nation's developing
constitutional requirements. Instead, the joint judgment in <i>Engineers</i>
famously propounds a rigid literalism as chilly towards overt progressivism as
it is towards the extra-textual intentionalism of
the first High Court. There is
little comfort for a progressivist judge in the Court's famous literalist
anathema on the constitutional
approach of its former members:</p>
<blockquote>
It is an interpretation of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> depending on an implication which is
formed on a vague, individual conception of the spirit of the compact, which is
not the result
of interpreting any specific language to be quoted, nor referable
to any recognized principle of the common law of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, and which,
when stated, is rebuttable by an intention of exclusion equally not referable to
any language of the instrument or acknowledged
common law constitutional
principle, but arrived at by the Court on the opinions of Judges as to hopes and
expectations respecting
vague external
conditions.<sup><a name="fnB230" href="#fn230">[230]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
literalistic harshness of this language is a little curious when we recall that
Isaacs at the Conventions (though not during the
Judiciary Bill debate) made at
least one contribution that has been cited as evidence of at least progressive
tendencies.<sup><a name="fnB231" href="#fn231">[231]</a></sup> Moreover, no
informed commentator doubts that, while Isaacs consistently had articulated a
preference for a literalist interpretative
methodology,<sup><a name="fnB232" href="#fn232">[232]</a></sup> and while this
preference undoubtedly reflected a variety of quite conventional legal and
constitutional influences,<sup><a name="fnB233" href="#fn233">[233]</a></sup>
his adherence to it must have been significantly influenced by an awareness that
its adoption by the Court necessarily would strongly
favour the expansion of
Commonwealth legislative power. In these circumstances, therefore, it is fair to
ask the question why Isaacs
J and his colleagues in <i>Engineers</i>, assuming
them to have indeed shared some practically progressivist agenda, chose to
exorcise the ghost of Sir Samuel Griffith under
the banner of literalism rather
than progressivism? The answer is as obvious as it is revealing. An announcement
by the Court that
it now routinely was in the business of revising the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>along the lines supposedly suggested by Deakin in 1903
presumably would have been politically unacceptable on the grounds of
constitutional
illegitimacy, both in wider terms to governments and electors,
and more specifically to the legal constituency of the High Court
itself.
Consequently, the progressive realities that formed part of the <i>Engineers
</i>agenda were better wrapped within the legal respectability of constitutional
literalism. In other words, there are strong grounds
to suppose that in 1920,
progressivism could not have been advanced as a respectable constitutional
methodology by the Isaacs-dominated
Court, even had it desired to take such a
step. There can be few more compelling illustrations of the fact that
progressivism did
not emerge into the post-Federation era as a legitimate
constitutional approach than its failure to have any explicit role in the
new
interpretative methodology enunciated in <i>Engineers</i>.</p>
<p>The early history of the High Court, therefore, provides little comfort for
those who argue for strong progressivist tendencies among
the Founders. The
members of the first High Court were uniformly intentionalist in their
constitutional approach, while the judgments
of Isaacs and Higgins JJ display no
leanings towards progressivism. The resolute refusal of the <i>Engineers</i>
bench to engage in progressivist rhetoric is similarly unhelpful to the
revisionist claims of modern progressivists.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading424"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p>It certainly is true that a careful analysis of historical material connected
with Federation and the period of constitutional establishment
that occurred
immediately after Federation reveals a number of contributions by the Founders
and their associates that contain progressivist
elements. These contributions
are striking when first examined (and particularly when examined out of context)
partly for the very
reason that they are so counter-intuitive to general
expectations as to the interpretative preferences of the Founders.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, any suggestion to the effect that strong progressivism was a
dominant, or even a significant, position among the Founders
amounts to a gross
exaggeration. Progressivist contributions in the Convention Debates are
infrequent, isolated, heavily dependent
upon context and highly ambiguous.
Progressivist interventions in debate on the<i> </i>Judiciary Bill, while
relatively more common and somewhat more explicit, generally share these
characteristics. Even where such comments
appear to embody a relatively overt
commitment to progressivism, it typically will be possible to mount a powerful
argument to the
effect that they really embody little more than a commitment to
such uncontroversial techniques as connotation-denotation, or that
their authors
regarded them as confined to the achievement of very minor tasks of
constitutional revision. Consequently, such comments
provide little or no
credible support for the type of strong progressivism advocated by those such as
Deane J or Kirby J.  A similar
view must be taken of the work of such
commentators as Andrew Inglis Clark. Predictably, in view of these conclusions,
an examination
of the judgments of the early High Court likewise betrays no
endorsement of a progressivist methodology.</p>
<p>One question that does arise naturally out of this analysis is that,
accepting the Founders were not progressivists, how did they
intend their<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>to be interpreted? This issue is beyond the scope of the
present article, but elements of an answer do inferentially emerge, to be
explored more fully on another occasion. The fact that the Founders did not
spend a great deal of time talking about the issue of
constitutional
interpretation (even during discussion of the Judicature Chapter) suggests that
they probably shared a broad if not
particularly deep consensus on the matter.
Thus, they probably were entirely comfortable with the announcement by the first
High
Court that the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>was to be interpreted in accordance with
the ordinary rules for the construction of British statutes, namely, through an
examination
of its words as a means of determining the legislative intent. </p>
<p>Correspondingly, however, they most likely would have endorsed fully the
further position of Griffith CJ and his colleagues to the
effect that the<i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>was to be construed in context as an entire documentary scheme
for the creation of a great federation, and that the intent of the
Conventions
thus was to be discerned in respect of the document as a whole, as well as of
its individual provisions. To this extent,
the emergence of such extra-textual
doctrines as reserved powers probably would not have surprised many of the
Founders, however
much it may have irked those such as Isaacs J. It certainly is
clear that the Founders would have expected the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>to be
interpreted expansively in accordance with rules established by the British
courts for the interpretation of colonial constitutions,
and would have
experienced no misgivings with the proper application of techniques like
connotation-denotation. </p>
<p>Over all this, however, would hang the fundamental obligation of the Court
ritually repeated during the Convention Debates: to maintain
the federal balance
so painfully achieved through the creation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. The
reality, therefore, is that the interpretative expectations of most of the
Founders quite predictably seem to have anticipated
the approach of the first
High Court. That approach could be characterized as a commitment to textual
intentionalism, but subject
to a recognition that constitutions are to be
interpreted expansively, and that federal constitutions are subject to a
fundamental
implied term of strong federalism. On no analysis, however, was it
tolerant of any version of strong progressivism.</p>

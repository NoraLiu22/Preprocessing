/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: This long 
          essay review was printed in the July 1879 number of the <u>Quarterly 
          Review</u>. Nominally it was intended as a notice of six books on glaciology 
          and polar exploration, but Wallace expanded the work into a full-blown 
          theory of glaciation parts of which were incorporated wholesale into 
          his book <u>Island Life</u> the following year. Original pagination 
          indicated within double brackets. To link directly to this page, connect

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 119]]</font> When 
          the late Professor Agassiz, in the year 1840, discovered clear traces 
          of glacial action in the valleys of Scotland, his announcement was received 
          with incredulity, even by geologists. The whole body of evidence afforded 
          by fossil remains was supposed to prove that our climate had formerly 
          been warmer than it is now, and that the farther we went back in geological 
          time the more tropical were the forms of life which inhabited Europe. 
          This was seen to be entirely consistent with the theory of a cooling 
          earth, to which the high temperatures of the earlier periods were then 
          almost universally attributed; and, as the idea of a much colder climate 
          in former times did not harmonize with this theory, the glacialists 
          were for some time looked upon as a set of wild enthusiasts, whose facts 
          were not worth examining, and whose theories might be ridiculed or despised. 
          Soon, however, the tide began to turn. Eminent geologists, after visiting 
          the alpine valleys where glaciers are still at work, were struck with 
          the identity of the phenomena evidently produced by them with those 
          to be still seen in all our mountain regions; the great importance of 
          this identity was acknowledged; and thenceforth a body of enthusiastic 
          and industrious workers arose, who have made this phase of the ancient 
          history of our earth their special study. With admirable patience they 
          have tracked the ice-marks far and wide over the northern hemisphere, 
          and have so skilfully interpreted the mysterious record, that we are 
          now able to read with confidence the great outlines of this most marvellous 
          chapter in the past history of our earth--the Glacial Period. More recently, 
          the subject has been greatly extended by the growing belief that similar 
          cold epochs have occurred during tertiary, secondary, and even pal&aelig;ozoic 
          times--a belief founded on numerous facts which had previously been 
          overlooked or misinterpreted; while the proofs of a corresponding succession 
          of warm periods within the Arctic regions have accumulated so rapidly, 
          that no doubt now remains as to this still more startling phase of climatic 
          change. 
        </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To account for 
          this wonderful series of phenomena the old theory of a cooling earth 
          is evidently inadequate, and has long been given up by geologists, while 
          it has been shown by physicists to be altogether untenable. Another 
          theory has however taken its place, which, though beset with many difficulties, 
          does really account for almost the whole of the series of facts above 
          referred to, and is therefore adopted with more or less reserve by most 
          students of the subject. But the facts are so varied and widespread, 
          their interpretation is sometimes so obscure, and the theory which explains 
          them is often so difficult in its application, that the whole question 
          appears to most persons to be a hopeless puzzle, while many even doubt 
          the fundamental fact of there ever having been glacial epochs of the 
          intensity and wide extent usually claimed for them. Within the last 
          few years, however, much light has been thrown on the subject by the 
          various Arctic expeditions and by discussions on oceanic circulation, 
          and the time has probably now come when a condensed and intelligible 
          account, both of the facts and of the best mode of accounting for the 
          facts, will be acceptable to a wide circle of intelligent readers. Such 
          an account will here be attempted.</p>
        <p><em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glacial 
          Epoch.</em>--The phenomena that prove the comparatively recent occurrence 
          of a glacial epoch in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere 
          are exceedingly varied and extend over very wide areas. It will be well 
          therefore to state, first, what these facts are as exhibited in our 
          own country, referring afterwards to corresponding phenomena in other 
          parts of the world.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most striking and conclusive among 
          these facts are the grooved, scratched, <font color="990000">[[p. 120]]</font> 
          or striated rocks. These occur abundantly in Scotland, the Lake country, 
          and North Wales, and no rational explanation of them has yet been given, 
          except that they were formed by glaciers. In many valleys, as for instance 
          that of Llanberis in North Wales, hundreds of examples may be seen of 
          deep grooves several inches wide, smaller furrows, and stri&aelig; of 
          extreme fineness, whenever the rock is of sufficiently close texture 
          and sufficiently hard to receive and retain such marks. These grooves 
          or scratches often extend for many yards in length; they are found in 
          the bottom of the valley as well as high up on its sides, and they are 
          all (almost without exception) in one direction--that of the valley 
          itself--even though the particular surface they are upon slopes in another 
          direction. Where the native covering of turf is freshly removed, the 
          grooves and stri&aelig; are often seen in great perfection, and there 
          is reason to believe that such markings cover, or have once covered, 
          a large part of the rocky surfaces of the countries where they are now 
          found. Accompanying these stri&aelig; we find another phenomenon, hardly 
          less curious,--the rounding off or planing down of the hardest rocks 
          to a smooth undulating surface. Hard crystalline schists, with the strata 
          nearly vertical, and which one would expect to find exposing jagged 
          edges, are often ground off to a smooth, but never to a perfectly flat 
          surface. These smoothly-rounded surfaces<sub> </sub>are found not only 
          on single rocks, but over whole valleys and mountain-sides, and form 
          what are termed <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es, </em>from their having 
          the appearance at a distance of sheep lying down.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these two 
          phenomena are actually produced elsewhere by existing glaciers, while 
          there is no other known or even conceivable agency that could have produced 
          them. Whenever the Swiss glaciers retreat a little, as they sometimes 
          do, the rocks they have moved over are found to be rounded, grooved, 
          and striated just like those we now see in Wales and Scotland. The two 
          sets of phenomena are so exactly identical, that no one who has ever 
          compared them can doubt that they are due to the same causes. But we 
          have further and even more convincing evidence. Glaciers produce many 
          other effects besides these two; and whatever effects they now produce 
          in Switzerland, in Norway, or in Greenland, we find examples of similar 
          effects having been produced in our own country. The most striking of 
          these are moraines and travelled blocks, which must be briefly described.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every 
          existing glacier carries down with it great masses of rock, stones, 
          and earth, which fall on its surface from the precipices and mountain 
          slopes which hem it in. As the glacier slowly moves downward, this debris 
          forms long lines on each side, or on the centre whenever two glacier-streams 
          unite, and is finally deposited at its termination in a huge mound called 
          the terminal moraine. The decrease of a glacier may often be traced 
          by successive old moraines across the valley up which it has retreated. 
          When once seen and examined in connection with an existing glacier, 
          these moraines can always be distinguished almost at a glance. Their 
          position is most remarkable, having no apparent relation to the valley 
          or the surrounding slopes. They look like huge earthworks formed for 
          purposes of defence, rather than works of nature; and their composition 
          is equally peculiar, consisting of a mixture of earth and rocks of all 
          sizes, without any arrangement whatever, the rocks often being huge 
          angular masses just as they had split off the surrounding precipices. 
          Some of these rocky masses often rest on the very top of the moraine, 
          in positions where no other natural power but that of ice could have 
          placed them. Exactly similar mounds are found in the valleys of Wales 
          and Scotland, and always in districts where other evidences of ice-action 
          can be abundantly traced, and where the course of the glacier which 
          produced them can be readily understood.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phenomenon of travelled or perched blocks 
          is also a common one in all glacier-countries, marking out very clearly 
          the former extension of the ice. The glacier which fills a lateral valley 
          will often cross over the main valley, and abut against the opposite 
          slope, and will deposit there some portion of its terminal moraine. 
          But in these cases the end of the glacier will spread out laterally 
          and the moraine matter will be distributed over a large surface, so 
          that the only well-marked feature left by it will be some of the larger 
          masses of rock that may have been brought down. The same thing will 
          occur when a glacier surrounds an isolated knoll or overrides a projecting 
          spur, on both of which large blocks brought from a distance may be left 
          stranded. Such blocks are found abundantly in many districts of our 
          own country where other marks of glaciation exist, and they often consist 
          of a rock different from that on which they rest, or from any in the 
          immediate vicinity. They can, however, almost always be traced to their 
          source in one of the higher valleys from which the glacier descended; 
          and this remoteness of origin, combined with their great size, their 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 121]]</font> angular forms, and their singular 
          positions, often perched on the crest of a ridge, on a steep slope, 
          or on the summit of a knoll, altogether preclude any other known mode 
          of transport but by glaciers or floating ice.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the most 
          remarkable examples of these travelled blocks are to be seen on the 
          southern slopes of the Jura mountains. They consist of enormous angular 
          masses of granite, gneiss, and other crystalline rocks, quite foreign 
          to the Jura range which consists entirely of Jurassic limestones and 
          tertiary deposits, but exactly agreeing with those of the main Alpine 
          range, more than fifty miles away across the great central valley of 
          Switzerland. These blocks have been proved by Swiss geologists to have 
          been brought by the ancient glacier of the Rhone, which was fed by the 
          snows of the whole Alpine range, from Mont Blanc to Monte Rosa and the 
          head of the Rhone valley, a distance of nearly 120 miles, together with 
          the southern slopes of the Bernese Alps--a district which comprises 
          all the most extensive snowfields and glaciers in Switzerland. The whole 
          area between these two ranges, which may be roughly described as about 
          100 miles long by 30 wide and bounded by mountains from 7000 to 10,000 
          feet high, must have been literally filled with ice; and this enormous 
          glacier discharged itself at the mouth of the upper Rhone-valley, between 
          the Dent de Morcles and the Dent de Midi, in an ice-stream of such enormous 
          thickness as to fill up the bed of the Lake of Geneva, and, though spreading 
          widely over the valley, retaining a thickness of more than 2000 feet 
          when it reached the Jura.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blocks brought by it are found scattered 
          over the slopes of the Jura for a distance of about 100 miles, and it 
          is a very interesting fact, that they reach the greatest height in a 
          direct line with the course of the glacier, while on both sides of this 
          point they are found lower and lower. One of the largest of the blocks 
          is forty feet in diameter, and many others are of enormous size. They 
          vary considerably in the material of which they are composed; but they 
          have each been traced to their source, which has always been found in 
          a part of the Alpine range corresponding to their actual position on 
          the theory that they were brought, as described, by the great Rhone 
          glacier. Thus, all the blocks found to the east of a central point near 
          Neufchatel can be traced to the eastern side of the Rhone valley, while 
          those found towards Geneva have all come from the west side. It is evident 
          that, had these blocks been carried by floating ice during a period 
          of submergence (as was at first supposed), their distribution must have 
          been different. There could have been no accurate separation of those 
          derived from the opposite sides of the same valley, while all would 
          have been stranded at the same elevation, or in parallel lines indicating 
          the different heights at which the water stood at different epochs. 
          These considerations are so weighty, that they compelled Sir Charles 
          Lyell to withdraw the explanation he first gave--of the carriage of 
          the blocks by floating ice during a period of submergence--as quite 
          untenable, and to accept, as the only explanation which covered the 
          facts, the enormous glacier above described.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
          Similar phenomena, though nowhere on so grand a scale, are found in 
          the vicinity of all the mountain ranges of Central Europe, and they 
          undoubtedly demonstrate the fact of a recent change of climate, from 
          a time when all our higher mountains were covered with perpetual snow, 
          and the adjacent valleys were filled with glaciers at least as extensive 
          as those now found in Switzerland.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this conclusion, 
          marvellous as it is, by no means affords us an adequate conception of 
          the condition of our islands during the whole duration of the glacial 
          epoch; for there are other phenomena, best developed in Scotland, which 
          show that what we have hitherto described was but its concluding phase, 
          and that during its maximum development the mountainous parts of our 
          islands must have been reduced to a condition only to be now paralleled 
          in Greenland and the Antarctic regions. As few persons besides professed 
          geologists are acquainted with the weight of the evidence in support 
          of this statement, we will here briefly summarize it, referring our 
          readers to Mr. Geikie's volume for fuller details.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over almost all the lowlands, and in many 
          of the highland valleys of Scotland, there are immense superficial deposits 
          of clay, sand, gravel, or drift, which can be traced more or less certainly 
          to glacial action. Some of them are moraines, others are lacustrine 
          deposits in temporary lakes formed by moraines or glaciers, while others 
          have been formed or deposited under water during periods of submergence. 
          But below them all, and often lying directly on the solid rock, there 
          are extensive layers of a very tough clayey deposit called 'till.' It 
          is very fine in texture, very tenacious, and often of a stone-like hardness; 
          and it is always full of rocks and stones, which are of rude sub-angular 
          forms, rubbed smooth and partially rounded, and almost always covered 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 122]]</font> with scratches or deep stri&aelig;, 
          often crossing each other in various directions. Sometimes the stones 
          are so numerous, that there seems to be only just enough clay to unite 
          them into a solid mass; and they are of all sizes, from mere grit up 
          to rocks many feet in diameter. The 'till' is found chiefly in low-lying 
          districts, where it covers extensive areas, sometimes to the depth of 
          a hundred feet; while in the highlands it occurs in much smaller patches, 
          but in some of the broader valleys it forms terraces which have been 
          cut through by the streams. Occasionally it is found as high as two 
          thousand feet above the sea in hollows on hillsides, or in other situations 
          where it seems to have been protected from denudation.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'till' is 
          totally unstratified, the stones it contains being found all mixed together 
          and evidently unsorted by water, while the rock surfaces on which it 
          rests are invariably worn smooth, and greatly grooved and striated when 
          the rock is hard, while when it is soft or jointed it frequently has 
          a greatly broken surface, as if it had been subjected to enormous pressure. 
          The colour and texture of the 'till' and the nature of the stones it 
          contains all correspond with the character of the rock of the district, 
          so that it is clearly a local formation. It is often found underneath 
          moraines, drift, and other glacial deposits, but never overlies them, 
          so that it was certainly formed at an earlier date.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout Scotland, 
          where 'till' is found, the glacial stri&aelig;, perched blocks, <em>roches 
          moutonn&eacute;es, </em>and other marks of glacial action, occur very 
          high up the mountains, to at least 3000 and often even to 3500 feet 
          above the sea; while all lower hills and mountains are rounded and grooved 
          up to their very summits, and these grooves always radiate outwards 
          from the highest peaks and ridges towards the valleys or the sea.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these various 
          phenomena taken together are only explicable on the supposition that 
          the whole of Scotland was once buried under a vast ice-sheet, above 
          which only the highest mountains reared their summits. There is absolutely 
          no escape from this conclusion, for the facts which lead to it are not 
          local, found only in one spot or one valley, but general throughout 
          the entire length and breadth of Scotland; and these facts correspond 
          so wonderfully in every detail to this conclusion, and this only, as 
          to amount to absolute demonstration. The weight of this vast ice-sheet, 
          at least three thousand feet in maximum thickness, and continually moving 
          seaward with a slow grinding motion like that of all existing glaciers, 
          must have worn down the whole surface of the country, especially all 
          the prominences, leaving the grooves and stri&aelig; we still see, marking 
          the direction of its motion. All the loose stones and rocks which lay 
          on the surface would be pressed into the ice, the harder ones would 
          serve as scratching and grinding tools, and would thus themselves become 
          worn, scratched, and striated as we find them, while all the softer 
          masses would be ground up into impalpable mud along with the material 
          worn off the rock-surfaces of the country.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peculiar 
          characters of the 'till,' its fineness and tenacity, correspond closely 
          with the fine matter which now issues from under all glaciers, making 
          the streams milky white, yellow, or brown, according to the nature of 
          the rock. The sediment from such water is a fine unctuous ooze, only 
          needing pressure to form it into a tenacious clay; and when 'till' is 
          exposed to the action of water it dissolves into a similar soft, sticky, 
          unctuous mud. The present glaciers of the Alps, being confined to valleys 
          which carry off a large quantity of drainage water, lose this mud perhaps 
          as rapidly as it is formed; but when the ice covered almost the whole 
          country, there would be comparatively little drainage water, and the 
          mud and stones would collect in vast compact masses in sheltered hollows, 
          and especially in the lower flat valleys, which would necessarily be 
          ground into hollows or basins where the pressure of the ice was greatest. 
          As the ice retreated, the areas of greatest pressure would retreat also, 
          and the hollows would be left full of the stones and glacier-mud which 
          was continually being formed. At a later period it was greatly denuded 
          by rain and rivers, but, as we have seen, large quantities remain to 
          this day, to tell the wonderful story of its formation. It was at this 
          time that the glaciers of Wales and of Ireland acquired their greatest 
          extension, and there is clear evidence that the ice on the west of Scotland 
          extended far out to sea, overspreading all the islands, and connecting 
          itself in one unbroken mass with the almost equally extensive ice-sheet 
          that covered Ireland.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that the great change of climate, 
          which produced such marvellous effects in the British Isles, could not 
          have been confined to them; and accordingly we find that there are strikingly 
          similar proofs that Scandinavia and much of Northern Europe have also 
          been covered with a continuous ice-sheet. We have already seen that 
          huge glaciers almost buried the Alps, carrying granitic blocks to the 
          Jura and depositing them on its flanks to a height of 3450 <font color="990000">[[p. 
          123]]</font> feet above the sea-level; while to the south, in the plains 
          of Italy, the terminal moraines left by the retreating glaciers have 
          formed considerable hills, those of Ivrea, the work of the great glacier 
          of the Val d'Aosta, being fifteen miles across, and from 700 to 1500 
          feet high.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In North America 
          the marks of glaciation are even more extensive and perhaps more remarkable 
          than in Europe, stretching over the whole eastern part of Canada, and 
          at least as far as the 40th parallel of latitude, south of the great 
          lakes. There is, over considerable areas, a deposit like the 'till' 
          of Scotland, produced by the grinding of the great ice-sheet when it 
          was at its maximum thickness. In the eastern part of Canada and the 
          United States, the ice appears to have risen to its greatest height 
          over the northern watershed of the St. Lawrence near its mouth, and 
          to have extended across to the White Mountains of New England, filling 
          up the Gulf of St. Lawrence, overspreading Nova Scotia and Long Island, 
          and terminating in an ice-cliff in the Atlantic. It is believed by Mr. 
          J. D. Dana to have had a thickness of over 5000 feet in New England, 
          and to have reached a height of 13,000 feet over the northern watershed 
          of the St. Lawrence. At a later period the local glaciers left moraine-matter, 
          travelled-blocks, and striated rocks, as in Europe. There are also in 
          North America, as well as in Britain and Scandinavia, proofs of the 
          submersion of the land beneath the sea, to a depth of more than a thousand 
          feet, in the latter part of the glacial epoch; but this is a subject 
          we need not here enter upon, as our special object is to show the reality 
          and magnitude of that wonderful and comparatively recent change of climate 
          termed the glacial epoch.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many educated 
          persons, and even men of science who have not given much attention to 
          the subject, look upon the whole of this enquiry as an elaborate but 
          highly improbable theory, made to fit certain phenomena which are otherwise 
          difficult to explain; and they would not be much surprised if they were 
          some day told that it was all a delusion, and that somebody had explained 
          the whole thing in a more simple way. The outline now given of the wide 
          basis of facts on which the theory rests, will, it is hoped, prevent 
          any of our readers from being imposed upon by such statements or disturbed 
          by any sceptical doubts. There is perhaps no great conclusion in any 
          science, which rests upon a surer foundation than this does; and if 
          we are ever to be guided by our reason in deducing the unknown from 
          the known, or the past from the present, we cannot refuse our assent 
          to the reality of the glacial epoch in all its more important features. 
          Just as surely as the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne or of Victoria demonstrate 
          the former existence of active volcanoes and flowing lava-streams, so 
          surely do the striated rocks, the perched blocks, the moraines, and 
          the 'till,' demonstrate the former existence of the glaciers, by which 
          alone they could have been produced.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before quitting this part of our subject, 
          we must notice some curious facts, which seem to show that there were 
          recurring periods of warmth during the glacial epoch itself, as they 
          have a very important bearing on the theory by which changes of climate 
          in general seem to be best explained.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'till,' as we have seen, could only have 
          been formed when the country was buried under an ice-sheet of enormous 
          thickness, and when in the parts so buried there could have been neither 
          animal nor vegetable life. But in several places in Scotland, layers 
          of sand and gravel with beds of peaty matter have been found intercalated 
          between layers of 'till.' Sometimes these intercalated beds are very 
          thin, but in other cases they are twenty or thirty feet thick, and contain 
          the remains of the extinct ox, the Irish elk, the horse, reindeer, and 
          mammoth. Here then we have evidence of two distinct periods of intense 
          cold when the country was buried in ice, and of an intervening mild 
          period sufficiently prolonged for the country to become covered with 
          vegetation and stocked with large animals. In some districts borings 
          have proved the existence of no less than four distinct formations of 
          'till,' separated from each other by beds of sand from two to twenty 
          feet in thickness.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> In North America similar 
          beds occur, intercalated between true glacial deposits, and containing 
          remains of the elephant, mastodon, and great extinct beaver. In Switzerland 
          a similar interglacial bed contains peat, and remains of pines, oaks, 
          birches, and larch, with bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, stag, and 
          cave-bear, and also abundance of insects.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
          There seems, therefore, to be ample proof that the glacial epoch did 
          not consist of one continuous change from a temperate to a cold and 
          arctic climate, which, having reached a maximum, then passed slowly 
          and completely away, but that there were certainly two, and probably 
          many, distinct alternations of arctic and temperate climates.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the evidence of such <font color="990000">[[p. 
          124]]</font> alternations is scanty, but a little consideration will 
          show that we could not expect to find more complete evidence, because 
          each succeeding ice-sheet would necessarily grind down or otherwise 
          destroy most of the superficial deposits left by its predecessors, while 
          the torrents that must have been produced by the melting of the ice 
          would wash away most of the fragments which had escaped. It is therefore 
          fortunate that we find <em>any</em> portions of interglacial deposits 
          containing vegetable and animal remains; and, as we might expect, these 
          seem to have been formed when each succeeding phase of the cold period 
          was less severe than those which preceded it, in other words, when the 
          glacial epoch was passing away. If there had been similar intercalated 
          warm periods while it was coming on, it is hardly possible that any 
          record of them could have been preserved, because each succeeding extension 
          of the ice would be greater than that which preceded it, and would certainly 
          destroy all traces of animal or vegetable remains in superficial deposits.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is a very 
          remarkable fact, that the only theory which affords a distinct explanation 
          of the changes which brought about the glacial period, leads to the 
          conclusion that such alternations of warm and cold climates must have 
          occurred during its continuance; and as the same theory also explains, 
          more or less completely, the other changes of climate of which we have 
          geological evidence, it will be most convenient to our readers at once 
          to give an outline of that theory, and to show as clearly as possible 
          by its aid how the glacial epoch was brought about. In doing so we shall 
          have the opportunity of clearing up some of the misconceptions with 
          which the subject has been encumbered; and we shall then proceed to 
          give an account of the proofs of warm arctic climates, and to show how 
          far the same theory is able to explain them.</p>
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astronomical 
          causes of periodical changes of Climate</em>.--The elliptical orbit 
          in which the earth moves round the sun has an eccentricity of about 
          one and a half millions of miles, which causes us to be sometimes three 
          millions of miles nearer the sun than at others. Strange as it may seem, 
          we in the northern hemisphere are nearest to the sun in winter, and 
          furthest off in summer, while in the southern hemisphere it is the reverse; 
          and this peculiarity must have some effect in making our northern winters 
          less severe than those of the Antarctic lands. But the earth moves more 
          rapidly in that part of its orbit which is nearest the sun, so that 
          our winter is not only milder, but several days shorter, than that of 
          the southern hemisphere. There can be no doubt that if this state of 
          things were reversed, our winters occurring when we were furthest from 
          the sun, or in <em>aphelion</em>, and our summers when we were nearest 
          the sun, or in <em>perihelion</em>, we should experience a decided difference 
          in climate, our winters being more severe and longer, and our summers 
          hotter but shorter. Now there is a combination of astronomical causes 
          (the precession of the equinoxes and the revolution of the apsides) 
          which actually brings this change about every 10,500 years, so that 
          after this interval the condition of the two hemispheres is reversed 
          as regards nearness to the sun in summer and comparative duration of 
          summer and winter, and this change has been going on throughout all 
          geological periods. As we shall continually have to refer to these changes, 
          we shall speak of them as the 'opposite phases of precession,' when 
          winter in the northern hemisphere occurs at <em>aphelion</em> or <em>perihelion</em>, 
          that is when the earth is farthest from or nearest to the sun.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the amount 
          of eccentricity itself varies very largely, though very slowly, and 
          it is now nearly at a minimum. It also varies very irregularly, but 
          its amount has been calculated by Mr. Croll and others for 3,000,000 
          years back, during which time it has much more frequently been of greater 
          than of less amount than it is now. Going backward from the present 
          time, we find that for about 25,000 years it was slightly greater, and 
          for 30,000 years more rather less, than it is now, so that for a period 
          of nearly 60,000 years back we can impute no important change of climate 
          to this cause. But it then increases rapidly till about 72,000 years 
          ago, when it was double, while 100,000 years ago it was more than two-and-a-half 
          times, its present amount. Going back still further, it diminishes for 
          50,000 years to double, and then again increases for 60,000 years till 
          it becomes nearly three-and-a-half times what it is now. It then diminishes 
          rapidly, and after one more considerable rise, sinks to almost exactly 
          its present amount 400,000 years ago. We thus find that for a period 
          of about 140,000 years, beginning 70,000 years back, the eccentricity 
          was always more than double its present amount, with two maxima, of 
          more than two-and-a-half and nearly three-and-a-half times that quantity. 
          It is to this long period of high eccentricity that geologists are pretty 
          generally agreed to refer the glacial epoch, and to this we shall accordingly 
          for the present confine our remarks.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then endeavor to ascertain what would 
          have been the climatic condition of <font color="990000">[[p. 125]]</font> 
          our country at the period of greatest eccentricity 210,000 years ago. 
          The mean distance of the sun may be taken at 92,500,000 of miles, and 
          the eccentricity at the period we are referring to was, in round numbers, 
          five millions of miles. The sun's distance would therefore be 97,500,000 
          miles when in <em>aphelion</em>, and 87,500,000 when in <em>perihelion</em>--a 
          difference of ten millions of miles. The question is, what difference 
          would this make in our climate, when our winters occurred in <em>aphelion</em> 
          or at a time when we were furthest from the sun? And in estimating this 
          we must remember that the quantity of heat received from the sun is 
          in inverse proportion to the square of the distance, so that instead 
          of being about one-tenth less, as the simple proportion of the above 
          numbers would give, the difference will be very nearly one-fifth--that 
          is, the earth would be receiving only four-fifths of the heat in <em>aphelion</em> 
          that it received in <em>perihelion</em>.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand what effect this would 
          have on climate, we must first obtain a clear idea of the power of the 
          sun in raising the earth's surface-temperature; and on this subject 
          there is a very general misconception, owing to the unscientific manner 
          in which all thermometers are graduated and figured, so that we reckon 
          degrees of temperature either from the freezing-point of water or from 
          a point thirty-two degrees below it. The true zero from which we ought 
          to measure terrestrial temperatures is, however, about 271&deg; F. below 
          the freezing point, or -239&deg; F., this being the temperature to which 
          the surface of the earth would sink if the heat of the sun were entirely 
          withdrawn from it. When therefore we speak of the mean temperature of 
          the equator being 80&deg; F., while that of England is about 50&deg; 
          F., these numbers convey no real information, either as to the total 
          amount of sun-heat received or as to its proportions in the two latitudes. 
          But if we add to both of these numbers 239&deg; F., we obtain 319&deg; 
          F. for the absolute temperature of the equator, and 280&deg; <em>[sic]</em> 
          F. for that of England, and these numbers are truly proportional to 
          the amount of heat in each place due, directly or indirectly, to the 
          solar influence. We may here mention that it is the universal opinion 
          of modern physicists, that the internal heat of the earth escapes outward 
          so slowly as to contribute no sensible portion of that which we perceive 
          as climatic temperature, and that it may therefore be neglected in all 
          calculations as to comparatively recent changes of climate. Two facts 
          may be adduced, which, if they do not prove, are at all events quite 
          in accordance with this view, while they are opposed to the view that 
          the internal heat makes itself felt in any important degree. The one 
          is, that in the very deepest tropical oceans the bottom temperature 
          is close to the freezing-point; the other, that in many parts of Siberia, 
          after passing below the surface-soil, there are found seventy and in 
          some places several hundred feet of permanently frozen ground.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean January temperature of England may 
          be taken at 39&deg; F., which is equivalent to 278&deg; F. of absolute 
          temperature; and if we calculate what would be the mean temperature 
          of the same month, when the sun was distant 97,500,000, instead of 91,000,000 
          of miles as it is now, we find it comes out 242&deg; F., which is equivalent 
          to 3&deg; F. of our thermometers, or 29&deg; of frost. Calculated in 
          the same way, the summer would be excessively hot, the July mean temperature 
          being 125&deg; F. The winter, however, would be 26 days longer than 
          the summer, and the total quantity of sun-heat received by us during 
          the year would be exactly the same as it is now. How then, it may be 
          asked, could this produce a glacial period? Would not the snow that 
          fell in the winter be all melted by the intensely hot summer? The answer 
          to these questions involves considerations of great interest, which 
          must be discussed in some detail; but we may first point out, that the 
          figures above given are not to be taken as implying that these temperatures 
          would actually occur, but rather as quantities of heating power, which 
          might be distributed over wider areas or longer times, so as to produce 
          results differing considerably from the maxima and minima indicated. 
          Our actual climate does not depend so much on the amount of sun-heat 
          we ourselves receive, as on the way in which the heat of adjacent regions 
          is distributed. Owing to our insular position and the influence of the 
          Gulf-stream, we have a much warmer and more uniform climate than is 
          due to our latitude, yet the cold arctic winds often lower our temperature 
          to the freezing-point, at times when we are receiving an amount of sun-heat 
          which would give us genial warmth if its effect were not thus counteracted.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time we are speaking of, the winter 
          of the whole northern hemisphere would be as much colder on the average 
          as our own would be, that is, about 36&deg; F. colder than now. The 
          tropics and parts of the southern hemisphere would also be colder, so 
          that it is almost certain that our climate in winter would have been 
          quite as bad if not worse than these figures represent, and would probably 
          have been something like <font color="990000">[[p. 126]]</font> that 
          of Yakoutsk in Northern Siberia, the coldest place in the world outside 
          the Arctic circle. It is hardly possible, therefore, to exaggerate the 
          degree of winter cold of Britain and of all the north temperate zone 
          at that period; and the winter would not only be thus intensely cold, 
          but all its effects would be exaggerated by its being very long. Then 
          would follow a summer of great heat, with a sun probably as fierce as 
          that of India or Australia, and which, though shorter than our present 
          summers by nearly a month, would still be long as compared with that 
          of the Arctic regions. And during this summer, we must remember, all 
          the world would be warmer; evaporation would be greater than now, and 
          the surface waters of the ocean, being kept at a high temperature, would 
          give us warmer and moister breezes than we now possess. Again, therefore, 
          we have to ask, could the winter do anything that the summer could not 
          undo? In order to be in a position to answer this question, we must 
          consider how the heat received from the sun is disposed of, and the 
          influence of water and air, snow and ice, in distributing or storing 
          up heat or cold.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great aerial 
          ocean which surrounds the earth has the wonderful property of allowing 
          the heat-rays from the sun to pass through it without being warmed by 
          them. When the earth is heated, however, the air gets warm by contact 
          with it, and the vapour and carbonic acid in the air are also impervious 
          to the radiant heat given out by the earth, and are therefore warmed 
          by radiation. But the air thus warmed is in continual motion, owing 
          to change of density. It is lifted up and pushed aside by cooler and 
          heavier air; and thus heat can never <em>accumulate</em> in the atmosphere, 
          or warm it beyond a very moderate degree, so that the long-continued 
          sun-heat of the tropics is in great part carried away to give warmth 
          to colder regions. Water also is mobile; and though it receives and 
          stores up a great deal of heat, it is for ever dispersing it over the 
          earth. The rain, which brings down a certain portion of heat from the 
          atmosphere or absorbs it from the earth on which it falls, flows away 
          in streams to the ocean; while the ocean itself, constantly impelled 
          by the winds, forms great currents, which carry off the surplus heated 
          water of the tropics to the temperate and even to the Polar regions. 
          An immense quantity of sun-heat is also used up in evaporating water, 
          and the vapour is conveyed by the aerial currents to distant countries, 
          where, on being condensed into rain, it gives up much of this heat to 
          the earth and atmosphere. The power of water in carrying away heat is 
          well seen in the abnormally high temperature of arid deserts, while 
          the still more powerful influence of air can be best understood by considering 
          how rapidly a few hours of our northern sunshine will heat a tightly-closed 
          glasshouse far above the temperature produced even by the vertical sun 
          of the equator where the air is free to circulate. We can quite understand, 
          then, that, were not a very large proportion of the sun's heat carried 
          away from the tropics by air and water, those parts of the earth would 
          be uninhabitable furnaces, as would indeed <em>any</em> part of the 
          earth where the sun shone brightly throughout a summer's day.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though sun-heat 
          cannot be stored up beyond a very moderate amount, yet cold can be stored 
          up to an almost unlimited extent, owing to the peculiar property of 
          water in becoming solid at a very moderately low temperature; and as 
          this is a point of the highest importance in the enquiry we are now 
          pursuing, it must be carefully considered.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then examine the very different effects 
          produced by water falling as rain, or as snow, which may yet not differ 
          from each other more than two or three degrees in temperature. The rain, 
          however much of it may fall, runs off rapidly into rivers, and soon 
          reaches the ocean. If cold, it cools the air and the earth temporarily, 
          but can produce no permanent effect, because a few hours or days of 
          sunshine restore to the air and the surface soil all the heat they had 
          lost. But if snow falls for a long time, it remains where it fell, becomes 
          compacted into a mass, and keeps the earth below it and the air above 
          it at or very near the freezing-point till all is melted. If the quantity 
          is great, it may take days, or weeks, or months, to melt it all; and 
          if more falls during winter than can be melted during the succeeding 
          summer, then the snow will be perpetual, as we find it above a certain 
          height on all great mountains, and in some parts of the Arctic and Antarctic 
          regions, and then no amount of sun-heat warms the air much above the 
          freezing-point. In N. latitude 80&deg;, Captain Scoresby had the pitch 
          on one side of his ship melted by the heat of the sun, while salt water 
          was freezing on the other side, owing to the coldness of the air.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to remember that this 
          storing up of cold depends entirely on the amount of snowfall and the 
          want of sufficient heat to melt it, not at all on the actual cold of 
          the winter or the average cold of the year. A place may be intensely 
          cold in winter and may even have a very <font color="990000">[[p. 127]]</font> 
          short summer, yet if so little snow falls that it is quickly melted, 
          there is nothing to prevent that summer being warm and the earth producing 
          a rich and luxuriant vegetation. As examples of this, we have great 
          forests in the north of Asia and America, where the winters are colder 
          and the summers shorter than in southern Greenland, or in Heard Island, 
          both of which are almost wholly covered with perpetual snow and ice. 
          At the Jardin, on the Mont Blanc range, surrounded by perpetual snow, 
          the lowest winter temperature is -6&deg; F., while at Upernivik in Greenland 
          it is -49&deg; F., yet in summer the thermometer often rises to 50&deg; 
          F. or even to 58&deg; F., and the country is covered with a luxuriant 
          herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. Even in the very highest latitudes 
          reached by our last Arctic expedition, there is very little perpetual 
          snow or ice; for Captain Nares tells us, that north of Hayes Sound, 
          in latitude 79&deg; N., the mountains were remarkably free of ice-cap, 
          while extensive tracts of lands were free from snow during the summer.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
          And the reason of this is evidently the scanty snowfall, which rendered 
          it sometimes difficult to obtain enough to form protecting banks round 
          the ships; and this was north of 80&deg; latitude, where the sun was 
          absent for 142 days.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very 
          remarkable and most suggestive fact, that nowhere in the world at the 
          present time are there any extensive lowlands covered with perpetual 
          snow. The Tundras of Siberia and the barren grounds of North America 
          are all clad with some kind of summer vegetation; and it is only where 
          there are lofty mountains or high plateaux, as in Greenland, Spitzbergen, 
          and Grinnell Land, that glaciers, accompanied by perpetual snow, descend 
          to the sea-level. In the Antarctic regions there are extensive highlands, 
          and these are everywhere exposed to the influence of the moist sea air; 
          and it is here accordingly that we find what appears to be a veritable 
          belt of permanent ice covering the whole circumference of the Antarctic 
          continent, and forming a girdle of ice-cliffs which almost everywhere 
          descend into the sea. Such Antarctic islands as South Georgia, South 
          Shetland, and Heard Island, are often said to have perpetual snow at 
          the sea-level; but they are all mountainous and send glaciers down into 
          the sea, and as they receive moist air on every side, the precipitation, 
          which almost all takes the form of snow even in summer, is of course 
          unusually large.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Payer 
          of the Austrian Arctic expedition has furnished us with a clue to these 
          phenomena, by his observation of the rate of evaporation of ice during 
          the Arctic summer. He found that no less than four feet thick of ice 
          was thus evaporated. Now to replace this, a quantity of snow equivalent 
          to about forty-five inches of rain must fall; and as the precipitation 
          rarely reaches this amount outside the tropics, except in islands and 
          in mountainous districts, and it is generally less than half as much 
          over the greater part of the northern continents, we can quite understand 
          why perpetual snow should be so rare a phenomenon on lowlands. Mountains, 
          however, acting as condensers, are exposed to great precipitation, and 
          when covered with snow their condensing power becomes greater, and this 
          tends to increase the accumulation of snow; while the rarefied air has 
          less capacity for heat, and is thus unable to melt or evaporate the 
          snow as it does on the lowlands. We can thus understand how it is that 
          only where there are extensive highlands, to act both as condensers 
          of moisture and accumulators of snow, do we find anything approaching 
          the condition of things which appears to have prevailed in our country 
          during the glacial epoch.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations seem to render Mr. Croll's 
          theory of polar ice-caps, constantly increasing in thickness to the 
          pole itself, quite untenable. He believes that the Antarctic continent 
          is now covered by such an ice-cap, the thickness of which at the South 
          Pole he calculates at twelve miles, giving a slope at an angle of only 
          half a degree,--and less than this, he says, will not produce motion. 
          To the objection, that the outer band of ice will condense all the vapour, 
          he replies that however small the annual amount of snowfall may be, 
          if more falls than is melted, the ice must continue to accumulate year 
          by year, till its thickness in the centre of the continent be sufficiently 
          great to produce motion.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> But all the evidence 
          we have of the rapid diminution of snowfall and rainfall inland, and 
          especially when the coast consists of lofty mountains, as in the Antarctic 
          regions, combined with the enormous evaporating power of the four months' 
          polar sun, render such continuous increase as he supposes quite impossible. 
          He has himself told us that during summer, from May 10th to August 3rd, 
          a period of eighty-five days, the quantity of heat received from the 
          sun in consequence of his remaining above the horizon is actually greater 
          at the North Pole than at the equator.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> 
          The <font color="990000">[[p. 128]]</font> greatest amount of snowfall 
          that occurs on lowlands is perhaps on the shores of Lake Superior, where, 
          according to Alexander Agassiz (as quoted by Sir C. Lyell), the average 
          annual snowfall for fifteen years was seventy-two feet. Yet the snow 
          never lay more than six feet thick on the ground, and disappeared completely 
          in summer; although for four winter months the temperature was 5&deg; 
          F. below zero.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> We may be quite sure, then, 
          that beyond the mountain barrier of the Antarctic continent there are 
          either lowlands and plateaux free from snow in summer, or an icy sea 
          like that around the North Pole; but certainly no continuous ice-cap 
          like that imagined by Mr. Croll.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in accordance 
          with all these facts that the more remarkable indications of glaciation 
          are always found in the vicinity of mountain ranges of sufficient altitude 
          and extent to form condensers of the aqueous vapour and accumulators 
          of snow, and that such indications point to a maximum of glaciation 
          wherever the geographical position is such as to favour excessive rainfall. 
          Thus in America the White Mountains of New England and the plateau north 
          of the St. Lawrence have been the centres of the greatest glaciation 
          on that continent; while in Europe, the Scandinavian mountains, and 
          those of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, together with the great central 
          mass of the Alps, furnish the most remarkable evidences of extensive 
          glaciation.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these various 
          considerations it is clear, that the increased cold of winter, when 
          the eccentricity was great and the sun at its greatest distance during 
          that season, would not of itself produce a glacial epoch, unless the 
          amount of vapour to be condensed was also exceptionally great. Now the 
          greatest quantity of snow falls in the Arctic regions in summer and 
          autumn, and with us the greatest quantity of rain falls in the autumnal 
          months. It is probable, therefore, that in all northern lands glaciation 
          would commence at the time when autumn occurred in <em>aphelion</em>. 
          All the rain which falls on our mountains at that season would then 
          fall as snow, and, being further increased by the snow of winter, would 
          form accumulations which the summer would not melt. As time went on 
          and the <em>aphelion</em> occurred in winter, the perennial snow on 
          the mountains would chill the summer vapours, so that they too would 
          fall as snow, and thus increase the amount of deposition; and this would 
          be still further increased from causes which have been admirably discussed 
          by Mr. Croll.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade winds 
          owe their existence to the great difference between the temperature 
          of the equator and the poles, which causes a constant flow of air towards 
          the equator. The strength of this flow depends on the difference of 
          temperature, and this difference is now greatest between the South Pole 
          and the equator, owing to the much greater accumulation of ice in the 
          Antarctic regions. The consequence is, that the south-east trades are 
          stronger than the north-east, the division between them being considerably 
          on the north side of the equator. But just in proportion to the strength 
          of the trade winds is the strength of the anti-trades--the upper current 
          which carries the warm moisture-laden air of the tropics towards the 
          poles. These are now strongest in the southern hemisphere, and thus 
          they supply the moisture necessary to produce the enormous quantity 
          of ice in the Antarctic seas. But during the period we are discussing--of 
          high eccentricity and the northern winter in <em>aphelion</em>--this 
          state of things would be reversed. The South Pole, having its winter 
          in <em>perihelion</em>, would be nearly free of ice, while the north-temperate 
          zone would be largely snow-clad, and the north-east trades would therefore 
          be far stronger than now. The south-westerly anti-trades would also 
          be much stronger, and would bring with them the increased quantity of 
          moisture, which is the chief thing required to produce a condition of 
          glaciation.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased force of the north-east trades 
          will have, however, another and totally distinct effect, which will 
          still further increase the tendency to an accumulation of perpetual 
          snow and ice. It is now generally admitted that we owe our mild climate 
          and our comparative freedom from snow to the influence of the Gulf-stream, 
          which equally ameliorates the climate of Scandinavia and Spitzbergen, 
          as shown by the northward curvature of the isothermal lines, so that 
          Trondhjem in N. lat. 63&deg; 25' has the same mean temperature as Halifax 
          (Nova Scotia) in N. lat. 45&deg;. The quantity of heat brought into 
          the North Atlantic by the Gulf-stream depends mainly on the superior 
          strength of the south-east trades. When the north-east trades were the 
          more powerful, its strength would certainly be much less, while it is 
          possible, as Mr. Croll thinks, that almost the whole of it might be 
          diverted southward, owing to the peculiar form of the east coast of 
          South America, and would go to swell the Brazilian current and ameliorate 
          the climate of the southern hemisphere.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 129]]</font> That 
          some effects of this nature would follow from any increase of the arctic 
          and decrease of the antarctic ice, may be considered certain; and Mr. 
          Croll has clearly shown that in this case cause and effect act and react 
          on each other in a remarkable way. The increase of snow and ice in the 
          northern hemisphere is the cause of an increased supply of moisture 
          being brought by the more powerful anti-trades, and this greater supply 
          of moisture leads to an extension of the ice, which reacts in still 
          further increasing the supply of moisture. The same increase of snow 
          and ice diminishes the power of the Gulf-stream, and this diminution 
          makes both summer and winter colder, and thus helps on still further 
          the formation and preservation of the icy mantle. At the very same time 
          these agencies are acting in the reverse way in the opposite hemisphere, 
          diminishing the supply of moisture carried by the anti-trades, but increasing 
          the temperature by means of southward ocean-currents.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now sufficiently 
          answered the question, why the short hot summer would not melt the snow 
          which accumulated during the long cold winter produced by high eccentricity 
          and autumn or winter in <em>aphelion</em>, even though the amount of 
          heat received from the sun in the whole year was exactly the same as 
          now. The reasons are mainly two: first, that heat cannot be permanently 
          accumulated, being continually carried away by winds and flowing water, 
          while cold can be so accumulated, owing to the comparative immobility 
          of snow and ice; and, secondly, because there are two great agencies, 
          the winds and the ocean-currents, which are so affected by an increase 
          of the snow and ice towards one pole and its diminution at the other, 
          as to help on the process when it has once begun, and to produce by 
          their action and reaction a maximum of effect, which without their aid 
          would be altogether unattainable. To these we may add a third agency 
          which we have not yet mentioned--that snow and ice reflect heat (as 
          they do light) to a much greater degree than do land or water. The heat, 
          therefore, of the short summer would be partly lost by reflection, and 
          partly used up in melting or evaporating a certain portion of snow. 
          Much of it too would be reflected from the upper surface of the clouds 
          which, owing to intense evaporation at this season, would be very prevalent 
          in the north temperate zone. Combining these various causes and effects, 
          we have little difficulty in comprehending how the wonderful phenomena 
          of glaciation in our own country, in the Alps of Central Europe, and 
          over extensive regions in North America, were brought about.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before quitting 
          this part of our subject, we must briefly refer to the changes of level 
          of the sea and land which occurred during the glacial period, and which 
          Mr. Croll believes were mainly due to a shifting of the earth's centre 
          of gravity owing to a transfer of the ice-cap from one pole to the other, 
          thereby causing an accumulation of water around the heavier pole. There 
          is evidence of many distinct periods of submergence. Mr. James Geikie 
          believes that during the greatest extension of the ice, the land was 
          somewhat lower than it is now; for he says that as the ice melted away 
          in Scotland the sea occupied its place, following its retreating footsteps 
          and laying down the boulder-clay; but this submergence did not exceed 
          200 or 260 feet. At a later period, the south of Scotland and Wales 
          were submerged to a depth of about 1300 feet or more, up to which height 
          marine shells are found in the drift. The land then rose again, with 
          several pauses, till Britain became joined to the Continent, as it had 
          been before the glacial epoch. Another submergence afterwards took place 
          to a less amount, and then a slight elevation, bringing the land into 
          the state in which it is now. A somewhat similar series of changes appear 
          to have taken place in North America, but owing to the absence of marine 
          shells the amount of subsidence is doubtful. Mr. James D. Dana believes 
          that the land stood higher during the glacial period, and we have seen 
          how important a factor this is in initiating glaciation and increasing 
          its intensity.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assumption that an ice-cap, continually 
          increasing in thickness, extended from lat. 50&deg; in Europe and 40&deg; 
          in North America up to the pole, it has been calculated that a rise 
          of the sea-level would be produced in the latitude of Edinburgh of about 
          800 or 1000 feet. But if, as we have endeavoured to prove, no such general 
          ice-cap ever existed, but merely local ice-sheets collected over all 
          high lands which were areas of great precipitation, then probably not 
          more than one-fifth of this amount of ocean-rise would occur, sufficient 
          to account for the submergence at the period of the formation of the 
          boulder-clay, and for the various raised beaches at lower levels. The 
          greater subsidences were probably local, and were perhaps due to the 
          enormous weight of the accumulations of ice over given areas. Owing 
          to the earth's crust giving way slowly to such strains, subsidence would 
          only begin when the ice-sheet had nearly attained its maximum extent, 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 130]]</font> and would probably continue for 
          some time while it was diminishing; and this seems to accord very well 
          with the ascertained facts.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will now be 
          seen that the theory, by which the glacial epoch is accounted for, explains 
          also those curious indications of intercalated warm periods to which 
          we have already referred. For after a lapse of about 10,500 years the 
          <em>aphelion</em>, or time of minimum sun-heat in the northern hemisphere, 
          would have gradually changed from winter to summer, and the <em>perihelion</em>, 
          or time of maximum sun-heat, from summer to winter. The result would 
          be, that our winters would then be much warmer and our summers somewhat 
          cooler than they are now, and we should thus have a kind of perpetual 
          spring. At the same time the south-westerly winds would be less strong, 
          and would bring less vapour, while the Gulf-stream would be much stronger, 
          and this would still further ameliorate our climate and help to get 
          rid of all the snow and ice, till at the height of this mild epoch both 
          would be probably unknown. We find then that our theory necessitates 
          the existence of these warm interglacial periods, the evidences for 
          which were once such a puzzle to geologists: and we cannot but admit 
          that this circumstance is an additional support to the theory. We have 
          now, however, to consider a series of facts of the most interesting 
          nature, which bring out this aspect of the value of our theory in a 
          still more convincing manner.</p>
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of the former occurrence of Warm 
          Climates in Arctic Regions</em>.--That a milder climate prevailed in 
          the Arctic regions, at a not very remote epoch, is proved by two distinct 
          kinds of evidence. We have, first, the remains of large herbivorous 
          mammalia, such as the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, bison, and horse, 
          found in the icy alluvial deposits of Northern Siberia, and sometimes 
          preserved with the skin and carcass entire. These remains occur over 
          the whole area of Northern Asia, and are abundant in the Liakhov Islands, 
          nearly ten degrees north of the Arctic circle; and though the animals 
          may have been overwhelmed by floods and buried in icy deposits, it is 
          generally admitted that, in order to supply such large beasts with suitable 
          food, the climate of Northern Siberia must have been less severe than 
          it is now. Less doubtful proofs of a mild climate are however afforded 
          by the numerous discoveries of unfossilized trees in the arctic lands 
          of North America. Remains of large pine-trees were found abundantly 
          by Sir Robert M'Clure in a ravine on the west coast of Baring Island 
          (about 73&deg; N. lat.). A piece of one of these trees which was brought 
          home was twelve inches in diameter, and was estimated to have seventy 
          rings of annual growth. Similar remains have been found in Prince Patrick 
          Island, and in Wellington Channel, much further north; and all the observers 
          agree that these trees grew where they are found, although they are 
          more than 700 miles farther north than similar trees grow now. Trees 
          capable of being still used as fuel are found in about the same latitude 
          on the Liakhov Islands off the north coast of Siberia. Here we have 
          undoubted proofs of a considerably milder climate in the extreme north; 
          and the perfect condition of preservation in which the trees are found 
          renders it probable that they are to be referred to one of the last 
          mild phases of the glacial epoch.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very much more remarkable, however, are the 
          remains of a luxuriant flora of the Miocene period, which have been 
          found in great abundance in many arctic localities, especially in Iceland, 
          Greenland, and Spitzbergen, with smaller deposits at the Mackenzie River, 
          in Banks's Land, and in Grinnell Land, lat. 81&deg; 45' N. This flora 
          consisted of conifers in great abundance, more than fifty species being 
          known, about two hundred and thirty flowering plants (Monocotyledons 
          and Dicotyledons), and seventeen species of ferns and horsetails. Taking 
          the plants found in Greenland, in 70&deg; N. latitude, as well representing 
          the general character of this flora, we find seven species of oaks, 
          two planes, three beeches, four poplars, two willows, two vines, a walnut, 
          a chestnut, a sassafras, a liquidambar, a magnolia, a plum, and several 
          shrubby plants, together with sequoias allied to the mammoth trees of 
          California, and salisburias allied to the curious gingko-tree of Japan--in 
          all one hundred and thirty-seven species of trees and shrubs, often 
          beautifully preserved, and many of them possessing finely developed 
          foliage. Of course we cannot suppose that we have here collected in 
          one spot the entire flora of the country, as in the herbarium of a botanist, 
          and, looking upon it merely as an accidentally preserved fragment, we 
          are led to conclude that the flora of Greenland was probably richer 
          then than that of any part of Europe is now, and perhaps as rich as 
          that of the Northern United States or Japan.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much further north, in Spitzbergen, in 78&deg; 
          and 79&deg; of north latitude, and now one of the most inhospitable 
          climates on the globe, a fossil flora equally rich in species has been 
          found, but of a somewhat more northern character. Besides pines, sequoias, 
          and the swamp-cypress of the <font color="990000">[[p. 131]]</font> 
          Southern United States, there are oaks, poplars, planes, limes, a hazel, 
          a birch, and a walnut, and also water-lilies, pond-weeds, and an iris. 
          Several of the species are identical with those of Greenland.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Grinnell Land, 
          within eight degrees of the pole, the plants found consist of ten conifers, 
          including the swamp-cypress, with a poplar, a birch, two hazels, an 
          elm, a dogwood, a water-lily, a reed-grass, a sedge, and a horsetail, 
          indicating probably a climate not very unlike that which now prevails 
          in Scotland.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other localities referred to, as well 
          as in Alaska and the Liakhov Islands, less extensive remains of a similar 
          flora have been found. Another occurs near Dantzic in 55&deg; N. latitude, 
          containing the swamp-cypress, sequoias, oaks, and poplars; along with 
          a few more southern forms, as laurels, figs, and cinnamons. In the Isle 
          of Mull, in Scotland, a fragmentary deposit of the same age has been 
          preserved, with a hazel, a plane, and a sequoia, and similar plants 
          occur at Bovey Tracey in Devonshire. It is however in Central Europe, 
          at &#140;ninghen in Switzerland, and near Breslau, north of the Carpathians, 
          that the richest deposits of Miocene plants have been found, and some 
          of these are identical with Greenland species, while many others are 
          closely allied. There is in fact the clearest evidence that one characteristic 
          flora then covered the whole of the north temperate and Arctic zones, 
          with just about as much difference as now exists between the vegetation 
          of France and Norway or the Southern United States and Canada. This 
          flora bears more resemblance to that now inhabiting Eastern North America 
          and Eastern Asia, than to the flora of Europe; and though it clearly 
          shows differences of climate according to latitude, these differences 
          are far less than such as now exist, indicating a much greater uniformity 
          of temperature.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already 
          explained that, if glacial epochs were mainly due to great eccentricity 
          of the earth's orbit, they must always have alternated in each hemisphere 
          with correspondingly mild periods, each lasting about 10,500 years; 
          and we have shown that evidence of such intercalated mild periods is 
          actually found, both amid the records of the last glacial epoch in Scotland, 
          Switzerland, and North America, and in the still existing remains of 
          large unfossilized fir-trees in the highest Arctic regions. This glacial 
          epoch has been assumed to have been caused by the first period of high 
          eccentricity which we meet with in our backward survey--that which occurred 
          200,000 years ago. Still further back, we meet with no equally high 
          eccentricity till 850,000 years ago, when it considerably exceeded that 
          of the last glacial epoch, amounting to near 6 3/4 instead of 5 millions 
          of miles, and causing a difference of about thirty-six days between 
          the length of winter and summer. At this time there must have been a 
          correspondingly severe glacial epoch, with alternating periods of very 
          mild spring-like climates, and it is to one or other of these alternating 
          mild periods that we impute the various Miocene floras that have been 
          discovered in so many places in the Arctic regions and in the North 
          temperate zone.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have already 
          sufficiently explained how the mild climate, approaching to a perpetual 
          spring, was caused in the northern hemisphere at the time when the southern 
          hemisphere was highly glaciated, we need only say here that the greater 
          degree of eccentricity would produce at least a correspondingly greater 
          effect. But we know that considerable changes of land and sea have occurred 
          since the Miocene period, and we may well suppose that these were sometimes 
          favourable to the climate of the Arctic regions. Such would be the case 
          if the extent of land in the Antarctic regions were greater than now, 
          admitting of a much greater extension of the snow and ice. This would 
          increase the flow of the Gulf-stream, and of other currents bringing 
          warm water to the north to an enormous extent,--and if we also suppose 
          that there was less high land near the north pole, and some difference 
          in the American coast line, admitting the warm currents more freely 
          into the Arctic regions; and if we further remember that during winter 
          the whole north temperate zone would be kept warm by the nearness of 
          the sun at that season,--it is not difficult to understand that the 
          cold of the Arctic winter might be so ameliorated that, notwithstanding 
          the four months' absence of the sun, the winter's cold of Spitzbergen 
          might never exceed that of the north of Scotland at the present time.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now generally admitted by botanists, 
          that the three or four months' polar night would be no serious obstacle 
          to the growth of a luxuriant forest vegetation, if the temperature and 
          general climate were otherwise suitable. The hothouses in the Botanical 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 132]]</font> Gardens of St. Petersburg are 
          thickly matted up for six months, yet the prolonged darkness does not 
          prevent even tropical palms from being successfully cultivated; while 
          in Arctic lands many shrubby plants are covered up with snow for more 
          than that period. A far more important element in the growth of broad-leaved 
          dicotyledonous trees is a tolerably calm atmosphere. Long-continued 
          cold winds and gales are highly prejudicial, and it is to these that 
          the absence or scarcity of trees in many of the stormy islands of the 
          southern hemisphere is probably due. It is this too that dwarfs the 
          Arctic trees; and it is probably their power of resisting long-continued 
          winds, that enables tall conifer&aelig; to extend further north than 
          equally lofty deciduous trees. Now it is an interesting fact, which 
          appears to have escaped the attention even of Mr. Croll, that during 
          the mild periods caused by high eccentricity there would be a great 
          diminution of wind, owing to the much greater uniformity of temperature 
          over wide areas and to the weakness of the trades and anti-trades of 
          the northern hemisphere. That there must have been such an absence of 
          violent winds during the summer, is evident to any one who looks at 
          the foliage of the Arctic trees figured in Heer's work, specimens of 
          which may be seen in the geological gallery of the British Museum. The 
          leaves of the oaks, planes, chestnuts, vines, and poplars, are larger 
          than those of most European species, and plainly tell of a comparatively 
          tranquil atmosphere; and it is certainly a most suggestive fact, that 
          the same theory, which accounts for so many of the past changes of our 
          earth, explains also this undoubted feature of the Arctic climate in 
          the Miocene warm period.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of associating such luxuriant 
          vegetation with the long polar night and its accompanying severe cold, 
          has led many writers to maintain the necessity of a considerable decrease 
          in the obliquity of the ecliptic, while others have supposed that the 
          position of the pole itself may have changed. But astronomers and physicists 
          both deny that such changes have occurred to anything like the requisite 
          amount, while the latter change would not produce the desired effect, 
          since there are proofs of a nearly simultaneous mild climate all round 
          the polar area.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> The changes of eccentricity, 
          and of the phases of perihelion and aphelion, are, on the other hand, 
          universally admitted and calculable phenomena; while their effects on 
          the accumulation of snow and ice, on the winds and on the ocean currents, 
          have been worked out in so masterly a manner by Mr. Croll, that they 
          are rapidly taking their place among the established deductions of physical 
          science. If we add to these such moderate changes in the distribution 
          of sea and land, the outline of coasts, and the elevation of mountains 
          and plateaux, as we know to have occurred again and again during the 
          Tertiary period, we obtain a combination of causes which seem fully 
          adequate to have brought about those wonderful changes of climate, manifested 
          on the one hand by the recent glaciation of our own islands, and on 
          the other by the luxuriant Arctic vegetation of the Miocene age.</p>
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indications of Glacial and Mild Climates 
          throughout Geological Time.</em>--It will of course occur to the reader 
          that, if the extreme eccentricity 850,000 years ago was the cause of 
          the mild climate in the Arctic regions, and its accompanying luxuriant 
          flora, there must have been also, each alternate 10,500 years, a glacial 
          epoch of extreme intensity; and it may be asked, where are the proofs 
          of such periods of glaciation? The answer is that there are some indications 
          of such a glacial epoch, and, though very scanty, they are such as we 
          can alone expect to find. The evidence of the last glacial epoch, which 
          is more especially convincing, is that of the superficial effects produced 
          by the ice--the striations, the <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es</em>, the 
          moraines, the travelled blocks, and the 'till.' But these have only 
          been preserved to us here and there, because their formation is so recent, 
          and because they once covered the whole country. The greater part of 
          them have been destroyed; and that any traces of them still remain is 
          probably due to the fact that, since the last glacial epoch passed away, 
          there has been a period of very low eccentricity, and consequently great 
          stability of climates, and comparatively little denudation. No fragment 
          of any such evidence from the remote Miocene glacial epoch could possibly 
          reach us, because there has been, in almost all the time intervening 
          between it and our last glacial epoch, an amount of eccentricity always 
          much greater than now, and on the average nearly double. The whole lapse 
          of time has therefore been a continued series of alternate periods of 
          mild and severe climates, often culminating in lesser glacial epochs 
          and necessarily leading to a great denudation and an almost complete 
          remodelling of the earth's surface. There are only two kinds of evidence 
          of these remote glacial epochs that can possibly remain to us,--beds 
          containing glacial fossils, and <font color="990000">[[p. 133]]</font> 
          travelled angular blocks imbedded in marine or lacustrine deposits. 
          The former have not yet been recognized, though they probably exist, 
          and it is quite possible that some deposits of Arctic shells, classed 
          as glacial, may really belong to this period. The shells of warm seas 
          would undoubtedly suffer modification and extinction by change of climate, 
          but those of cold regions might perhaps undergo little change; for though 
          the polar seas of mild epochs might never be frozen, neither would they 
          ever rise in temperature much above the freezing-point, except in comparatively 
          shallow water. Many of the Arctic mollusca live at considerable depths 
          and have a wide range, and it is not improbable that the Arctic shell-fauna 
          has continued almost unchanged from the Miocene period. It is therefore 
          quite possible that some of the numerous deposits with shells, which 
          have been found in the Arctic regions at elevations of from 100 to 500 
          feet above the sea, may belong to the Miocene period. The same difficulty 
          occurs in the interpretation of the crag and associated deposits of 
          our own country. The presence of a large proportion of living and Arctic 
          shells has been held to prove a more recent origin, whereas it may indicate 
          an intercalated cold period at an earlier date. Geologists almost always 
          form their conclusions as to the age of these fragmentary deposits on 
          the assumption that there was a continuous deterioration of climate 
          from the Miocene through the Pliocene to the Glacial epoch. If, however, 
          as we believe, there have <em>always</em> been alternations of warm 
          and cold periods, a very different interpretation may be placed on the 
          facts, and some difficulties may be overcome.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other kind 
          of evidence, that of travelled blocks, is however found in the Miocene 
          deposits of Central and Southern Europe. In Northern Italy, near Turin, 
          there is a sandstone formation full of Miocene shells, intercalated 
          among whose strata are beds of conglomerate, containing huge angular 
          blocks of serpentine and greenstone, sometimes more than twenty feet 
          long. Some of them are partially striated and polished, and similar 
          rocks occur in the Alps about twenty miles off.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we go back 
          to the Eocene period, we find indications of a decidedly more tropical 
          climate than the Miocene, in fact quite as warm as that of any earlier 
          period, so far as we can judge by organic remains, for palms, turtles, 
          large snakes, and crocodiles, then inhabited England. Yet in this period 
          we also have indications of ice-action, in an extensive deposit of finely 
          stratified sandstone several thousand feet in thickness, extending from 
          Switzerland to Vienna, and quite destitute of organic remains, but which 
          contains in several places enormous blocks, either angular or partly 
          rounded, and composed of oolitic limestone or granite. Near the Lake 
          of Thun one of the granite blocks of this formation is of huge dimensions, 
          being 105 feet long, 90 feet wide, and 45 feet thick. The granite is 
          red, and of a peculiar kind, which cannot now be matched anywhere in 
          the Alps. Similar erratics have been found in beds of the same age in 
          the Carpathians and in the Apennines, indicating probably an extensive 
          inland European sea, into which glaciers descended from the surrounding 
          mountains.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back from 
          the Eocene all through the Secondary formations, the organic remains 
          are such as to indicate warm European seas, and there are no satisfactory 
          proofs of ice-action. But when we reach the remote Pal&aelig;ozoic formations, 
          we lose all clear evidence of very high temperatures, since even the 
          wonderful coal-flora is now generally admitted to be indicative of a 
          mild or warm uniform climate, but by no means necessarily of a tropical 
          one. Here again we meet with unmistakable signs of ice-action in the 
          Lower Permian conglomerates of the west of England. These contain partially-rounded 
          or angular fragments of various rocks, with striated or polished surfaces 
          just like the stones of the 'till.' These blocks lie confusedly bedded 
          in a red unstratified marl, and can often be traced to Welsh rocks, 
          from twenty to fifty miles distant. This remarkable deposit was first 
          adduced by Professor Ramsay as indicating a remote glacial epoch, and, 
          after a personal examination of it on the ground, Sir Charles Lyell 
          agrees that this is the only possible explanation that, with our present 
          knowledge, we can give of it.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous examples 
          of erratic blocks, which seem to indicate ice-action, occur in the Carboniferous 
          formation in Scotland, in France, in Nova Scotia, in Ohio, in India, 
          and in Australia. The Old Red Sandstone and Silurian formations contain 
          similar blocks and boulders; while Principal J. W. Dawson, of Montreal, 
          who is not an extreme glacialist, and whose opinion is therefore unbiassed, 
          believes that we have evidence of ice-action in temperate latitudes 
          as far back as the Huronian age--that is beyond our Cambrian formation.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only evidence wanting to complete the 
          proof of glacial epochs having occurred repeatedly throughout all geological 
          time, is the discovery of deposits of arctic marine shells similar to 
          those of the drift, <font color="990000">[[p. 134]]</font> which have 
          sometimes been raised more than a thousand feet above the sea. But here 
          again it is a question whether such deposits can be recognized if they 
          exist. The alternate periods of about ten thousand years of mild, and 
          of glacial conditions, are so short geologically, that the marine deposits 
          formed during a series of such changes may be represented by alternate 
          bands or strata in one deposit, and the fossils of both periods may 
          be more or less mingled together. Even if the deposit formed during 
          a phase of glacial conditions is sufficiently distinct in composition 
          to be separated from adjacent beds, its comparative poverty in organic 
          remains, or their small size, will not be imputed to cold, because geologists 
          have not yet recognized the constant alternation of short periods of 
          mild and glacial climates as an established fact, but are accustomed 
          to consider a glacial epoch to be one long-continued period of generally 
          glacial conditions. Again, it must be remembered, that during the cold 
          periods denudation will be greatly checked, so far as the carrying of 
          the denuded matter to the sea by running water is concerned; while during 
          the succeeding warm period it will be at a maximum, the melting of snow 
          and ice being added to the normal rainfall, while there will be abundance 
          of loose materials ground off by the ice, to load the rivers with great 
          volumes of sediment. It follows, that marine deposits representing periods 
          of glaciation will always be very scanty, as compared with those of 
          the succeeding warm periods, and this is another reason why any deposits 
          of this kind which do exist may easily have been overlooked.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the evidence 
          of remote glacial epochs is rare and fragmentary, that of the occurrence 
          of warm periods in the Arctic regions is frequent and ample. Besides 
          the wonderful Miocene flora already described, there is a somewhat older 
          one of the Upper Cretaceous age in Greenland, containing besides abundance 
          of dicotyledons--such as figs, magnolias, myrtles, and the sub-tropical 
          genus Myrsine-cycads, conifers, and numerous ferns, one of which is 
          a tree-fern, with a thick stem which has been found in the Greensand 
          of England.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same locality in Greenland (70&deg; 
          33' N. latitude, and 52&deg; W. longitude), and also in Spitzbergen, 
          a more ancient flora of the Lower Cretaceous age has been found, differing 
          widely from the preceding in the great abundance of ferns, cycads, and 
          conifers, and the scarcity of dicotyledons, which are represented by 
          a single species of poplar. Among the ferns many belong to the genus 
          Gleichenia, now entirely tropical.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proofs of a mild Arctic climate in Jurassic 
          times are found in the rich flora of this age in East Siberia and Amur-land, 
          with less productive deposits in Spitzbergen, and at Ando in Norway 
          within the Arctic circle. But more remarkable are the ammonites and 
          the vertebr&aelig; of Ichthyosaurus and Teleosaurus found in the Jurassic 
          beds of the Parry Islands in 77&deg; N. latitude.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the still 
          earlier Triassic deposits of Spitzbergen, species of nautili and ammonites 
          also occur.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True coal of 
          the Carboniferous period has been found at Spitzbergen and at Bear Island, 
          on the north coast of East Siberia, and it contains Calamites and Lepidodendrons, 
          with large spreading ferns. Marine deposits of the same age contain 
          large stony corals; while the more ancient Silurian limestones, which 
          are widely spread in the high Arctic regions, contain abundance of corals 
          and shells of Cephalopodous mollusca, like those of the same formation 
          in the temperate zones.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must undoubtedly 
          be admitted, that this connected series of records of the animal and 
          vegetable productions of the Arctic regions, extending over the whole 
          vast period from the Silurian to the Miocene, inclusive, and widely 
          scattered over the Arctic and sub-arctic zones, indicates rather a constant 
          mild climate than an alternation of warm and cold periods; and it is 
          therefore not surprising that this view should be generally adopted. 
          We must remember, however, that there are yet vast gaps in the record, 
          representing long ages of which we know nothing; while the condition 
          of the Arctic regions during cold periods would certainly be such as 
          not to favour the formation of stratified deposits, or the preservation 
          of animal or vegetable remains. Denudation by water would be almost 
          wholly checked, except perhaps where great northward-flowing rivers 
          brought down the products of warmer lands; while the masses of debris 
          carried by glaciers and icebergs, even if preserved to our times, would 
          rarely contain fossils.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the important part played by extensive 
          tracts of high land in producing glaciation, it is worthy of consideration 
          whether, in the absence of such conditions, anything like a severe Arctic 
          climate could exist, even during periods of high eccentricity with winter 
          in aphelion. Mr. Croll has well remarked, that the influence of the 
          lofty ice-clad mass of Greenland on the climate of the northern hemisphere 
          is overwhelmingly great, and that were it wholly removed the resulting 
          amelioration of climate, even now, would be almost magical. <font color="990000">[[p. 
          135]]</font> Some portion of the milder climate in the Arctic regions 
          may then be due to the absence of any high land in districts of great 
          precipitation; and we may easily imagine such an arrangement of the 
          land as to concentrate all the heating power of the oceanic currents 
          in a limited area, and thus to produce a mild or even warm climate on 
          one side of the pole, while the other side experienced an Arctic winter. 
          And if at this time high land prevailed, as now, round the south pole, 
          the powerful influences of winds and currents, already described, would 
          be kept constantly at work, so as to intensify the glaciation of the 
          Antarctic, while ameliorating the climate of the Arctic regions. Such 
          favourable geographical conditions might possibly keep up a warm arctic 
          climate during an entire phase of high eccentricity, and if these conditions 
          prevailed in several geological periods, the abundant indications of 
          luxuriant floras and sub-tropical faunas in high northern latitudes 
          would be to a great extent explained.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now briefly 
          summarize the facts of this strange history. The geological record is 
          best known to us in temperate latitudes, and the series of extinct animals 
          and plants it has brought to light indicates almost always warmer climates 
          than at present. The Pliocene was a very little warmer, the Miocene 
          considerably warmer, the Eocene almost or quite tropical. Further back 
          we have no proofs of any increasing warmth; and it is generally admitted 
          that even the carboniferous flora does not imply a climate at all warmer 
          than the Eocene. But at a comparatively very recent period, just at 
          the close of the Pliocene, we have irresistible proofs of intense cold 
          in the northern hemisphere, which reduced the northern half of our own 
          islands, and much of Europe and North America, to the condition in which 
          Greenland is now. But there are also indications that this arctic climate 
          alternated with milder intervals; and further, that in Miocene, Eocene, 
          and many older periods, distinct glacial epochs occurred, which may 
          have been as severe as that we have recently gone through. Then we have 
          another series of still more startling climatic changes, in the warm 
          climates of the Arctic regions. These have been proved to occur, first, 
          probably, at or near the time of the glacial period; then in Miocene, 
          Upper Cretaceous, Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Carboniferous, 
          and Silurian times. There is also evidence that some similar changes 
          occurred in the southern hemisphere, of which, however, our limited 
          space has not permitted us to give any account.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the whole 
          series of these wonderful changes can be explained by a full consideration 
          of the influence of certain astronomical facts--the eccentricity of 
          the earth's orbit, and the precession of the equinoxes--combined with 
          the physical properties of snow and ice in storing up cold, and the 
          action and reaction of these on the winds and the ocean currents; the 
          whole being further modified and intensified by changes in the distribution, 
          and especially in the elevation, of the land in temperate and polar 
          regions.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objection 
          to the theory is, that it accounts for too much. It not only explains 
          all the changes of climate of which we have evidence, but it necessitates 
          a whole series of changes of which we have no direct evidence. Some 
          attempt has been here made to explain why the record of such changes 
          is unlikely to have been preserved, and why, in cases where it has been 
          preserved, it may nevertheless have been overlooked. The imperfection 
          of all our records of the past is too well known to geologists, for 
          this difficulty to have much weight with them; but we may further point 
          out that none of the alternative hypotheses yet suggested at all remove 
          this difficulty. If the pole had shifted its place any number of times 
          to bring Greenland or Spitzbergen into warm latitudes, the Arctic regions 
          must still have been <em>somewhere</em>, and the difficulty is, that 
          no Arctic remains are <em>anywhere</em> found beyond recent times. And 
          if we postulate any amount of change in the obliquity of the ecliptic 
          (as advocated by the late Mr. Belt), we still have to trust to differences 
          of eccentricity, and of winter or summer in perihelion, to produce glacial 
          epochs and warm arctic climates alternately, and this leaves the problem 
          exactly where it is now. As to the theory of a cooling earth, even if 
          it were not totally inadmissible on physical grounds, it would leave 
          the glacial epoch itself--the great starting-point in the complex problem 
          of terrestrial climates--totally unaccounted for. We claim, therefore, 
          that the known facts of 'eccentricity,' when properly applied, do serve 
          to explain the known changes of our climate in past time; and that this 
          is really the only working hypothesis now available, since all others 
          have to make assumptions which either astronomers, physicists, or geologists 
          will not grant. It were much to be wished that pal&aelig;ontologists 
          would keep this theory in view when studying in detail the subdivisions 
          of any formation, with the object of ascertaining whether such evidence 
          of changes of climate as it requires may not sometimes have been overlooked.<br />

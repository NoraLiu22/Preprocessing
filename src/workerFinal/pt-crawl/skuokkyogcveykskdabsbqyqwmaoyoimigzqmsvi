1793 yellow fever epidemic in 1794.]
</center></p>

<center><i>First Cases of Bilious Fever</i></center>
On the 5th of August, I was requested by Dr. Hodge to visit his child.&nbsp;
I found it ill with a fever of a bilious kind, which terminated (with a
yellow skin) in death on the 7th of the same month.
<p>On the 6th of August, I was called to Mrs. Bradford, the wife of Mr.
Thomas Bradford.&nbsp; She had all the symptoms of a bilious remittent,
but they were so acute as to require two bleedings, and several successive
doses of physic.&nbsp; The last purge she took was a dose of <b>calomel</b>
[<font size=-1>mercurous chloride, a white, tasteless powder that darkens
on exposure to light</font>], which operated plentifully.&nbsp; For several
days after her recovery her eyes and face were of a yellow colour.
<p>On the same day, I was called to the son of Mrs. McNair, who had been
seized violently with all the usual symptoms of a bilious fever.&nbsp;
I purged him plentifully with salts and creamor tartar, and took ten or
twelve ounces of blood from his arm.&nbsp; His symptoms appeared to yield
to these remedies; but on the 10th of the month a hemorrhage from the nose
came on, and on the morning of the 12th he died.
<p>On the 7th of this month I was called to visit Richard Palmer, a son
of Mrs. Palmer, in Chesnut-street.&nbsp; He had been indisposed for several
days with a sick stomach, and vomiting after eating.&nbsp; He now complained
of a fever and head-ach.&nbsp; I gave him the usual remedies for the bilious
fever, and he recovered in a few days.&nbsp; On the 15th day of the same
month I was sent for to visit his brother William, who was seized with
all the symptoms of the same disease.&nbsp; On the 5th day his head-ach
became extremely acute, and his pulse fell to sixty strokes in a minute.&nbsp;
I suspected congestion to have taken place in his brain, and ordered him
to lose eight ounces of blood.&nbsp; His pulse became more frequent, and
less tense after bleeding, and he recovered a day or two afterwards.
<p>On the 14th day of this month I was sent for to visit Mrs. Leaming,
the wife of Mr. Thomas Leaming.&nbsp; I suspected at first that she had
the influenza, but in a day or two her fever put on bilious symptoms.&nbsp;
She was affected with an uncommon disposition to faint.&nbsp; Her pulse
was languid, but tense.&nbsp; I took a few ounces of blood from her, and
purged her with salts and calomel.&nbsp; I afterwards gave her a small
dose of laudanum which disagreed with her.&nbsp; In my note book I find
I have recorded that "she was worse for it."&nbsp; I was led to make this
remark by its being so very uncommon for a person, who had been properly
bled and purged, to take laudanum in a common bilious fever without being
benefited by it.&nbsp; She recovered, however, slowly, and was yellow for
many days afterwards.
<p>On the morning of the 18th of this month I was requested to visit Peter
Aston, in Vine-street, in consultation with Dr. Say.&nbsp; I found him
on the third day of a most acute bilious fever.&nbsp; His eyes were inflamed,
and his face flushed with a deep red colour.&nbsp; His pulse seemed to
forbid evacuations.&nbsp; We prescribed the strongest cordials, but to
no purpose.&nbsp; We found him, at 6 o'clock in the evening, sitting upon
the side of his bed, perfectly sensible, but without a pulse, with cold
clammy hands, and his face of a yellowish colour.&nbsp; He died a few hours
after we left him.
<p>None of the cases which I have mentioned excited the least apprehension
of the existence of a malignant or yellow fever in our city; for I had
frequently seen sporadic cases in which the common bilious fever of Philadelphia
had put on symptoms of great malignity, and terminated fatally, in a few
days, and now and then with a yellow colour on the skin, before or immediately
after death.
<p><center>
<i>Recognizing the Presence of the Epidemic</i></center>
On the 19th of this month I was requested to visit the wife of Mr. Peter
Le Maigre, in <b>Water-street, between Arch and Race-streets</b> (see "early
cases of yellow fever" [<b><font color="#ED181E">·</font></b>] on map of
Philadelphia below), in consultation with Dr. Foulke and Dr. Hodge.&nbsp;
I found her in the last stage of a highly bilious fever.&nbsp; She vomited
constantly, and complained of great heat and burning in her stomach.&nbsp;
The most powerful cordials and tonics were prescribed, but to no purpose.&nbsp;
She died on the evening of the next day.
<p>Upon coming out of Mrs. Le Maigre's room I remarked to Dr. Foulke and
Dr. Hodge, that I had seen an unusual number of bilious fevers, accompanied
with symptoms of uncommon malignity, and that I suspected ail was not right
in our city.&nbsp; Dr. Hodge immediately replied, that a fever of a most
malignant kind had carried off four or five persons within sight of Mr.
Le Maigre's door, and that one of them had died in twelve hours after the
attack of the disease.&nbsp; This information satisfied me that my apprehensions
were well founded.</td>

    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC"><center><i>The Origin of the Fever</i>
</center>
The origin of this fever was discovered to me at the same time, from the
account which Dr Foulke gave me of a quantity of damaged coffee which had
been thrown upon Mr. Ball's wharf (site <b><font color="#ED181E">3</font></b>
on map of Philadelphia above), and in the adjoining dock, on the 24th of
July, nearly in a line with Mr. Le Maigre's house, and which had putrefied
there to the great annoyance of the whole neigbourhood [<i><font size=-1>sic</font></i>].
<p>After this consultation I was soon able to trace all the cases of fever
which I have mentioned to this course.&nbsp; Dr. Hodge lived a few doors
above Mr. Le Maigre's where his child had been exposed to the exhalation
from the coffee for several days.&nbsp; Mrs. Bradford had spent an afternoon
in a house directly opposite to the wharf and dock on which the putrid
coffee had emitted its noxious effluvia, a few days before her sickness,
and had been much incommoded by it.&nbsp; Her sister, Mrs. Leaming, had
visited her during her illness at her house, which was about two hundred
yards from the infected wharf.&nbsp; Young Mr. McNair and Mrs. Palmer's
two sons had spent whole days in a compting house near where the coffee
was exposed, and each of them had complained of having been made sick by
its offensive smell, and Mr. Aston had frequently been in Water-street
near the source of the exhalation.
<p>This discovery of the malignity, extent, and origin of a fever which
I knew to be attended with great danger and mortality, gave me great pain.&nbsp;
I did not hesitate to name it the <i>bilious remitting yellow fever</i>.</td>

caught the fever from her, for she perfectly recollected perceiving a peculiar
smell unlike any thing she had been accustomed to in a sickroom, as soon

and Mrs. Palmer's two sons had spent the whole day in a compting house,
near where the coffee was exposed, and each of them had complained of having
been made sick by its offensive smell, and Mr. Aston had frequently been

it did not gain universal credit.&nbsp; Some of those physicians who had
not seen patients in it denied that any such fever existed, and asserted
(though its mortality was not denied) that it was nothing but the common
annual remittent of the city.&nbsp; Many of the citizens joined the physicians

for a while it was treated with ridicule or contempt....

    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC"><center><i>Who was Affected by the Fever</i>
</center>
All ages were affected by this fever, but persons between fourteen and
forty years of age were most subject to it.&nbsp; Many old people had it,
but it was not so fatal to them as to robust persons in middle life.&nbsp;
It affected children of all ages....
<p>Men were more subject to the disease than women.&nbsp; Pregnancy seemed
to expose women to it.
<p>The refugees from the French West-Indies universally escaped it.&nbsp;
This was not the case with the natives of France, who had been settled
in the city....
<p>It is difficult to account for these facts.&nbsp; However numerous their
causes may be, a difference in diet, which is as much a distinguishing
mark of nations as dress or manners, will probably be found to be one of
them.
<p>From the accounts of the yellow fever which had been published by many
writers, I was led to believe that the negroes in our city would escape
it....
<p>It was not long after ... Africans undertook the execution of their
humane offer of services to the sick before I was convinced I had been
mistaken.&nbsp; They took the disease in common with the white people,
and many of them died with it.&nbsp; I think I observed the greatest number
of them to sicken after the mornings and evenings became cool.&nbsp; A
large number of them were my patients.&nbsp; The disease was lighter in
them than in white people.&nbsp; I met with no case of hemorrhage in a
black patient.
<p>The tobacconists and persons who used tobacco did not escape the disease....
<p>There did not appear to any advantage from smelling vinegar, tar, camphor,
or volatile salts, in preventing the disease.&nbsp; Bark and wine were
equally ineffectual for that purpose.&nbsp; I was called to many hundred
people who were infected after using one or more of them.&nbsp; Nor did
the white washing walls secure families from the disease.&nbsp; I am disposed
to believe garlic was the only substance that was in any degree useful
in preventing it.&nbsp; I met with several persons who chewed it constantly,
and who were much exposed to the miasmata without being infected.&nbsp;
All other substances seemed to do harm by, begetting a false confidence
in the mind, to the exclusion of more rational preservatives.&nbsp; I have
suspected further, that such of them as were of a volatile nature helped
to spread the disease by affording a vehicle for miasmata through the air.
<p>There was great mortality in all those families who lived in wooden
houses.&nbsp; Whether this arose from the small size of these houses, or
from the want of cleanliness of the people who occupied them, or from the
miasmata becoming more accumulated, by adhering to the wood, I am unable
to determine.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the effect of the co-operation of all
three of those causes....
<p><center>
<i>The State of the Atmosphere</i></center>
The state of the atmosphere, during the whole month of September, and the
first two weeks in October, favoured the accumulation of the miasmata in
the city.
<p>The register of the weather shows how little the air was agitated by
winds during the above time.&nbsp; In vain were changes in the moon expected
to alter the state of the air.&nbsp; The light of the morning mocked the
hopes that were raised by a cloudy sky, in the evening.&nbsp; The sun ceased
to be viewed with pleasure.&nbsp; Hundreds sickened every day beneath the
influence of his rays:&nbsp;&nbsp; and even where they did not excite the
disease, they produced a languor in the body unknown to the oldest inhabitant
of the city, at the same season of the year.
<p>A meteor was seen at two o'clock in the morning, on or about the twelfth
of September.&nbsp; It fell between <b>Third-street and the hospital</b>
(just south of Rush's house, site <b><font color="#ED181E">1</font></b>,
on map of Philadelphia above), nearly in a line with Pine-street.&nbsp;
Mosquetoes (the usual attendants of a sickly autumn) were uncommonly numerous.&nbsp;
Here and there a dead cat added to the impurity of the air of the streets.&nbsp;
It was supposed those animals perished with hunger in the city, in consequence
of so many houses being deserted by the inhabitants who had fled into the
country, but the observations of subsequent years made it more probable
they were destroyed by the same morbid state of the atmosphere which produced
the reigning epidemic.
<p>It appears further, from the register of the weather, that there was
no rain between the 25th of August and the 15th of October, except a few
drops, hardly enough to lay the dust of the streets, on the 9th of September,
and the 12th of October.&nbsp; In consequence of this drought, the springs
and wells failed in many parts of the country.&nbsp; The dust in some places
extended two feet below the surface of the ground.&nbsp; The pastures were
deficient, or burnt up.&nbsp; There was a scarcity of autumnal fruits in
the neighbourhood of the city.&nbsp; But while vegetation drooped or died
from the want of moisture in some places, it revived with preternatural
vigour from unusual heat in others.&nbsp; Cherry-trees blossomed, and apple,
pear, and plum-trees bore young fruit in several gardens in Trenton, thirty
miles from Philadelphia, in the month of October.
<p>However inoffensive uniform heat, when agitated by gentle breezes, may
be, there is, I believe, no record of a dry, warm, and stagnating air having
existed for any length of time without producing diseases.&nbsp; Hippocrates,
in describing a pestilential fever, says the year in which it prevailed
was without a breeze of wind.&nbsp; The same state of the atmosphere, for
six weeks, is mentioned in many of the histories of the plague which prevailed
in London, in 1665.&nbsp; Even the sea air itself becomes unwholesome by
stagnating....
<p>Who can review this account of the universal diffusion of the miasmata
which produced this disease, its universal effects upon persons apparently
in good health, and its accumulation and concentration, in consequence
of the calmness of the air, and believe that it was possible for a febrile
disease to exist at that time in our city that was not derived from that
source?
<p><center>
<i>Circumstances of Public and Private Distress</i></center>
...[T]he first reports of the existence of this fever were treated with
neglect or contempt.&nbsp; A strange apathy pervaded all classes of people.&nbsp;
While I bore my share of reproach for "terrifying our citizens with imaginary
danger," I answered it by lamenting "that they were not terrified enough."&nbsp;
The&nbsp;publication from the <a href="week7ca.html" target="_blank">college
of physicians</a> soon dissipated this indifference and incredulity.&nbsp;
Fear or terror now sat upon every countenance.&nbsp; The disease appeared
in many parts of the town, remote from the spot where it originated; although,
for a while, in every instance, it was easily traced to it.&nbsp; This
set the city in motion.&nbsp; The streets and roads leading from the city
were crowded with families flying in every direction for safety to the
country.&nbsp; Business began to languish.&nbsp; <b>Water-street, between
Market and Race-streets</b> (section of Water-street near site <b><font color="#ED181E">3 </font></b>on
map of Philadelphia above), became a desert.&nbsp; The poor were the first
victims of the fever.&nbsp; From the sudden inturruption [<i><font size=-1>sic</font></i>]
of business they suffered for a while from poverty as well as from disease.&nbsp;
A large and airy house at <b>Bush-hill</b> (site <b><font color="#ED181E">4</font></b>
on map of Philadelphia above), about a mile from the city was opened for
their reception.&nbsp; This house, after it became the charge of a committee
appointed by the citizens on the 14th of September, was regulated and governed
with the order and cleanliness of an old and established hospital.&nbsp;
An American and French physician had the exclusive medical care of it after
the 22d of September.
<p>The disease, after the second week in September, spared no rank of citizens.&nbsp;
Whole families were confined by it.&nbsp; There was a deficiency of nurses
for the sick, and many of those who were employed were unqualified for
their business.&nbsp; There was likewise a great deficiency of physicians,
from the dissertion of some, and the sickness and death of others.&nbsp;
At one time there were but three physicians who were able to do business
out of their houses, and at this time there were probably not less than
6000 persons ill with the fever.
<p>During the first three or four weeks of the prevalence of the disease
I seldom went into a house the first time without meeting the parents or
children of the sick in tears.&nbsp; Many wept aloud in my entry, or parlour,
who came to ask for advice for their relations.&nbsp; Grief after a while
descended below weeping, and I was much struck in observing that many persons
submitted to the loss of relations and friends without shedding a tear,
or manifesting any other of the common signs of grief.
<p>A cheerful countenance was scarcely to be seen in the city for six weeks.&nbsp;
I recollect once, in entering the house of a poor man, to have met a child
of two years old that smiled in my face.&nbsp; I was strangely affected
with this sight (so discordant to my findings and the state of the city)
before I recollected the age and ignorance of the child.&nbsp; I was confined
the next day by an attack of the fever, and was sorry to hear, upon my
recovery, that the father and mother of this little creature died a few
days after my last visit to them.
<p>The streets every where discovered marks of the distress that pervaded
the city.&nbsp; More than one half the houses were shut up, although not
more than one third of the inhabitants had fled into the country.&nbsp;
In walking for many hundred yards, few persons were met, except such as
were in quest of a physician, a nurse, a bleeder, or the men who buried
the dead.&nbsp; The hearse alone kept up the remembrance of the noise of
carriages or carts in the streets.&nbsp; Funeral processions were laid
aside.&nbsp; A black man, leading or driving a horse, with a corpse on
a pair of chair wheels, with now and then half a dozen relations or friends
following at a distance from it, met the eye in most of the streets of
the city, at every hour of the day, while the noise of the same wheels
passing slowly over the pavements, kept alive anguish and fear in the sick
and well, every hour of the night.
<p>But a more serious source of the distress of the city arose from the
dissentions of the physicians, about the nature and treatment of the fever.&nbsp; 
It was considered by some as a modification of the influenza, and by others
as the <b>jail fever</b> [<font size=-1>typhus</font>].&nbsp; Its various
grades and symptoms were considered as so many different diseases, all
originating from different causes.&nbsp; There was the same contrariety
in the practice of the physicians that there was in their principles.&nbsp;
The newspapers conveyed accounts of both to the public, every day.&nbsp;
The minds of the citizens were distracted by them, and hundreds suffered
and died from the delays which were produced by an erroneous opinion of
a plurality of diseases in the city, or by indecision in the choice, or
a want of confidence in the remedies of their physician.
<p>The science of medicine is related to every thing, and the philosopher
as well as the Christian will be gratified by knowing the effects of a
great and mortal epidemic upon the morals of a people.&nbsp; It was some
alleviation of the distress produced by it, to observe its influence upon
the obligations of morality and religion.&nbsp; It was remarked during
this time, by many people, that the name of the Supreme Being was seldom
profaned, either in the streets, or in the intercourse of the citizens
with each other.&nbsp; But two robberies, and those of a trifling nature,
occurred in nearly two months, although many hundred houses were exposed
to plunder, every hour of the day and night.&nbsp; Many of the religious
societies met two or three times a week, and some of them every evening,
to implore the interposition of Heaven to save the city from desolation.&nbsp;
Humanity and charity kept pace with devotion.&nbsp; The public have already
seen accounts of their benevolent exercises in other publications.&nbsp;
It was my lot to witness the uncommon activity of those virtues upon a
smaller scale.&nbsp; I saw little to blame, but much to admire and praise
in persons of different professions, both sexes, and of all colours....

<b>fetor</b>
[<font size=-1>foul smell</font>], which upon inquiring, was constantly
traced to the putrid coffee.&nbsp; It should not surprise us, that this
seed, so inoffensive in its natural state, should produce, after its putrefaction,
a violent fever.&nbsp; The records of medicine ... furnish instances of
similar fevers being produced by the putrefaction of many other vegetable
substances.
<p>4.&nbsp; The rapid progress of the fever from Water-street and the courses
through which it travelled into other parts of the city, afford a strong
evidence that it was at first propagated by exhalation from the putrid
coffee.&nbsp; It was observed that it passed first through those alleys
and streets which were in the course of the winds that blew across the
dock and wharf, where the coffee had been thrown in a state of putrefaction.
<p>5.&nbsp; Many persons who had worked, or even visited, in the neighbourhood
of the exhalation from the coffee, early in the month of August, were indisposed
afterwards with sickness, puking, and yellow sweats, long before the air
of Water-street was so much impregnated with the exhalation, as to produce
such effects; and several patients, whom I attended in the yellow fever,
declared to me, or to their friends, that their indispositions began exactly
at the time they inhaled the offensive effluvia of the coffee.
<p>6.&nbsp; The first cases of the yellow fever have been clearly traced
to the sailors of the vessel who were first exposed to the effluvia of
the coffee.&nbsp; Their sickness commenced with the day on which the coffee
began to emit its putrid smell.&nbsp; The disease spread with the increase
of the poisonous exhaltion.&nbsp; A journeyman of Mr. Peter Brown, who
worked near the corner of Race and Water-streets (see "early cases of yellow
fever" on map of Philadelphia), caught the disease on the 27th of July.&nbsp;
Elizabeth Hill, the wife of a fisherman, was infected by only sailing near
the pestilential wharf, about the 1st of August, and died at Kensington
on the 14th of the same month.&nbsp; Many other names might be mentioned
of persons who sickened during the last week in July or the first week
in August, who ascribed their illness to the smell of the coffee.
<p>7.&nbsp; It has been remarked that this fever did not spread in the
country, when carried there by persons who were infected, and who afterwards
died with it.&nbsp; During four times in which it prevailed in Charleston,
in no one instance, according to Dr. Lining, was it propagated in any other
part of the state.
<p>8.&nbsp; In the histories of the disease which have been preserved in
this country, it has six times appeared about the first or middle of August,
and declined or ceased about the middle of October:&nbsp; viz.&nbsp; in
1732, 1739, 1745, and 1748 in Charleston, in 1791 in New-York, and in 1793
in Philadelphia.&nbsp; This frequent occurrence of the yellow fever at
the usual period of our common bilious remittens, cannot be ascribed to
accidental coincidence, but must be resolved, in most cases, into the combination
of more active miasmata with the predisposition of a tropical season.&nbsp;
In speaking of a tropical season, I include that kind of weather in which
rains and heats are alternated with each other, as well as that which is
uniformly warm.
<p>9.&nbsp; Several circumstances attended this epidemic, which do not
occur in the West-India yellow fever.&nbsp; It affected children as well
as adults, in common with our annual bilious fevers.&nbsp; In the West-Indies,
Dr. Hume tells us, it never attacked any person under puberty.&nbsp; It
had, moreover, many peculiar symptoms (as I have already shown) which are
not to be met with in any of the histories of the West-India yellow fever.
<p>10.&nbsp; Why should it surprise us to see a yellow fever generated
amongst us?&nbsp; It is only a higher grade of a fever which prevails every
year in our city, from vegetable putrefaction.&nbsp; It conforms, in the
difference of its degrees of violence and danger to season as well as climate,
and in this respect it is upon a footing with the small-pox, the measles,
the sore-throat, and several other diseases....&nbsp; It is very common
in South and North-Carolina and in Virginia, and there are facts which
prove, that not only strangers, but native individuals, and in one instance,
a whole family, have been carried off by it in the state of Maryland.&nbsp;
It proved fatal to one hundred persons in the city of New-York in the year
of 1791, where it was evidently generated by putrid exhalation.</td>

    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC"><p>The yellow colour of the skin has unfortunately too often been considered
as the characteristic mark of this fever, otherwise many other instances
of its prevalence might be discovered, I have no doubt, in every part of
the United States.&nbsp; I wish, with Dr. Mosely, the term yellow could
be abolished from the titles of this fever, for this colour is not only
frequently absent, but sometimes occurs in the mildest bilious remittents.&nbsp;
Dr. Haller, in his pathology, describes an epidemic of this kind in Switzerland,
in which this colour generally attended, and I have once seen it almost
universal in a common bilious fever, which prevailed in the American army,
in the year 1776....
<blockquote>[It is my] opinion, that the plagues which occasionally desolated
most of the countries of Europe, in former centuries, and which were always
said to be of foreign extraction, were of domestic origin.&nbsp; Between
the years 1006 and 1680, the plague was epidemic fifty-two times all over
Europe.&nbsp; It prevailed fourteen times in the 14th century.&nbsp; The
state of Europe in this long period is well known.&nbsp; Idleness, a deficiency
of vegetable aliment, a camp life, from the frequency of wars, famine,
an uncultivated and marshy soil, small cabins, and the want of cleanliness
in dress, diet, and furniture, all concurred to generate pestilential diseases.&nbsp;
The plagues which prevailed in London, every year from 1593 to 1611, and
from 1636 to 1649, I believe were generated in that city.&nbsp; The diminution
of plagues in Europe, more especially in London, appears to have been produced
by the great change in the diet and manners of the people; also by the
more commodious and airy forms of the houses of the poor, among whom the
plague ahvays makes its first appearance.&nbsp; It is true, these plagues,
were said by authors to have been imported, either directly or indirectly,
from the Levant; but the proofs of such importation were as vague and deficient
as they were of the West-India origin of our epidemic.&nbsp; The pestilential
fevers which have been mentioned, have been described by authors by the
generic name of the plague, but they appear to have originated from putrid
vegetable exhalations, and to have resembled, in most of their symptoms,
the West-India and <i>North-American</i> yellow fever.</blockquote>

<center><i>Of the Method of Cure</i></center>
...I had seen, and recorded in my note book, the efficacy of gentle purges
in the yellow fever of 1762; but finding them unsuccessful after the 20th
of August, and observing the disease to assume uncommon symptoms of great
prostration of strength, I laid them aside, and had recourse to a gentle
vomit of <b>ipecacuanha</b> [<font size=-1>syrup of ipecac</font>], on
the first day of the fever, and to the usual remedies for exciting the
action of the sanguiferous system.
<ul>
<li>
I gave [Peruvian] bark in all its usual forms of infusion, powder, and
tincture.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
I joined wine, brandy, and aromatics with it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
I applied blisters to the limbs, neck, and head.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Finding them all ineffectual, I attempted to rouse the system by wrapping
the whole body, agreeably to Dr. Hume's practice in blankets dipped in
warm vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
To these remedies I added one more:&nbsp; I rubbed the right side with
mercurial ointment, with a view of exciting the action of the vessels in
the whole system through the medium of the liver, which I then supposed
to be principally, though symptomatically, affected by the disease.</li>
</ul>
None of these remedies appeared to be of any service; for although three
out of thirteen recovered, of those to whom they were applied, yet I have
reason to believe that they would have recovered much sooner had the cure
been trusted to nature.
<p>Perplexed and distressed by my want of success in the treatment of this
fever, I [consulted] Dr. Stevens, an eminent and worthy physician from
St. Croix, who happened then to be in our city, and asked for such advice
and information upon the subject of the disease....&nbsp; He advised the
bark to be given in large quantities by way of <b>clyster</b> [<font size=-1>enema</font>],
as well as in the usual way; and he informed me of the manner in which
the cold bath should be used, so as to derive the greatest benefit from
it.
<p>This mode of treating the yellow fever, appeared to be reasonable....
<p>I began the use of each of Dr. Stevens's remedies the next day ... with
great confidence of their success....&nbsp; For a while I had hopes of
benefit to my patients from the use of these remedies, but, in a few days,
I was distressed to find they were not more effectual than those I had
previously used.&nbsp; Three out of four of my patients died, to whom the
cold bath was administered, in addition to the tonic remedies....
<p>Baffled in every attempt to stop the ravages of this fever ... I did
not abandon a hope that the disease might yet be cured.
<p>I had long believed that good was commensurate with evil, and that there
does not exist a disease for which the goodness of Providence has not provided
a remedy.&nbsp; Under the impression of this belief I applied myself with
fresh ardour to the investigation of the disease before me.
<p>I ransacked my library, and pored over every book that treated of the
yellow fever.&nbsp; The result of my researches for a while was fruitless.&nbsp;
The accounts of the symptoms and cure of the disease by the authors I consulted
were contradictory, and none of them appeared altogether applicable to
the prevailing epidemic.
<p>...I recollected that I had, among some old papers, a manuscript account
of the yellow fever as it prevailed in Virginia in the year 1741, which
had been put into my hands by Dr. [Benjamin] Franklin, a short time before
his death.&nbsp; I had read it formerly, and made extracts from it into
my lectures upon that disease.&nbsp; I now read it a second time.&nbsp;
I paused upon every sentence; even words in some places arrested and fixed
my attention.&nbsp; In reading the history of the method of cure I was
much struck with the following passages.
<blockquote>" It must be remarked, that this evacuation (meaning by purges)
is more necessary in this than in most other fevers....&nbsp; The abdominal
[organs] are the parts principally affected in this disease, but by this
timely evacuation their ... corruptible contents are discharged, before
they corrupt and produce any ill effects....&nbsp; All these acute putrid
fevers ever require some evacuation to bring them to a perfect crisis and
solution, and that even by stools, which must be promoted by art, where
nature does not do the business herself....
<p>"This evacuation must be procured by <b><i>lenitive chologoque</i></b>
[<font size=-1>soothing cathartic medicine that increases the flow of the
bile</font>] purges."</blockquote>
Here I paused.&nbsp; A new train of ideas suddenly broke in upon my mind....&nbsp;
I adopted his theory and practice, and resolved to follow them.&nbsp; It
remained now only to fix upon a suitable purge to answer the purpose of
discharging the contents of the bowels....
<p>I suspected that my want of success in discharging this bile, in several
of the cases in which I attempted the cure by purging, was owing to the
feebleness of my purges.

	I had been in the habit of occasionally purging with calomel in bilious
and inflammatory fevers, and had recommended the practice the year before
in my lectures, not only from my own experience, but upon the authority
of Dr. Clark....
<p>It was ... universally known, and sometimes prescribed, by the simple
name of <i>ten</i> and <i>ten</i>.&nbsp; This mode of giving calomel occurred
to me in preference to any other.&nbsp; The <b>jalap</b> [<font size=-1>dried
root of a Mexican vine (<i>Ipomoea purga</i>) of the morning glory family,
used as a purgative</font>] appeared to be a necessary addition to it,
in order to quicken its passage through the bowels; for calomel is slow
in its operation, more especially when it is given in large doses.&nbsp;
I resolved, after mature deliberation, to prescribe this purge.
<p>Finding ten grains of jalap insufficient to carry the calomel through
  the bowels in the rapid manner I wished, I added fifteen grains of the
  former to ten of the latter; but even this dose was slow and uncertain
  in its operation.
<p>I then issued three doses, each consisting of fifteen grains of jalap
and ten of calomel; one to be given every six hours until they procured
four or five large evacuations.&nbsp; The effects of this powder not only
answered, but far exceeded my expectations.&nbsp; It perfectly cured four
out of the first five patients to whom I gave it, notwithstanding some
of them were advanced several days in the disease....
<p>After such a pledge of the safety and success of my new medicine, I
gave it with confidence.&nbsp; I communicated the prescription to such
of the practitioners as I met in the streets.&nbsp; Some of them I found
had been in the use of calomel for several days, but as they had given
it in small and single doses only, and had followed it by large doses of
bark, wine, and laudanum, they had done little or no good with it.
<p>I imparted the prescription to the college of physicians, on the third
of September, and endeavoured to remove the fears of my fellow-citizens,
by assuring them that the disease was no longer incurable....
<p>The credit it acquired, brought me an immense accession of business.&nbsp;
It still continued to be almost uniformly effectual in all those which
I was able to attend, either in person, or by my pupils....
<p>But I did not rely upon purging alone to cure the disease.&nbsp; The
theory of it which I had adopted led me to use other remedies to abstract
excess of stimulus from the system.&nbsp; These were blood-letting, cool
air, cold drinks, low diet, and applications of cold water to the body....
<p>Never before did I experience such sublime joy as I now felt in contemplating
the success of my remedies.&nbsp; It repaid me for all the toils and studies
of my life.&nbsp; The conquest of this formidable disease was not the effect
of accident, nor of the application of a single remedy; but it was the
triumph of a principle in medicine.&nbsp; The reader will not wonder at
this joyful state of my mind when I add a short extract from my note book,
dated the 10th of September.&nbsp; "Thank God! out of one hundred patients,
whom I have visited or prescribed for this day, I have lost none."
<p>Being unable to comply with the numerous demands which were made upon
me for the purging powders ... and, finding myself unable to attend all
the persons who sent for me, I furnished the apothecaries with the recipe
for the mercurial purges, together with printed directions for giving them,
and for the treatment of the disease.
<p><center>
<i>Response of the Medical Community to Mercurial Purges</i></center>
Hitherto there had been great harmony among the physicians of the city,
although there was a diversity of sentiment as to the nature and cure of
the prevailing fever.&nbsp; But this diversity of sentiment and practice
was daily lessening, and would probably have ceased altogether in a few
days, had it not been prevented by two publications, the one by Dr. Kuhn,
and the other by Dr. Stevens, in which they recommended bark, wine, and
other cordials, and the cold bath, as the proper remedies for the disease.&nbsp;
The latter dissuaded from the use of evacuations of all kinds....
<p>I felt, at this season of universal distress, my professional obligations
to all the citizens of Philadelphia to be superior to private and personal
considerations, and therefore determined at every hazard to do every thing
in my power to save their lives.&nbsp; Under the influence of this disposition,
I addressed a letter to the college of physicians, in which I stated my
objections to Dr. Kuhn and Dr. Stevens's remedies, and defended those I
had recommended.
<p>I likewise defended them in the public papers against the attacks that
were made upon them by several of the physicians of the city, and occasionally
addressed such advice to the citizens as experience had suggested to be
useful to prevent the disease, particularly low diet, gentle doses of laxative
physic, avoiding its exciting causes, and prompt applications for medical
aid....
<p>This controversy with my brethren, with whom I had long lived in friendly
intercourse, carried on amidst the most distressing labours, was extremely
painful to me, and was submitted to only to prevent the greater evil of
the depopulation of our city by the use of remedies which had been prescribed
by myself, as well as others, not only without effect, but with evident
injury to the sick....
<p><center>
<i>Objections to the Mercurial Purge, and Answers to Them</i></center>
However salutary the mercurial purge was, objections were made to it by
many of our physicians; and prejudices, equally weak and ill-founded, were
excited against it.&nbsp; I shall enumerate, and answer those objections.</td>

<td bgcolor="#CCFFFF">1.&nbsp; It was said to be of too drastic a nature.&nbsp; It was compared
to arsenic; and it was called a dose for a horse.
<blockquote>This objection was without foundation.&nbsp; Hundreds who took
it declared they had never taken so mild a purge....&nbsp; It sometimes,
it is true, operated from twenty to thirty times in the course of twenty-four
hours; but I heard of an equal number of stools in two cases from salts
and cremor tartar.&nbsp; It is not an easy thing to affect life, or even
subsequent health, by copious or frequent purging....
<p>Dr. Clark ... remarks, that evacuations do not destroy life in the dysentery,
but the fever, with the emaciation and mortification which attend and follow
the disease.</blockquote>
2.&nbsp; A second objection to this mercurial purge was, that it excited
a salivation, and sometimes loosened the teeth.
<blockquote>I met with but two cases in which there was a loss of teeth
from the use of this medicine, and in both the teeth were previously loose
or decayed.&nbsp; The salivation was a trifling evil, compared with the
benefit which was derived from it....</blockquote>
3.&nbsp; It was said that the mercurial purge excoriated the rectum, and
produced the symptoms of pain and inflammation in that part....
<blockquote>To refute this charge, it will be sufficient to remark, that
the bile produces the same excoriation and pain in the rectum in the bilious
and yellow fever, where no mercury has been given to discharge it....</blockquote>
4.&nbsp; It was objected to this purge, that it inflamed and lacerated
the stomach and bowels....
<blockquote>To refute this objection it will only be necessary to review
the account formerly given of the state of the stomach and bowels after
death from the yellow fever, in cases in which no mercury had been given....&nbsp;
Dr. Clark informs us ... "For several years past, when the dysentery has
resisted the common mode of practice, I have administered mercury with
the greatest success; and am thoroughly persuaded that it is possessed
of powers to remove inflammation and ulceration of the intestines, which
are the chief causes of death in this distemper."</blockquote>
5.&nbsp; It was urged against this powerful and efficacious medicine, that
it was prescribed indiscriminately in all cases, and that it did harm in
all weak habits.
<blockquote>To this I answer, that there was no person so weak in constitution
or a previous disease, as to be injured by a single dose of this medicine.&nbsp;
Mrs. Meredith, the wife of the treasurer of the United States, a lady of
uncommon delicacy of constitution, took two doses of the powder in the
course of twelve hours, not only without any inconvenience, but with an
evident increase of strength soon afterwards....&nbsp; Even children took
two or three large doses of it with perfect&nbsp; safety....&nbsp; I am
happy in being able to add further, that many women took it in every stage
of pregnancy without suffering the least inconvenience from it.&nbsp; Out
of a great number of pregnant women whom I attended in this fever I did
not lose one to whom I gave this medicine, nor did any of them suffer an
abortion....</blockquote></td>

    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC"><p>Much has been said of the bad effects of this purge from its having
been put up carelessly by the apothecaries, or from its having been taken
contrary to the printed directions by many people.&nbsp; If it did harm
in any one case (which I do not believe) from the former of the above causes
the fault is not mine.&nbsp; Twenty men employed constantly in putting
up this medicine would not have been sufficient to have complied with all
the demands which were made of me for it.&nbsp; Hundreds who were in health
called or sent for it as well as the sick, in order to have it in readiness,
in case they should be surprized by the disease in the night, or at a distance
in the night, or at a distance from a physician.
<p>In all the cases in which this purge was supposed to have been hurtful,
when given on the first or second day of the disease, I believe it was
because it was not followed by repeated doses of the same, or of some other
purge, or because it was not aided by blood-letting....
<p>It is possible that this purge sometimes proved hurtful when it was
given on the fifth day of the disease, but it was seldom given for the
first time after the third day, and when it was, the patient was generally
in such a situation that nothing did him either good or harm.
<p>I derived great pleasure from hearing, after the fever had left the
city, that calomel had been given with success as a purge in bilious fevers
in other parts of the union besides Philadelphia....</td>

At the heart of EU conservation efforts is the EU’s <strong>Natura 2000 network</strong> of protected areas, which currently makes up <strong>18% of the EU’s land area</strong> and <strong>10% of its marine territory</strong>.</p><p><strong>Nature protection</strong> needs to be complemented by <strong><a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/nature-and-biodiversity/nature-restoration-law_en" rel="noopener">nature restoration</a> </strong>efforts, through actions such as removing barriers on rivers and rewilding.

The strategy aims to <strong>increase the protected area</strong> to at least 30% of EU land and 30% of surrounding seas by 2030. One-third of this, areas of very high biodiversity and climate value, should be under strict protection. Primary and old-growth forests and other carbon-rich ecosystems like peatlands and grasslands will be the focus of strict protection.  </p><p>The strategy also calls for <strong>restoring ecosystems</strong> and planting additional trees to support biodiversity and ecosystem restoration. More <strong>forests</strong> will also be managed to promote biodiversity-friendly practices.</p><p>Recently, the European Commission proposed the <strong>Nature Restoration Law,</strong> which takes a holistic approach to restore all EU land and sea. The first milestone is set for 2030 when 20% of all EU land and sea must be under restoration measures, while the ultimate target is for 2050 when all EU land and sea in need of restoration must be under restoration measures.</p><p>Other initiatives include the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/biodiversity/green-infrastructure/building-a-coherent-trans-european"

EU contributes via Natura 2000 sites. </p><p>The EEA regularly assesses the state of nature in Europe, including conservation status of key habitats and species, as well as assessments on protected

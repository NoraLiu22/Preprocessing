/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 
          657]]</font> It was a drowsy afternoon in the month of roses when I 
          climbed the hill from Poole to Broadstone, in order for a few hours 
          to sit at the feet of the great naturalist, spiritualist, and social 
          reformer, Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace. &quot;Old Orchard,&quot; where the great 
          scientist lives, was a little difficult to find, and I went in a wrong 
          direction, which necessitated my plunging knee-deep in purple heather, 
          as I took a short cut across the wild to the house. On the brow of the 
          hill there had been recently a fire, and the underwood lay blackened 
          and waste. This black patch was the only stain on a prospect where all 
          else was fair. The sun shone in a pellucid blue sky; the insects hummed 
          in the afternoon heat; the trees luxuriated in the moisture of air and 
          earth from the heavy rain of the night before. It was a spot where things 
          were all but visibly growing, and yonder was the house where lived the 
          great naturalist, to whom, with Darwin, belongs the honour of having 
          told the world the secret of their growth and evolution.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pushed open the gate, 
          which bore the inscription, &quot;Old Orchard--A. R. Wallace&quot;--and found 
          myself in a luxurious garden where flowers of many varieties contested 
          in a friendly rivalry of shape, colour, and perfume. As I entered the 
          porch, two merry children ran out of the house into the garden, and 
          I realised that in the winter of his life the great scientist was still 
          closely in touch with the innocence and fragrance of childhood.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at once shown 
          into the drawing-room. On an occasional table lay several books, among 
          which I noticed Richard Whiteing's &quot;No. 5, John-street,&quot; and the current 
          number of the <i>Fortnightly</i>. 
          I picked up the review, and turned over its pages. The only contribution 
          that interested me was an article on August Strindberg, which I began 
          to read whilst waiting for the appearance of the last of the great Victorians. 
          The article was full of interest, but so also was the view from the 
          low <font color="990000">[[p. 658]]</font> window, and my eyes frequently 
          strayed from the pages of the review to drink in the beauty of the landscape 
          that lay spread out before me; the tangled profusion of cultivated flowers 
          that filled with a riot of colour the garden in the foreground, steeply 
          sloping towards a wide vista of country, with just a glimpse of the 
          sea that runs inland past Bournemouth to Poole Harbour and beyond.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My reverie was abruptly 
          ended by the appearance of Dr. Wallace, whose tall slight figure showed 
          unmistakable signs of the passage of time, for the great scientist is 
          in his 90th year.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He led the way to his 
          study, and having ensconced himself in an armchair, bade me be seated, 
          and we began to talk, at first hesitatingly, until the web of reserve 
          that separates two people who are meeting each other for the first time 
          was broken through and dispelled.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked Dr. Wallace 
          concerning his latest book, in which he has sought to show from the 
          wealth of his scientific experience, and indeed has demonstrated to 
          the satisfaction of many, that evolution has been purposive, and not 
          the outcome of chance--that the universe shows not merely design but 
          intention.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With some diffidence 
          I gave expression to the thought that had often come to me, that the 
          endless manifestations of beauty that the world affords, are beautiful 
          by reason of the intention that they should serve for man's &aelig;sthetic 
          delight. With the Lamarckian view in my mind, I went on to suggest that 
          evolution was caused by the inherent life force in each cell, plant, 
          or animal pushing outwards towards a development and satisfaction of 
          its own needs.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are on the right 
          lines,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;but there is something more than that. The 
          push is there, but it has an intention behind it--that intention being 
          to spread life out in an infinite variety for the development to the 
          utmost fulness of the mind of man. But for this intention towards infinite 
          variety, the world would present a monotonous sameness in no wise conducive 
          to mental development.&quot; I thought of Herbert Spencer's<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
          definition of evolution being a progression from the homogeneous to 
          the heterogeneous, as Dr. Wallace continued to develop this line of 
          thought.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In certain parts of 
          the tropics,&quot; he said, &quot;you will, in the space of a few yards, find 
          a hundred or more plants of different species, getting nourishment out 
          of the same air and the same soil. And out of this same soil, each of 
          these different plants not only develop different aspects of the beautiful, 
          but yield a wide variety of quite different chemical products. In exactly 
          the same environment these widely differing plants have evolved in widely 
          different directions, because of the underlying intention that they 
          should evolve in such bewildering, but purposive diversity.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was a fortunate 
          fate that took you to the Amazons,&quot; I remarked.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, 
          &quot;but you do not need to go to the tropics to see evidences of this wonderful 
          variety; for not even in England will you find two square yards of ground 
          exactly alike. Look at any hedgerow, and you cannot fail to be struck 
          by its wonderful diversity of form and colour. A botanist clergyman 
          in the north of England,&quot; Mr. Wallace went on to say, &quot;has made this 
          subject a matter of careful investigation. He has botanically examined 
          different meadows all yielding this diverse result; and, even in pasture 
          land, where, through cultivation, there is a man-made limit to variety, 
          each square yard of meadow is found to yield different proportions of 
          the grasses or clovers that are cultivated.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But not only is this 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 659 (photo)]] [[p. 660]]</font> wonderful 
          variety displayed on this earth, but our planet is different from all 
          others--an orderly and purposive variety being the keynote of the universe.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And the object of 
          all this heterogeneity?&quot; I asked.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The purpose of it,&quot; 
          said Dr. Wallace, &quot;is to provide for the development of man in endless 
          diversity, not of body, but of mind. So far as bodily structure is concerned, 
          man's evolution is finished. Man's physical structure stopped evolving 
          when he began to use outside aids to express his individuality. When 
          man discovered fire and its uses; when he made weapons and invented 
          traps; when he began to use tools; when he developed speech; when he 
          commenced to conquer nature; then further evolution was shifted from 
          the physical to the mental plane.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Physical dissemblances 
          between men are as nothing compared with their wide mental differences. 
          In the various gradations between the ordinary man and the genius, what 
          wonderful variety! And between men of genius these differences are even 
          more striking. The products of their genius alone show this. What infinite 
          variety of thought and emotion in the music of Beethoven, the plays 
          of Shakespeare, the philosophy of Spencer, the theories of Newton, the 
          art of Michelangelo! But <i>cui 
          bono</i>?&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The words of Shakespeare 
          come into my mind:--
        </p><blockquote><font size="-1">The solemn temples, 
          the great globe itself,<br />
          Yea, all which it inherit, 
          shall dissolve;<br />
          And, like this insubstantial 
          pageant faded,<br />
          Leave not a rack behind: 
          We are such stuff<br />
          As dreams are made of, and 
          our little life<br />
          Is rounded with a sleep.&quot;</font></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of this, I asked, 
        But what is the ultimate goal of all this variety? Does this mental expansion 
        continue after death, or when we die, is it to end
        <blockquote><font size="-1">The heart-ache, 
          and the thousand natural shocks</font><br />
          <font size="-1">That flesh is heir to--?</font></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, as is well-known, 
        Dr. Wallace has for a number of years past expressed his lively conviction 
        of the truth of spiritualism, so that in following his view of what happens 
        after death, we leave the realm of tangible evidence and stand on the 
        threshold of regions of investigation which the ordinary man may not care 
        to enter.
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whatever may be 
          the grounds of his faith, it was impossible to hear Dr. Wallace talk 
          on the subject for five minutes without perceiving that to him spiritualism 
          was no mere working hypothesis, nor a question of speculation, but a 
          conviction settled beyond cavil or dispute. I did not, therefore, question 
          him as to the evidences of his belief. I was more interested to learn 
          what that belief had taught him as to man's destiny--what was man's 
          state after death?
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We gather from people 
          who have passed over,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;that man goes on developing 
          in the spiritual world towards that infinite variety which is the object 
          of life on earth.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But,&quot; I asked, &quot;if 
          this development can go on in the spiritual world, why was it necessary 
          for an earth life at all?&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The earth life is 
          necessary,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;in order, as it were, to get a point 
          of departure for the individual spirit.&quot; The inference I drew from his 
          further remarks was that the purpose of material evolution was to establish 
          conditions out of which man's individuality could come into being. Without 
          such material conditions, the individualisation of humanity out of the 
          Godhead (this was not the exact word Dr. Wallace used) might not have 
          been possible. But that individualisation once achieved, growth and 
          development could go on in the spiritual world apart from, and independent 
          of, material conditions.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Is there any birth, 
          then, in the spiritual world?&quot; I asked.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;As far as can be ascertained, 
          no!&quot; said Dr. Wallace; &quot;although there appears to be a continuous condition 
          of ecstatic union on the spiritual plane; but knowledge on that point 
          is vague.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A volume of poetry 
          of Thomas Lake Harris lay on the table. Dr. Wallace picked it up and 
          handed it to me. &quot;You will,&quot; he said, &quot;find more spiritual discernment 
          in the writings of Lake Harris than in any other modern writer.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened the book at 
          random, and read &quot;Fear is the insanity of the soul.&quot; &quot;That is a great 
          thought,&quot; said Dr. Wallace; &quot;the soul that is in perfect health knows 
          no fear, because it realises that it is part of the divine order. But, 
          speaking of insanity,&quot; he continued, &quot;I am of the opinion that we shall 
          never learn how to cure it until we go back to the discarded view that 
          insanity is possession--possession by evil spirits. On the material 
          side, of course, there may be a lesion in the brain tissues or some 
          destruction or degeneration of brain cells by a poisonous disease or 
          by alcoholism, permitting the entrance of some alien evil spirit.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 
          661]]</font> Dr. Wallace, however, is a many-sided man, and he next 
          began to talk of Socialism. I sat facing a portrait of Herbert Spencer, 
          and, pointing to it, asked my host how he got over Spencer's well-known 
          arguments against militarising industry under the State.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In his objections 
          to Socialism,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;Herbert Spencer is illogical, as he 
          is also on the land question, upon which he changed his views. To the 
          individualist, the great bugbear is the State. But it is such a bugbear, 
          largely because people cannot free their minds from a conception of 
          the State based on its existing organisation from above downwards; with 
          its tenacious clinging to established caste and class privileges. Socialism, 
          on the contrary, implies government from the people upwards, based on 
          the idea of mutual love and service; whereas the individualist idea 
          of Government is akin to the view of Hobbes that the State is a leviathan 
          which presses from the top downwards.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Edward Bellamy's 
          &quot;Looking Backward&quot; that converted Dr. Wallace to Socialism, or, shall 
          we say, to Communism, for in the ideal state envisaged by Dr. Wallace, 
          there is no inequality of reward, no paying of big salaries to highly 
          placed officials, but a real community of interest.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The existing division 
          of society into rich and poor is preposterous,&quot; said Dr. Wallace. &quot;That 
          there should be some who are rich beyond the dreams of avarice, while 
          others starve in the midst of plenty, is an evil that cries loudly for 
          redress.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace has written 
          voluminously on social questions,<sup> </sup>but not only is he the 
          quintessence of modesty with regard to his own writings, but he is ungrudging 
          of praise to others. He went on to speak in high terms of the social 
          schemes of Captain Petavel and Herbert V. Mills for providing work for 
          all. &quot;An economist and statistician of the highest repute in America,&quot; 
          said Dr. Wallace, &quot;has shown that under modern economic organisation, 
          a surprisingly small number of men are required to produce the necessaries 
          of life for all. As a result of the great ease with which wealth can 
          be produced, we get the phenomenon of unemployment, that economic lever 
          which raises profits at one end of the beam, and depresses wages at 
          the other. What we have got to do is to drain off the unemployed into 
          self-supporting colonies like those established by Captain Petavel and 
          advocated by Herbert V. Mills. Now,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;there is a right 
          way and a wrong way of doing this. The Salvation Army has adopted the 
          wrong way. In their colonies they have proceeded on the plan of growing 
          things for the general market, confining their attentions to a few saleable 
          commodities. What is the result? Their produce enters an already overstocked 
          market, where sellers compete with one another to reduce prices. Moreover, 
          the sellers have to pay all the costs of marketing their crops, including 
          railway freights, market dues, middlemen's profits, and other charges. 
          The money return to the colonists is therefore far below the real value 
          of the commodities produced. Nor is this all. When <font color="990000">[[p. 
          662]]</font> the colonists have got the money, they have to buy food, 
          clothing, and household necessaries at retail price, <i>i.e.</i>, 
          at the cost of production <i>plus</i> 
          railway freights, and middlemen's profits, both wholesale and retail. 
          Or, to put the matter in a nutshell, they sell cheap and buy dear. Can 
          it be wondered at that colonies so managed struggle on and finally fail?&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On the Mills and Petavel 
          plan, however, production is carried on for use. Mr. Mills has gone 
          into the question in a scientific manner, showing on a given acreage 
          of land what are the exact proportions of various crops and stock to 
          secure an economic dovetailing of industries that will make each colony 
          practically self-supporting and independent of markets and middlemen. 
          On a given acreage, with a given population, so much space would be 
          devoted to growing corn as would provide sufficient bread for the needs 
          of the colony; so much space for pasture to provide enough milk and 
          meat for the colonists, and enough wool for their clothing, and hides 
          for tanning into leather. Skilfully organised, such a colony would be 
          practically self-supporting. And each person would be taught two or 
          more trades. Each worker would become proficient in an indoor and an 
          outdoor occupation, so that there would be variety instead of monotony 
          of employment, and no time run to waste when conditions were unsuitable 
          for either indoor or outdoor work. Such a colony would get for itself 
          the full value of the work done, because the mechanism of exchange would 
          not absorb half the value of the wealth produced, as is the case now. 
          A few fruit trees on such a colony would provide fresh fruit or preserves 
          all the year round for the colonists; whereas if railed to a big town, 
          the freights and middlemen's profits might absorb all the money return, 
          as sometimes actually happens to fruit-growers when a glut forces prices 
          down to a low point. As for the few necessaries or luxuries not actually 
          produced on the colony, these could be purchased by the sale of whatever 
          crops were grown in excess of their own actual requirements, a full 
          and varied life being thus secured.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace next referred 
          to an educational system that has been proposed, and which has his enthusiastic 
          support. This system starts on the assumption that all class distinctions 
          are to be abolished. An education Act would be passed, under which the 
          children of the slums, the children of the artisans, of agricultural 
          labourers, of the middle-classes, and of the aristocracy would go to 
          school together from infancy. These schools would be day-schools, and 
          on entering in the morning, all the children would be undressed and 
          bathed. They would then be dressed again, but not in their own clothes, 
          for uniforms would be provided so that the class distinction of dress, 
          as expounded by Carlyle in his philosophy of clothes, would no longer 
          operate. The advantage claimed for this system, by Dr. Wallace, is that 
          it would break down the caste that arises from differences of education; 
          nor would harm come to the children of the upper classes, for all would 
          tend to approximate to the highest type by force of example. Dr. Wallace 
          did not appear to think there was any danger of the lower morals or 
          manners of the slum children contaminating the others, and went on to 
          say that these schools would be entirely supported by the State, and 
          that school-time would extend to the age of twenty-five. Seeing a look 
          of surprise on my face, he went on to say that this would involve no 
          economic loss to the community, because of the greater value to the 
          State of young men and women when their education, which would be manual 
          as well as scholastic, was finished. Their added economic value in efficiency 
          would more than pay the whole cost of their education and support up 
          to the age of twenty-five years.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the magic of his 
          personality, Dr. Wallace conjured up before me a Utopia, where noble 
          men and beautiful women with sweet children lived in a state of refinement, 
          harmony, and plenty. I did not like to break the spell of the vision 
          by any untoward remark, but a sceptical vein that runs through my most 
          optimistic moments prompted me to ask: &quot;Under such a scheme, where plenty 
          reigned, would not the population so increase that poverty would eventually 
          come in again?&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This had the result 
          of stirring up the great scientist to make a vigorous protest. &quot;The 
          theory propounded by Malthus,&quot; he said, &quot;is the greatest of all delusions. 
          As man develops towards a higher type; as he becomes more refined and 
          more civilised, so his fecundity decreases. Low down in the scale of 
          life, birth is only limited by available sustenance. But the higher 
          grows the type, the less is the fecundity. This is true, not only of 
          ascending types in the evolutionary scale, but it is also true of ascending 
          man. The fecundity of the slums is much greater than that of Mayfair. 
          As man progresses in comfort and refinement, he tends to have fewer 
          progeny; as witness the millions of India and China, compared with <font color="990000">[[p. 
          663]]</font> the almost stationary population of England, and the declining 
          native population of France. Besides, if young people continued at school 
          until the age of twenty-five, early marriages would be discountenanced, 
          for public opinion would not tolerate marriage during the educational 
          period.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, 
          with an energy that surprised me, &quot;you must not dream that I approve 
          of any of the modern eugenic heresies that are now being advocated. 
          I feel a little sore on this point,&quot; he continued, &quot;because in a popular 
          scientific publication that has just been sent to me, I am referred 
          to as spending the evening of my days in furthering the teaching of 
          eugenics. Wherever did I advocate any such preposterous theories?&quot; he 
          said in scorn. &quot;Not a reference to any of my writings; not a word is 
          quoted in justification of this scientific libel. Where can they put 
          their finger on any statement of mine that as much as lends colour to 
          such an assertion? Why, never by word or deed have I given the slightest 
          countenance to eugenics. Segregation of the unfit, indeed! It is a mere 
          excuse for establishing a medical tyranny. And we have enough of this 
          kind of tyranny already. Even now, the lunacy laws give dangerous powers 
          to the medical fraternity. At the present moment, there are some perfectly 
          sane people incarcerated in lunatic asylums simply for believing in 
          spiritualism. The world does not want the eugenist to set it straight. 
          Give the people good conditions, improve their environment, and all 
          will tend towards the highest type. Eugenics is simply the meddlesome 
          interference of an arrogant, scientific priestcraft. There are,&quot; he 
          said, &quot;no really bad people; no one absolutely beyond reclaim. That 
          is where our prison system is all wrong. We treat our prisoners as though 
          they were utterly bad. There are none utterly bad, but only different 
          degrees of goodness. When we understand that, we shall give up our absurd 
          ideas of punishing crime, and shall, instead, try to reform the criminal.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up to go. But 
          Dr. Wallace was in no hurry to let me depart. For nearly three hours, 
          however, he had been talking, and that must involve no small strain 
          on a man of ninety. So I persisted in taking my departure, although 
          the charm of his personality almost overcame my judgment, and I would 
          fain have stayed a little longer, to sit at his feet and absorb the 
          wisdom of two centuries.</p>

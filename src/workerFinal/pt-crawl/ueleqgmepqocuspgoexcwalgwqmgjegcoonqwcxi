<h2>Background</h2>   
<P>   
The    
<A HREF = "http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/inforweb.html">Informedia Digital Video Library at    
Carnegie Mellon University</A> is   
one of the NSF/DARPA/NASA jointly funded Digital Library Initiative   
projects, established in 1995.  This particular effort focuses on   
search and discovery in the video medium.  The Informedia project will   
establish a large, on-line digital video library by developing   
intelligent, automatic mechanisms to populate the library and allow for   
full-content and knowledge-based search and retrieval via desktop   
computer and metropolitan area networks.  Initially, the library will   
be populated with several thousand hours of raw and edited video drawn   
from licensed public television documentaries and broadcast news and   
special events.  The library is being deployed in testbeds at local   
area K-12 schools, at Carnegie Mellon University, and as demonstration   
systems at government sponsors.   
<P>   
The distinguishing feature of our technical approach is the integrated   
application of speech, language and image understanding technologies   
for efficient creation and exploration of the library.  Using a   
high-quality speech recognizer, the sound track of each videotape or   
broadcast, combined and aligned with closed-captioning information when   
available, is converted to a textual transcript.  A language   
understanding system then analyzes and organizes the transcript and   
stores it in a full-text information retrieval system.  Likewise, image   
understanding techniques are used for segmenting video sequences by   
automatically locating boundaries of shots, scenes, and conversations.   
The system thus partitions video into small-sized segments and provides   
alternate representations and abstractions of video content to better   
support information retrieval and manipulation.  Exploration of the   
library is based on these same techniques.     
<P>   
<h2>Component and Content Availability</h2>

<h3>Present</h3>   
<p>   
The highly modular system structure and implementation of the   
Informedia Digital Video Library system is itself a fertile testbed for   
researchers in many disciplines.  Any of the component systems (e.g.,   
speech recognition, image sequence segmentation; user interface display   
and control tools; text indexing, search and retrieval; video servers;   
network streaming protocols; dynamic pricing algorithms) can be   
exported for use in other research projects elsewhere.  It is our   
intent to encourage investigation by DLI researchers who have interests   
in any of the components as well as the overall system use and   
application.  We can also import components from DLI members to   
incorporate into the Informedia system (such as natural language   
processing, speech recognition, or image segmentation systems, etc.),   
if built to our interfaces and data types.  One application, News on Demand, has already been described in    
this magazine (<a href = "../september95/nod/09hauptmann1.html">September 1995</a>) and a    
discussion of some of the education-related applications will be forthcoming in the fall.   
<P>   
<h3>Future</h3>   
<p>   
External research groups will have much the same set of opportunities,   
with restricted licensing and a different cost structure.  Requests for   
involvement by external researchers will be evaluated by the project's   
principal investigators.  Criteria include anticipated impact on the   
performance or function of the overall system and costs to integrate   
and verify their contributions if implementation is involved.   
<P>   
Maturing Informedia into a universally-usable system will enable easier   
access to researchers.  We are currently moving towards an HTML   
Informedia client interface, utilizing commonly available technology to   
allow access over the Internet.  To date, the interface has been a   
customized, proprietary, Windows 95 application.  Research into   
Informedia's data and networking architecture will lead ultimately to   
using emerging commercial servers for data distribution, and satisfying   
their standards and protocols.  Data and derived metadata in the   
Informedia library are collected under license, and can be licensed by   
others.  We are now pursuing public domain data as well.     
<a href = "http://www.ini.cmu.edu/NETBILL/home.html">NetBill</a>, our   
network billing component, is a separable body of code (both in client   
and server) that is being made available to other DLI sites for use as   
desired.   
<P>   
The Informedia library will continue to exist beyond the end of the   
current project; we expect that user support and services will be   
provided by third parties.  We anticipate future applications of the   
technology in the health field, education and training, etc.  Work on   
the various components of the Informedia Digital Video Library system   
(such as speech, language processing, and image understanding) will   
continue at Carnegie Mellon for related research efforts.  We will   
maintain the infrastructure for creation and dissemination of digital   
video content, with network access as appropriate.   
<P>   
An important and explicit goal of this project is to accelerate   
acceptance of Informedia Library technologies by seeding the network   
community and priming the providers, both non-profit and commercial.   
We have assembled the project partners and organized the project   
structure with this goal in mind.  The    
<A HREF = "http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/sponsors.html">partnerships</A> we have established   
for resources, field testing, and productization will enable us to   
achieve a more pervasive impact and potential commercial realization,   
and ultimately allow the Informedia Digital Video Library system to   
survive beyond its research infancy.

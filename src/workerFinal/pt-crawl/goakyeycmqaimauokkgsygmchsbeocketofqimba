<p>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded $755,000 to the Penn State University Libraries to support an extensive study of digital image delivery. Project partners include the School of Information Sciences
and Technology (IST), Center for Education Technology Services, and the
Center for Quality and Planning, Library Computing Services. Co-Principal Investigator's on
the project include Dr. Amanda Spink, Associate Professor of Information
Sciences and Technology; Roger Brisson, Digital Access Librarian;
Michael Dooris, Director of Planning Research and Assessment; Eric
Ferrin, Senior Director of Library Computing Services; and Henry
Pisciotta, Arts and Architecture Librarian and Assistant Head of the
Arts and Humanities Library.</p>

<p>The Visual Image User Study (VIUS, pronounced "views") will examine the
use of digital pictures at Penn State in the disciplines of the arts,
environmental studies, and the humanities. The project includes the
development and testing of a prototype digital library system for image
delivery. Phase one of the project will employ a variety of needs
assessment methods and information retrieval studies to analyze current
and future needs of teachers, learners, and archival managers. The
second phase, based on results of phase one, will create the design and
content of the prototype system. Reviewers of the plan praise its
client-centered approach, interdisciplinary scope, institutional
teamwork, and potential to contribute useful data to important
research aspects of digital library development. Slated to begin in May
2001, activities will continue for twenty-six months. A summary of the
project is available at &lt;<a href="http://www.libraries.psu.edu/crsweb/vius">http://www.libraries.psu.edu/crsweb/vius</a>&gt;.

&lt;<a href="mailto:meta-e@germ1.uibk.ac.at">meta-e@germ1.uibk.ac.at</a>&gt;
</p>


<p>The METAe project <http://meta-e.uibk.ac.at/> is a highly collaborative research and software development project in which university departments, libraries, archives and software companies from seven European countries and the US are cooperating in order to develop application software for the digitization of printed material. Initial prototypes of the software will be available in 2002. The METAe project is co-funded by the European Commission, "Digital Heritage and Cultural Content" area &lt;<a href="http://www.cordis.lu/ist/ka3/digicult/">http://www.cordis.lu/ist/ka3/digicult/</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>The main objectives of METAe are: 
</p>
<ul><li>to ease the digitization of books, journals and magazines in terms of cost-effectiveness and degree of automation;</li></ul>

<ul><li>to enrich the output of the conversion process in terms of structural metadata capturing; and</li></ul>

<ul><li>to enhance the opportunity for successful digital preservation from the very beginning of life-cycle management by producing highly standardized information objects. </li></ul>

<p>The METAe software is designed to be a comprehensive software package where all tasks within a digitization workflow can be carried out according to the standards currently emerging, such as the Open Archival Information System &lt;<a href="http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/nost/isoas/overview.html">http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/nost/isoas/overview.html</a>&gt; or the NISO working draft for Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images.
</p>

<p>The functionality of the software will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating images</li>
<li>enhancing and pre-processing images</li>
<li>capturing descriptive metadata from electronic library catalogues</li>
<li>carrying out OCR-processing</li>
<li>creating technical and administrative metadata</li>
<li>extracting structural metadata</li>
<li>organizing permanent quality control</li>
</ul>

<p>The core of the METAe engine is an integrated layout and document
recognition system designed to find the hierarchical structures
constituting a book or journal, e.g. the issues and articles of a
periodical or the chapters and sub-chapters of a book as well as other
elements forming part of the layout, such as footnotes, page numbers,
illustrations, or caption lines. 
</p>

<p>The METAe software package will also consist of a specialized Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine adapted to recognize old typefaces and historical texts. This is an overdue task, especially for the German typeface "Fraktur", a derivate of the gothic letter that was used in a large majority of printed texts in Central Europe and the Nordic countries until the middle of the 20th century. The OCR engine will be supported by five historical dictionaries representing the orthography of the English, French, German, Italian and Spanish languages. 
</p>

<p>Keep informed about the progress of the project by monitoring the following:<br>
METAe mailing list: &lt;<a href="http://meta-e.uibk.ac.at/contact.html">http://meta-e.uibk.ac.at/contact.html</a>&gt;<br>
METAe newsletter: &lt;<a href="http://meta-e.uibk.ac.at/newsletter/news.htm">http://meta-e.uibk.ac.at/newsletter/news.htm</a>&gt;</p>

<p>We welcome contact with libraries and organizations whose digital holdings include page images of books and journals. Organizations willing to support us in building up our test bed are encouraged to contact the METAe team.

&lt;<a href="mailto:Peggy.Price@usm.edu">Peggy.Price@usm.edu</a>&gt;
</p>


<p>The McCain Library and Archives is pleased to announce the launch of their new Website, The Special Collections Virtual Reading Room.  By translating traditional reading room activities into an online environment, the site enhances access to physical and virtual resources.  Its most innovative feature allows users to search, full-text, the finding aids that describe and inventory the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) Libraries' unique primary source collections in Archives, the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection, and its other special collections.  The site also offers an overview of the collections held in the McCain Library as well as contact information, news and exhibits, and instructional information.  It links to digital collections and relevant databases. </p>

<p>USM Libraries' Special Collections department encompasses the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection, USM Archives, Mississippiana, and the Special Collections Digital Lab. Each collection maintains a Web presence. The new site operates as a comprehensive focal point for research in Special Collections, gathering information across collections and unifying searching functions. 
A functional splash page lists the four primary components of the site, and with the roll of a computer mouse, a content outline of each component page appears:</p>

<blockquote><strong>About</strong>: Provides contact information, hours, location, services and information for donors.<br> 
<strong>Collections</strong>: Offers descriptions of each collection, with links to their respective pages.<br>
<strong>Research</strong>: Facilitates access to finding aids, pathfinders and the vertical file indexes. "Using the collections" defines these terms and helps newer users identify needs. Online resources are listed as well.<br>
<strong>Showcase</strong>: Informs users about news items, events and activities associated with Special Collections materials and people. Exhibit announcements are included on the showcase page, along with links to online exhibits.</blockquote>
<p>A search box located at the bottom of the page provides comprehensive access to online finding aids and indexes. The USM Libraries offers 540 online registers (processed collections) and another 300 accession records (unprocessed collections) for USM Archives and the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection.  The USM Libraries have had finding aids on the Web as early as 1995, but through the Virtual Reading Room, these descriptive tools are searchable in a more comprehensive fashion.</p> 

<p>In addition to the finding aids, the Virtual Reading Room allows searching of the de Grummond and Mississippiana vertical file indexes and other guides to collections. Users will also find direct hyperlinks to the online catalog, databases and, soon, the digital media archive. Listed, too, are hyperlinks to finding aids in de Grummond and Archives, and the Mississippiana vertical file and pathfinders. Online resources are divided into subject categories, and provide access to relevant sites on campus, throughout the state and nationwide.</p> 

<p>Other points of interest include a new Mississippiana/Other Special Collections page &lt;<a href="http://www.lib.usm.edu/~spcol/msana/">http://www.lib.usm.edu/~spcol/msana/</a>&gt; and the Civil Rights in Mississippi Digital Archive with full-text oral history transcripts with selected audio clips &lt;<a href="http://www.lib.usm.edu/~spcol/crda/">http://www.lib.usm.edu/~spcol/crda/</a>&gt;.

<p>Major UK initiatives such as the People's Network &lt;<a href="http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/">http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/</a>&gt;, the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) &lt;<a href="http://www.ngfl.gov.uk/">http://www.ngfl.gov.uk/</a>&gt; and the University for Industry &lt;<a href="http://www.ufiltd.co.uk/">http://www.ufiltd.co.uk/</a>&gt; aim to provide seamless access to online material.  It is timely, therefore, to pay attention to the internal design of the resources themselves so that, once accessed, the required data can be retrieved as quickly and easily as possible. </p>

<p>EBONI aims to tackle one aspect of this problem by developing a set of recommendations for publishing electronic textbooks on the Web, reflecting the needs of academics and a diverse population of students across the UK.  The project will identify and compare the various methods which have emerged in the publication of learning and teaching resources on the Web in order to determine the most effective way of representing information electronically, in order to maximize usability and information intake by users.  An evaluation of textbooks by students from a range of disciplines and backgrounds will form the basis of best practice guidelines for publishing educational material on the Internet.  This will enable the needs of an emerging higher education community of readers and creators of digital content to be met more satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Specifically, EBONI aims to:</p>

<ul><li>Evaluate the different approaches to the design of learning and teaching resources on the Web, and to identify which techniques are most successful in enabling users to retrieve the information they require.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Identify and report on the individual requirements of academics and students in learning and teaching on the Web.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Compile and promote a set of best practice guidelines for the publication of textbooks on the Internet for the UK higher education community.</li></ul>

<p>Key outcomes will include:</p>

<ul><li>A catalogue of online learning and teaching resources, resulting from a survey of  Higher Education (HE) material available on the Internet &lt;<a href="http://eboni.dis.strath.ac.uk:8080/search">http://eboni.dis.strath.ac.uk:8080/search</a>&gt;. </li></ul>

<ul><li>A full, flexible methodology for evaluating electronic books, from which related experiments can be derived.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The final set of guidelines for designing electronic books.</li></ul>

<p>EBONI is funded under the JISC DNER Programme for Learning and Teaching and is based at the Centre for Digital Library Research &lt;<a href="http://cdlr.strath.ac.uk/">http://cdlr.strath.ac.uk/</a>&gt;, University of Strathclyde.  Further information can be found at the project Web site &lt;<a href="http://eboni.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/">http://eboni.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/</a>&gt;.

Images Standards Committee<br> &lt;<a href="http://www.niso.org/commitau.html">http://www.niso.org/commitau.html</a>&gt; </p>

<p>Technical metadata, which describes various aspects of image characteristics and the capture process, is increasingly being perceived as an essential component of any digitization initiative. This category of metadata is not only required to support image quality assessment and image enhancement and processing, but is also seen as crucial for long-term collection management to ensure the longevity of digital collections. The goal of the NISO Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images Standards initiative is to develop a generalized technical metadata standard applicable to all images regardless of their method of creation. The charge of the Committee is to review and revise the "Data Dictionary for Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images" &lt;<a href="http://www.niso.org/pdfs/DataDict.pdf">http://www.niso.org/pdfs/DataDict.pdf</a>&gt;, which presents a comprehensive list of technical data elements required to manage digital image collections. We would like to invite comments from our colleagues involved in various aspects of imaging to ensure that the draft dictionary is comprehensive and inclusive, representing various perspectives. The ultimate goal of the standard is to facilitate the development of applications to validate, process, manage, and migrate images of enduring value.</p>

<p>We are particularly interested in getting your feedback on the following issues:</p>

<p>a) Does the draft dictionary include all the data fields that are necessary to achieve the goals of technical metadata?</p>
<ul><li>Document image provenance and history </li></ul>

<ul><li>Ensure that image data will be rendered accurately on output (e.g., displayed on screen, printed to
paper or film, etc.)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Support the ongoing management of image files (e.g., processing, refreshing, or migration)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Assess the aesthetic value of a given image</li></ul>

<p>b) Is it successful in describing quality attributes such as detail, color, tone, and file size? What else would you recommend adding?</p>

<p>c) Of the elements present, do you have suggestions for changes within the definitions? Do any definitions need to be expanded? Do you agree with a structure where some elements are "required" and others are "optional" or "recommended"? Should certain elements be repeatable?</p>

<p>d) Put yourself in the position of a user of this data dictionary. What would you do to make it more usable for you (or your staff)?</p>

<p>e) Does this initiative relate well to other similar ones such as DIG or GDI+? Do you know of other related initiatives?</p>

</p>

<p>As a result of a college wide installation of a wireless network here at
SUNY Morrisville College linked to our IBM ThinkPad University program,  the
library has been investigating ways to better serve users that are not
connected by a wire to the network.  These users could be anywhere on our
campus.  Three new resources have been created from my searching for
wireless information.</p>

<p>Wireless Librarian<br>
 &lt;<a href="http://people.morrisville.edu/~drewwe/wireless/">http://people.morrisville.edu/~drewwe/wireless/</a>&gt;</p>

<p>As a result of my investigations and frustration with a lack of easily accessible  information, I started a website called the Wireless
Librarian.  As it says on this site, "The purpose of this page is to provide
a space for documenting my experiences using wireless.  I will also include
links to sites of interest."
The page includes links to many articles and other sites about libraries
doing wireless as well as links to sites explaining the technology.</p> 

<p>Libraries with Wireless:<br>
&lt;<a href="http://people.morrisville.edu/~drewwe/wireless/wirelesslibraries.htm">http://people.morrisville.edu/~drewwe/wireless/wirelesslibraries.htm</a>&gt;</p> 

<p>I soon found I needed an organized list of libraries that use wireless to provide nomadic access to their resources.  The following introductory
paragraph on that page says it all:</p>

<p>"Tell me if your library has wireless network for its patrons.  Send me a
URL that links to either your library or a page describing your wireless
efforts.  Many libraries are running programs where they lend laptops.  They
are included here if they also have a wireless network for the laptops. This
list includes libraries that already have a wireless network or have almost
finished installing it."</p>

<p>Both current users and non-users of Eprint Archives are invited to
participate. The survey consists of about 72 web-based questions,
takes less than 10 minutes to complete, and comes in four
versions:</p>

<p><strong>Physicists, astrophysicists, mathematicians, and related fields</strong>:</p>

   <blockquote>1. arXiv Users</blockquote>

   <blockquote>2. arXiv Non-Users</blockquote>

</p>

<p>On "Day One" of the pilot test of Library of Congress Classification on the World Wide Web, 300 people registered to use the service, which is named <em>Classification Web</em>. Six weeks later 3,500 people had registered, with new users registering daily. "The response to our <em>Classification Web</em> pilot test has been very positive," said Peter R. Young, chief of the Cataloging Distribution Service -- the Library of Congress division conducting the pilot program. "There is clearly great interest in such a web-based service throughout the library community," Young continued, "and we encourage catalogers and reference librarians everywhere to access <em>Classification Web</em> and give us feedback." The service provides instant access to up-to-date LC Classification data wherever a user has a Web connection. Currently, Library of Congress Subject Headings are also included in the pilot test, which ends March 30, 2001.  </p>

<p>"We hope all users of <em>Classification Web</em> will fill out the brief online survey," Cheryl C. Cook, <em>Classification Web</em> pilot project coordinator stated. "A lot of good user feedback is very important to this project -- it will help us determine if CDS will offer <em>Classification Web</em> as a cost-recovery service," she emphasized. Typically, librarians are accessing <em>Classification Web</em> to query the LC Classification database by captions or to see links and relationships between LC subject headings and LC Classification schedules.</p>

<p><em>Classification Web</em> is available by visiting the web site at &lt;<a href="http://www.lccweb.net">http://www.lccweb.net</a>&gt;. The latest information about the pilot test is posted on the CDS home page at &lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/cds">http://www.loc.gov/cds</a>&gt;. CDS publishes the complete range of LC's cataloging publications and  services for the library community.

<h4>NISO Creates OpenURL Standard Committee</h4>

<p>"Bethesda, Maryland, USA – March, 2001 The National Information Standards
Organization (NISO) has announced the formation of a committee to develop
the OpenURL Standard.  This standard will allow information seekers to be
connected to the appropriate copy of any chosen resource by passing along
bibliographic or descriptive information about the resource in the form of
metadata and taking into account the user’s organizational context or
starting point.  A variety of appropriate related resources may also be made
available using OpenURL syntax. This new standard will let information
providers connect their customers to services and products more cleanly and
directly."</p>

<p>"The committee is charged to build a syntax for web-transportable packages of
metadata and/or identifiers about an information object. This information is
at the core of context-sensitive or open link technology. By standardizing
the syntax, this work will enable the development of innovative
user-specific services in the scholarly communications industry and other
information fields.  For example, product descriptions could be linked to
technical support services targeted to specific user categories.  The
OpenURL standard may impact the level of basic Internet infrastructure,
where resolution of identifiers in a context-sensitive manner is required."</p>

<h4>Sun Microsystems &amp; Stanford University's LOCKSS Program to Expand through Mellon Foundation Funding</h4>


<p>"PALO ALTO, California -- February 5, 2001 -- Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq:  SUNW), and The Stanford University Libraries today announced that the  Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has provided continuation funding for an online archiving program designed to provide reliable, persistent access to academic materials published on the Internet. Initiated as a collaboration between Sun and Stanford, this project may provide a solution to the problem of collecting and maintaining permanent access to electronic scholarly publications and library collections, whose sustainability and permanency would otherwise remain largely subject to the whim of publishers...."</p>

<p>"...Initially funded by The National Science Foundation and Sun Microsystems, the project was initiated in May 2000 and includes as test sites the libraries at Stanford, Harvard, Columbia, University of California at Berkeley, University of Tennessee and the Los Alamos National Library. The newly announced funding from the Mellon Foundation will allow for the global expansion of the project, including a second test that will include dozens of major libraries starting in April 2001."</p>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">This morning the latest issue
        of Azerbaijan International arrived on my desk in London. Putting
        aside Qatar, Algeria, Namibia and the rest of my new world, I
        opened it. Turning the pages, memories of the effort, the frustration
        and the hardships of the last four years came pouring back-all
        warm, sticky and sweet.<BR>
<BR>
        The short story by Sabir Ahmadli is a glimpse at the &quot;Azeri&quot;
        soul. The calm poetic beauty of the writer's words convey the
        utter senselessness of the brutality that has been directed towards
        the peoples of this region-in Baku, Almaty, and Chechnya- which
        stretch back unchanged to the time even before the Tsars.<BR>
<BR>
        Amazing, no matter the frustration and personal inconvenience,
        I really loved what I was doing in Baku. I loved the people I
        was working with, and the idea that what Chevron is doing in
        Azerbaijan really matters. After four years, perhaps, I became
        too involved with Azerbaijan and too focused on Baku . . . perhaps.<BR>
<BR>
        To Azerbaijan International, thank you for causing me to remember.
        In the end, it is the memories of real people, of real effort,
        and of real friendships that really matter.</FONT></P>

        in Saudi Arabia who have lived and traveled abroad for more than
        15 years and visited more than 40 countries. Recently, we met
        some Azerbaijanis from Baku and pumped them for information about
        this area of which we knew so little. It resulted in a new friendship
        and a two week vacation to Azerbaijan (extended from one week
        because we were having such a good time). <BR>
<BR>
        Azerbaijan is one of the best kept travel secrets in the world.
        We want everyone to know it's worth the trip. Never have we visited
        a country in which we were so warmly accepted or which was so
        full of delightful surprises. Azerbaijan has a deep and fascinating
        history. The capital is a beautiful city, reminiscent of old
        Vienna. The surrounding countryside is rich in archaeology and
        agriculture. We stayed at one of the hotels that was within walking
        distance of a seaside boulevard park as well as the ancient walled
        inner city. Azerbaijanis love to celebrate culture and the Arts.
        There are museums, theaters and squares throughout the city as
        well as opera houses and concert halls. The food is great and
        taxis are cheap. For sightseeing tours we met Azerbaijan International's
        Contributing Writer, Fuad Akhundov, who calls himself &quot;amateur&quot;
        but we found him the best and most knowledgeable guide we had
        ever had in any place in the world.<BR>

        from Baku</FONT></B></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">I recently checked the Nobel
        Foundation Web Page and found nothing about our homeland, Azerbaijan,
        in connection to the world recognized Nobel Prize. Well, I complained.
        Here's the letter I wrote and the result...<BR>
<BR>
        &quot;I recently saw the Nobel Foundation Web Page and the article
        about Alfred Nobel, benefactor of the Nobel Prize. The article
        is very well written except that it omits that Nobel acquired
        much of his wealth in Azerbaijan, specifically from oil fields
        in Baku at the turn of last century. This money is still being
        used to honor Nobel Laureates and their great contributions to
        modern society. Please contact me if I'm wrong, however I would
        really appreciate if additional material about the life of Nobel
        in Azerbaijan could be added to your Web Server.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
        The reply I received came from Hans Mehlin of the Karolinska
        Institute in Stockholm who wrote, &quot;You are correct. Especially
        Alfred's brothers, [Robert and Ludwig] were involved in the oil
        business in Azerbaijan. We are planning to make extensive changes
        to the Server this summer. Plans are already being made to include
        this kind of information. Several relatives of the Nobel Family
        will be traveling to Azerbaijan this summer to visit places that
        relate to the Nobels. They will provide us with photos and text
        after the trip.&quot;</FONT></P>

        wrote about the relationship of the Nobel Prize to Azerbaijan
        (AI 2:3. Summer 1994). Alfred Nobel was the largest single shareholder
        in the Baku oil fields and factories owned by his brothers, Robert
        and Ludwig. When Alfred died in 1896, much of his legacy went
        to fund the Nobel Prize. Swedish historian, E. Bargengren, who
        had access to the Nobel family archives, insists that it was
        this &quot;decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from
        Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes
        to be established.&quot; This year, 1996, commemorates 100 years
        since the Prize was established, although the first awards were
        designated in 1901. <BR>

        your magazine to the world about the desperate situation that
        exists here when children are born with Thalassemia. It is so
        difficult for the families and medical personnel to see how much
        these children suffer and how often and how young they are when
        they die. This tragedy is even more painful when we realize how

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">I'm the author of the short
        article &quot;The Thalassemic Child: A Mother's Dilemma&quot;
        which you published in your Autumn 1995 issue (AI 3:4, p. 56).
        Thank you very much for revealing our misfortune to the world.
<BR>
<BR>
        I'm 33 years old, a physician by profession. Three years ago
        I was happy. I had a family, a husband. I loved and was loved.
        We had a healthy and handsome seven year old son. And then we
        decided that our son should have a little sister. From then on,
        my life turned into a nightmare. Our second child was a beautiful
        girl and when she was two years old, she was diagnosed with thalassemia-a
        hereditary blood disorder. The average life span for such children
        is 24 in the world, in Azerbaijan these days, it's only about
        10-12 years. And so when we received the diagnosis, the meaning
        of my life was lost. No mother can reconcile herself to such
        a tragedy of seeing her innocent child slowly perish.<BR>
<BR>
        I feel the ground slipping from beneath my feet. In search of
        a way out of this situation, I am losing my head. I'm in despair.
        An ominous fate is hanging over me and my family but I will not
        give in. I will struggle for the life of my daughter and the
        happiness of my family which is unthinkable without Nargis (her
        name is the flower, &quot;Narcissus&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
        My elder son, Farid, who is already ten and is aware of my sufferings
        tells me, &quot;Don't feel so miserable, Mother. Everything will
        be OK with us and I will save my sister even if I have to sacrifice
        my health for her.&quot; Trying to support me morally, he cannot
        imagine how dangerous this illness is for his sister. A child
        is only a child after all. <BR>
<BR>
        The point is that the situation in Azerbaijan is desperate. Thalassemia
        is endemic here. Proportionately, we have more than our share
        of children with this disease-more than 2,000 children. The families
        with these children desperately need help. We can't even depend
        on getting sufficient blood that we need in Azerbaijan. <BR>
<BR>
        Scientists promise us that a cure is imminent by about the turn
        of the century. Our greatest task here in Azerbaijan is just
        to be able to help our children cling to life until such a cure
        is found. Our Institutes are so desperate for all the equipment
        and supplies, from blood bags to blood pumps that help filter
        out excessive iron when our children are transfused. It's so
        hard to find blood donors; there are so many problems linked
        with this disease. Every day we clutch onto life by the sheer
        force of our willpower.<BR>
<BR>
        Kind people do exist everywhere who take no heed of nationality
        or religion. Human kindness is immortal and I believe such people
        exist who can help us to until a cure can be found. I believe
        in miracles and await-both with fear and expectation.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Of all the publications that
        cross my desk related to the Newly Independent States (NIS),
        &quot;Azerbaijan International&quot; provides the most thorough
        coverage of any Republic in the former Soviet Union in its depiction
        of the many layers of contemporary society. Such material in
        English is rare and difficult to find on many of these newly
        independent countries.<BR>
<BR>
        The interviews, features, business stories, literary contributions,
        letters and photos provide the most diverse and comprehensive
        coverage about Azerbaijan available anywhere in the world for
        the English language reader. To that end, I'm pleased to see
        that you now have an &quot;Azerbaijan International Web Page&quot;
        on the Internet and that the majority of your articles from all
        the previous issues are being made available there. This provides
        a wealth of material worldwide about Azerbaijan to those with
        computer access. <BR>
<BR>
        Extremely important are your articles in Azeri (both Latin and
        Arabic script) for those scholars, specialists and native speakers
        who rarely have such a forum for public discourse and expression
        through native languages.<BR>
<BR>
        Despite the difficult transition now taking place in Azerbaijan,
        your publication strives to present a balanced, forward-thinking
        depiction of Azerbaijan. With continuing hardships borne by the
        people, it is crucial to look to the future, focusing on the
        positive and constructive developments in international relations,
        politics, economics, social issues and on the individuals themselves
        who are working towards realizing these goals in Azerbaijan.
        Thanks for your commitment to the future of this region by publishing
        such a journal.</FONT></P>

        Issue and was really impressed, as usual. One very descriptive
        word for AI is &quot;classy,&quot; whatever the theme! It's not
        a particularly literary word, but apt just the same.<BR>
<BR>
        Since the Health and Medical Care Issue [AI 3:4, Autumn 1995],
        I've been on the lookout for more information about Azerbaijan
        medicine. I'm convinced that they could teach us quite a bit
        about TLC-&quot;tender loving care,&quot; that increasingly rare,
        but most important of all medical services. <BR>
<BR>
        Their medical science may not be exactly the latest because of
        outdated equipment, but the hearts of so many of their medical
        personnel definitely seem to be in the right place. If true,
        that makes their initial problem more economic than scientific.
        It must be a real mind-boggler to make the transition from Communist
        to Capitalist economics!<BR>
<BR>
        I also have just read somewhere that Azeris have one doctor for
        every 875 citizens. If that figure is accurate, it exceeds the
        US ratio by quite a sizable margin and makes me wonder what happens
        to all the 8,000 medical students when they graduate. I'm looking
        forward to the time when the Azerbaijan Medical University has
        its own Web Page or Listserv. Hope that will come in 1996.</FONT></P>

        about &quot;Contemporary Literature in Azerbaijan&quot; (4:1,
        Spring 1996). I found it both interesting and inspiring as it
        provided a frame of reference showing how the Soviet period impacts
        literature and writing today. I was very touched by Rail Kuliyev's
        concern [Reader's Forum] about the need for materials in the
        British Library which reflect the true spirit of contemporary
        and independent Azerbaijan. <BR>
<BR>
        Jala Garibova's interview with writer Sabir Ahmadli [New Literary

        1990, when Russian troops attacked Baku.<BR>
<BR>
        What really shocked me was Galib Mammad's article [Loopholes
        and Democracy: An Azerbaijani Diplomat Looks at U.S. Policy].
        While I like to think of myself as a relatively well-informed
        person, I didn't know about Section 907 of the &quot;Freedom
        Support Act&quot; which denies direct aid to Azerbaijan's government.
        Nor did I know that Azerbaijan is the only single Republic among
        15 of the Former Soviet Union which has been denied US financial
        support. I wish I knew more. I'd be willing to write a letter
        if I had more information.<BR>
<BR>
        Azerbaijan International, under your editorship, paints a bittersweet
        picture of what is, and has been, going on in Azerbaijan. Poignant
        because it shows an independent culture which has been throttled
        and which is trying to break out and establish its own identity.

        I'm an exchange student from Azerbaijan, completing my junior
        year at Klein High School in Houston. I've been here seven months.
        So much has happened to me during this short period. It has definitely
        changed my purpose for living.<BR>
<BR>
        Before I came to America, I was a simple Azeri schoolgirl, who
        was interested in the English language, American history and
        culture. I loved this country very much but could never dream
        about coming here. America was something great, but much too
        far away.<BR>
<BR>
        When the American Embassy opened in Baku in 1993, I used to spend
        hours visiting its library reading room with its magnificent
        books. One day I learned that United States Information Services
        (USIS) and World Learning were planning to sponsor an exchange
        program for high school students and 50 students would be selected
        to study in the US for one year. I was so thrilled just to be
        able to dream about such a possibility. <BR>
<BR>
        The competition was very difficult. Nearly one thousand students
        competed in the application process which included tests, compositions,
        interviews and cultural orientation. In the end I was one of
        the lucky few to be chosen. My family and friends say I was &quot;born
        under a lucky star in a happy shirt.&quot; I think it's true.<BR>
<BR>
        I soon learned that even though Americans are very different
        from Azerbaijanis, they're still very easy to make friends with.
        When I first started school in Texas, my classmates-American
        teenagers-always asked where I was from. When I told them, they
        were surprised and showed skepticism on their faces. They would
        ask, &quot;From Aza...what?&quot; And then I would be bombarded
        with questions like, &quot;Is it in Africa?&quot; or &quot;Do
        you have electricity, cars and TV sets?&quot; Answering all these
        questions made me very sad and, to tell you the truth, a bit
        insulted. How could American students, who have all these wonderful
        books and all these wonderful opportunities to learn about every
        country in the world, not know anything about Azerbaijan?<BR>
<BR>
        That's when I decided to try to use every opportunity to tell
        my friends about my country. It wasn't long before my Sociology
        teacher asked me to address the class. I really wanted my classmates
        to know how people live in other countries-not having three or
        four cars in every garage, supermarkets always full of food,
        pharmacies brimming with medicine and malls full of beautiful
        clothes. But more importantly, I wanted them to know what it's
        like not having peace in their homeland.<BR>
        A lot of students ask me if I want to stay in the US. I tell
        them I can't despite how wonderful life is here. If I stayed
        here, it wouldn't help my country one bit. I didn't come here
        just to enjoy my year in an American high school. I came to learn
        why American is great and how it works so I can go back help
        my country to grow strong so that one day when foreigners will
        say, &quot;Azerbaijan! Cool! I've heard a lot about that great
        country!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
        I've changed alot this year. I look at life much more seriously.
        I've learned that as a single individual, I can make a significant
        difference. Before I came here, my biggest dream was to become
        the interpreter to Azerbaijan's President. But now I'm convinced
        there is something more important for me to do. I want to be
        a simple teacher in a simple secondary school in Baku because
        it's the young people who will save our country.<BR>
<BR>
        Not long ago my father wrote me, reminding me that in the beginning
        of this century great companies like Nobel and Rothschilds operated
        in Azerbaijan. Had it not been for the 1917 Revolution and Russian
        intervention in Azerbaijan, today we would be among the most
        highly developed countries in the world. Instead, we're just
        the same as the other 14 Republics of the former Soviet Union,
        struggling through an enormously difficult economic crisis that
        affects every aspect of our lives.<BR>
<BR>
        Our legacy from the USSR is a ruined economy and an oil industry
        with old, worn-out technology. To restore all this will take
        a long time, even with the help of foreign investment. It is
        impossible to build new economic relationships based on ruined
        socialist economies. We must change the psychology of our people
        and raise up a new nation with a new entrepreneurial worldview.
        For this, our country needs specialists with broad experience
        in the fields of science and technology. I agree with my father.
        And that's why I want to be a teacher-the best teacher I can
        possibly be.<BR>
<BR>
        In closing, let me thank the government of the United States,
        World Learning Organization, Close-Up Foundation and all the
        kind and generous American people including our dear host families
        who have made these educational opportunities possible. Thanks
        for everything you've done for us.</FONT></P>

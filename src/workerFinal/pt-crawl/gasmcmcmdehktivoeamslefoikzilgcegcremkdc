        offices, on the phone and in online forums relate the 
        same story, over and over again: they were told by various 
        doctors, family members and, incredibly, county and state 
        public health department medical and science personnel, 
        that there is no Lyme disease--no occurrence of <i>Borrelia

        know what these nay-sayers are smoking, but may I have 
        some, please? Perhaps then I will be able to forget the 
        existence of the following bits of data documenting that 
        Lyme indeed has been rearing its teeny ugly mouthparts 
        in California for decades. (Like, for instance, this CDC 
        <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/tickmap.htm">map</a>.)</font> 
      </P>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">One 
        serious drawback to the data you will find below is that 
        the numbers are grossly understated since counties and 
        states are using the Centers for Disease Control's <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/epi.htm">epidemiological</a> 
        criteria as if it were a definitive diagnostic test. Since 
        the CDC's epidemiological criteria ignores some of the 
        most significant <i>Borrelia</i>-specific and -related 
        bands on Western Blot tests, and most accepted standard 
        medical texts (such as <a href="http://search.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/query?DISAMBIGUATION=true&FUNCTION=search&SERVER2=server2&SERVER1=server1&PARAMETER=borreliosis">Medline</a>,

        and others) don't even recommend any WB testing for diagnostic 
        purposes, Lyme <I>appears</I> to occur rarely in California 
        and the U.S, if you go by state and federal surveillance 
        figures. Additionally, doctors and medical societies are 
        using the CDC epidemiological criteria as if it were the 
        ABC's of how to diagnose Lyme and many other TBI diseases. 
        As a result, patients are grossly underdiagnosed and reporting 
        almost nonexistent compared to the actual number of cases.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Merck 
        states that there are 16,000 cases reported annually. 
        The Lyme Foundation's conclusions are that only one out 
        of every 10 cases of Lyme is accurately diagnosed. Thus, 
        Merck's numbers are off by about <i>144,000 cases a year</i>, 
        based on the Lyme Foundation's figures. The researchers 
        at the National Institutes of Health's National Center

          is inappropriate to state that Lyme is rare in California

          other warm-blooded mammals upon which they feed and 
          use for transportation) than other counties.</font></li>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">The 
        disease becomes increasingly untreatable the longer it 
        is left untreated or inadequately treated. The impact 
        of the disease on the body is a gradual but sure degradation 
        of all body systems and organ functioning. Failing to 
        recognize borreliosis as the serious health threat that 
        it is not only consigns all those currently trying to 
        survive day to day with this devastating disease--one 
        that increasingly isolates them from friends and families 
        who don't believe they are really sick or that they really 
        have Lyme--but consigns them to the ranks of those too 
        sick to work, which puts increasing strain on social services, 
        Social Security and Medicare.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">I used 
        to earn $80,000 a year (more, actually, if you add in 
        the cost of my employer-paid health insurance coverage, 
        paid parking, and other benefits), with a good chunk of 
        my bi-weekly $3,115 gross pay going towards state disability, 
        social security and other taxes, in addition to the state 
        and federal income taxes I paid on top of all those payroll 
        deductions. I've been sick for 14 years now, and unable 
        to work for 11 of those years (as of this writing, in 
        2004).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">And 
        all that money I paid into social security? I get less 
        than a quarter of my working monthly net salary, which 
        barely covers rent and utilities, and does not cover the 
        medical care I require that Medicare doesn't pay for. 
        Yet still there are people, SSA employees included, who 
        think that I would rather &quot;sit back and be able to 
        not have to work&quot; rather than work for a living. 
        If there is anything more likely to send a Type A workaholic 
        into a mouth-frothing tirade, I have yet to figure out

        be contributing their taxes to the national economy nor 
        buying goods and services, like new cars, new homes, hew

        </B></FONT><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">And 
        then there are those people who get Lyme the old-fashioned 
        way: sex and birth. Lyme, a spirochete like syphilis, 
        is <a href="std.html">transmitted sexually</a>. For some 
        reason currently known only to <i>Borrelia</i> itself, 
        men once again get off lightly in that it is much easier 
        for a man to pass <i>Borrelia</i> to a female sexual partner 
        than it is a female to a male partner (perhaps the reason 
        is that <I>Borrelia</I> abhors a liquid and drills its 
        way into the nearest tissue whenever possible - unless 
        it is encysted, in which case it will float around for 
        awhile). Either or both, however, contribute to the infection 
        of fetuses, resulting in babies born already infected 
        with <i>Borrelia</i> through placental transmission, or 
        who get it through their infected mother's <a href="milk.html">breast 
        milk</a>.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Faint 
        Light</b><br>
        As grim as all of this is, the faint light at the end 
        of the tunnel is that there are some health care practitioners 
        who have come to recognize that Lyme disease and co-infections 
        is not only real, but is really occurring outside of the 
        northeastern U.S., and year by year, a few more doctors 
        see the light. These are the doctors who learn how to 
        interpret for themselves the incomplete Western Blot tests 
        done by county health departments and other general labs, 
        or skip them and the other tests that are listed in the 
        many inaccurate 'authoritative' medical sources, turning 
        instead to the more advanced <a href="index.html#tests">testing</a> 
        methodologies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">But 
        even if they order the right tests and interpret them 
        correctly, many doctors stick to the ineffectual short-term 
        low-dose antibiotic treatment protocols &quot;approved&quot; 
        by the AMA and state medical associations, despite the 
        fact that most of their Lyme patients, especially the 
        ones who have been sick for years, often decades, do not 
        respond to short-term low-dose antibiotics. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Some 
        doctors do realize that short-term antibiotics are generally 
        worthless, but are afraid to try the more aggressive long-term 
        high-dose protocols developed by doctors who have far 
        more experience treating Lyme patients, such as that outlined 
        in ILADs <a href="http://www.ilads.org/guideline_news.htm">New 
        Treatment Guidelines for Lyme Disease</a>, either because 
        they are concerned about the effects on their patients 
        (who can be monitored by regular visits, tests to monitor 
        liver and kidney function, stressing aggressive probiotics 
        and prescribing anti-fungals), or because they don't want 
        the wrath of the state medical association, insurance 
        companies and Medicare coming down on them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">The 
        bottom line for people who are sick with <i>Borrelia</i> 
        and other parasites that frequently travel with them from 
        host to host (<i>Babesia</i>, <i>Bartonella</i> [cat scratch 
        fever], and <i>Ehrlichia</i>) is that finding appropriate

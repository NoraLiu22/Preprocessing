He is widely regarded as the architect of Britain's unlikely victory, using an intelligence strategy known as the Dowding System.  The Battle of Britain was at the very end of his military career - his nickname by then was \"Stuffy\" Dowding - and shortly after he was side-lined. But he cared deeply for every one of his pilots, and following his retirement he became focused on what had happened to all his \"dear fighter boys\" lost in the war. He wrote extensively on the after life and spiritualism - many bereaved families wrote to him seeking answers as a result. He met his second wife after a medium suggested he take her out for lunch having received a communication from her late first husband from beyond the grave. Together they were prominent advocates of spiritualism, and of animal rights, with Dowding giving his maiden speech in the Lords about the need for ethical standards in slaughterhouses. \n\nDiane picked up Dowding's book by pure chance through her local book shop during the first lockdown, and has since become fascinated by the life of this man. Together with Dowding's stepson, David Whiting, and historian Victoria Taylor, Diane discusses Dowding's legacy.

Whimsical and uncompromising, depressive yet joyful, childlike and curmudgeonly, an 'outsider', championed by insiders like Paul McCartney, he's perhaps best known for his collection 'Life in a Scotch Sitting Room Volume Two\" (there is no volume one) or his much-covered 1983 indie hit 'Women of the World'.\n\nCutler often referred to himself as a 'humourist', though his work spans music, poetry, children's books, performative and visual art. A sensitive soul and keen member of the Noise Abatement Society, he loved the small, quiet things in life - bugs, flowers, birds, small kindnesses and cups of tea. He hated chemical smells, loud noises and cars and always rode his bicycle to get around - whether peddling his harmonium to a gig to support Soft Machine or heading to Hampstead Heath to sit quietly with his notebook under a tree.\n\nThe Scottish eccentric had a distinctive style - wearing plus fours and often with a flower adorning his hat. He would approach strangers offering small sticky labels with 'cutlerisms' on like \"Never Knowingly Understood\", \"Illiterates Against the Nizis\" or \"Funny Smell\". He was convinced that the world was absurd and met it with a unique blend of dark and daft humour, refusing to let it crush his child's eye view.\n\nJohn Peel, who recorded many sessions with Ivor Cutler, once remarked that Cutler was probably the only performer whose work had been featured on Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4.

He aims to rescue Tolkien from the hippies, who, he says, claimed Tolkien as their own.  \n\n\"The fascinating thing to me about Tolkien is that his sensibility is so profoundly conservative - with a small 'c'. ...when you look at the man's politics, he was such a reactionary!\"  \n\nPresenter Matthew Parris, who doesn't believe in elves or dwarves, is not so sure that the fantasy author deserves to be rescued. \n\nWith additional help and guidance from Malcolm Guite.\n\nNiall Ferguson is senior fellow of the Hoover Institution and author of Empire: How Britain made the Modern World.\n\nProducer: Ellie Richold\n\nFirst broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2021."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0b87896.jpg","duration":{"value":1680,"label":"28 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2021-12-07T17:01:00Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qxsb","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qxsb","title":"Great Lives","synopses":{"short":"Biographical series in which guests choose someone who has inspired their lives.","medium":"Biographical series in which guests choose someone who has inspired their lives.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qxsb&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"m0012ft4","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:m0012ft5","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2021-12-14T00:00:00Z","label":"14 Dec 2021"},"titles":{"primary":"Great Lives","secondary":"Rory Sutherland on Johnny Ramone","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Rory Sutherland on Johnny Ramone"},"synopses":{"short":"The advertising guru Rory Sutherland on the founder of the New York punk band, the Ramones","medium":"Johnny Ramone of the band the Ramones was a Republican who wanted to make a million so he could retire early.

Famed for their blisteringly short songs played at breakneck speed, the Ramones burst onto the scene in 1976 with tracks like 'Blitzkrieg Bop', 'I Don't Wanna Walk Around With You' and 'Judy is a Punk'.  When they played The Roundhouse in London journalist Chris Salewicz was there, and afterwards he said all the British punk bands started to play their songs twice as fast.  But, as advertising expert Rory Sutherland reveals, it's Johnny Ramone's contradictions that really form the basis for his choosing him as a great life.  Johnny was a staunch Republican at a time when punk was perceived as a largely left-wing movement.  In fact, for Rory, anything that aims to disrupt the status quo can be punk - including Brexit!  Johnny studied tapes of the Ramones performances to ensure that they looked, sounded and moved in what he felt was the right way, and his aim was to make a million dollars and retire early.

Roosevelt, who \"saved the United States, just in time for the United States to save the world\". \n\nWhen FDR came into office in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression, unemployment stood at more than 25% and drought in the Dust Bowl had decimated American agriculture across the Great Plains. While known for his folksy charm, Roosevelt was a shrewd and determined politician, who transformed federal government, the US financial system and the relationship between the American people and their president forever. His raft of early interventions, known as the New Deal, have become the benchmark for US presidents' first 100 days in office ever since. \n\nAs 'Forester in Chief', FDR's administration initiated mass tree planting and soil conservation - all while providing employment for 3 million young men. Rob talks to Matthew Parris about how FDR's radical and ambitious environmentalism continues to inspire him, and how this man defied his sheltered upper class upbringing to reach out to working Americans and address their struggles directly.\n\nThey are joined by Professor David B.

With its raw energy and Kurt’s ‘take me as I am’ performances, Chris found a rock band that delivered the authenticity he’d been searching for. \n\nAccompanied from New York by author, journalist and music specialist Laura Barton, Chris discusses the Great Life of Kurt Cobain, his music, his message, his sense of humour and why it’s never too late to jump in a mosh pit. \n\nPresented by Matthew Parris.  \n\nProducer: Nicola Humphries\n\nFirst broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 2023."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0dvd2m5.jpg","duration":{"value":1680,"label":"28 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2023-01-17T17:00:00Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qxsb","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qxsb","title":"Great Lives","synopses":{"short":"Biographical series in which guests choose someone who has inspired their lives.","medium":"Biographical series in which guests choose someone who has inspired their lives.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qxsb&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"m001hfcg","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:m001hfck","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2023-01-24T00:00:00Z","label":"24 Jan 2023"},"titles":{"primary":"Great Lives","secondary":"Adjoa Andoh on Zora Neale Hurston","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Adjoa Andoh on Zora Neale Hurston"},"synopses":{"short":"Bridgerton's Adjoa Andoh chooses the iconic American writer Zora Neale Hurston","medium":"Actor Adjoa Andoh, known worldwide as Bridgerton's Lady Danbury, chooses the iconic American writer and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston.

From his home in California he rubbed shoulders with the likes of Einstein and Brecht, and he recorded broadcasts for the BBC urging the German people to rise up and over throw Hitler.  He was married and had six children, two of whom took their own lives.\n\nLexicographer and word expert on 'Countdown' Susie Dent says German was her first love and she first-read Mann whilst studying at University.  She loves the tension in his work between the pull of one's senses and the desire to stay aloof and detached.  Susie and Matthew are joined by Karolina Watroba, Research fellow in German and Comparative Literature at the University of Oxford.  Karolina was born in Poland where Mann is a huge cultural icon and she first read 'The Magic Mountain' in the summer before she went to University. \n\nFuture subjects in the series include Hattie Jacques and Stamford Raffles, founder of London Zoo and Singapore.\n\nProduced for BBC Audio in Bristol by Toby Field"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0c1bd86.jpg","duration":{"value":1680,"label":"28 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2023-08-01T16:00:00Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qxsb","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qxsb","title":"Great Lives","synopses":{"short":"Biographical series in which guests choose someone who has inspired their lives.","medium":"Biographical series in which guests choose someone who has inspired their lives.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qxsb&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"m001pf6n","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:m001pf6t","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2023-08-08T00:00:00Z","label":"08 Aug 2023"},"titles":{"primary":"Great Lives","secondary":"Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore and London Zoo","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore and London Zoo"},"synopses":{"short":"The head of ZSL, Matthew Gould, picks the founder of London Zoo","medium":"Sir Stamford Raffles, born 1781, was an agent of the East India Company and often seen as founder of Singapore.

TV and films followed, most notably the role of Eric Sykes' twin sister in 'Sykes' and the stern but lovelorn matron, headmistress or housekeeper in the 'Carry On' films.  Hattie was teased about her weight in school and she was often the person being laughed at in her work.  She largely accepted this role but yearned to do more serious work.

Sophie studies why we laugh and says it was great how Hattie held her own with these men.  Together with expert Andy Merriman they explore Hattie's life including how she did her own welding in a film, her marriage to John Le Mesurier and affair with John Schofield, and whether the typecasting she suffered was a hindrance or a benefit to her career.

The report, called Limits to Growth, was published in 1972 to much publicity, alarm and ridicule. \n\nDonella said \"We were at MIT. We had been trained in science. The way we thought about the future was utterly logical: if you tell people there’s a disaster ahead, they will change course. If you give them a choice between a good future and a bad one, they will pick the good. They might even be grateful.

To this end, she founded the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, which champions regenerative and distributive economics, that can meet the needs of people within the means of the living planet.

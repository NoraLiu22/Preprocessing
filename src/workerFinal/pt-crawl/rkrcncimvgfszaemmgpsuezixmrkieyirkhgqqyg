/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 289]]</font> After the one-volume &quot;Life and Letters&quot; by Francis Darwin, and the admirable
little book by Grant Allen in the &quot;English Worthies&quot; series, there seemed to be little room for
another English work upon the same subject; yet the present small volume is markedly original,
and while following pretty closely the general lines of the &quot;Life and Letters,&quot; introduces much
new matter, and gives a fuller account of what may be termed the critical points of Darwin's
theories than are to be found in any of the works here referred to. It is written in a thoroughly
sympathetic, though impartial, spirit; and without introducing any actual criticism, either of the
views of Darwin or of his opponents (which would have been manifestly out of place in a
popular work), it yet makes clear the differences of opinion that now exist as to some of
Darwin's most cherished theories, and, while briefly stating the main facts and hypotheses on
both sides, leaves the reader in no doubt, both as to the exact nature and importance of the
opposing views and the kind of evidence that is required in order to decide which is most in
accordance with the facts of nature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven chapters deal with Darwin's life down to the year 1856, the facts of which are
so widely known that they call for no special notice. Though much condensed, they supply all the
information needed by the general reader; and we will only quote the following estimate of
character as due to heredity, which is very suggestive:</p>

<blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It appears probable that Charles Darwin's unique power was largely due to
inheritance of the imagination of his grandfather, combined with the acute observation of
his father. Although he possessed an even larger share of both these qualities than his
predecessors, it is probable that he owed more to their cooperation than to the high
degree of their development.&quot;</font></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While believing this estimate to be generally correct, it appears to the present writer that two
other important factors have been usually overlooked--the solitude of the five years' voyage and
the persistent ill-health. During a very large portion of the five years with the <em>Beagle</em>, Darwin
must have been practically alone and thrown on his own mental resources, not only on the ship
when all the officers would be engaged on their duties, but during his numerous land-journeys
and excursions on shore; and this mental solitude of an active mind furnished continually with
new and interesting facts on which to exercise the imaginative and reasoning powers, led to the
formation of those original and suggestive ideas which were the foundation of his greatness.
Hardly less important was the almost continuous ill-health, which, while not preventing work or
shortening life, obliged him to live in the country, free from the distractions of society, and
where his active mind could only be satisfied by continual study and experiment. Without the
solitude of the voyage the fundamental idea of natural selection might never have been attained;
with vigorous health that wonderful series of experimental observations in the quiet and solitude
of Down, without which the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; would have lost much of its convincing power,
would almost certainly not have been made.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapters viii. to xii. are devoted to the relations between Darwin and the present writer,
about which nothing need be here said, except that they contain some new matter, and while too
flattering to myself, appear to be quite accurate as to the facts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next six chapters are devoted to a sketch of the writing and publication of the &quot;Origin,&quot;
and the influence of Darwin upon his more eminent friends and correspondents; and of these
chapters the most original and important is the eighteenth, on the &quot;Influence of Darwin upon
Huxley.&quot; Prof. Poulton here points out the misconceptions prevalent as to Huxley's exact views,
showing that the one and only point on which he considered the theory to fail in logical
completeness was the absence of proof of infertility arising among the most divergent races of
domestic animals, a difficulty which still exists, but which may possibly be set at rest by
systematic and long-continued experiment. This difficulty, however, applies equally to all other
theories; while, if the argument of the present writer is sound--that, under certain conditions
which are frequently present, the variations in fertility which undoubtedly occur will be
accumulated by natural selection, we not only have the general occurrence of infertility between
allied species explained, but we also see why such infertility does not arise among varieties due
to man's selection, since he has never attempted to produce it. A more thorough examination of
this problem seems, therefore, to be called for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapters xix. and xx. are devoted to an interesting exposition of the various misconceptions
and misrepresentations of the theory of natural selection, which caused so much trouble and
annoyance to Darwin, misconceptions which are still prevalent, as shown by Lord Salisbury's
recent address, and by passages in Prof. Cope's last book (see <em>Nature</em>, vol. liii. p. 554). These
chapters are therefore very opportune, and may do something to show the public that a large
proportion of Darwin's critics have not taken the trouble to understand the theory to which they
take exception.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next two chapters are perhaps the most original and important in the volume, since they
contain a very careful summary of Darwin's celebrated theory of Pangenesis. To most of the
readers of this work these chapters will be entirely new, and will give them in a very readable
form some idea of the exceedingly varied and complex phenomena of &quot;inheritance&quot; which the
theory was formed to explain. Among these are sexual and asexual reproduction, the complex
phenomena of variability and inheritance, the diversity of embryonic changes during
development of allied groups, the phenomena of graft-hybrids, the reproduction of lost parts, the
sterility of hybrids, reversion to ancestral forms, and many others. Besides these there are the <font color="990000">[[p.
290]]</font> doubtful phenomena of the inheritance of the effects of use and disuse and of other
acquired modifications of the individual by external conditions, which Darwin accepted as a fact,
though he remarked upon it: &quot;Nothing in the whole circuit of physiology is more wonderful.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one who reads this account of Pangenesis will feel admiration for its ingenuity, and
surprise at the completeness with which it can be made to explain all the varied phenomena of
inheritance, though some of these explanations seem more verbal than real. Readers will also
understand the fundamental difference between this theory and that of Weismann; and will see,
that in order to decide which best explains the whole series of phenomena, the inheritance or
non-inheritance of acquired characters, as a matter of fact, must first be settled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty of conceiving the actual operation of the theory of Pangenesis may be best
illustrated by an example. Taking a bird, such as a peacock, the theory implies that not only every
cell and fibre of bone, muscle, skin, and all internal organs gives off gemmules which all find
their way into every one of the cells constituting the sperm or reproductive fluid, but that every
one of the feathers also sends gemmules from each of the cells that build up its wonderfully
complex structure, not only in the adult stage, but in the condition they assume in the young and
adolescent birds; and further, that every detail of varying colour of the barbs of these feathers
send off their gemmules, and that all this inconceivable number of gemmules must travel through
the whole structure of the quill, and through all the tissues of the body, till they reach the
reproductive organs, and every one of these gemmules must reach all or most of the sperm-cells,
failing which there would be a corresponding deficiency in the offspring. But as important
deficiencies of feathers, or of colour on the various feathers, which produce the beautiful patterns
and ornaments of a bird's plumage only rarely occur, we must assume that the passage of the
millions of gemmules from the ends of the feathers of a peacock's train through the whole length
of the shaft, and then to the sperm-cells, is almost always successfully accomplished. In addition
to the enormous difficulty, on any theory, of conceiving the processes of growth and
development of the complex parts of living organisms, we have, on this theory, an equal or
greater difficulty in the reverse process, by which the gemmules from every cell get back again to
the sperm and germ cells. Without asserting that this process is impossible or inconceivable, it is
well to endeavour to realise what it really is and its almost incredible complexity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Poulton gives a brief account of the experiments made by Mr. Galton and the late Mr.
Romanes to test the theory of Pangenesis, by the transfusion of blood and the transplantation of
skin, from one variety of animal to another, and then breeding from the modified individuals; but
in no case was any effect produced on the characters of the offspring. Though, perhaps, not quite
conclusive, these experiments indicate that there is no such continuous transference of gemmules
as the theory requires.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining three chapters deal with the descent of man and sexual selection, the various
botanical works, and a series of hitherto unpublished letters to Prof. Meldola, chiefly interesting
as illustrating Darwin's kindness to all students of natural history, and the amount of trouble he
took to be of use to them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, Prof. Poulton is to be congratulated on the production of so interesting a book,
which in a wonderfully limited space gives a connected account of Darwin's life and work, and
especially of some portions of his theories which have been almost neglected by other writers. A
good print, from a photograph, of Darwin's statue in the Natural History Museum, forms the
frontispiece of the volume.</p>

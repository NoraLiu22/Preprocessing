/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<br />&nbsp;<br /><center><i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: In 
          this celebrated study Wallace came to Darwin's defense on an application 
          of the theory of natural selection. His commentary was published in 
          Volume 12 (3rd Series) of the <u>Annals and Magazine of Natural History</u> 
          in October 1863. Original pagination indicated within double brackets.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 303]]</font> My attention 
          has been called to the paper in the 'Annals' for June last on the above 
          subjects, the author of which seems to me to have quite misunderstood 
          and much misrepresented the facts and reasonings of Mr. Darwin on the 
          question. As some of your readers may conclude, if it remains unanswered, 
          that it is therefore unanswerable, I ask permission to make a few remarks 
          on what seem to me its chief errors. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Haughton combats the views not only of those 
          who believe that the regular structure of the Bee's comb can be accounted 
          for through the agency of &quot;natural selection&quot; and variation, but also 
          of the opposite school, who impute to the Bee a <font color="990000">[[p. 
          304]]</font> supernatural or divinely inspired instinct, by which it 
          is enabled to construct its cells on true mechanical and mathematical 
          principles, so as to combine the requisite accommodation for rearing 
          its brood and storing its honey, with the greatest amount of strength 
          and the utmost economy of material. In his opinion of this last school 
          I quite agree with him, but think he has not pointed out its weakest 
          points. If we consider the cell as adapted to the size of the grub and 
          young bee, and in its relations to the cells immediately surrounding 
          it, there can be no doubt that the form of the cell itself, with its 
          pyramidal base and arrangement in double tiers, gives the greatest economy 
          of space and material possible. But if we look at the whole comb suspended 
          vertically by its upper side only, we shall immediately perceive that 
          the strain upon its uppermost rows of cells is many times greater than 
          that upon its lower ones; so that, if economy of material was the main 
          object of this beautiful structure, and the attainment of such economy 
          was secured by unerring wisdom, the walls of the cells should regularly 
          decrease in thickness from the upper to the lower part of the comb. 
          The same mathematical knowledge that enables us to see the beauty and 
          economy of the form of the individual cells, as surely points out the 
          great waste of material in building the upper and lower portions of 
          the comb of the same thickness and strength. We have here, I think, 
          a conclusive argument against the notion that the bees are guided by 
          any supernatural impulse to construct their cells on the best mathematical 
          principles, so as to economize, in the highest degree, labour, space, 
          and material. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mr. Haughton attempts to overthrow the theory 
          of Mr. Darwin on this subject, we are compelled to demur to many of 
          his statements, which, indeed, are often so deficient in clearness as 
          to suggest the idea that 'The Origin of Species' has been but superficially 
          studied by him. In his first paragraph, for example, he speaks of a 
          class of writers by whom &quot;the geometrical properties of the cells are 
          alleged as a sufficient cause for the production of the insects that 
          make them, from the advantage which these forms of cells are supposed 
          to possess over other forms--advantages said to be so important as to 
          decide the battle of life in favour of the insects that adopt the geometrical 
          plan of making their cells.&quot; This is surely a most unfair statement 
          of the doctrine that simultaneous favourable variations in structure 
          and habits, accumulated by natural selection, may act and react on each 
          other, and thus ultimately lead to such a modification of the insect 
          as may better adapt it for constructing the most advantageous form of 
          cell. Mr. Haughton's statement of the case is, that the cell made by 
          the bee is a sufficient cause for the production of the bee; and he 
          would <font color="990000">[[p. 305]]</font> have his readers believe 
          that this absurdity is maintained by the writers he alludes to. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author then describes the following three forms 
          of cells which he has observed, but does not always express his meaning 
          with sufficient accuracy:--1. Hexagonal cells, somewhat pyramidal, with 
          a rounded extremity. The British tree-wasp and the genus <i>Polistes</i> 
          make cells of this form, in small groups, and often of a very fragile 
          papery material. 2. &quot;Hexagonal cells formed of adjoining prismatic figures, 
          with rectilinear axes, terminated by a truncated plane, at right angles 
          to the axes of the prisms.&quot; I have quoted this elaborate description 
          literally, because I am quite unable to understand what the author means 
          by a &quot;truncated plane,&quot; which renders his meaning somewhat obscure. 
          The cells of this form are said to occur in wasps' nests from the West 
          Indies and South Africa. 3. The bee's hexagonal cell terminated by three 
          faces of a rhombic dodecahedron, each of which forms one-third of the 
          base of one of the cells of the opposite layer. It is not stated, but 
          may be inferred, that the first two forms of cells are in a single layer 
          only; and all these varieties of cells, it is said, may be accounted 
          for &quot;simply by the mechanical pressure of the insects against each other 
          during the formation of the cell.&quot; Again, at page 428, &quot;The true cause 
          of the shape of the cell is the crowding together of the bees at work, 
          as was first shown by Buffon. From this crowding together they cannot 
          help making cells with the dihedral angles of 120&deg; of the rhombic 
          dodecahedron; and the economy of wax has nothing to do with the origin 
          of the cell, but is a geometrical property of the figure named.&quot; There 
          are, however, several important objections to this pressure-theory. 
          Many exotic tree-wasps construct little groups of three or four hexagonal 
          cells, only one or two insects working at them together. Here is no 
          crowding, yet they are hexagonal. Again, a Mexican bee (<i>Melipona 
          domestica</i>) makes a comb of cylindrical cells, only partially hexagonal; 
          and in the Malay Islands there is a domesticated bee which makes oval 
          cells, and though the insects are kept in hollow bamboos for hives, 
          yet the crowding together does not make their cells hexagonal. The wild 
          bee of Borneo, on the other hand, suspends its comb from the arms of 
          lofty trees in the free air; and if crowding had <i>all</i> and economy<i> 
          nothing</i> to do with it, one would think that here the cells should 
          retain their normal cylindrical form; instead of which, they are as 
          beautifully geometrical as those of our own hive-bee. But, what is still 
          more important, Mr. Darwin states (Origin of Species, ed. 3, p. 251) 
          that our bees build the cell-wall at first rough and ten times as thick 
          as it is to remain when finished, it being afterwards gnawed down to 
          the proper thinness. Here <font color="990000">[[p. 306]]</font> is 
          a complete proof of economy of wax rather than economy of labour, and 
          a complete disproof of the theory of circular walls pressed into hexagons 
          by the crowds of struggling bees, which is given us as a new theory 
          of the formation of the bee's cell, unsupported by a single original 
          observation. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To finish this subject of bees, we will now pass 

          to page 427, where Mr. Haughton produces his most crushing argument. 

          He seems to suppose that it is necessary to the theory of Mr. Darwin 

          that there should have been a number of species of bees, now extinct, 

          filling up the gap between the single round cell of the humble-bee and 

          the perfect geometrical structure of the hive-bee, each of them using 

          a little less wax than the preceding one, and that, to effect this, 

          it is necessary that there should have been a bee building a <i>triangular</i> 

          cell, and after that, one building a <i>square</i> cell, before arriving 

          at the <i>hexagonal</i> cell of the hive-bee. But in this view there 

          is a misconception of the conditions of the problem. It is true that, 

          to fill up a given space with cells of a given <i>area</i> and walls 

          of equal thickness, the triangle will be more economical of material 

          than the circle (with solid intervals), and the square more economical 

          than the triangle. The primary use of the cell, however, is not the 

          storing of honey--but the accommodation of the larva and pupa; for this 

          it must have a certain <i>diameter</i>, and the triangular cell must 

          therefore circumscribe the circular one, and will then be found to require 

          more materials even than the circular cell with solid intervals, without 

          taking into account the fact that the sides of the triangular cells, 

          being without support in their whole length, would have to be thicker 

          than those of any other form, if of equal strength. The same argument 

          will apply in a less degree to the walls of a square cell.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A still more serious error exists, however, in supposing 
          any such extravagantly shaped cells requisite to form the gradual passage 
          from the circle to the hexagon, in order that every step of the process 
          may give its proportionate saving of material. Let the reader draw a 
          number of equal circles in contact, and he will at once perceive how 
          very simple it is (considering that the bees build the cell-wall of 
          a uniform thickness, and reduce it to the smallest serviceable dimensions 
          by gnawing down the growing walls) to suppose them, when material was 
          scanty, to gnaw out a little of the solid triangles left between the 
          circles. The amount of intelligence perceptible in the habits of most 
          insects renders such an act by no means beyond their capacities; and 
          as every step in this direction would tend to the well-being of the 
          community, what was at first done under the pressure of necessity would 
          at length become a regular practice, and finally settle into that class 
          of hereditary habits which we call instinct. <font color="990000">[[p. 
          307]]</font> Some of these steps do actually occur in the <i>Melipona 
          domestica</i> and other bees; and the immense quantity of honey consumed 
          by the hive-bee to make a small quantity of wax, as well as its curious 
          habit of cutting down the walls of its cells to a uniform thickness, 
          are certainly very strong arguments in favour of this view. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly the same arguments will apply to the origin, 

          step by step, of the lozenge-formed planes forming the pyramidal base 

          of the cell as to the hexagonal form of its wall; for these planes are 

          the simple result of gnawing away the superfluous wax in the angles 

          between the alternate spherical bases of the opposite layer of cells; 

          and when this wax is so much gnawed away as to reduce all the walls 

          of the cells to an equal thickness, the true geometrical figure which 

          we see is the necessary result. (Origin of Species, p. 247) It is evident, 

          therefore, that all the minute calculations of geometers respecting 

          the amount of saving in this pyramidal base over a <i>flat</i> base 

          to the cell is altogether beside the question, because a flat base could 

          not arise out of spherical alternate bases in contact, by any such simple 

          successive steps as are shown to result in the existing form.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of the &quot;origin of species&quot; Mr. Haughton 

          enlarges considerably; but his chief arguments are reduced to the setting-up 

          of &quot;three unwarrantable assumptions,&quot; which he imputes to the Lamarckians 

          and Darwinians, and then, to use his own words, &quot;brings to the ground 

          like a child's house of cards.&quot; The first of these is &quot;<i>the indefinite 

          variation of species continuously in the one direction.</i>&quot; Now this 

          is certainly never assumed by Mr. Darwin, whose argument is mainly grounded 

          on the fact that variations occur in <i>every direction</i>. This is 

          so obvious that it hardly needs insisting on. In every large family 

          there is almost always one child taller, one darker, one thinner than 

          the rest; one will have a larger nose, another a larger eye: they vary 

          morally as well; some are more poetical, others more morose; one has 

          a genius for numbers, another for painting. It is the same in animals: 

          the puppies, or kittens, or rabbits of one litter differ in many ways 

          from each other--in colour, in size, in disposition; so that, though 

          they do not &quot;<i>vary continuously in one direction</i>,&quot; they do vary 

          continuously in many directions; and thus there is always material for 

          natural selection to act upon in <i>some</i> direction that may be advantageous.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his remarks upon this &quot;unwarrantable assumption&quot; 
          (which is altogether his own), Mr. Haughton has the following passage:--&quot;In 
          the writings of Darwin there is this singular inconsistency, that, while 
          he shows the utmost effects of human breeding on domestic animals to 
          be capable of production in ten or twenty years, he denies the right 
          of his adversaries to appeal <font color="990000">[[p. 308]]</font> 
          to the unaltered condition of the ass, the ostrich, and the cat for 
          3000 years,&quot; &amp;c. The first part of this sentence is so completely 
          out of the pale of grammatical construction, that I must conclude Mr. 
          Haughton writes a very bad hand, and did not correct the proofs. But, 
          so far from Mr. Darwin denying his opponents the use of the facts above 
          alluded to, he himself offers them far stronger ones, in the many species 
          of shells which have lived unchanged since the middle tertiary epochs, 
          and of mammals whose remains are found in beds which testify that they 
          have survived important changes of the earth's surface. No one who understands 
          the theory of natural selection will imagine that these facts are in 
          any way opposed to it. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second supposed &quot;unwarrantable assumption&quot; is, 

          &quot;<i>That the causes of variation</i>, viz. natural advantage in the 

          struggle for existence (Darwin), <i>are sufficient to account for the 

          effects asserted to be produced</i>.&quot; There certainly never was a more 

          unwarrantable assertion made, than that Darwin assigned &quot;natural advantage 

          in the struggle for existence&quot; as &quot;the cause of variation.&quot; Darwin over 

          and over again declares that the <i>cause</i> of variation is unknown 

          (Origin of Species, pp. 8, 38), though the <i>fact</i> is certain and 

          undeniable. Natural selection, acting through advantage in the struggle 

          for existence, <i>accumulates</i> favourable variations, but in no sense 

          <i>causes</i> them. This is the very foundation of Mr. Darwin's theory; 

          yet even this is misunderstood or misrepresented by Mr. Haughton.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third &quot;unwarrantable assumption&quot; charged upon 

          Mr. Darwin is, &quot;<i>That succession implies causation</i>,&quot; &quot;that the 

          Pal&aelig;ozoic Cephalopoda produced the Red-Sandstone fishes,&quot; &quot;that 

          these in turn gave birth to the Liassic reptiles,&quot; &amp;c., &amp;c. 

          Now those who have read the 'Origin of Species' know that such absurd 

          doctrines as these are nowhere taught there; and I can only say to those 

          who have not read it that I challenge them or Mr. Haughton to produce 

          any passages which will bear such a meaning.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, it is asserted &quot;that naturalists 
          who have accepted by multitudes the new theory of the origin of species 
          are, as a class, untrained in the use of the logical faculties, which, 
          however, they may be charitably supposed to possess in common with other 
          men.&quot; This is the judgment of the Rev. S. Haughton on such men as Lyell, 
          Hooker, Lubbock, Huxley, and Asa Gray. A perusal of his paper, with 
          the remarks I have now made upon it, will enable any one to judge how 
          far Mr. Haughton himself possesses those &quot;logical faculties&quot; which he 
          is half inclined to deny to the mass of British naturalists. There are 
          several other minor points in his paper which might be alluded to; but 
          it has already occupied as much space as it deserves, and I will only, 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 309]]</font> in conclusion, quote from it 
          a short paragraph which contains an important truth, but which may very 
          fairly be applied in other quarters than those for which the author 
          intended it:--&quot;No progress in natural science is possible as long as 
          men will take their rude guesses at truth for facts, and substitute 
          the fancies of their imagination for the sober rules of reasoning.&quot;</p>

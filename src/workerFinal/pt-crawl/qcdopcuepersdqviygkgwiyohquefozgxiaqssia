              SCANDAL-DRIVEN PRESS </b>is not a recent phenomenon. Pierre and 
              Marie had been hounded by intrusive reporters as early as 1902, 
              when news began to circulate about the medical uses of radium. After 
              they won the Nobel Prize, reporters redoubled their attentions. 
              But until late 1910 most press coverage of Marie Curie focused on 
              the heroic labors of the blonde, foreign-born mother, wife, and 
              then widow. Some of the press changed its tune, however, in November 
              1910, when Curie offered herself as a candidate for the single vacant 
              seat for a physicist in the French Academy of Sciences.<br>
              <br>
              Her main rival for the seat was 66-year-old Edouard Branly, whose 
              scientific reputation was based on his contribution to wireless 
              telegraphy. When Italian Gugliemo Marconi was awarded the 1909 Nobel 
              Prize for Physics for his work in that field, many French patriots 
              felt stung by Branly's exclusion.

              <font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Branly's claim to 
              the Academy chair was also championed by many French Catholics, 
              who knew that he had been singled out for honor by the Pope. For 
              generations French politics had been bitterly divided between conservative 
              Catholics and liberal freethinkers like Marie and her friends, and 
              the split ran through every public action.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Among the false rumors 
              the right-wing press spread about Curie was that she was Jewish, 
              not truly French, and thus undeserving of a seat in the French Academy. 
              Although the liberal press came to her defense, the accusations 
              did the intended damage. Branly won the election on January 23, 
              1911, by two votes. Curie responded to the snub characteristically, 
              by throwing herself into her work. </font> </p>

              a woman who was left a widow at 38 should become romantically attached 
              again is not surprising. But when Curie's relationship with fellow 
              physicist Paul Langevin moved beyond friendly collegiality to mutual 
              love, she could not foresee where it would lead. Langevin, a brilliant 
              former pupil of Pierre's, was unhappily married to a woman who came 
              from a similar working-class background but lacked his educational 
              attainments. With four children to raise, Madame Langevin complained 
              that Paul placed his commitment to science above the needs of his 
              family. <br>
              <br>
              &#147;They can't comprehend at his house that he refuses magnificent 
              situations...in private industry to dedicate himself to science,&#148; 
              wrote a friend of Langevin's. During the summer of 1911, as rumors 
              about a relationship between Curie and Langevin began to spread, 
              Madame Langevin began proceedings to bring about a legal separation.</font></p>

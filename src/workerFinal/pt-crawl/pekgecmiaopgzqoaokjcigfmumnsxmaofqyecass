&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>The Female of the Species</B><P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; W<font size=-2>HEN</font> the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;    He shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        But the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        For the female of the species is more deadly than the male. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    When Nag the basking cobra hears the careless foot of man, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        He will sometimes wriggle sideways and avoid it if he can. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        But his mate makes no such motion where she camps beside the trail. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        For the female of the species is more deadly than the male. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    When the early Jesuit fathers preached to Hurons and Choctaws, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        They prayed to be delivered from the vengeance of the squaws. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        'Twas the women, not the warriors, turned those stark enthusiasts pale. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        For the female of the species is more deadly than the male. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    Man's timid heart is bursting with the things he must not say, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        For the Woman that God gave him isn't his to give away; 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        But when hunter meets with husbands, each confirms the other's tale&#151;
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        The female of the species is more deadly than the male. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    Man, a bear in most relations&#151;worm and savage otherwise,&#151; 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Man propounds negotiations, Man accepts the compromise. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        To its ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    Fear, or foolishness, impels him, ere he lay the wicked low, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        To concede some form of trial even to his fiercest foe. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Mirth obscene diverts his anger&#151;Doubt and Pity oft perplex 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Him in dealing with an issue&#151;to the scandal of The Sex! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    But the Woman that God gave him, every fibre of her frame 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Proves her launched for one sole issue, armed and engined for the same; 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        And to serve that single issue, lest the generations fail, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        The female of the species must be deadlier than the male. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    She who faces Death by torture for each life beneath her breast 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        May not deal in doubt or pity&#151;must not swerve for fact or jest. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        These be purely male diversions&#151;not in these her honour dwells&#151; 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        She the Other Law we live by, is that Law and nothing else. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    She can bring no more to living than the powers that make her great 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        As the Mother of the Infant and the Mistress of the Mate. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        And when Babe and Man are lacking and she strides unclaimed to claim 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Her right as femme (and baron), her equipment is the same. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    She is wedded to convictions&#151;in default of grosser ties; 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Her contentions are her children, Heaven help him who denies!&#151;
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        He will meet no suave discussion, but the instant, white-hot, wild, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Wakened female of the species warring as for spouse and child. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    Unprovoked and awful charges&#151;even so the she-bear fights, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Speech that drips, corrodes, and poisons&#151;even so the cobra bites, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Scientific vivisection of one nerve till it is raw 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        And the victim writhes in anguish&#151;like the Jesuit with the squaw! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    So it comes that Man, the coward, when he gathers to confer 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        With his fellow-braves in council, dare not leave a place for her 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Where, at war with Life and Conscience, he uplifts his erring hands 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        To some God of Abstract Justice&#151;which no woman understands. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;    And Man knows it! Knows, moreover, that the Woman that God gave him 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        Must command but may not govern&#151;shall enthral but not enslave him. 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        And <I>She</I> knows, because <I>She</I> warns him, and Her instincts never fail, 
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;        That the Female of Her Species is more deadly than the Male.

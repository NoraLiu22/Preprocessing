<h1>What is Early Music?</h1>

<p>The term &quot;early music&quot; sometimes causes confusion.
As a very casual indication, music from the 1400s is early music
in the sense which we use here, whereas music from the 1940s is
not.  The context is European classical music, which had its
best-known pieces written in the 1700s &amp; 1800s, and so the
&quot;early&quot; in early music means earlier than that.  In this
way, early music usually designates the
<a href="../beginlst/medieval.htm">Medieval</a>,
<a href="../beginlst/renaiss.htm">Renaissance</a>, and
<a href="../beginlst/barintro.htm">Baroque</a> periods of Western
music.  Early Music is a standard term, used in trade magazines,
journals, record store classical sections, etc.</p>

<h2>Musical Periods</h2>

<p>Precise date-based definitions of the stylistic periods of
Western music, and by implication of &quot;early music&quot; in
sum, are a rather illusory goal.  The most common ending date given
for the Baroque period is 1750, with the death of J. S. Bach.  This
is a convenient and acceptable date, frequently used in definitions
of early music, but it is also a simplification of the various
stylistic events of the period.  If one views the Baroque as a
style with specific traits, then those traits were being overturned
in favor of those of the &quot;Classical&quot; style by some
composers before this date, and persisted in the work of some other
composers after this date.  Stylistic periods are designated only
later, by historians who necessarily prioritize certain features
over others.</p>

<p>Baroque music has its origins in the rise of the recitative
style among Monteverdi and others, the beginning of
<a href="opera.html">opera</a> as a form, and the consequent adoption
of <a href="continuo.html">basso continuo</a>.  In fact, the end
of the Renaissance style around 1600 is among the clearest divisions
in Western music, owing to the simultaneity of these changes, as
well as to the self-conscious way in which Monteverdi and others
advocated them.  The beginning of the Renaissance is less clear.
There are two major changes to be considered, the use of the interval
of a third as a <a href="../harmony/chords.html">stable harmony</a>
and the new humanistic orientation to text with music at its service.
In this case, the important changes occurred over several decades,
and so although most references will place the beginning of the
Renaissance with the new harmonies of Dufay around 1420, others
will place it with the humanistic texts of Josquin around 1500.
Some of the former references will then call the latter period the
High Renaissance.  Some European classifications include only the
Medieval &amp; Renaissance periods under the early music label,
with the Baroque period considered separately.</p>

<h3>Ancient Music</h3>

<p>Obviously, what we know about music and its performance tends
to decrease as we look farther backward in time.  This is due to
less writing of original sources, to more chance for destruction
of sources which were written, and also to the temporal distance
between these people and ourselves making it less likely that we
will understand statements and instructions in the same way.  We
hope to overcome the latter factor with study and familiarity, but
the former two are inherent barriers.  Designating a beginning to
Medieval music is one area where knowledge is too vague to give a
precise date.  Various trends do emerge in the 1100s, such as
relatively large volumes of written notated polyphony and non-liturgical
Latin song.  It is tempting, therefore, to locate the &quot;beginning&quot;
of the Medieval music period at this point, especially because of
the general historical factors surrounding the &quot;Twelfth Century
Renaissance.&quot;  However, such a designation marginalizes the
closely related pre-12th century repertory, and that repertory
possesses no clear starting point at all.</p>

<p>The beginning of polyphony, something which likely occurred in
improvised form centuries prior to the major codifications of the
1100s, is a central event in Western musical history.  However,
surviving Medieval musical sources are actually dominated by
<a href="../beginlst/chant.htm">plainchant</a>.  It is a correspondingly
large area of study &amp; performance, in various regional &amp;
historical styles.  Not only were there the semi-mythical consolidations
of <a href="gregorian.html">Gregorian chant</a>, but various earlier
chant repertories for which some manuscript sources survive.  There
are also some scattered sources of
<a href="../beginlst/ancient.html">ancient music</a> which might
broadly be considered under the term early music.  Owing to its
greater historical distance, this music is rather distinct from
the usual &quot;early music&quot; repertories and so is often
considered separately, especially as none of it survives from
Western Europe itself.  There is a true break here, with no
discernible stylistic continuity between surviving ancient music
and the earliest Western plainchant of centuries later.</p>

<h2>Revival</h2>

<p>It is easy enough to say that early music means music of the
<a href="../beginlst/medieval.htm">Medieval</a>,
<a href="../beginlst/renaiss.htm">Renaissance</a> and
<a href="../beginlst/baroque.htm">Baroque</a> periods, but why is
it those periods in particular?  The answer is relatively simple.
Beginning with the late 18th century music of Mozart &amp; Haydn,
some works simply never stopped being put before the public.  Mozart
&amp; Haydn's music, and especially Beethoven's in the following
generation, was performed in public concerts during their lifetimes
and then after their deaths, continuously to the present day.  This
is a fairly noticeable change, historically speaking, as earlier
music frequently was not performed even a few decades after it was
written.  There were <a href="repertory.html">various exceptions</a>
to this basic trend, especially in ceremonial music such as that
used in the Vatican or for royal funerals.  More broadly, plainchant
&amp; tunes in general are a very conspicuous and distinct exception.
However, early music becomes <em>early</em> by virtue of not
generally having had this public continuity, even if it did have
various threads of scholarly or specialized continuity.</p>

<p>To turn a convoluted phrase, early music is etymologically the
music which is earlier than the earliest music which was typically
being performed in concerts at the time when performers decided to
perform early music.  For the most part, this happened in the 1900s,
gradually over the course of a few decades in the beginning &amp;
middle of the century.  Some of the first institutions to revive
Renaissance music on a larger scale were the English Cathedral
Choirs, and they now have a long-standing tradition of performing
this music.  Their early entry into this repertory was facilitated
by various embryonic musicological revival efforts in England in
the 1800s and even notably the 1700s, and buoyed by interest in
Renaissance music among early 20th century English composers.  By
the 1950s, early music was a definite phenomenon, with such performers
as <a href="../performers/cape.html">Safford Cape</a>,
<a href="../performers/deller.html">Alfred Deller</a>,
<a href="../performers/nypm.html">Noah Greenberg</a>, etc.  Since
then, the number of early music performers has increased steadily,
as has audience interest, to the point where early music sales are
more or less equal to those of non-early classical music.</p>

<p>Beyond historical technique, which remained under study with
examples from these eras in a fairly continuous way in academia,
and with which many prominent composers were associated at one time
or another, there were some notable revivals prior to the decisive
one which has defined the Early Music Movement as such.  Mendelssohn's
revival of Bach's <i>St. Matthew Passion</i> in 1829 is probably
the single most significant such event, although the survival of
Handel's <i>Messiah</i> in re-orchestrations by Mozart and others
is also notable, especially as these events conditioned some of
the first musical antiquarian societies in England.  In this way,
some composers' works have performance traditions which predate
the present Early Music revival, but which do not generally extend
continuously to their actual lifetimes.  These various performance
threads can be interesting to consider, especially as the Early
Music movement itself becomes more extensive in both history and
stylistic range.  For instance, the history of musical revival in
England is quite involved, leading to many ramifications for
different performance styles today.</p>

<h3>Recreation</h3>

<p>The idea of revival has become a touchstone for the Early Music
Movement, and consequently the fact that some styles of performance
have been going on long enough to develop and build their own
continuity presents some philosophical complications.  Early music
performers have a history of going directly to written &amp;
manuscript sources, and consequently not basing their interpretations
so much on what other performers have done, but more on their own
direct intuition of the sources themselves.  This is very different
from what &quot;mainstream&quot; performers have generally done,
and so the latter have a history of continuity with and development
of previous performance ideas as such.  The existence of performance
continuity within the early music community itself provides something
of a bifurcation in the goals of performers, as to this point early
music has been fundamentally a <em>radical</em> movement.</p>

<p>The idea of wanting to perform music only a few decades older
than the 18th century music already being performed regularly does
not seem very radical.  However, the desire to base interpretations
directly on original sources, rather than on the way previous
performers had interpreted them, has had significant ramifications.
For one thing, copying and modifying a previous performance, perhaps
extending back in a chain to that of the composer himself, is a
rather different skill from intuiting it directly after a lapse of
some decades.  The <em>necessity</em> of taking this step for
chronologically early music has led directly to conflicts with
interpretations which are based on performance history, especially
such earlier revived performance histories as that for Bach.  A
battle cry has become &quot;composer's intentions&quot; together
with the huge body of philosophical argument which that notion
implies, and so there has been a general trend toward
&quot;recreating&quot; the sound world from which the composition
arose.  This act necessarily puts the performer at some distance
from the event to be recreated, and so is mediated fundamentally
by textual sources.</p>

<a name="hip"></a>
<h2>Historically Informed Performance</h2>

<p>When Bach's music was revived by Schumann and Mendelssohn, it
was performed and even transcribed in 19th century style.
Orchestrations were updated, piano parts were added to the <i>Sonatas
&amp; Partitas for Solo Violin</i>, etc.  It seemed natural to them
to perform the music, which they had &quot;discovered&quot; and
found valuable, in the style of their own time.  As interest
increased, and with it curiosity, especially regarding the difficulties
involved in performing Bach's keyboard music on the piano, the idea
of &quot;original instruments&quot; arose in this repertory.  Bach's
music simply sounds rather different on a harpsichord than it does
on a piano, while the former also enforces different ideas on
phrasing, ornament, dynamics, technique, etc.  The idea that older
sonorities might be interesting on their own terms, and not need
updating, was also radical, and created another fundamental impetus
for the Early Music Movement.  However, the term &quot;original
instruments&quot; has been mostly abandoned for two important
reasons:  There are questions about just how original &quot;original&quot;
means when it comes to available reconstructions or surviving
specimens, and also &quot;instruments&quot; gives a skewed labeling
of historical vocal technique.</p>

<p>Labels such as &quot;authentic performance&quot; and &quot;composer's
intentions&quot; have likewise been mostly abandoned, but this time
primarily for philosophical rather than practical reasons.  There
are two basic facts underlining this decision.  The first is that
knowing precisely how a work was originally performed, especially
one rather distant in time, is not really possible.  The second is
that, perhaps with a few exceptions, composers do not state their
intentions with regard to hypothetical performances hundreds of
years in the future.  The idea that the composer &quot;wants&quot;
the music to sound today exactly as it did for the first performance
is simply a philosophical one.  Judging by their own actions, one
might conclude that Schumann and Mendelssohn would have expected
or even wanted their music to be &quot;updated&quot; for new
stylistic eras.  This is partly an issue in the wake of Beethoven,
a composer who had some difficulty achieving a performance in
practice which fit what he had in mind.  One can interpret this
fact either as a call to redouble one's efforts to achieve precisely
what he had in mind, or more generally to develop performance ideas
in such a way as to make the once impossible rendition possible.
Which exactly is the <em>intent</em>?  For Bach's <i>Mass in b</i>,
which was never performed in his lifetime?  For music of even
earlier composers, who probably did not anticipate it being heard
ten years after their deaths?</p>

<p>One basic fact seems inescapable:  Learning more about the
circumstances surrounding the creation of a piece of music leads
to a greater understanding of it.  The sonorities and resources of
historical voices &amp; instruments give insight into phrasing
&amp; articulation.  Historical tuning gives insight into harmonic
motion.  Especially in the case of music very distant from us, such
as Medieval or early Renaissance music, some &quot;common sense&quot;
ideas on how music should be performed, as based on typical practice
today, are very different from those described in historical
treatises.  Although ultimately a performer makes an artistic
decision as to what and how to perform today, understanding these
differences can lead to a more informed decision, even if modern
instruments or other factors are eventually chosen.  This is what
makes the term &quot;Historically Informed Performance&quot; (or
<i>HIP</i>) fairly widely accepted today.</p>

<h3>Authenticity</h3>

<p>In its own time, the setting for early music was very different
from today, and so e.g. performing Medieval music in a concert hall
is already inherently an anachronism.  Facts such as this are
unavoidable, even if performers painstakingly research and interpret
music according to historical sources.  Likewise, the mere idea of
&quot;historical performance&quot; is primarily a modern one, and
so attempting to render works in this way contains some philosophical
contradictions which cannot be resolved.  With the right attitude,
these philosophical pitfalls are simply a way to ensure that musical
performance will remain a creative activity.  One can even extend
the context in all directions, from using period-style instruments
and vocal technique, to placing the music into its historical social
context in a historical building in historical costume.  Such
extremes are less common, but can also be fun, provided one remembers
that there is nothing one can do to recreate a historical audience,
i.e. an audience for which the music is truly new.</p>

<p>What then is an authentic performance?  This is an emotionally
charged question, at least when asked concerning repertories with
competing performance traditions.  Although the label &quot;historically
informed performance&quot; seems fairly neutral and seductive, in
the sense that one can hardly vilify gaining information, there
are also strong implications regarding how informed one must be
and how that information must be used.  As more information becomes
available, and as the movement progresses on its own terms, various
practical questions arise in addition to the more theoretical ones
about the nature of text &amp; composition.  It is one step to
decide to perform Bach's music on harpsichord rather than on piano,
but as alluded to in the dismissal of the &quot;original
instruments&quot; term, there are continuing questions of precision
regarding <em>which</em> harpsichord.  This is only the beginning,
because at least hypothetically, every nuance of the physical
performance can be exactly as it was for Bach.  If one values
information concerning historical context, and wants to use as much
as one can as faithfully as possible, there is still a point at
which one simply must stop studying and start performing.  Otherwise,
there is no performance and no music.</p>

<p>To return to a fundamental issue, even the hypothetical perfect
reproduction of the original performance presents theoretical
problems.  At some level of precision, and for relatively early
music this level is not very fine at all, the notation and available
sources will not dictate every detail.  Phrasing, nuance, the most
delicate inflections of single notes... these are not included in
notation.  The performers must make these decisions, especially as
they reflect their own physical gifts or inclinations.  Singers
will not sound identical, even if their technique is the same.
This is part of what makes music a living art, something which must
be continually reinterpreted in order to exist (until the invention
of recordings).  More than that, the composition of a piece,
especially one which we would want to hear centuries later, was a
creative act made in the context of creative musicians.  In this
sense, if musicians today are to abandon any creativity when
rendering old music, then they are <em>not</em> authentic, because
that is not the frame of mind under which the original was made.
The same frame of mind is indeed impossible today, because the
piece will never be new again.  Of course, for many individuals,
it will seem new, and that is part of what has made the revival
aspect of early music so successful and exciting.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Performance histories have frequently reflected ideas such as
&quot;progress&quot; &amp; &quot;evolution&quot; and consequently
an underlying implication that scoring &amp; interpretation should
be updated to reflect contemporary concerns &amp; possibilities.
There have been normative judgements at work.  However, there have
also been inherent contradictions, as the continuing performance
of works by Mozart &amp; Beethoven clearly suggests that the
classical music community has not viewed more recent compositions
as simply better.  Throughout Western musical history, there have
been statements that the new music of the time was self-evidently
superior to that of the previous generation, but these statements
have become increasingly fringe judgements since the era of Beethoven.
It is not by coincidence that the early music movement traces some
of its deepest roots to the following generations.  Once one begins
to believe that some earlier music is no worse, or perhaps even
better, than what is being written now, the idea that even earlier
music and performance practices are worthwhile too cannot be far
behind.</p>

<p>In some ways, nothing has changed.  Performance histories continue
to reflect contemporary concerns &amp; possibilities, even if these
differ substantially from what they once were.  The growing desire
today for a musical museum reflects various factors in society,
not least of which is a multicultural awareness that the art of
other times &amp; places can speak to us.  It may also reflect some
disturbing psychological facts of contemporary life, but such a
discussion would move rather far from the topic here.  Beyond any
of this, a fundamental understanding of historical changes in style
and artistry leads naturally to an expansion of our ideas on <em>what
music must be</em>.  This is something which early music gives to
contemporary music-making as a whole, something which may prove
enormously productive as early music moves firmly into the popular
consciousness of the 21st century.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Early music is therefore either music which is chronologically
early (as in &quot;before 1750&quot;), or an attitude toward
performance which can be applied to any music (as in &quot;Historically
Informed Performance&quot;).  Frequently it is both, canonically
so.  For more specific examples and discussion, please examine
other sections of the <a href="../">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Practitioners of early music tend to have rather different ideas
on precisely how these factors work out and delineate themselves
in practice.  The question remains somewhat open, which is a big
reason that the topic always produces interesting discussion on
<a href="earlym-l.html">our forum</a>.  That early music cannot
fully define itself also ensures it will remain a living art.</p>

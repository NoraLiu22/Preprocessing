/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 510]]</font> Now that 
        we have entered the last year of this our Nineteenth Century, in many 
        respects the most eventful century for good and evil the world has witnessed, 
        most thinking men are looking forward with anxious hope as to what of 
        real good the Twentieth Century may have in store for humanity. Any words 
        of hopeful guidance as to how we may help to bring about such good; any 
        indication of the true path to such social regeneration as may not only 
        enable the middle classes to reach a still higher pitch of refinement, 
        but may raise up the masses from the deadly slough of want, misery, starvation 
        and crime in which so many millions are now floundering, often from no 
        fault of their own and in the midst of the most wealthy and most civilized 
        countries in the world,--will certainly be welcome to the humane and thoughtful 
        in all modern societies.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, that if we wish to do any real 
        good, we must cease to deal in generalities, or to suggest mere palliatives. 
        We must seek for the fundamental error in our social system which has 
        led to the damning result, that, in the latter half of the nineteenth 
        century there has been a far greater mass of human misery arising directly 
        from want--and an equal, perhaps greater, amount in proportion to population--than 
        in the preceding century. This is clearly indicated by the figures given 
        by the statistician Mulhall in 1883, in a paper read at the British Association. 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 511]]</font> In the period 1774 to 1800--which 
        may be taken as representing the latter half of the eighteenth century--he 
        gives the wealth per head of the population of Great Britain at &#163;110, 
        and for 1860 to 1882, representing a corresponding period of the nineteenth 
        century, at &#163;216. But the purchasing power of money is estimated to have 
        been so much greater in the earlier period that Mr. Mulhall calculates 
        the effective income per head to have then been &#163;227, or actually higher 
        than in our own time. This apparent paradox can only be explained by the 
        <em>proportion</em> of the very poor to the whole population being now 
        exceptionally large, so that, although there has been such an enormous 
        increase of total wealth and a considerable increase of very rich men, 
        yet the great army of workers who produce this wealth has increased so 
        much more largely that the proportion coming to them is smaller than ever. 
        And this is quite in accordance with the evidence of Mr. Charles Booth, 
        who has shown that about 1,300,000 of the population of London live &quot;below 
        the margin of poverty;&quot; and if we add to these the inmates of the workhouses, 
        hospitals, &amp;c., we shall find that close upon <em>one-third</em> of 
        the whole population are in this miserable condition; and we may be sure 
        that in all our great manufacturing towns and cities, the proportion of 
        the very poor is not much less.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we must remember that in the last century 
        the majority of the workers lived in the rural districts or in the smaller 
        towns, and possessed many additions to their means of living which they 
        have now lost:--such as gardens, common-rights, wood for fuel, gleaning 
        after harvest, pig and poultry-keeping, and often skim-milk or butter 
        milk from the farms where they worked.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It thus appears that the conclusions arrived 
        at by myself from the statistics of poverty, suicide, insanity, physical 
        deterioration, and crime, during the last forty years,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
        are supported by a quite different set of facts, extending over a much 
        longer period, and set forth by a statistical authority of the first rank, 
        who has no special views to support. Let us therefore now consider the 
        main <font color="990000">[[p. 512]]</font> problem. What is the fundamental 
        error in our social system that has allowed this state of things to persist, 
        notwithstanding all our increase in wealth, and how we may most certainly 
        and most safely bring about the desired change to a social state in which 
        none who are willing to work shall ever suffer the extreme of want?</p>
      
      <p align="center"><em>The Society of the Future.</em></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am myself convinced that the society of the 
        future will be some form of socialism, which may be briefly defined as 
        <em>the organization of labour for the good of all</em>. Just as the Post 
        Office is organized labour in one department for the benefit of all alike; 
        just as the railways might be organized as a whole for the equal benefit 
        of the whole community; just as extensive industries over a whole country 
        are now organized for the exclusive benefit of combinations of capitalists; 
        so all necessary and useful labour might be organized for the equal benefit 
        of all. When a combination or trust deals with the whole of one industry 
        over an extensive area, there are two enormous economies; advertising, 
        which under the system of competition among thousands of manufacturers 
        and dealers wastes millions annually, is all saved; and distribution, 
        when only the exact number of stores and assistants needful for the work 
        are employed, effects an almost unimaginable saving over the scores of 
        shops and stores in every small town, competing with each other for a 
        bare living. What then would be the economy when <em>all</em> the industries 
        of a whole country were similarly organized for the common good; and when 
        all absolutely useless and unnecessary employments were abolished--such 
        as gold and diamond mining except to the extent needed for science and 
        art; nine-tenths of the lawyers, and all the financiers and stock-gamblers? 
        It is clear that under such an organized system three or four hours work 
        for five days a week by all persons between the ages of twenty and fifty 
        would produce abundance of necessaries and comforts, as well as all the 
        refinements and wholesome luxuries of life, for the whole population.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 513]]</font> But although 
        I feel sure that some such system as this will be adopted in the future, 
        yet it may be only in a somewhat distant future, and the coming century 
        may only witness a step towards it; it is important that this step should 
        be one in the right direction. The majority of our people dislike the 
        very idea of socialism, because they think it can only be founded by compulsion. 
        If that were the case it would be equally repulsive to myself. I believe 
        only in <em>voluntary</em> organization for the common good, and I think 
        it quite possible that we require a period of true individualism--of competition 
        under strictly equal conditions--to develop all the forces and all the 
        best qualities of humanity, in order to prepare us for that voluntary 
        organization which will be adopted when we are ready for it, but which 
        cannot be profitably forced on before we are thus prepared.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our present society the bulk of the people 
        have no opportunity for the full development of all their powers and capacities, 
        while others who have the opportunity have no sufficient inducement to 
        do so. The accumulation of wealth is now mainly effected by the misdirected 
        energy of competing individuals; and the power that wealth so obtained 
        gives them is often used for purposes which are hurtful to the nation. 
        There can be no <em>true</em> individualism, no <em>fair</em> competition, 
        without equality of opportunity for all. This alone is social justice, 
        and by this alone can the best that is in each nation be developed and 
        utilized for the benefit of all its citizens. I propose, therefore, to 
        state briefly what is the ethical foundation for this principle, and what 
        its practical application implies.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><em>The Law of Social Justice</em>.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Herbert Spencer's volume on &quot;Justice,&quot; forming 
        Part IV. of his <em>Principles of Ethics</em>, he gives as the foundation 
        of social justice the following:--</p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of man, as of all inferior 
        creatures, the law by conformity to which the species is preserved, is 
        that among adults the individuals best adapted to the conditions of their 
        existence shall prosper most, and that the individuals least adapted to 
        the conditions of their <font color="990000">[[p. 514]]</font> existence 
        shall prosper least--a law which, if uninterfered with, entails survival 
        of the fittest, and spread of the most adapted varieties. And, as before, 
        so here, we see that, ethically considered, this law implies,<i> that 
        each individual ought to receive the benefits and evils of his own nature 
        and consequent conduct: neither being prevented from having whatever good 
        his actions normally bring him, nor allowed to shoulder off on to other 
        persons whatever ill is brought to him by his actions.</i>&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <font size="-1"></font> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage printed in italics is the &quot;law of social 
        justice&quot; deduced from the law of the survival of the fittest, and it is 
        appealed to again and again throughout the volume, but is usually indicated 
        by the shorter formula--&quot;each shall receive the benefits and evils due 
        to his own nature and consequent conduct.&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
        In all our sports and trials of skill or endurance, we aim at equality 
        of conditions for the competitors, who are all of nearly equal age and 
        in good health, while their preliminary training has been nearly the same; 
        and it is universally recognized that the skill or endurance of each can 
        only be ascertained by such equal or fair conditions.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it is a question, not of mere sports 
        or amusements, but of the real battle of life, failure in which often 
        means continuous hardship, want, or premature death, with the loss to 
        friends and to the community of all those higher qualities or talents 
        which were undeveloped through want of leisure or opportunity, we make 
        no attempt whatever to give fair play to all alike. How much we lose by 
        this unfairness no one can tell, but the poets have always recognized 
        that there is such a loss. Gray tells of the &quot;village Hampdens&quot; and the 
        &quot;mute inglorious Miltons&quot; that may have passed away unknown, and of the 
        hearts &quot;once pregnant with celestial fire&quot;--</p>
      
 <blockquote>&quot;But knowledge to their eyes her ample page<br />
        Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;<br />
        Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage<br />
        And froze the genial current of the soul&quot;:</blockquote>
      <p><font color="990000">[[p. 515]]</font> while even the refined and critical 
        Tennyson could say--<br />
      </p>
<blockquote>&quot;Plowmen, shepherds, have I found, and more than once, and still 
        could find, Sons of Gods and kings of men in utter nobleness of mind.&quot;</blockquote>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere we see illustrations of the same 
        fact in the fortunate accidents that have here and there rescued some 
        great mind from a life of obscure drudgery. If Watt, the mathematical 
        instrument maker, had not lived in Glasgow, where he had the model of 
        a steam-engine sent him from the University for repair, the advent of 
        the modern steam-engine might have been delayed half a century. If Faraday 
        had not had a ticket given him to Sir Humphry Davy's lectures on chemistry 
        at the Royal Institution, he might have always remained a working bookbinder, 
        and the progress of electrical science might have been seriously checked. 
        Numbers of our inventors and original thinkers have sprung from the ranks 
        of peasants and mechanics, and we may be sure that many more who were 
        equally gifted have been wholly lost to the world owing to the absence 
        of favourable conditions at the right period of their lives, or to some 
        inherent modesty or timidity that prevented them from forcing their way 
        in spite of all obstacles. What we need in order to profit by all the 
        skill, and talent, and genius that may exist in our whole population, 
        is that all should have the education and the opportunities for developing 
        whatever abilities they may possess, which are now accessible only to 
        the higher and the wealthier classes; and when we find that this is also 
        the teaching of philosophy, and that only in this way can we apply the 
        fundamental principle of organic evolution to the development of the social 
        organism, we have both experience and theory in favour of adopting it 
        as a sure guide.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><em>Equality of Opportunity.</em></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While discussing Herbert Spencer's &quot;Justice&quot; 
        in an address to the Land Nationalization Society in 1892, I remarked:</p>
      
<font size="-1">
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is strange that Mr. Spencer did 
        not perceive that if this law of the connection between individual character 
        and conduct and their <font color="990000">[[p. 516]]</font> economical 
        results, is to be allowed free play, some social arrangement must be made 
        by which all may start in life with an approach to <em>equality of opportunities.</em>&quot;</blockquote>
      </font> 
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years later this term was used and popularized 
        by Mr. Benjamin Kidd in his &quot;Social Evolution,&quot; and is now often used 
        with approval by political and social writers, most of whom, however, 
        do not appear to see all that it implies. The term includes all that is 
        contained in Spencer's principle of social justice, and as it is much 
        shorter and more expressive, it is well adapted to become the watchword 
        of social reformers. Let us then see what its full application would really 
        mean.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equality of Opportunity is absolute fair play 
        as between man and man in the struggle for existence. It means that all 
        shall have the best education they are capable of receiving; that their 
        faculties shall all be well trained, and their whole nature obtain the 
        fullest moral, intellectual, and physical development. This does not mean 
        that all shall have the <em>same </em>education, that all shall be made 
        to learn the same things and go through the same training, but that all 
        shall be so trained as to develop fully all that is best in them. It must 
        be an adaptive education, modified in accordance with the peculiar mental 
        and physical nature of the pupils, not a rigid routine applied to all 
        alike, as is too often the case now.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It further implies that during this period of 
        thorough education every endeavour shall be made to ascertain how the 
        special faculties of each can be best utilized for the good of society 
        and for his own happiness, and thus will be determined the particular 
        work, both bodily and mental, to which each youth shall be trained, subject 
        always to the demand for workers in the various industries or occupations.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet further, equality of opportunity requires 
        that all shall have an endowment to support them during the transition 
        period between education and profitable employment, and to furnish them 
        with such an outfit as their special avocations require.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><font color="990000">[[p. 517]] </font><em>Inheritance 
        of Wealth causes Inequality.</em></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even this is not all. We must also take 
        care that inequality is not introduced by private gifts or bequests to 
        individuals which might enable them to live permanently in idleness and 
        luxury, since every one who so lives must necessarily be supported by 
        the labour of others, and is in all essentials a pauper, as has been so 
        forcibly urged in the remarkable work of Mr. A. J. Ferris--&quot;Pauperizing 
        the Rich.&quot; It is here that most people (including Herbert Spencer and 
        Mr. Kidd) object to the application of the principle that every man shall 
        receive the results of his own nature and conduct, or, in other words, 
        shall have &quot;equality of opportunity,&quot; as being unjust or injurious. But 
        if this principle is the essential feature of social justice, its full 
        application cannot be unjust; while if it is the true correlative in human 
        society of survival of the fittest among the lower forms of life, it cannot 
        be injurious.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty seems to arise from the fact 
        that if the accumulation of property either by the labour, the foresight, 
        or the good fortune of an individual, is right, and is for the benefit 
        of society as a whole, as is generally assumed, it is also assumed that 
        the power of transferring this property to another must be also both right 
        and beneficial. This, however, does not logically follow. If equality 
        of opportunity is a true and just principle, then the society that gives 
        to every man that equality, and protects him in his work throughout his 
        life, may fairly claim to inherit any surplus wealth that he leaves behind 
        him, <em>in order to ensure similar advantages to all</em>. And it is 
        still more obvious, that a society which has adopted the principle of 
        equality of opportunity as the only means of securing true individualism 
        and competition under fair and equal conditions, may justly prevent individuals 
        from introducing inequality by their injudicious gifts or bequests. From 
        either point of view it follows, that society should protect itself by 
        a strict regulation of the transmission or inheritance of wealth.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><font color="990000">[[p. 518]]</font> <em>Public Debts 
        Impolitic and Immoral.</em></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another consideration that is usually 
        overlooked in this connection, and thus helps to obscure the real issue. 
        Under our highly artificial and complex monetary system, the &quot;property&quot; 
        left by rich men is seldom real wealth, but consists almost wholly of 
        claims upon, or tribute exacted from society at large. Real wealth is 
        highly perishable--food, clothing, houses, tools, machinery, &amp;c.--and 
        if such wealth were given to another in large quantities it would rapidly 
        deteriorate or require a considerable annual expenditure to preserve its 
        value. But by our money-market system of funds, stocks, shares, and rents, 
        permanent incomes are derived from perishable wealth, to the injury of 
        all who are forced to pay these incomes. Money has been diverted from 
        its original and beneficial purpose of facilitating the mutual exchange 
        of commodities--&quot;a tool of exchange,&quot; as some economists have termed it--into 
        a means of enabling large numbers of wealthy individuals to live permanently 
        at the expense of their working fellow-citizens. This is the real reason 
        of the objection of the ancient law-givers to usury, that it enables men 
        to live without doing any useful work; and the objection of modern socialists 
        to interest is, not that to take interest for the use of money is morally 
        wrong, but that the general application of the principle of national or 
        municipal interest-bearing debts, railway shares, &amp;c., afford the 
        conditions by which perishable wealth is changed into permanent property, 
        and offers facilities for the most gigantic and harmful system of gambling 
        the world has ever seen.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All wealth so acquired is a means of impoverishing 
        those whose work produces all the real wealth that is consumed annually. 
        Adam Smith again and again states this fact, that the annual consumption 
        of the whole population, including all the idle rich, is produced annually 
        by the workers; and it is because the system of interest enables false 
        wealth, which is really tribute exacted from the people, to go on increasing 
        indefinitely, and thus tends <font color="990000">[[p. 519]]</font> continually 
        to impoverish the workers and to increase the numbers of the idle, that 
        it has been condemned as both impolitic and evil. And we now see that, 
        as it leads to results which are opposed to &quot;equality of opportunity,&quot; 
        it is also ethically unjust.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><em>Hereditary Wealth bad for its Recipients.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another consideration which leads 
        to the same conclusion as to the evil of hereditary or unearned wealth--its 
        injurious effects to those who receive it, and through them to the whole 
        community. It is only the strongest and most evenly balanced natures that 
        can pass unscathed through the ordeal of knowing that enormous wealth 
        is to be theirs on the death of a parent or relative. The worst vices 
        of our rotten civilization are fostered by this class of prodigals, surrounded 
        by a crowd of gamblers and other parasites, who assist in their debaucheries 
        and seek every opportunity of obtaining a share of the plunder. This class 
        of evils is too well known and comes too frequently and too prominently 
        before the public to need dwelling upon here; but it serves to complete 
        the proof of the evil effects of private inheritance, and to demonstrate 
        in a practical way the need for the adoption of the just principle of 
        equality of opportunity.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><em>Conclusion</em>.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a system of society as is here suggested, 
        when all were well educated and well trained and were all given an equal 
        start in life, and when every one knew that however great an amount of 
        wealth he might accumulate he would not be allowed to give or bequeath 
        it to others in order that they might be free to live lives of idleness 
        or pleasure, the mad race for wealth and luxury would be greatly diminished 
        in intensity, and most men would be content with such a competence as 
        would secure to them an enjoyable old age. And as work of every kind would 
        have to be done by men who were as well educated and as refined as their 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 520]]</font> employers, while only a small minority 
        could possibly become employers, the greatest incentive would exist towards 
        the voluntary association of workers for their common good, thus leading 
        by a gradual transition to various forms of co-operation adapted to the 
        conditions of each case. With such equality of education and endowment 
        none would consent to engage in unhealthy occupations which were not absolutely 
        necessary for the well-being of the community, and when such work was 
        necessary they would see that every possible precautions were taken against 
        injury. All the most difficult labour-problems of our day would thus receive 
        an easy solution.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit, therefore, that the adoption of the 
        principle of Equality of Opportunity as our guide in all future legislation, 
        should be acceptable to every social reformer who believes in the supremacy 
        of Justice. To the individualist it would mean the fullest application 
        of his principle of individual freedom limited only by the like freedom 
        of others, since this principle is a mere mockery under the present negation 
        of fair and equal conditions to the bulk of the citizens of all civilized 
        states. And it should be equally acceptable to the socialist, because 
        the greatest obstacle to his teachings would be removed by the abolition 
        of ignorance and of that grinding poverty and want which leaves no time 
        or energy for any struggle but that for bare existence. Equality of Opportunity, 
        founded as it is upon simple Justice between man and man, is therefore 
        well fitted to become the watchword of the social reformers of the Twentieth 
        Century.</p>

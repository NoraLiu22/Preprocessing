lyrics written by Brian Hageman<P>
<HR>
<P>Excuse me sir, I'd like to buy a spike for planting hornets in the heart of my wife.  She's had conversations with my darker side.  Now she's left me with a poisoned mind.
<P>She has a hornet's heart.
<P>I care for her so.  It saddens me to know she knows that I'd cook her to keep her warm.  When she saws her saw-like call and asks me if I caught it all, I let slip I love her so, I'd cook her to keep her warm.
<P>She has a hornet's heart.
<P><HR><P>

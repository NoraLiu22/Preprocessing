Archaeocyaths are an extinct group of sponges that have a controversial history. 
Discoveries in the 1960s and 1970s caused re-examination of sponge phylogeny generally, 
and comparisons between archaeocyaths and sponges in particular. The result was 
the abandonment of the Phylum Archaeocyatha. Present consensus is that archaeocyaths 
represent both a clade and a grade--Class Archaeocyatha and the archaeocyathan 
morphological grade--within Phylum Porifera. The first archaeocyaths appear roughly 
530 million years ago, during the Lower Cambrian and were very important members 
of Lower Cambrian environments. They diversified into hundreds of species during 
this time period and some of these species contributed greatly to the creation 
of the reef systems that supported a wide variety of organisms. Despite their 
great success in terms of numbers, the archaeocyaths were a short-lived group. 
They were almost completely non-existent by the middle Cambrian, some 10 to 15 
million years after their first appearance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Phylum

Chordata comprises those animals most often occupying the top of the food chain, 
including the fishes, reptiles(included the extinct dinosaurs), reptiles, birds 
and mammals (including humans). The Chordates primary common feature is a notochord, 
a rod that extending most of the length of the organism. Lying dorsal to the gut 
but ventral to the central nervous system, it stiffens the body and acts as support 
during locomotion. More specifically, the notochordat should be present at least 
during some part of the organisms development. Other common morphologies include 
bilateral symmetry, segmented body, a well-developed coelom, a single, dorsal, 
hollow nerve cord, usually with an enlarged anterior end (i.e., brain), a tail 
projecting beyond (posterior to) the anus at some stage of development, ventral 
heart, with dorsal and ventral blood vessels and a closed blood system, a complete 
digestive system, and usually, a bony or cartilaginous endoskeleton</FONT><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC">.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC">Metazoa</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF9900"><A NAME="Metazoa"></A></FONT></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
first multi-celled animals (<B>metazoa</B>) evolved over 600 million years ago 
and can be grouped into three categories: sponge-like animals, cnidarians, and 
worms. The sponges, and cnidarians (corals and sea anemones), are the most primitive 
with about 11 specialized cell types. Worms and higher metazoa have approximately 
55 specialized cells.<BR> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) 
<B>Sponges</B> are simple multi-celled animals. In general, sponges have open-topped, 
sack-like bodies which are fixed to the sea floor. Water is pulled through the 
body, and food is filtered out. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
2) <B>Cnidarians</B> comprise corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish.Their body plan 
resembles a sack with an end that functions as a mouth that can be opened and 
closed with tentacles that can be extended to move food to the mouth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
3) Among the simple metazoa,<B> worms</B> are the most advanced, and it is conjectures 
that their body was the basis for the evolution of all more advanced life forms. 
Worms have a fluid-filled cavity called a coelom inside the body and advanced 
variations of this cavity can be seen in all higher animals. In many animals, 
it has become the sack which holds the internal organs.</FONT></P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC">Insects</FONT></B></FONT>

earliest known insects are tiny wingless forms from the early and middle Devonian. 
Insect flight developed with suddenness resembling the Cambrian explosion during 
the middle Carboniferous, apparently the result of the significant survival advantage 
that was accrued. By the end of the Carboniferous, the insects had evolved into 
a large number of distinct orders, including many dragonfly-like forms. This was 
the hey-day of the</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#FFCC00">

<FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC">forms appeared. Blattoid and Orthopteroid orders attained 
their greatest diversity, and new groups like the Psocoptera, Homopteran, Hemiptera, 
Mecoptera and Coleoptera became ubiquitous and diverse. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CCCCCC">The 
Permian extinction wiped out nine orders of insects, and more orders disappeared 
in the Triassic or the early Jurassic. However, surviving orders such as Neuroptera, 
Mecoptera, and Diptera, and Coleoptera underwent further radiation establishing 
many families extant in modern times.<BR> From the Upper Cretaceous, insects have 
largely been of modern type. This is illustrated by the many recent families and 
genera that have been found preserved in Baltic amber and elsewhere. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CCCCCC">Of 
the orders recorded with certainty for the first time from Tertiary beds, the 
Strepsiptera and Siphonaptera may have been relatively late developments, but 
the others were probably more ancient.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">One 
of the sure signs that a fossil site is a Lagerstatt is when insects are well 
preserved. Insect preservation generally requires rapid sedimentary coverage before 
decay and predation occur.

are layered mounds, columns, and sheets found in the rock. They were originally 
built by the growth of layer upon layer of cyanobacteria, a single-celled photosynthesizing 
microbe growing on a sea floor. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic cells (the simplest 
form of modern carbon-based life) that lack a DNA-containing nucleus. This simple 
organism was the only life on Earth for some 2 billion years, and dominated life 
on earth between 1 and 2 billion years ago. Though uncommon, extant stromatolites 
are found in a few places such as Shark Bay, Australia; the salinity of the water 
is very high in this bay, such that the only life that can survive is cyanobacteria. 
</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The prototypical 
structures are formed when the bacteria precipitate or trap and bind layers of 
sediment to make accretionary formations that present in different forms, including 
domes, cones and complex branching configurations. Structures sizes are highly 
variable from twig size to Mack truck size. Especially when polished, stromatolite 
can be most beautiful.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Yet, 
interesting controversies persist in the origins of stromatolites.</FONT></P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#FFCC00"><B><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC">Trilobites</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF9900"><A NAME="Trilobites"></A></FONT></B></FONT></P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CCCCCC">Among 
the fossil remains of extinct life on Earth, the trilobites are the most ubiquitous. 
In terms of popularity, they are probably second only to the dinosaurs. Trilobites 
were marine invertebrates that emerged in the Cambrian Explosion, a time that 
superimposed abundant oxygen on earth with the evolutionary emergence of cellular 
mechanisms to use oxygen for energy (see related article of cell biology). Diversity 
of life exploded and trilobites shared in the chain reaction. Trilobites rapidly 
evolved functional complexity and, particularly, sophisticated vision systems. 
Size, a relatively easy adaptation in evolution, also exploded. The entire Paleozoic 
Era is sometimes called the age of trilobites and for these 300 million years, 
trilobite evolution resulted in an estimated 15,000 different species exhibiting 
enormous diversity of forms most wonderful and beautiful. They vary in size from 
a few millimeters to a couple of feet. Trilobites have been called the &quot;Butterflies 
of the Seas&quot;, a name we find most hard to dispute.</FONT></P>

                which includes modern-day insects, scorpions, centipedes, shrimps, 
                lobsters and crabs, and other jointed-legged animals. They lived 
                throughout the crucial period just before the modern arthropod 
                groups are known to have appeared. It is sound conjecture that 
                trilobites descended from a single ancestor. But, by the time 
                trilobites appeared in the Lower</FONT> <A HREF="../GeologicalTimeMachine.htm">Cambrian</A> 
                <FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC">fossil record, they were already a highly 
                diverse and advanced sub-phylum of animals. Interestingly, Darwin 
                thought trilobites most closely related to Crustacea, and the 
                famous Walcott thought it was an arachnid. Setting aside one hypothesis 
                in favor of the other yet alludes science.</FONT></FONT></P>
              <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CCCCCC">The 
trilobite was encased in an exoskeleton composed of calcite, a hard mineral, just 
like a modern-day clamshell. As an evolutionary adaptation that emerged in the 
Cambrian, exoskeletons served as a means of containment and support for internal 
organs. In fact, the appearance of exoskeletons in the Cambrian Explosion was 
undoubtedly a critical evolutionary innovation. In short, this support system 
was a prerequisite for an explosion of trilobite size. Natural selection would 
also have favored a development of harder and thicker shells due to the protection 
they provided. The trilobite evolved to be a veritable armored tank on the topside, 
but on the underside it was soft and vulnerable, and no currently living animals 
have such a configuration.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CCCCCC">Lengthwise, 
the trilobite is divided into three segments, the cephalon (or head), the thorax 
(middle) and pygidium (or tail). It may not surprise you that the organs contained 
in these segments correspond well to those of human head, middle and tail. The 
middle segment of the trilobite was further divided into a number of &quot;thoracic 
segments&quot;, each connected fore and aft to adjacent segments by weaker tissue. 
These linked thoracic segments rendered the trilobite flexible, and hence more 
mobile, but also made them more vulnerable to predation.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CCCCCC">Trilobites 
particularly flourished in the oceans of the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, 
beginning around 540 million years ago, with a diminishing of families persisting 
until the Permian. The number of families actually peaked in the Late Cambrian 
when an extinction event removed many. The morphological diversity actually peaked 
in the Ordovician. Many more families were removed at the end of the Ordovician 
440 million years ago during a great ice age where ice sheets advanced to the 
equator. The diminished number of trilobite families that survived to the Silurian 
radiated into new and exotic forms, and still more exotic spiny and pustulose 
forms in the Devonian. The Devonian was punctuated by periods of rising seas that 
disrupted the reef systems where the trilobites flourished forcing selective adaptation. 
The end of the Devonian saw the Frasnian-Famennian event where only Proteus survived 
into the Carboniferous. Despite reduced ancestry, with decent with modification 
ruling, these trilobites filled the same ecological niches repeated the forms 
of their extinguished relatives. The genetic path was assuredly different, but 
the evolved forms had discernable specificity with those long extinct. However, 
trilobites never truly recovered in the Carboniferous, with but a handful of genera 
extant by the Permian. Failing to adapt to deep-water habitats, their vulnerability 
to climatic change remained and led to their disappearance prior to yet another 
great mass extinction at the end of the Permian. The age of the trilobite yielded 
to the age of the</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#FFCC00">

encompass many of the familiar animals on Earth: birds; fishes; frogs; reptiles; 
snakes; and mammals, including we Homo sapiens. The vertebrate fossil record dates 
back some 500 million years ago to the upper Cambrian. Vertebrates first evolved 
in the ocean. The invertebrate ancestors of vertebrates had gill slits that were 
primarily used for filter feeding, with oxygen uptake being through their skin. 
These early vertebrates lacked jaws, as does extant hagfish and lampreys. Jawed 
vertebrates appeared 100 million years later in Silurian time. In terms of number 
of species, vertebrates are a tiny per cent of the living creatures. </FONT></FONT></P></div></td></tr>

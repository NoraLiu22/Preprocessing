<P>HeadLine (<a href="http://www.headline.ac.uk/">http://www.headline.ac.uk/</a>), one of the eLib programme's Phase 3 projects, is developing a hybrid library system -- the HeadLine Personal Information Environment (PIE). The PIE uses portal-type technology to present an information environment that is personalised to the user's needs and allows user customisation.  The user is presented with pages of resources relevant to their courses/department. PIE users are also provided with an "All resources" page which contains all of the resources to which their library provides access. Users can create their own lists of resources on their own pages.</p>  

<p>The PIE aims to provide its users (students, academics, library staff, etc.) with a "one-stop-shop" -- a single interface to both print and electronic information resources and services. The PIE will allow seamless authentication to those resources that the user has permission to access.</p>

<p>Users will only have to input a username and password once -- on logging in. From the Librarian/PIE administrator's point of view, one of the PIE's aims is to reduce the amount of administrative work associated with maintaining resource information (often currently contained within "flat" library web pages). The metadata associated with the PIE's resources is contained within a Resource Description Model.</p>

<p>The first release of the HeadLine PIE is due to be rolled out to target groups at each of the project's partner sites (London School of Economics, London Business School and the University of Hertfordshire) in early May 2000.  If you are interested in becoming a guest user of the PIE and/or keeping up-to-date with HeadLine developments then join the HeadLine mailing list:  <a href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/headline-users/">http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/headline-users/</a>.</p>

<p>A new demonstration version of the HeadLine PIE is now available. This demonstration is an example of what we think a "typical" student user's session might involve.  You can visit this demonstration at: &lt;<a href="http://www.headline.ac.uk/publications/pie/">http://www.headline.ac.uk/publications/pie/</a>&gt;. You will find out how "Pete", an Economics student, uses the PIE to add a new resource to his page and then to search for information for his forthcoming assignment. The HeadLine team is interested in your comments. Does the PIE meet your expectations? What do you think could be improved?  Please send you comments via e-mail to the HeadLine Team: &lt;<a href="mailto:headline@lse.ac.uk">headline@lse.ac.uk</a>&gt;.

<p>A couple of years ago at a conference about e-publishing, the last speaker (an elegant and effective lady) concluded her presentation with the following words: "If you really want to get your library staff involved in e-journal use and management propose them to launch a Webzine, it is very useful to understand the process and they will have also a lot of fun."</p>

<p>At CERN, as in many other libraries, we have tried to face the e-journal challenge and now we have access to more than 400 online journals related to high energy physics (HEP).</p>

<p>We are now used to extracting our e-journal web pages from the catalogue, maintaining all the links related to the e-journals (home, last issue, TOC, TOC and SA, etc.) as you can see at &lt;<a href="http://library.cern.ch/electronic_journals/ej.html">http://library.cern.ch/electronic_journals/ej.html</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>During the run to face the explosion of e-journals we remembered the recommendation to launch a Web journal and we proposed to our librarians to prepare a Webzine for HEP libraries. We also contacted colleagues of other HEP libraries. Because of the general overload the answers were without too much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>We asked for volunteers among the staff of our library and, to my surprise, the ones I expected to be willing to volunteer were not interested and vice versa.</p>

<p>After several long discussions and uncertainty we defined our purpose and we started to look for authors. We are lucky because CERN, and HEP in general, are full of authors willing to write about scientific information management.</p>

<p>You can see the result at &lt;<a href="http://library.cern.ch/HEPLW/">http://library.cern.ch/HEPLW/</a>&gt;. We know, it is still a rather naive Webzine, but it could become useful to our target audience and we are sure we will continue to have a lot of fun.</p>

<p>We were so eager to announce the first issue on 31 March at the 2nd Workshop on e-publishing in physics (see at <a href="http://documents.cern.ch/age?a99231">http://documents.cern.ch/age?a99231</a>) that we did not even wait for the release of our ISSN. You can have a look  at the workshop presentations; it is also available as webcasting (with a lot of patience!).</p>

<p>At the workshop most of the major players in our field (APS, Elsevier, IOP, JHEP, and Springer) were present with their news and their projects. So between the presentation of the idea of the overlay journal by the APS and a presentation of <em>The New Journal of Physics</em> by IOP we informed the audience of the release of the first issue of our HEP Libraries Webzine.

<p>Between 1910 and 1979 the newsreels, released twice a week in British cinemas, gave millions their picture of national and world events. Such fondly remembered names as Pathe News, Gaumont British News and British Movietone News were seen in every cinema, and have now preserved an invaluable record of life and news in the twentieth century. They are already regularly used by television companies making historical programmes, and are increasingly used by academics working in a variety of fields, as  appreciation grows of their special value as a historical resource.</p>

<p>The British Universities Film & Video Council (BUFVC), a representative body which aims to promote the production, study and use of film and related media in British higher education and research, has maintained and encouraged an interest in newsreel history since the 1970s. In 1995, with funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the BUFVC initiated the British Universities Newsreel Project, which has resulted in a database of information on 160,000 individual newsreel stories taken from twenty-one British newsreels and cinemagazines.</p>

<p>The database features news coverage from 1910 to 1979, and embraces such topics as fashion, sport, crime, leisure, transport and two world wars. It is fully searchable by subject, title, event, location, date, company, cameraman and synopsis. An accompanying booklet includes a short history of the newsreels. The website also includes the history, general information on the newsreels, articles, and a biographical index of cameramen. Further information is being added to the database, and a major new project is underway to add supporting documentation such as commentary scripts and cameramen's dope sheets.</p>

<p>The British Universities Newsreel Project website is the first centralised record of British newsreel releases. It will become a major historical resource for students, historians and film researchers, and will help secure the newsreels' place as a treasure trove of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The website is at &lt;<a href="http://www.bufvc.ac.uk/newsreels">http://www.bufvc.ac.uk/newsreels</a>&gt;, with free access to all ac.uk addresses and BUFVC members. It is also being sold as a cross-platform (PC or Apple Mac) CD-ROM, price £95.00 (inc. VAT and p&p) but with one copy free to BUFVC member representatives, with a discount price of £65.00 for additional copies.</p>

<p>The North Carolina State University Library has released the source code for MyLibrary@NCState. Developed as a portal application to the NCSU Library's information resources, MyLibrary@NCState allows user profiling to build a dynamic, customized gateway to both general and discipline specific resources, including databases, electronic journals, current awareness features, personal bookmarks, and subject librarian contacts.</p>

<p>MyLibrary@NCState provides a highly configurable entry point to library services and collections, while allowing users to control even the background and banner colors of the page. Several screen areas are not configurable by the user but function as a method of enhancing communication between the library and its patrons. These include a global message that can be sent to all subscribers and a message from the librarian associated with the subject discipline identified during the creation of the initial profile.  A third static field displays "your librarians"  -- the names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of professional staff in a particular discipline also automatically generated from the creation of the user profile.</p>

<p>MyLibrary@NCState was named one of the Library and Information Technology
Association's "Top Technology Trends" in 1999.  In a review of personalization software packages used by libraries to offer user-customized access to library services, Roy Tennant, Digital Library Project Manager, UC-Berkeley called MyLibrary@NCState "best of its class" and "one of the most useful library applications [he'd] seen in quite some time."</p>

<p>MyLibrary@NCState is entirely built on open-source software and can, theoretically, be adapted to any library environment that includes access to a Unix server and an understanding of Perl scripting and relational databases. All of the content is served by the freeware database application MySQL which supports APIs for both Perl and C programming languages.</p>

<p>MyLibrary@NCState will run on any Unix HTTP server that supports CGI scripts. Please note that it is not "plug and play" and will require some comparative analysis of individual systems.</p>

<p>The source code is available through agreement to a GNU Public License. The site provides a developmental "sandbox" and a listserv for developers. By freely releasing this code The NCSU Libraries hope that others in the community can contribute to improving the service to the benefit of all library users.</p>

<p>To download the code, please access: &lt;<a href="http://hegel.lib.ncsu.edu/development/mylibrary/">http://hegel.lib.ncsu.edu/development/mylibrary/</a>&gt;.

<p>To try MyLibrary@NCState click to the guest account at: &lt;<a href="http://my.lib.ncsu.edu/">http://my.lib.ncsu.edu/</a>&gt;. </p>

<p>Thanks and we hope to see some of you in the sandbox very soon!</p>

<p>The preservation and long term accessibility of digital materials is a significant and growing concern for libraries worldwide.  Our ability and enthusiasm for creating (and relying on) digital resources far outweighs our current technical and organisational capacity to preserve and provide long-term access to them.  Long-term digital preservation relies on a number of technical and organisational factors, not least on the existence of robust descriptions of the digital objects to be preserved.  Even more so than traditional resources, continuing access to digital resources will require detailed descriptions telling us exactly what is contained in preserved digital files.  For digital materials, without meaningful retrieval there is no preservation.  To ensure meaningful retrieval, we must know precisely what we are trying to retrieve.  One of the aims of the Cedars project is to develop a metadata set which can be used for effective long-term digital preservation, thereby contributing to the development of new standards for this type of data description.</p>

<p>The very detailed metadata necessary to successfully archive digital material must support a wide range of archival functions from access control to document integrity and,  finally, preservation itself. Cedars has now developed an outline specification describing the complete set of metadata elements which attempts to reflect the multiple needs and functions which have to be addressed.  These functions include acquisition, management, storage, searching, retrieval, access, delivery and preservation.</p>  

<p>"Metadata for Digital Preservation: The Cedars Project Outline Specification" is now available for public consultation.  A final version is expected by June 2000.  It is available from the Cedars Project web site (<a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/cedars">http://www.leeds.ac.uk/cedars</a>).</p>

<p>Cedars is a project of the UK Consortium of University Research Libraries (CURL).  It is funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) as part of their Electronic Libraries Programme (eLib).</p>

<p>Librarians have shared ideas, information, perspectives and views through e-mail list servers for more than a decade. Long before there was a World Wide Web (and even before most academic e-mail was on the Internet), there was PACS-L: the Public-Access Computer Systems Forum.</p>

<p>Founded in June 1989 by Charles W. Bailey, Jr., of the University of Houston, PACS-L was one of the first library-related lists to cover a wide range of topics. It reached one of the widest audiences of any library lists. In a decade of activity, more than 18,000 messages reached a list that grew to more than 10,000 addresses. PACS-L disappeared in August 1999, but came back to life in March 2000.</p>

<p>PACS-L made a difference in the library field and for many individual librarians. It generated an international community of people concerned about library systems and public access. On the event of its rebirth, I prepared an informal article on PACS-L’s first decade, with contributions from many of PACS-L’s moderators and several of the long-term participants.</p>

<p>While a much shorter version of the article has been submitted for print publication, the complete article (7,900 words) is available online. The article’s name appears above. To reach it, I ask that you point to the "Libraries, Media, and the Future" subsite of my personal Website (the subsite index has a counter), then click on the link for "Talking About Public Access: PACS-L’s First Decade."</p>

<p>The PrePRINT Network at &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/preprint">http://www.osti.gov/preprint</a>&gt;  introduced by the Department of Energy’s Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) on January 31, 2000, is making the scientific community very happy. Since its release, this novel site has facilitated access to over 300,000 preprints in the physical sciences and other disciplines of interest to DOE. Without requiring the use of metadata standards, the PrePRINT Network enables the user to search diverse preprint databases through a single interface. An excellent example of intelligent web design, the PrePRINT Network presents a practical, working solution to scientists seeking preprint information.</p>

<p>The PrePRINT Network was recently updated with new resources and currently provides access to approximately 800 preprint sites. Several of these new additions were added at the request of authors and site owners, who had seen the PrePRINT Network and wanted to be included. Since the PrePRINT Network does not mandate the use of metadata standards, authors or site owners are not required to change their data or to conform to any set guidelines. The PrePRINT Network facilitates access to the sites and does not change the content in any way, so preprint site owners can simply notify OSTI of their desire to be added to the PrePRINT Network.</p>

<p>In addition to the preprint sites that can be accessed via browsing or by subject discipline, users have the option of searching 24 large preprint databases via distributed searching technology. Through a single interface, users may select which preprint databases they wish to search and then choose among author, title, full record, and date field options. Fields may be combined, such as a search for a particular author and title. Once the user enters the query and initiates the search, the PrePRINT Network software then pulses the search engines of each of the individual databases chosen. Results are returned in a consolidated list. The advantage of this technology is that the user does not have to perform individual searches within each database. Furthermore, the PrePRINT Network translates the queries into the appropriate syntax for each database, again saving the user time and eliminating the effort of having to learn how the different databases formulate search queries.</p>

<p>While other preprint initiatives have been discussed recently within information science circles, the PrePRINT Network has been fully operational for over two months now and is experiencing a high number of accesses from national laboratories, universities, and other research oriented institutions. A high growth rate for the PrePRINT Network is anticipated as more preprints are made available on the web.  The PrePRINT Network is the latest product developed by OSTI, and it serves to complete the trilogy of methods by which researchers announce and disseminate their findings: grey literature (DOE Information Bridge, &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/bridge">http://www.osti.gov/bridge</a>&gt;) journal literature (PubSCIENCE, &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/pubscience">http://www.osti.gov/pubscience</a>&gt;), and preprints (PrePRINT Network, &lt;<a href="http://www.osti.gov/preprint">http://www.osti.gov/preprint</a>&gt;).</p>

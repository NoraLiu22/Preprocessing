              Joliot. Just as Marie and Pierre had combined personal love with 
              professional commitment, so did the Joliot-Curies. Ir&egrave;ne and Fred

            <p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Like Pierre Curie, 
              Fred Joliot lacked impeccable academic credentials. But he had graduated 
              first in his engineering class at the Paris Municipal School of 
              Industrial Physics and Chemistry, where he studied under Paul Langevin, 
              the Curies' colleague and Marie's erstwhile love. In 1925 Langevin 
              helped place Fred at the Radium Institute as a junior assistant 
              to Marie Curie. By that time Ir&egrave;ne, two and a half years Fred's 
              senior, had been awarded her doctorate for studies of the alpha 
              rays of polonium (the first of the two elements her mother had discovered 
              27 years earlier). About a year after Fred's arrival in the lab, 
              the couple married. </font></p>

              THAT THE MARRIAGE WOULD LAST,</b> Marie Curie not only insisted 
              on a prenuptial agreement but also confirmed that Ir&egrave;ne would inherit 
              the use of the radium at the lab. The young couple struggled to 
              make ends meet, with Fred doing some teaching on the side. Despite 
              his many responsibilities, he was able in 1930 to complete his doctorate 
              on properties of compounds of polonium. For a while his financial 
              concerns led him to contemplate leaving research for a better-paying 
              career in industry. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Before 1928, when 
              they began to sign their scientific articles jointly, Ir&egrave;ne and 
              Fred had each published some solid work as individuals, but neither 
              had demonstrated outstanding scientific abilities. Together they 
              brushed greatness twice before striking pay dirt. In 1932 they noted 
              the unusual result of an experiment they performed, but failed to 
              understand it completely. That left the discovery of the neutron 
              to James Chadwick. In another experiment, drawing an incorrect conclusion 
              about the mysterious outcome, they ceded the discovery of the positron 
              to C. D. Anderson. <b><br>

              led them to a correct and very significant conclusion in mid-January 
              1934. By bombarding stable elements with nuclear projectiles, they 
              were the first to discover artificial radioactivity--a normal element 
              was changed to a radioactive one through human intervention. </font></p>
        <font size="-1">Persistent rumors about the strength of Joliot's 
                  attachment to Ir&egrave;ne (shown above at a 1929 conference on beta 
                  and gamma rays held at the Cavendish Laboratory) led him to 
                  announce to an acquaintance, &#147;But I do love my wife. I

            after receiving the Nobel Prize and the fame and obligations that 
            went with it, Ir&egrave;ne and Fred each took on administrative duties and 
            students. Ir&egrave;ne accepted the position of Undersecretary for Scientific 
            Research in a Socialist-Communist coalition government, but political 
            maneuvers were not to her taste and she soon returned to the lab. 
            In 1938 her group did painstaking work on uranium with puzzling results, 
            which provoked German scientists to research that led to the discovery 
            of nuclear fission. Fred's group, recognizing a potentially immense 
            source of energy, began pioneering work on chain reactions. When Germany 
            invaded France in 1940, his collaborators fled and helped create the 
            British atomic energy program, leading to the American Manhattan Project. 
            Fred and Ir&egrave;ne decided to remain in their homeland.</font>

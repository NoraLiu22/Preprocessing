Students were asked to look at a painting or image and write a short poem about what that image evoked for them. She hopes her poem will allow readers to form their own interpretations.</p>

<p>Dear Anzac soldiers and army,</p>

<p>The first thing I would like to say is I am so incredibly thankful for your services to our country. If it weren't for your services Australia would be living our worst lives. I have the highest respect possible for the whole army and can’t wait to hear the new plans you have to keep Australia and New Zealand safe.</p>

<p>The training you go through is incredibly hard and I don’t know how you do it. From what I’ve seen you have to do swimming, running, obstacle courses, first aid, and shooting. For me, that’s a lot to do in just a little amount of time and it would be hard to process all the training into your memory, so thank you for giving up a lot of your time to give to Australia's people. I don’t know how you do any of it. It amazes me to learn about the training you go through to get into the army. I have even more respect for all of you when you go through this training to save our country although you know you could lose your lives.</p>

<p>The whole army has taught me to stay strong and to put others before me. You are putting your life at risk for the whole of Australia to save our lives and that is the highest level of respect and generosity. Also when you don’t mind or even whine about the food or how much training you do amazes me. I could never do what you do and would love to learn more about the experience.</p>

<p>As a project, I would love to meet up with your team and study about the planes, the training and maybe a small interview on what it is like to be a soldier in the army, what it is like to be on the battlefield and what it is like without your family for such long periods.</p>

<p>Once again thank you so much for your service to Australia and hopefully, you get this note.</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Paige</p>

<p><strong><u>Poem</u></strong></p>

<p>The days are long and hard,<br />
As poppy’s turn red,<br />
As the battlefields grow old,<br />
And as your families grow tired.</p>

<p>But you are strong,<br />
And you are brave,<br />
And when you step onto that battlefield,<br />
We only pray.</p>

<p>We pray that you make it back alive,<br />
And that you will remember us,<br />
As we will always remember you.</p>

<p>For your fellow soldiers,<br />
Say to yourself,<br />
They are happy in heaven,<br />
And have died to save us.</p>

<p>Remember,<br />
We have respect for you,<br />
And always will,<br />
For that, you have served our country,<br />
And risked it all,<br />
For me.</p>

<p>So keep fighting,<br />
As we will keep fighting to remember you,<br />
And as we remember you,<br />
You stay strong,<br />
Stay brave,<br />
And stay tough,<br />
As we will never forget you.</p>

<p>Lest we forget</p>

            <div><p>This poem was written by Hayden Pitt, a year 10 student from Mount Barker Community College in Western Australia. It formed part of his HASS course, and entry to the Mt Barker RSL High School Anzac Day competition, in which students investigated Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in service personnel from the First and Second World Wars. The students presented their findings as a visual museum display.</p>

<p><strong>Even the brave can be broken.</strong></p>

<p>Soldiers. Stress. Courage. Death.<br />
Men who were tough. Who once were there.<br />
Came back broken. Fingers running through their hair.<br />
They try and try but forget they not.<br />
The trauma, the stress, the pain, the lot.<br />
Suffer they do, through day and through night.<br />
Though it be the loss, the death, the fright.<br />
Flash backs come, unwanted they are.<br />
From the bark of a dog or the horn of a car.<br />
Many are hurt and scared within.<br />
So we must understand the places they’ve been.</p>

<p>A war is raging in our backyard<br />
To stop it we will have to work ourselves hard<br />
When I go to the battle, I expect glory<br />
But when I get there it is just pointless and gory.<br /><br />
I wonder to this day what was the point of the war?<br />
It caused horrible suffering but then, that opened a door<br />
This door brought out the best in people, being true and mighty brave<br />
And that had an effect, like a ripple, like a wave.<br /><br />
People felt united, especially when<br />
You walked up to their graves and said "Never again."<br />
Everyone in the war deserves a reward,<br />
So we can give them our love and let us move forward<br /><br />
War is something we will always regret,<br />
The least we can do is say "Lest We Forget".</p>

<p>After visiting the Australian War Memorial with her year six class,  Bridget composed this poem:</p>

<p><strong>Remembrance Day</strong><br />
'You ever realised what the ANZACS were willing to do?<br />
They gave their lives for me and you.<br />
You ever wonder it would be to see,<br />
They died for you and me.<br />
They had to live in blood and gore<br />
They gave their lives to go to war.<br />
You ever realise what they did<br />
They gave their lives for us to live.<br />
You ever feel bad when you’re alone<br />
How ‘bout being a million miles<br />
away from home?<br />
Having to fight faithfully, hour after hour<br />
inside their hearts were trembling outisde their muscle power.<br />
They gave their lives for you and me,<br />
They sacrificed themselves don’t you see?"</p>

I waved goodbye.<br />
In the house there was silence.<br />
Everyone was hoping we were going to see him again.</p>

<p>Two weeks later I woke up from the sound of bombs.<br />

The birds were singing.</p>

Leaving behind our Aussie Shore<br />
I do hope my boys will return home soon<br />

With many of the men coming back to camp wounded and tiring<br />
All over the fields they roam<br />

Would make her feel a little less frail</p>

My boys must be in trouble at war<br />
The news was bleak<br />
I have lost three of my boys in one week.</p>

I do hope my boys will return home soon<br />
To tell us of their war stories in our family room</p>

The boys have all made me and their late Dad so proud<br />
Their efforts will never be forgotten, the King and Queen have vowed.</p>

<p>"The time has come" an Australian said,<br />
"Bye" as he faced the door and ran ahead.<br />
The war has started the battle begun,<br />
Smack,boom,crash went the lethal gun.<br />
Oww, the pain, other soldiers cried,<br />
Most of their friends sadly died.<br />
All the solders tried to laugh in glee,<br />
But they all missed their family.<br />
Every battle the bugle sang,<br />
The soldiers heard the deafening bang.<br />
Soon the battle is going to end,<br />
The pain inside will never mend.<br />
How they wished to be back home,<br />
Safe and snug and not alone,<br />
More and more people die,<br />
As more soldiers painfully cry.<br />
When it's the end of war,<br />
They knock happily at their door,</p>

<p>Soldiers go to Flanders field,<br />
With the poppies they wield,<br />
People look at the poppies red,<br />
Like their blood on the graveyards head,<br />
We remember the soldiers, who fought and died.<br />
And all their mates fighting by their side.<br />
We thank the soldiers who kept us alive,<br />
And the times in war they had to survive,<br />
We will always remember the men,<br />
Who gave their life to defend.</p>

<p>Lest we forget.</p>

<p>Asoldier stands, proud and stiff,<br />
in the centre of our town,<br />
With a rifle, never to fire again,<br />
with its barrel pointing to the ground.</p>

<p>Through rain, hail, shine and wind,<br />
he reminds us as time passes by,<br />
That life doesn't always go your way,<br />
it's just a beautiful lie.</p>

<p>The plaque that has those 'respectful' words,<br />
moulded in the brass,<br />
Really, doesn't mean anything,<br />
for everyone is the same as the last.</p>

<p>But, for our tall, strong soldier,<br />
and each one of his mates,<br />
Each experience was different,<br />
each with different fates.</p>

<p>Now, we know nothing of this soldier and nothing of his life,<br />
We can only assume, his memories, his fears,<br />
if he had children or a wife.</p>

<p>Maybe, he was just 16,<br />
and needed life's thrill,<br />
Maybe, living on rations was easy for him,<br />
or maybe he couldn't kill.</p>

<p>Maybe, he was 18, his life was just finding its place,<br />
Maybe, he was lost in the mud, unable to be retraced.</p>

<p>Maybe, he was 21, with a sweetheart waiting at home,<br />
Maybe, he had her portrait, resting in his pocket,<br />
along with his watch and comb.</p>

<p>Maybe, he was a young man,<br />
believing a job had to be done,<br />
Maybe, he thought this wouldn't kill me,<br />
this is gonna be fun.</p>

<p>Stone, flesh, soul and pride<br />
Is the legacy of this man,<br />
He's very special to each of us,<br />
cause he helped save our land.</p>

<p>So maybe this soldier is made of rock,<br />
but his life is special and old,<br />
Maybe, this town keeps our eye out for him,<br />
for we know his memories are gold.</p>

            <div><h3>The night before Gallipoli</h3>

<p>As part of their studies on the First World War, Year 6 students from Holy Cross Primary School, Kincumber, completed a writing task imagining they were an Australian soldier anchored off the shores of Gallipoli the night before the landing. Here are nine of their stories.</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>I peer through the darkness towards the shore’s outline and it feels like it is thirstily staring back at me, daring me with its evil eye to set foot on its beach. The idea of dying brings a sharp pang to my gut and makes me feel uneasy. I huddle to the side of the boat and I can’t keep my family from crossing my mind, that it may have been my last goodbye. The tension is building inside of me and my stomach churns, so I decide to pray; pray for hope, pray for courage and pray for safety among my loved ones.</p>

<p>As I look across the boat I see my fellow troop mates, their eyes tired and bloodshot from lack of sleep, but I don’t see defeat in their eyes yet, and I don’t think I ever will.</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>I’m on a one way trip to hell. This boat ride started off as an adventure and now has gone downhill. What seemed like a good idea back at the farm has now turned into regret. The only support I’ve got is my mates, my photograph of my family and my blanket of courage. I regret coming here now because of the terrible homesickness I feel on the inside. I dearly miss the twinkle of light in my mother’s eyes and the comfort of my brothers who didn’t come. I can tell everyone else feels homesick just by looking at them. We are all racked with nerves as we inch closer and prepare for Johnny Turk’s attack. But there is one thing for sure… I will never let my mates down.</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>As I lay in the hull of the boat, my attention turns to outside. I roll over and witness the moon shimmering over us, watching our every move. My mind drifts to family, as the moon reminds me of my mother, watching over me. I wonder, if this is my last moon, what will my family be feeling. I feel guilty – as if I have left them out to dry, isolated, with nowhere to go. But I have a job to do; to protect our country, to never back down, to fight to the last breath. I have made a solemn oath to never leave a mate behind, no matter how bad the situation, doing Australia proud. I am terrified – we all are – but right now we’re safe; we’re in the calm before the storm.</p>

<p>4.</p>

<p>As the sun sets into the sea I wonder if I will ever see it set again. I am covered in darkness and a blanket of fear as the wind howls. I am terrified, knowing that tomorrow could possibly be the worst day of my life. I am scared but I must be brave. I will do this for my country. I’ll do this for my mates. But what if I die here, what if I die here and no one knows? And my family; my brother and sisters what will they think? My mum and my dad how could they cope without me? I look at all of my mates. Will they be with me tomorrow, will any of my mates survive this catastrophe? The cliff face is mocking me, daring me to show Johnny Turk what I’m made of. I am ready, ready to make my country proud… but the night is still young.</p>

<p>5.</p>

<p>Here we wait, apprehensive but excited, waiting for our turn in the Great War. I can see the look on my mate’s faces of horror, misery and despair. Our rifles are at the ready, fingers on triggers. My thoughts return to happier days with my dad teaching me all his knowledge of the world. This was meant to be an adventure to experience the world first-hand but ended in hell. I look into my mate’s eyes full of dread and trepidation. We have one hour of peace until chaos erupts. I make a final oath to never let up, to make my country proud.    </p>

<p>6.</p>

<p>My teeth chatter my tummy churns; my tears carve a wet path down my face. I know that when the dawn sun rises we will go, go into that hell hole where the cliffs tower over us, mocking our fear. We all know Jonny Turk lurks up there waiting to shoot. I am infuriated with the Poms. Why would they send us into a death trap, like lambs to the slaughter? What seemed like such a grand adventure on the farm is now my worst nightmare. The idea of not seeing another starry night like this makes me cringe. I might never see my family again or feel their loving embrace. But I will not let my mates down If they fall I will carry them; if they die, I will die with them. I look at their faces; blood-shot eyes filled with fear yet determined to do their bit. We are young men, from a young country and we are determined to do it proud.</p>

<p>7.</p>

<p>The night is dragging, as I sit in this boat, agonising over my plans. Skittish minutes tick by as I rage at the Poms asinine decision to invade this hell hole. They’re ready for us,, ready for the boats to hit the shore. My thoughts turn to home. I’ll come home, I promise. I see their faces; my seven year old sister keeps asking where I am. A bucket of tears carve a pathway down my face.</p>

<p>Johnny Turk has all the advantages; anything could happen.</p>

<p>No matter how petrified I am I won’t let my country down, nor my mates.</p>

<p>The night before Gallipolli                                                                                                                                                            </p>

<p>8.</p>

<p>Dear Diary</p>

<p>There are still 6 hours till dawn. I am more terrified and nervous about letting my Australian country down than of dying. Will this be my last night on earth? My stomach is turning. I feel so sick. I’m home sick and am now regretting joining the army, But I will never stop or let down my mates. I need to show bravery, respect and courage and if we want to pull this off we definitely need team work.</p>

<p>The boat is rocking; I 'm trying my best to get some sleep. I am getting more nervous as we get closer and closer to Anzac Cove. My mates are asleep but I know they are determined and ready; as am I.</p>

<p>9.</p>

<p>It’s five hours until we get there and I can already see the horror in my mind.  I can feel the moon mocking me as we head towards my mind’s nightmare. A wind of regret chills my blood.  My mates and I are terrified at what lies ahead. We are all scared but we are determined to do the job we came here to do.  I am not going to let my mates down tomorrow, or my family, or my country.  In the morning I venture into hell with my mates.  I will stand like a true Aussie and won’t back down.</p>

We had our rifles ready, oh how our shoulders ached.</p>

            <div><p>The young Aussie boy<br />
No more than seventeen<br />
Split up into groups of six<br />
Of blokes he’d never seen</p>

<p>One said “How’s it going mate<br />
You seem a bit too young!<br />
You don’t look that much older<br />
Than a man of 21!”</p>

<p>He then said, “Pleased to meet you, I’m Martsson<br />
But you can call me ‘Mart’<br />
Just as they had started talking<br />
The boat was to depart</p>

<p>Weeks and weeks at sea<br />
Through the thickened mist<br />
Land at last was sighted<br />
An urge they couldn’t resist</p>

<p>Each and every soldier<br />
Shouldered their loaded gun<br />
“Remember the rules” The commander shouted<br />
“One for all, and all for one!”</p>

<p>The Young Aussie Diggers<br />
Stepped out onto the beach<br />
And before they could even turn around<br />
The boat was out of reach</p>

<p>As it sailed off into the distance<br />
The men began to march<br />
The fog now in their faces<br />
The fog as white as starch</p>

<p>The eerie silence followed<br />
See or hear, they could not<br />
They took their battle stations<br />
Then came the first gunshot</p>

<p>Suddenly, the air exploded<br />
Men dropping left and right<br />
“Damn those bloody Turks” Mart said<br />
“They’re putting up a fight”</p>

<p>“I’ll cover ya to that trench” He said<br />
“You’d better run like hell!<br />
Little did Mart know<br />
The front line had already fell</p>

<p>It was then he saw the battlefield<br />
The boy of seventeen<br />
His comrades dropping, one by one<br />
Their demise all but clean</p>

<p>The sand turned red<br />
The sand stained with blood<br />
The tides, ever-rising<br />
The beach began to flood</p>

<p>The bodies of the defeated<br />
Of those who couldn’t flee<br />
The raging tides behind them<br />
Pulling them out to sea</p>

<p>His blood froze in an instant<br />
His veins as cold as ice<br />
This wasn’t about the kill count<br />
This was about sacrifice</p>

<p>The ground beneath exploded<br />
And as the sand subsided<br />
He saw Mart’s tattered figure,<br />
His fate none but decided</p>

<p>Sprinting across the sand<br />
Through the leaded rain<br />
A bullet hit his shoulder<br />
A shoulder now in pain</p>

<p>Once he’d made it to Mart<br />
The man, waiting to die<br />
Mart spoke his final words<br />
The boy began to cry</p>

<p>The skies above were raging<br />
The boy gripping his injured limb<br />
The heavens split right open<br />
And cried along with him</p>

<p>Those years have long passed<br />
He lived day by day<br />
His skin turned to wrinkles<br />
His hair now of grey</p>

<p>At the grave of Martsson Williams<br />
For that was his name<br />
This man forever remembered<br />
Deserving of his fame</p>

<p>The polished marble headstone<br />
This alone, marked the life<br />
Of a 31 year old man<br />
Who made the ultimate sacrifice</p>

<p>The ‘boy’ of 93<br />
Now grey and old<br />
His tattered army jacket<br />
His only shield from the cold</p>

<p>He let out his tears<br />
And stared at the ground<br />
Mart’s grave was empty, he knew<br />
His body, never found</p>

<p>He remembered Mart’s last words<br />
“Make the decision you won’t regret”<br />
He put his hand to his heart, and whispered<br />
“Lest We Forget”</p>

            <div><p>Mary-Anne Taylor, her mother and her brother and sisters were standing in the hot sun watching the parade go past. It was the spring of 1914 and war had broken out three months ago. Her father came to Australia to work in the goldfields but unfortunately made no money to go home. After years’ worth of savings, he finally got enough money to take a trip to England. When the war started Mary-Anne’s father was in England visiting his sick mother, so he joined up to fight for the British Empire. He was fighting on the Western Front against the Germans. That parade brought back memories of him and made her start thinking about when she was going to see him again. Little did she know that she was never going to see her father again.</p>

<p>Mary-Anne was born in July 1892 in Carlton, Melbourne and was brought up in a small cottage with her six siblings. She was the oldest of the five girls in her family so she was forever looking after her sisters, whether they had cuts or needed help with their homework. She started her nurse training in December 1911 and joined the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) soon after.</p>

<p>The spark that lit the fuse at the start of World War I, was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The war was raging in Europe with the Allied Forces (Britain, France and Russia) up against the Central Powers (Germany and Austria Hungary). Australia’s Prime Minister Andrew Fisher pledged full support for Britain. Australians were fully supportive of the war because they wanted to prove themselves to the British Empire. Aboriginals went as well also wanting to prove themselves as Australians.  At the start of the war there were many volunteers and some of those who were accepted were sent to Egypt to fight the Ottoman Empire (Turkey).</p>

<p>A month after the parade the Taylors received a letter from the British army saying that her father was dead. The whole family mourned that day for the loss of him and that same day Mary-Anne and her brother Jim Taylor decided that they would go to war. The reasons why Mary-Anne wanted to go to war was partially the loss of her father and the desire to help, and partially to support her brother.</p>

<p>In late-1914 she and her friend Julia went on a boat and headed for Egypt. On the long voyage Mary-Anne and the other nurses were busy assisting with vaccinations and operations. She was posted at the 1st Australian General Hospital (1AGH) while Julia was posted at to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Australian General Hospital (2AGH).</p>

<p>While she was there the Australian troops were training near Cairo, ready for the time when the British Empire needed them. By the end of 1914 Mary-Anne was one of about 300 nurses that had come to Egypt. Mary-Anne remembered the terrible events 25<sup>th</sup> of April 1915 well, with the wounded coming in fast and with injuries ranging from blown off arms or legs to bullet holes right through thighs and hips.</p>

<p>At 4:30 that morning the Anzac troops had landed on the Gallipoli Peninsular but the Turkish were ready for them. They rained bullets on them and that day there were 2000 Anzacs wounded or dead and Mary-Anne nursed many of them.</p>

<p> It was not all work. Once she was allowed to have some time off where she went to see the famous pyramids and the sphinx. She also went to the markets with her friends and bought artefacts to send home. She even got to ride a camel.</p>

<p>Mary-Anne was worried about her brother, she had not heard anything about him and the day he came into her ward she wept to see him in the state he was. His left leg had been blown off by a Turkish shell and the bleeding could not be stopped. Mary-Anne was so close to her brother and while she was bandaging up the wound she remembered the time when they went to the Melbourne Beach with her whole family. There they went and picked up the prettiest shells they could see.</p>

<p>When Jim came to he started to talk to Mary-Anne about what the war on the front line was like. He told her that when he landed it was quite hot and pleasant but eventually it got freezing. Jim and the other soldiers had no proper clothes due to the fact that all their clothes were entirely worn out. Jim told Mary-Anne about the small amount of water that he was rationed. He said he even shaved with tea so not to waste water. He said he was really looking forward to mum’s roast when he was on leave because the food was inedible. Some of the things he had were bully beef (a type of canned beef), biscuits made by his mum, bread, bacon, cheese, Julienne canned vegetables and corned beef. Jim said the worst thing about the trenches were the rats and the flies. They spread disease and fed on the open wounds of the injured. “When there was a truce I had a friendly chat with the enemy. They’re not half as bad as we all think they are Mary-Anne.” He went on, “but the next day we were enemies again, it was strange. I went to war for the adventure but not this, this horrible life”.</p>

<p>A week later a ship came to take Jim home. It was a sad goodbye for Mary-Anne but she was happy that he could go home to mum and help look after the family. Jim went onto writing letters back to Mary-Anne telling her that all was well in the family.</p>

<p>Life remained busy for Mary-Anne with the numbers of injured and sick growing so high the nurses had to take over a local amusement park, turning the ticket office into an operating theatre and the skating rink, the scenic railway and the skeleton house all into wards. There were up to five deaths a day and sometimes over 250 patients to look after.</p>

<p>It seemed like an eternity, but after four long years, in 1917 Mary-Anne finally returned home. She had seen death, sorrow and pain, but when she came home she wanted to continue her career as a nurse where she worked in the Alfred Hospital for many years.</p>

            <div><h2>Mirrored Memoirs</h2>

<p>Before the wake of days despise,<br />
The soldiers daunt their high command.<br />
The pale, early morning skies<br />
Expose the endless vast of land.</p>

<p>A sea of brown flows limitless –<br />
Dry grass clumps and rutted earth.<br />
The Germans stand in coalesce<br />
Prepared to fight for all they’re worth.</p>

<p>Much horror soon is yet to come,<br />
Inferno’s close, its breath grows raucous.<br />
Silence – not a murmured hum,<br />
The pending soldiers, greatly cautious.</p>

<p>The lines of men that stand prepared,<br />
Are shielded by their masks of heft.<br />
Their frail bodies – under–cared,<br />
Are all the hope that they have left.</p>

<p>A pair of brothers – twins at such,<br />
Stand amongst this German force<br />
Shaking with Hell’s fearsome touch,<br />
Their safety, no one can enforce.</p>

<p>The tactic rises; bombs of gas<br />
An agonising, fearful fog<br />
The Germans cause, harsh death at mass<br />
As Allied forces breathe the smog.</p>

<p>The veil of sour–coloured mist<br />
Rolls across the dusty plains.<br />
Taking out those who exist<br />
Thriving anguish yet remains.</p>

<p>Brother twins, side by side<br />
Follow through the fatal haze.<br />
Nerves upon them do their pride,<br />
Messing with their mental phase.</p>

<p>Death surrounds them, hoarding courage.<br />
Screaming torment pains their ears.<br />
Suffering faces, for help they forage.<br />
Souls of bravery disappear.</p>

<p>Thunderous echoes, booming loud<br />
Travel amidst the gloomy fog.<br />
Like broken waves, a stratus cloud,<br />
Explosions to the soldiers flog.</p>

<p>The twins are struck and torn apart –<br />
Ripped away from brother’s side.<br />
Lost among the misty art –<br />
Swamped upon by Death’s harsh tide.</p>

<p>The eldest brother – vision blurred,<br />
Stumbles in the frantic scene.<br />
He screams and shouts, his words are slurred,<br />
His sibling – nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Surrounding fear and cruel despair<br />
Flood the eldest brother’s state.<br />
Torture would not close compare,<br />
For now he knows his brother’s fate.</p>

<p>Crumpled in a blood stained heap<br />
The younger twin lies still.<br />
Plunged into an endless sleep –<br />
Another pointless kill.</p>

<p>Staring shocked with disbelief,<br />
He crumbles to his knees.<br />
The eldest brother, filled with grief<br />
Curses at his thieves.</p>

<p>His blood-smeared face, from those unknown,<br />
Forms a sight of hate and sorrow.<br />
For he has lost a man well-known –<br />
A love, you cannot borrow.</p>

<p>A sudden sharp of dreadful pain,<br />
Forces through the live twin’s back.<br />
He looks to see that he’s been slain<br />
And suddenly, his words turn black.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The injured and strident moans<br />
Wake him from his slumber.<br />
The eldest brother, all alone<br />
Yet lives another number.</p>

<p>His shaky hands, reach for his chest<br />
In which he finds a rigid weal.<br />
The foul and ugly manifest<br />
Reminds him of his tortured Hell.</p>

<p>Images flicker through his mind<br />
A cruel, despiteful, nightmare crimson.<br />
His horrors are not left behind,<br />
An everlasting, bitter prison.</p>

<p>He swiftly lifts his aching build<br />
And stares with shaken eyes.<br />
The mirror shows an image killed;<br />
His brother, in disguise...</p>

<p>On behalf of Year 6 students at Trinity College, we would like to thank you for touring us and showing us around the War Memorial. We really enjoyed the statues, the movie and the stuffed horse, all these things had stories about war heroes.</p>

<p>We remember when we saw all the huge aircraft and we saw the light show, the gift shop was full of interesting things.</p>

<p>We had great fun doing all the activities and looking at all the old features and we could touch so many different things such as hard tack and all different relics.</p>

<p>Kind Regards,<br />
Vicke, Ava, and Danielle, Year 6 students<br />

<p>The sky cries, all day it has cried<br />
The cold sodden hearts and muddy earth are untouched<br />
For not one but many have just died<br />
And no goal has been reached.</p>

<p>Their precious lives lost, a generation wasted<br />
Carried away by the wind and mustard gas<br />
Erased from the earth by shells and false hatred<br />
Their world razed while they watch in a trench pass.</p>

<p>Eating, sleeping and walking in their graves<br />
Their Generals commanding kilometres away<br />
Fighting against reason and living worse than slaves<br />
Families praying the telegram never reaches their doorways.</p>

<p>The sky shrieks for the tortured men and cries<br />
For one stone pillar cannot replace the millions of stolen lives.</p>

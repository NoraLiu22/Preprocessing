<tr><td>Brain Awareness Week (BAW) is a time for neuroscientists to get
out of the
lab and to interact with the public.  The Internet is a powerful resource
that can be used to communicate with the public during BAW and to provide
information related to BAW activities. This article outlines several ways
that the Internet can be used to plan, coordinate and promote your BAW
program.</td></tr></table></center><P>

<h3>1. Planning BAW Activities</h3> 

<img src = "cnllogo.gif" align=right width="200" height="160" hspace=20>
What is the best way to talk to public? How do you speak to K-12 students,
teachers and the media?  What activities make a successful BAW program?  
What have other groups and organizations tried?  These questions and
others like them are answered on various web sites.  For example, the <a
href = "http://www.sfn.org/">Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Public 
Education and Communication Committee</a> has compiled <a 
href="http://www.sfn.org/nerve">several reports</a> to 
assist neuroscientists who venture into K-12 classrooms.<p>

The SFN also has advice for <a href = "http://www.sfn.org/BAW/">dealing
with the media</a>.  It is a good idea to review this information if you
will be talking to TV, radio or newspaper reporters during BAW.<P>

Some neuroscientists have trouble deciding what to do during BAW, others
want to try something new each year.  Web sites that contain ideas,
activities and demonstrations appropriate for a variety of audiences
include:<P>

<ul><li><a href = "http://www.dana.org/brainweek/">Dana Alliance for Brain
Initiatives BAW web site</A> - the Dana Alliance has a calendar of BAW
activities that take place around the world.  This site lists the BAW
events that other groups have organized.  A few puzzles for classroom use
are also available to download.<p>

<li><a href = "http://www.sfn.org/BAW/">Society for Neuroscience BAW web
site</A> - the Society for Neuroscience also maintains a calendar of BAW
events and has several camera-ready posters and logos available to
download.<p> <img src = "./gif/mal.jpg" width="123" height="200"
align=right hspace=20>

<li><a href =
"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html">Neuroscience for
Kids</A> - a resource designed primarily for K-12 students and teachers,
Neuroscience for Kids is a content-rich web site with many activities,
demonstrations and experiments for the classroom. You can <a href =
"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/works.html">download worksheets,
puzzles, bookmarks and games</A> and browse through <a href =
"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/experi.html">many activities</A>
that can be used during visits to K-12 classrooms.<p>

<li><a href = "http://www.aan.com">American Academy of Neurology (AAN)
</A> - the AAN Subcommittee for Education of Non-neurologists (SENN) has
developed a wonderful collection of activities for K-6 students. Some
materials are now available and complete lesson plans will soon be
available through a new SENN web site.<P>

</ul><p>

<h3>2. Promoting BAW Activities</h3> 

<ul><Li><h4>E-mail</h4><p> 

<ul><li>Send invitations<BR>
Notify local schools, sponsors and university administrators about your
BAW
activities by sending an invitation by e-mail.  Such an invitation is
faster and less expensive than using the postal service.  On the other
hand, e-mail is considered by many to be more informal and less personal
than a letter.  Therefore, you should consider sending a hard copy, formal
invitation to certain individuals.<p>

<img src = "./gif/bawmail.gif" width="150" height="95" align=right
hspace=20>


<LI>Contact local media<BR> Invitations to your BAW events can be sent
to local television, radio and print media via e-mail.  Some television
and radio stations and newspapers will want a press release detailing your
activities.  This can also be distributed through e-mail. <P>

<li>Maintain contact with students, teachers and other members of the
public<br>Notify people with information about your BAW program, driving
instructions or changes to your program.  This may be feasible only for
those BAW programs with a small number of participants, although a
"listserv" may be set up to distribute e-mail to a large number of
people.</ul><P>

<li><h4>Your Own BAW Web Site</h4><p>

Creating a web site is not difficult.  You may already have your own web
site or your department or organization may be able to assist you in
creating a new one.  The ease with which the public can access the
Internet makes the use of web sites especially valuable in promoting your
BAW program.  Your web site can be used to:<P>

<ul><li>Alert the Public<BR> Many organizations have lectures, laboratory
tours and open houses during BAW.  To alert the public to such events,
organizations can create a web site describing the events.  Information on
the site should include the title/description, location and time of the
event, sponsors, and contact information (e.g., e-mail address and phone
number of BAW organizers).  This information is essential for students and
teachers who may want to attend your event.  The site should be posted as
soon as possible so people can make plans far in advance.<p>

Posters and flyers can be located on your BAW web site for easy
distribution to many people.  These posters could contain information
about the time, place, and title of BAW lectures.  Encourage people 
to download the posters and to place them on bulletin boards or doors to
advertise your events. <P>
 
Your web site can also be used to notify people around the world about BAW
activities located in other cities.  By providing links to other BAW
sites, you will be promoting BAW on a large scale.  You can also share the
URL (web site address) of your site with colleagues at other institutions.  
In exchange for promoting your site on their home page, you agree
to link to their page on your home site.  In other words,<p>

<img src = "./gif/bawcomp.gif" width="171" height="154" align=right
hspace=20>


<Center><i><font color=blue size="+1"><strong>"You link to my site; I will
link to
your
site."</strong></font></i></center><P>

<li>Invite the Public<BR> Often public demand for BAW events exceeds an
organization's ability to accommodate everyone.  For these popular events,
an organization may have to restrict participation to a limited number of
people.  It is possible to create a web site with an electronic
"invitation" or application to gauge public interest for a particular BAW
event.  Such an electronic invitation can be in the form of an online
application that can be returned to event organizers via e-mail or an
offline application that people can print out and return to event
organizers by regular mail. <P>

<li>Provide Information and Materials<BR> If people must travel to your
institution for BAW activities, they will need driving directions, parking
instructions, and building/room information.  Rather than mailing this
information, you can post this information on your web site.  You can even
include maps on your web site for people coming by car or bus. Maps can
also be used to help people find buildings and rooms in which BAW events
will take place.<P>

Some people who come to your program may have other questions.  It is
always a good idea to include an e-mail address of a contact person on all
web sites, posters, newsletters, and flyers that will be distributed to
the public.  With the widespread use of e-mail, many inquiries about your
BAW program can be answered at your own convenience.  Of course, a
telephone number of a contact person should be included for those
individuals without e-mail access.<P>

Because many people may not be able to attend your BAW program and you may
not be able to accommodate everyone who is interested in attending , it is
still possible for you to provide these people with BAW materials that you
develop.  For example, you can create neuroscience-related activities,
games or lesson plans for teachers who are unable to come to your events.  
Promotional items, such as bookmarks, with your institution?s BAW logo can
be distributed via web sites.  If you do not have any materials to share
via the web, you can always direct people to web resources with such
material.  Web sites with this type of material include:<p>

<ul><li><a href =
"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/works.html">Worksheets, puzzles,
bookmarks, games</A> from <a href =
"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html">Neuroscience for
Kids</A>

<li><a href = "http://www.dana.org/brainweek/">Puzzles and promotional
items</A> from the <a href = "http://www.dana.org/">Dana Alliance for
Brain Initiatives</A></ul><p>

<LI>Reward Sponsors<BR> 

University and corporate support of BAW is
essential to the development and maintenance of innovative BAW
activities.  
Of course, fund raising is one of the most difficult aspects of developing
outreach activities.  One way to recruit potential sponsors is by
rewarding them for their participation.  The exposure that sponsors 
receive by having their name on all print material and web sites is often
sufficient incentive for sponsorship.  Furthermore, providing potential
sponsors with estimates of the number of people who will be exposed to
materials with their names may convince them to support your projects.

<p>One strategy utilized by commercial web sites is a fee for posting
sponsor banners or logos.  Although I have never used this approach, some
organizations and businesses may be more willing to contribute to your BAW
activities if they know exactly what they will receive in return for their
sponsorship.  A fee schedule for banners of specific sizes for a specific
time period may appeal to these potential sponsors. Make sure that your
university or organization permits this type of "advertising" on web sites
before using this method.</ul> </ul><P>

<h3>1. Maintain your web site</h3>
Your BAW web site should have current
information about the time, place, and other details about your events. 
Last minute room changes or additional sponsors can be added to the site
if necessary. <P>

<h3>2. Answer questions from the public</h3> Many people may use e-mail to
ask questions about your BAW activities. These questions may focus on the
suitability of your program for different age groups, the cost (if any) of
the activities, and the location of various events.  It is best to have
someone available to answer these question promptly.<p>

<table width=100% bgcolor="#ffffcc"><tr><td><h2><font
color="#ff0000">After BAW</font></h2></td></tr></table>

<h3>1. Follow up with people who attended your program</h3> Ask attendees
to send you e-mail with feedback concerning their experiences during BAW.  
This information should be used to improve your next BAW program.<P>

<img src = "./gif/bawkid3.jpg" width="246" height="225" align=right
hspace=20>

<h3>2. Use the BAW web site to describe your successful BAW</h3>
Photographs, student artwork, and comments can be used to highlight
features of your BAW program.  The <a href = "baw.html">BAW Open House</a>
at the University of Washington is a good example of how this can be
accomplished. <P>

<h3>3. Reward sponsors and recruit new ones</h3>  The time after BAW is an
additional 
opportunity to reward your sponsors with continued acknowledgment of their
support.  In addition to hard copy thank-you letters to your sponsors, you
may decide to keep banners and logos that refer to these organizations and
companies.  You may want their support next year.  In the months after
BAW, you may want to collect data concerning the number of visits your BAW
web site received.  These data may provide you with ammunition to approach
these sponsors again and to secure new funding from other sources.

The Internet is filled with creative ideas for you to use during BAW.  
Web sites with activities and experiments to bring to classrooms, ideas
for lectures, and past BAW exhibits can be viewed.  The Internet also has
the potential to promote your BAW to a wide audience. Your BAW program
will be greatly enhanced by increased public awareness of your activities
and increased sponsorship by using web sites and e-mail.<p>

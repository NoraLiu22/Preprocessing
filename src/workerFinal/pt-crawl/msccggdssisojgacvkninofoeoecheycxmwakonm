    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC"><p>Near the close of  the 15th century, the population of Europe was hit by what seemed to be a fearsome new plague.&nbsp; The illness covered its victims with painful sores and left some horribly disfigured.&nbsp; It appeared suddenly following France's invasion of Italy in 1494.&nbsp; Afflicted French soldiers called it the "Neapolitan" disease.&nbsp; Italians, meanwhile, blamed the invaders and dubbed the affliction the "French" disease. </p>
      <p>Some modern epidemiologists have suggested that this supposedly &quot;new&quot; disease  (known today as syphilis) may have existed in Europe prior to that time.&nbsp; Perhaps its presence escaped notice because its symptoms mimic those of diseases like leprosy, or because the numbers of individuals affected by it were too few and far between until living conditions set the stage for a wide-spread outbreak.
	  </p>
      <p>Others have suggested the disease's sudden appearance was the consequence of a mutation in the microbe responsible for yaws, a related, but far less virulent disease.&nbsp; Yaws is a tropical disease unknown in Europe's harsher climate.&nbsp; Perhaps a genetic variation, one which facilitated the microbe's successful adaptation to the warm moist environment surrounding clothed humans' genitalia, enabled it  to  survive and thrive in these cooler conditions.</p>
      <p>The appearance of syphilis in Europe at this time is also coincident with the first intimate contact with New World natives whose immune systems had long since adapted to the disease.&nbsp; Explorers returning to the Old World may have unwittingly brought home the tiny spirochete, <em>treponema pallidum</em>, responsible for syphilis as an unwelcome microbial souvenir. </p></td>

<blockquote>As [Ferdinand and Isabella] dwelt in fair and stately show,...
<br>There came forth from God a gen'ral malison,
<br>That fell on all the land, each province and nation,
<br>All countries that we know, or where we penetrate.
<br>
<strong>It was a pestilence ne'er to be found at all
<br>
In verse or in prose, in science or in story,
<br>
So evil and perverse and cruel past control,
<br>
Exceeding contagious, and in filth so prodigal,</strong><br>So strong to hold its own, there is little got of glory....
<p>Theologians pretend the cause of it doth lie
<br>In certain new-found sins that are rife in Christendom.
<br>
Oh! Providence divine, oh! judgment from on high!
<br>Which ever has in store a perfect penalty.
<br>Howe'er we go astray, our folly is brought home....
<p>But some [theologians] to luxury, and all of wanton sense,
<br>To which the world is giv'n do refer the same.
<br>
<strong>The ailment, say they, is a just and proper sentence;
<br>
According to the sin so is the repentance,
<br>
And the part that suffers most is the part most to blame....</strong></blockquote></td>

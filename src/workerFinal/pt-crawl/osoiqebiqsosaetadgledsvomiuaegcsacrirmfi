        instruction. They also prepare primers and train teachers
        to show children and adults how to read in their own
        language.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Regarding the educational system of
        rural Chad, let us look at the example of the Guéra
        villages. The learning of new knowledge permits people to
        acquire helpful skills, which alone is a source of
        development. Education helps accomplish all this. The Bon
        Goula people, for example, are interested in education,
        but the weak educational structure in the region is the
        reason why young people of the region do not believe they
        need to go to school. However, there is in the region two
        spontaneous schools run by untrained teachers who wish to
        help their little brothers and sisters, the hope of
        tomorrow. These two spontaneous schools are in Bone I and
        Ibre.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Further east, there is a
        spontaneous school in Koya (C.P I to C.P. II) with 33
        students, a school in Koutoutou (full cycle), and a
        school in Daguéla (C.P. I to C.M. I). These schools
        receive students from their own village as well as those
        from surrounding villages. Five trained instructors and a
        few volunteer teachers run these schools. The students,
        given the nature of spontaneous schools, leave their
        villages to go study elsewhere, especially in Melfi, Sarh
        or N'Djaména. The formation of spontaneous schools in
        Chadian villages demonstrates the strong desire parents
        have to see that their children have the opportunity to
        go to school.</font></p>

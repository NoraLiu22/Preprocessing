This October 22nd, return to the rapture of savoring a thimble of grape-flavored aspirin while tucked inside a blanket cocoon. The chills and head throb can’t be ignored, true, but COCOJOEY’S WORLD is a day off school with a new PSX disc in one hand and a controller palmed in the other.

COCOJOEY’S exuberant debut thrums like a rhythm game RPG OST from a parallel universe: present-day dilemmas as dungeon-crawl boss battles, and real life joy as a race across candy-coated synth panoramas. This is a more inviting way to face existential pain – not a facile attempt at escape from it.

Simultaneously refined and relatable, the lyric sheets here loop seamlessly between the reflective and the aspirational. Swallowed together, these tracks present a character creator screen ready to transmute outer darkness into inner liberation, boosting any listener as their own low-poly main character in pursuit of a most elusive level-up: acceptance.

-

COCOJOEY makes happy hyper-bitpop wiisportscore fusion-type breakbeats inspired by cats, PSX-era pause menus, and ontological crises. A classically-trained pianist and in-demand composer/producer, COCOJOEY has &amp;quot;Symphony Center” on the resume, but for this project, an uncommon command of harmony and orchestration are never in danger of eclipsing an ebullient sonic experience.

been waiting for the day to be out and about\nBut I sink into the wall, if you notice me at all\nI’ll pretend I didn’t see you looking at me\nCuz I’m staring at the floor, probably heading out the door\nIn a minute I’ll be going home\nClosing out my tab, signing out for now, the line and goodbye\n\nWhy did I bother going out if I’m an anxious mess?\nAlthough I was inspired by the music that I heard…\nLet me sing to my phone voice memo\nSo I remember when I’m home\n\nBut I’m stuck!!\nA purgatory to find parking, I circle the block\nSlice of life, this is how it is\nBehind Joey’s eyes it’s a farce\nJust allergies and nosebleeds\nNow suddenly I’m agoraphobic boy\nTherefore, my quest: escape from this catacomb\nBefore I succumb alone to the rot\n\nBack to staring at the wall, backlit colors of the fall\nOn the screen my character’s tall, I should stop for now\nIn a couple days ahead, I’ll be in a hospital bed\nA traveler with a lantern will explore my cave\nWill the battle be inane? Is it cancer or inflame?\nI don’t know, I’m asleep (it’s the best that I’ve got)\nDream of melodies, and the music’s fucking cringe\nbut I’ll laugh\n\nWake up, you’re in my dream\nThe sound of a universe imagining\nIf you are me, and I am you\nWe are the god who’s really true\nSo bide your time, but witness this day\nWe’re going back home soon anyway…\n\nBut I’m stuck!! A purgatory to find purpose, I click in the note\nSlice of life, this is how it is\nBehind everybody’s eyes it’s a farce\nJust allergies and nosebleeds\nNow suddenly I’m in a tower in the void\nTherefore, our quest: escape from this catacomb\nBefore we succumb alone to the rot"}},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://cocojoey.bandcamp.com/track/cocojoeys-cave"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"item":{"@type":"MusicRecording","@id":"https://cocojoey.bandcamp.com/track/middle-school-black-metal-new-recording-706","additionalProperty":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"track_id","value":2260836570},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"license_name","value":"all_rights_reserved"}],"name":"middle school black metal / New Recording 706","duration":"P00H00M19S","copyrightNotice":"All Rights Reserved","mainEntityOfPage":"https://cocojoey.bandcamp.com/track/middle-school-black-metal-new-recording-706"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":5,"item":{"@type":"MusicRecording","@id":"https://cocojoey.bandcamp.com/track/toxic-obstruction","additionalProperty":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"track_id","value":668513897},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"license_name","value":"all_rights_reserved"}],"name":"TOXIC OBSTRUCTION","duration":"P00H03M32S","copyrightNotice":"All Rights Reserved","recordingOf":{"@type":"MusicComposition","lyrics":{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Liberate amygdala (your toxic obstruction)\nTake away my big holdup (your toxic obstruction)\nDid I find enjoyment here?

The chills and head throb can’t be ignored, true, but COCOJOEY’S WORLD is a day off school with a new PSX disc in one hand and a controller palmed in the other.\r\n\r\nCOCOJOEY’S exuberant debut thrums like a rhythm game RPG OST from a parallel universe: present-day dilemmas as dungeon-crawl boss battles, and real life joy as a race across candy-coated synth panoramas. This is a more inviting way to face existential pain – not a facile attempt at escape from it.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously refined and relatable, the lyric sheets here loop seamlessly between the reflective and the aspirational. Swallowed together, these tracks present a character creator screen ready to transmute outer darkness into inner liberation, boosting any listener as their own low-poly main character in pursuit of a most elusive level-up: acceptance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCOCOJOEY makes happy hyper-bitpop wiisportscore fusion-type breakbeats inspired by cats, PSX-era pause menus, and ontological crises. A classically-trained pianist and in-demand composer/producer, COCOJOEY has \"Symphony Center” on the resume, but for this project, an uncommon command of harmony and orchestration are never in danger of eclipsing an ebullient sonic experience.\r\n\r\nBlurb by Doyle Armbrust","creditText":"All music performed, produced, and mixed by Joey Meland\r\nMixing consultation from Noam

The chills and head throb can’t be ignored, true, but COCOJOEY’S WORLD is a day off school with a new PSX disc in one hand and a controller palmed in the other.\r\n\r\nCOCOJOEY’S exuberant debut thrums like a rhythm game RPG OST from a parallel universe: present-day dilemmas as dungeon-crawl boss battles, and real life joy as a race across candy-coated synth panoramas. This is a more inviting way to face existential pain – not a facile attempt at escape from it.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously refined and relatable, the lyric sheets here loop seamlessly between the reflective and the aspirational. Swallowed together, these tracks present a character creator screen ready to transmute outer darkness into inner liberation, boosting any listener as their own low-poly main character in pursuit of a most elusive level-up: acceptance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCOCOJOEY makes happy hyper-bitpop wiisportscore fusion-type breakbeats inspired by cats, PSX-era pause menus, and ontological crises. A classically-trained pianist and in-demand composer/producer, COCOJOEY has \&quot;Symphony Center” on the resume, but for this project, an uncommon command of harmony and orchestration are never in danger of eclipsing an ebullient sonic experience.\r\n\r\nBlurb by Doyle Armbrust&quot;,&quot;credits&quot;:&quot;All music performed, produced, and mixed by Joey Meland\r\nMixing consultation from

                    <div>A body in a space, it’s a familiar place
I’ve been waiting for the day to be out and about
But I sink into the wall, if you notice me at all
I’ll pretend I didn’t see you looking at me
Cuz I’m staring at the floor, probably heading out the door
In a minute I’ll be going home
Closing out my tab, signing out for now, the line and goodbye

Why did I bother going out if I’m an anxious mess?
Although I was inspired by the music that I heard…
Let me sing to my phone voice memo
So I remember when I’m home

But I’m stuck!!
A purgatory to find parking, I circle the block
Slice of life, this is how it is
Behind Joey’s eyes it’s a farce
Just allergies and nosebleeds
Now suddenly I’m agoraphobic boy
Therefore, my quest: escape from this catacomb
Before I succumb alone to the rot

Back to staring at the wall, backlit colors of the fall
On the screen my character’s tall, I should stop for now
In a couple days ahead, I’ll be in a hospital bed
A traveler with a lantern will explore my cave
Will the battle be inane? Is it cancer or inflame?
I don’t know, I’m asleep (it’s the best that I’ve got)
Dream of melodies, and the music’s fucking cringe
but I’ll laugh

Wake up, you’re in my dream
The sound of a universe imagining
If you are me, and I am you
We are the god who’s really true
So bide your time, but witness this day
We’re going back home soon anyway…

But I’m stuck!! A purgatory to find purpose, I click in the note
Slice of life, this is how it is
Behind everybody’s eyes it’s a farce
Just allergies and nosebleeds
Now suddenly I’m in a tower in the void
Therefore, our quest: escape from this catacomb
Before we succumb alone to the rot</div>

Walk around - an empty shell
Do I think I’m uniquely suited here?
Take it around a living hell
Why don’t I just take a trip?

Take it off / take it out / it’s just.
gotta get it before I die
if I get / wanna quit / I’m fit

sign me up / pick me up / I’m just

I’m staring at the wall feeling lazy
I want to talk about it with you
I guess I’ve got this feeling going crazy!

I’m just waiting, gonna say the same thing
I’m a play thing, up to take it down down
Yeah, you know it’s true

I’m so down low sad, but I can keep a secret
I’m so down low sad, but you know I’m non-judgmental

I got got
Hey so while you’re here could I just open up and put out what I’m thinking?
I got got
I honestly can’t tell if I just wanna cry or stay until I’m shrinking

Wait for now
Am I strong enough to weather the storm?

(Keep a secret)

Hey ummm if you wanna leave you’re welcome
Here’s your coat, the door, please have a good one!
I hope that when we meet again, I’ll be brave
But it’s okay cause you’re a phantom!!

I’m just waiting, gonna say the same thing
I’m a play thing, up to take it down down
Yeah, you know it’s true

Wait for now

Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed.
Press 0 to break free”

“We appreciate your patience.
Your current wait time is: one lifetime”

Swim alone through time, I’m down with it
Looking for another body, I’m down with it
And if you’re feeling alright, I’m down with it
Get it up in the void and I’m already slit
Sixth extinction, and my mind’s in it
Opportunity knocks in stars with it
Silence of eternity, chasing it
And we’ll be feeling pretty fine encased in it

I’m a god
Fuck it up ‘midst a superposition
La da di da da da da da da
I spit in the ripple of my desire
Open fire!!!

I want it, I’m all ready!!
I want it, so come and get me!!
Consume me into entropy (x2)

If we met outside
The dust in my mouth would make you cry
I’d sit and wait for you there
I thought we’d have a moment to spare

Come fly away, ‘cross the milky milky way
Drop down underground, past the filth of yesterday
I soak in the flame: life’s roguey roguey game
Let’s run, become one, feel it at the center (and I’ll..)
…
So I’m here all night
And everything’s alright
Waiting on the sound of the light
I don’t know if there’s any other lifeform calling
In a sound of light (looking for another body, i’m down with it)
Tearing everything down and build it right (get it up in the void and i’m already slit)
And there isn’t another night (opportunity knocks in stars with it)
or is there any other lifeform?

If we met outside
The dust in my mouth would make you cry
I’d sit and wait for you there
I thought we’d have a moment to spare (x2)</div>

Making it making it make it better for the found sound
Taking it taking it take the letter from the pain down (x2)

Staring at the ceiling and it’s
3AM and I’m still conscious
Curled up in a bed of tension
I don’t even know the reason

Fall down, day in a blank apartment
Couchlocked, passing the time away
Lonely day in a frozen city
Mindstate keeping the hounds at bay

Making it making it make it better for the found sound

Staring at the ceiling and it’s

Toss and turn, I’m lacking
Rapid eye, it’s time but
I can’t help, I’m snacking
Might as well, I’m jacked in

Couchlocked, passing the time away

In love but aware
It might just take another one
To make the water hotter!
There are so many lands to discover
We could swim alone or together
I’m chill, there ain’t an ounce of pressure
Let’s take our time forever

Backstroke to find a shore
I’ve tread water here before
Front crawl, I’m on all fours
This is Cocojoey lore

Sit back and watch a movie
I think that you’re a cutie
but I’m going off deep endy
I might just need a friendy
So with anticipation
I can’t commence the operation
Easier to float in dissociation
So far in this well that I’m seven-days-in’

In the city, it can get a little lonely
Maybe better with a cat, but my lease and allergies…so I
Hold my breath, kick all night
Swim toward another timeline
Make waves inside my mind
Drown in the ebb of blocktime

It’s lonely inside, underwater and out of sightline
Voice in my head going live
“While it’s lonely inside, you can turn this tread into a swan dive”
Furever home I will provide

“Woah! Look up there, it’s Coco the cat!!! I couldn’t be happier to be with my..”

Best friend, in another life I knew my
Best friend, now we reunite, I have my
Best friend, anxiety’s alright, when I’m with my
Best friend, cuddle up all night
You know my… (repeat)</div>

To give another care
Find another idol
There’s someone out there

Time
The life there out to live
Is stuck in indecision
The waiting gets to me

(all in) Time
The raindrop turned to ash
I thought I heard you sleeping
A face lit by a phone

(all in) Time
We all accept defeat
A lifer’s work repeated
But there’s something out there

Wake up in a scare (we’re ephemeral anyway)
Walk it down the stairs (we’re ephemeral anyway)
Take it out with the spares

Time
To end is to begin
The failure’s in the answer
It’s never late to care

(all in) Time
I’d walk you to the lake
We’d take a new direction
The water’s getting clear

Wake up in a scare (we’re ephemeral anyway)
Walk it down the stairs (we’re ephemeral anyway)
Take it out with the spares (we’re ephemeral anyway)
Will myself to care (we’re ephemeral anyway)
We’re ephemeral anyway

“I wanted to tell you that there’s nowhere to go, there’s nothing to do. As I read my own words back to me, I realized I can be simply here: looking through the trees, witnessing myself in the fox by the river. There’s nothing left to find”

Wait for now
Be patient enough to weather the storm
Wait for now
Even if you’re coasting on for nothing
Wait for now
The pressure’s off, we’re ephemeral anyway
Wait for now
Watch for the love, the thread that makes us better

We hope for everybody
We look in anybody
We long for other bodies
We live in everybody
In seeking astral body
Accept attachment body
We lose collective body
Scatter celestial body
The message opens after
A thread of endless laughter
The ocean’s depth the ladder
We sing form of connector
Instead of seeking rather
Accept collective matter
Aware project distractor
The tick of time goes faster

Next time we walk along
You’ll still be here and you’ll write this song
And wait on the beach watching ourselves float away into the void
In time we all return

Time
To end is to begin

            <div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">This October 22nd, return to the rapture of savoring a thimble of grape-flavored aspirin while tucked inside a blanket cocoon. The chills and head throb can’t be ignored, true, but COCOJOEY’S WORLD is a day off school with a new PSX disc in one hand and a controller palmed in the other.<br>
<br>
COCOJOEY’S exuberant debut thrums like a rhythm game RPG OST from a parallel universe: present-day dilemmas as dungeon-crawl boss battles, and real life joy as a race across candy-coated synth panoramas. This is a more inviting way to face existential pain – not a facile attempt at escape from it.<br>
<br>
Simultaneously refined and relatable, the lyric sheets here loop seamlessly between the reflective and the aspirational. Swallowed together, these tracks present a character creator screen ready to transmute outer darkness into inner liberation, boosting any listener as their own low-poly main character in pursuit of a most elusive level-up: acceptance.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
COCOJOEY makes happy hyper-bitpop wiisportscore fusion-type breakbeats inspired by cats, PSX-era pause menus, and ontological crises. A classically-trained pianist and in-demand composer/producer, COCOJOEY has &quot;Symphony Center” on the resume, but for this project, an uncommon command of harmony and orchestration are never in danger of eclipsing an ebullient sonic experience.<br>

              the Curies' work. In early June 1903 both Curies were invited to 
              London as guests of the prestigious Royal Institution. Since custom 
              ruled out women lecturers, Pierre alone described their work in 
              his &#147;Friday Evening Discourse.&#148; He was careful, however, 
              to describe Marie's crucial role in their collaboration. The audience 
              included representatives of England's social elite and such major 
              scientists as Lord Kelvin. Kelvin showed his respect by sitting 
              next to Marie at the lecture and by hosting a luncheon in Pierre's 
              honor the following day. </font><br>

              difficulty in dressing himself before the talk. His fingers were 
              so covered with sores that he spilled some radium in the hall while 
              demonstrating its properties. Ill health, however, kept neither 
              Curie from noting the value of the jewels worn by the members of 
              English high society they met in the course of the weekend. They 
              amused themselves by estimating the number of fine laboratories 
              they could set up with the proceeds from selling those jewels. </font></p>

            trip from Poland to celebrate Marie's academic triumph. <br>

            Bronya had insisted that the first woman to receive a doctorate in 
            France should acknowledge the special event by wearing a new dress. 
            Characteristically, Marie chose a black dress. Like the navy wedding 
            outfit she had chosen eight years earlier, the new dress could be 
            worn in the lab without fear of stains. </font></td>

              New Zealand-born scientist Ernest Rutherford, who was also actively 
              engaged in research in the new science of radioactivity, was visiting 
              Paris. He had stopped by the Municipal School shed where Marie isolated 
              radium, and at dinner that night he asked Marie how they managed 
              to work in such a place. &#147;You know,&#148; he said, &#147;it

              Some time later Bronya's second child died of tubercular meningitis. 
              And against the backdrop of these specific losses was the fact that 
              Pierre's health continued to deteriorate. Sometimes unbearable pain

The British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII) is  seeking two new Trustees (Click <a  href="https://www.bailii.org/bailii/BAILII_seeks_new_Trustees.pdf">here</a> for PDF of Announcement). BAILII runs a free  online public service that provides access to a vast,  constantly updated set of British and Irish legal materials.

BAILII trustees are  expected to actively support the organisation's activities,  have a knowledge of charitable fundraising, attend the Sir  Henry Brooke Lecture, and meet as a Board three times per year.  BAILII's work supports access to justice, fairness, and  inclusion, and it aims for diversity on its Board to contribute  to good governance and decision-making. Please send expressions  of interest to Ann M. Hale at <a  href="mailto:ann.hale@sas.ac.uk">ann.hale@sas.ac.uk</a> by  midnight (BST) on Wednesday, 1 May 2024.

      <p><em><font size="2">by Diane Hubbard<br>
      </font></em><img src="images/diane_small.jpg" alt="Diane Hubbard" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="106"><font size="2">In painting, sculpture, <em>belles-lettres</em>, and in music, we have all
      witnessed styles fall in and out of favor with irreverence. As I look back on our
      demi-century of harpsichord manufacture I ponder the changes in artistic taste as they
      evolved sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, but never irreversibly.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The artisan industry of musical instrument making was never immune to
      stylistic change. We are most aware of this capriciousness when we consider performance
      practice. In the fifty years of Hubbard activity we have seen &quot;period&quot;
      orchestras ascend from the back rooms of local early music societies to their now
      seemingly permanent position on the world musical stage.</font></p>
      <p><a href="kits/engspin.htm"><img src="images/eng_bent_spinnet.jpg" alt="English Bentside Spinet" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="20" border="0" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="137"></a><font size="2">Within the Hubbard workshop the trickle down effect of stylistic change is
      evident in our order books. Throughout the 50's a French double-manual harpsichord was
      considered a novelty, and English instruments were all the rage. At the very least, one's
      instrument had to look like 18th century English furniture regardless of its inner soul.</font></p>
      <p><img src="images/flemish_single_tiny.jpg" alt="Flemish Single" align="right" vspace="20" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="110"><font size="2">During the 60's, after restoring his own 1584 Moermans
      harpsichord to playing condition and introducing this design to his customers, Frank
      Hubbard's order book was filled with nothing but Flemish instruments. I remember so
      clearly when we met in 1963, Frank was years behind in deliveries of Flemish instruments
      and convinced he would meet his maker before completing them all.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><a href="kits/museum_hemsch.htm"><img src="images/hemsch_drop.jpg" alt="The magnificent Hemsch Harpsichord" align="left" hspace="0" border="0" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="151"></a>In 1966-67
      Frank was invited to establish a restoration workshop for the collection of musical
      instruments at the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris. There he examined
      several new French designs and soon was keen to offer these to his customers.
      Simultaneously, the restoration of the Boston Museum's magnificent Henry Hemsch
      harpsichord (1736?) was underway in our Waltham shop. The timing was propitious. Upon his
      return to the U.S., Frank appealed to those on the waiting list to change their Flemish
      orders to the &quot;new&quot; French design. Some did, some didn't, but the rest is
      history. French doubles proliferated.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">By the time Hendrik Broekman returned to the Hubbard shop after Frank's
      death in 1976, the 18th century French double had become the most ubiquitous design for
      modern copies used on the concert stage and in the living room. It was now Hendrik's turn
      to wax wistful about stimulating orders for German and English instruments so that we
      could hear the sonorities Bach and Handel might have heard when they sat down for the
      first time at a new instrument by a native maker.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><a href="kits/germdbl.htm"><img src="images/german_double_smrt.jpg" alt="German Double Harpsichord" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="21" border="0" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="187"></a>If the
      concept of the Hubbard &amp; Broekman German double was born in that instant it was more
      than a decade before the first German harpsichord left the workshop in 1989. You may
      remember that during the 60's to wish for a large German style harpsichord was considered
      poor taste. Clearly, today our outlook has changed. We are very enthusiastic about our
      Hass instruments with their exceptional brilliance and their ability to execute the
      clearest articulations. So much so that Hendrik, not one to be taken in by fads, has
      abandoned his Franco/Flemish double and is building himself a new love . . . a magnificent
      Hass. Fickle? Perhaps, but I don't believe so.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Remarkably, we have endured 50 years in this field. How it will evolve
      in the next millennium is unpredictable. The only sure thing is that artistic taste and
      styles will continue to change and that Hubbard Harpsichords will be there acting in the
      dual role of preserver of the past and innovator for the future.</font></p>

        <p>National parks are among the world's natural jewels. They represent the power of Canada's natural environment
            which has shaped not only the geography of this country, but also the course of its history and the
            experiences of the people who live and travel here.</p>
        <p>National parks are established to protect and present outstanding representative examples of natural
            landscapes and phenomena that occur in each of Canada's unique natural regions, as identified in the
            National Parks System Plan. When establishing new parks, other considerations include the area&rsquo;s
            ecological connectivity with other regions and whether the area is represented or underrepresented within
            the system plan.</p>
        <p>These wild places, located in every province and territory, range from mountains and plains, to boreal
            forests and tundra, to lakes and glaciers, and beyond. National parks protect the habitats, wildlife, and
            ecosystem diversity representative of these natural regions.</p>
        <p>National parks are located on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts, across the interior mountains, plains
            and Great Lakes. They range in size from 14 km2 (Georgian Bay Islands National Park of Canada) to almost
            45,000 km2 (Wood Buffalo National Park of Canada). And they include world-renowned names such as Banff and
            Jasper, as well as more recently established Ivvavik and Vuntut.</p>
        <p>Parks Canada is responsible for both protecting the ecosystems of these magnificent natural areas and
            managing them for visitors to understand, appreciate, and enjoy in a way that doesn't compromise their
            integrity.</p>

        <p>The breathtaking scenery and natural surroundings of national parks provide the perfect setting for tuning
            into nature, respecting it, and pledging to protect it. Each national park is a haven for the human spirit.
        </p>
        <p>National parks tell the stories of the natural beginnings of these lands--mountains forming, lakes emerging,
            rivers running, forests growing, glaciers moving, grasslands evolving. They reveal ongoing natural
            processes--floods, fires and the migration of species. They provide opportunities to connect with nature,
            people and the events that define the peoples of these lands.</p>
        <p>Visitors can paddle down rivers flowing through canyons carved over thousands of years, observe birds as they
            rest in their travels along traditional migration routes, walk through vibrant young forests transformed by
            fire. These are unforgettable experiences, made all the more memorable by the rich experiences Parks Canada
            offers.</p>

<h4>Additional considerations</h4>
<p>When evaluating a new area as a candidate site, a range of factors are examined, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>areas of cultural significance</li>
    <li>underrepresented natural regions in the system</li>
    <li>biodiversity and ecological processes</li>
    <li>landscape connectivity</li>
    <li>support of Indigenous communities and governments</li>
    <li>support of any relevant provincial or territorial governments</li>
</ul>

                    <p>This is a map of the country of Canada, divided into provinces, territories, and natural regions. The general purpose
                        of this map is to identify the 39 terrestrial regions of Canada including whether or not they are presently
                        represented by a national park or national park reserve. </p>
                    <p>The map contains a legend in the top left corner, another legend in the top right corner, and a 0 to 1200 kilometre
                        scale in the bottom right. The year 2022 is indicated outside the bottom right corner while the Parks Canada
                        government of Canada logo is positioned in bottom left.</p>
                    <p>A green line encircles the entire country of Canada on land and in Canadian waters, indicating the country’s
                        established marine and terrestrial boundaries. This line also separates Canada from neighbouring countries, the
                        United States and Greenland, and also separates Canadian waters from international waters. International waters are
                        found west of British Columbia; north of Yukon Territory; north-west of the North West Territories; north-east and
                        east of Nunavut; north and north-east of Labrador; north east and east of Newfoundland; and east of Nova Scotia.</p>
                    <p>This same green line is used to divide Canada into 39 distinct terrestrial regions. These boundaries range in scale
                        and may include parts of one or more provinces and territories. Within each of these 39 boundaries is a number,
                        listed from 1 to 39. On the legend in top right hand corner, these numbers are also listed, corresponding to the
                        unique name for each region. </p>
                    <p>Each terrestrial region is also colour coded to indicate that region’s current level of representation within the
                        National Parks System Plan. The corresponding legend in the top left hand corner of the map indicates that the
                        regions appear in one of beige, light brown, or light green colours. Green indicates that the region is represented
                        within the current National Parks System Plan. Brown indicates that the region is underrepresented. Beige indicates
                        that the region is not represented within the System Plan. </p>
                    <p>This same legend also indicates that dark green forms appears on the map in places where there are existing national
                        parks or national park reserves. This dark green appears as small green circles for smaller parks or larger shapes

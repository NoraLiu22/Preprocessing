<H1 align="center">&quot;Validity&quot; Indices for IPIP Measures</h1>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>This is a most controversial topic, so be warned! 
  Most inventory developers assume that these are necessary. BUT, they may well 
  be wrong: See Piedmont, et al. (2000), Johnson (2005), and Dudley, et al. (2005).</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">One can easily develop one's 
  own validity indices after selecting a particular set of IPIP 
  scales of interest. The validity indices that one might consider include: 
  </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">(a) OVERUSE OF THE SAME RESPONSE OPTION: For 
  each subject, count the number of responses for each option, including no response, 
  across the total set of items administered. After examining the resulting distribution 
  for each response option, one may want to exclude subjects with too many responses 
  of the same kind--particularly those who omit many responses. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">(b) COMMONALITY VERSUS DEVIANCY: Select the 
  items with the most extreme response splits, half in each direction, and score 
  each subject's responses on a total deviancy scale. After examining the distribution 
  of subjects' deviancy scores, one may elect to exclude subjects whose deviancy 
  scores are much like those from random responders. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">(c) SEMANTIC INCONSISTENCY: Intercorrelate all 
  of the items across the total sample, and select pairs with high positive and 
  with high negative correlations to be used as indices of synonym consistency 
  and of antonym consistency. For each subject, compute the correlation between 
  his/her responses across each of the two sets of pairs, including each pair 
  twice, once in each order (AB and BA). After examining the bivariate frequency 
  distribution of these two indices of semantic consistency, one may elect to 
  exclude subjects who look like quasi-random responders. BUT, see Costa and McCrae 
  (1997) and, especially, Kurtz and Parrish (2001). </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">(d) SOCIAL DESIRABILITY: Compute the mean response 
  for each item across the total sample of subjects, and then correlate each subject's 
  responses with those item means across the total set of items. After examining 
  the distribution of subjects' social-desirability correlations, one might elect 
  to exclude subjects with negative correlations, near-zero correlations, and/or 
  extraordinarily high correlations. </font></b></p>

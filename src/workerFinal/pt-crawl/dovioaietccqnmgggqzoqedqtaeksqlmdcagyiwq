<h1 align=center>Outdoor Murals of Ottawa Canada</h1>
Outdoor murals can breathe life and character into the uniformity of large urban centers. When
coordinated, they can demarcate distinct communities, even when isolated they show that here,
someone cares. They reduce graffiti in problem areas, they can build
<a href="thingofbeauty.html">community pride</a>. And, they can be a magnet for tourists, as the
small town of <a href="http://www.muraltown.com">Chemainus</a> has shown so dramatically.
<p>
Here are the ones I was able to locate in Ottawa up to 2016. All are painted on, or mounted
on, exterior surfaces and have been done with the permission of the property owner. As much as
possible, all are shown as the artist saw them, with obstructions removed when possible by
perspective control and other techniques.

Although Ottawa's economic engine has been dominated by non-governmental activity for many years,
any attempt to stand out from the crowd is still frowned upon in the best civil service tradition
and hit with bylaw infractions by the dozen. So, until recently outdoor murals were present only
in a few areas where a business improvement association succeeded in applying sufficient political
pressure to defeat the bylaw bureaucrats.
<p>
That antipathy meant that our city played no part in enabling people
to appreciate them, let alone protect or promote them. For example, immediately adjacent to the
magnificent Corso Italia Heritage Mural, there is a city parking lot. Despite this, until the
2009 rebuilding of Via Italia, the city blockaded views of the murals with parking meters and
parking. Many murals in Westboro are similarly obstructed except early Sunday mornings. A superb mural in
Vanier is hidden behind a city-approved patio roof.
What's more, the positive parts of the city's approach are fragmented: artworks that are part of capital projects are
dealt with by one group, Paint it Up! by another, street painting by yet another, underpass
murals by yet yet another, while private murals seem to be recorded by the city only when someone
complains to bylaws...
<p>
Residential murals are still tolerated only on a zero complaints basis, despite Ontario Superior Court
<a href="charter.html">rulings</a> that the federal charter of rights and freedoms requires
municipal regulators to stick to their constitutionally sanctioned responsibilities for health and
safety of their residents and to stay out of aesthetic judgements. Put simply, any 'mark' can be
called a 'sign' in Ottawa, and residential areas aren't allowed them under the city sign bylaws.
Further, anything anywhere may be arbitrarily ruled as 'graffiti' by a city inspector at any time,
even after it has been in place for years, as in the case of the Hot Peppers restaurant
(<a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=495+somerset+w+ottawa+ON">[Map]</a>).
<p>
For the most part I had to find all of the murals shown on my own. I encouraged the city to
separate aesthetic values, art, which is not a proper part of zoning, from commercial signage, a
land use, which is. I hoped for the surrounding community to have some input on murals, in
particular that a mural be permitted if the majority of the surrounding community are in favour of
it, rather than having a tiny number of philistines in control as at present. Sadly,  I found that in
several cases complainers had used this site to locate murals to destroy.
<p>
The destruction of the magnificent 4-storey-high <a href="images/mural93.jpg">Orcas</a> by Shaun McInnis
was the last straw for me. This was an international level work of art. I can never view my city in the same
way again. I stopped this project then.
<p>
Other cities show what is possible when work like Shaun's is supported. One example: a blank wall left
after an adjacent building was demolished to expand a car intersection in Lyon, France. Begun in 1987 with the
active support of the city, with 2 restorations since, here is the incredible result, before and after.

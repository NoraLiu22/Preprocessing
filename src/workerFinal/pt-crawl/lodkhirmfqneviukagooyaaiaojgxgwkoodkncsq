          my name is Sarah and my friend and I had to do a school report on a
          country, so we picked Chad because we wanted to do it on a country a
          lot of people had probably never heard of. I must admit I had never
          heard of Chad before we were assigned to the report. I am really happy
          I chose Chad. By coming to this website, I learned sooo much about
          Chad. It seems like a really cool place and I would love to visit
          there one day. This is a really awesome website. Y'all have so many
          cute things, from tales to coloring pages. In our report, we had to
          make a food from the country that we chose, and we were even more
          happy that we chose Chad because y'all even have recipes! We chose Jus
          de fruit. I sure hope it's good! We are showing our report in front of
          our class tomorrow so pray that we do well. I think that by finding
          this website, we will do really good. Thank you for taking your time
          to do this and may God bless y'all.&quot; - <b>Sarah, Louisiana, USA</b></font></i> </p>

          country! We were right! Chad is a great place to do a project on!
          Thanks to this website, my friend and I have gotten a 100% on our

          <p align="left">There
        are quite a few websites out there with information about
        the geography and politics of Chad. For the average
        research project on Chad, many of your questions will be
        answered at <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html">World
        Factbook</a>. This is the site where WE go when we want
        up-to-the-minute statistical information about Chad.
        Another place to get a good head start on your project is
        to glean all you can from <a
        href="http://www.gksoft.com/govt/en/td.html">Gunnar
        Anzinger's website</a>. The <a
        href="http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/img_Tibesti.html">volcanoes</a>
        of the northern desert of Chad are magnificent, and
        certainly worth the trip while you are &quot;surfing&quot; in our area. </p>
        <p>Here, however, we want to go a step further, and
        invite you to come visit us in our home to learn more
        about us. While you sit with us on our woven straw mat,
        and enjoy a cup of tea with us, we will let you know
        about the symbolism of the <a href="anthem.html">flag of
        Chad</a>, and give you the words of our <a
        href="anthem.html">national anthem</a>. Chadian <a
        href="art.html">art, music</a> and <a
        href="literature.html">literature</a> is perhaps not as
        professionally developed as in other nations, but its
        simplicity and practicality defies world standards. In
        our <a href="culture.html">culture section</a>, we will
        give you a crash course in Chadian culture, as well as
        share the rules to a game or two the children (and
        adults) of Chad enjoy playing. If you would like to learn about the
        athletes of Chad, such as <a href="http://www.tchadbasketball.net/">our
        basketball players</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaltouma_Nadjina">Khaltouma
        Nadjina, our famous sprinter</a>, you can find that information here as
        well.&nbsp; Before you leave, we would
        like to offer you a chance to enjoy some of our favourite <a
        href="cook.html">Chadian recipes</a>. And what visit to
        Chad would be complete without pulling out our <a
        href="photos.html">photo album</a>, to give you a chance
        to stop and enjoy a moment <em>chez nous</em>?</p>

        <td>There are two seasons in Chad: rainy season and dry
        season, the names being obvious as to what the seasons
        mean. Summer in the northern hemisphere is the big rainy
        season in Chad; winter is the small rainy season. Spring
        is the very hot season, autumn the short one. Lots of
        rain means cool weather; no rain makes it up to 104
        degrees Fahrenheit even in the shade.<p>The beauty of this
        part of Chad (from Lake Chad northward) is the desert
        landscape. As you head further north into the Sahara,
        trees become more and more rare. I find it beautiful to
        see a tree growing in the middle of nowhere, because it
        has a taproot to some small amount of moisture
        underground. Trees are very important here, for their
        shade helps people escape the hot sun. The mountains are
        another beauty of Chad, some rising up very suddenly in
        the midst of a flat landscape, sometimes at nearly 45
        degree angles-like a rocky skyscraper in the Sahara.</p>
        <p>Chadians are very friendly people, known for their
        bravery and courage. Many Chadians are Animist, but some
        are Muslim and others are Christian. Animists worship the
        gods of the river, sky, moon, sun, mountains, and offer
        animal sacrifices when one of the spirits gets angry and
        causes disease or calamity to appease them.</p>

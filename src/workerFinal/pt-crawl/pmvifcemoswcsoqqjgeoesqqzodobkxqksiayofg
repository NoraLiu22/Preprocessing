<p>

<p align="left">
As long as there have been authors, there have been people interested in quantifying the impact or performance of the work those authors have created. There are a variety of metrics that were used as proxies of impact long before our modern scholarly communication's ecosystem developed. These measures included things like individual sales, a publication's circulation, the reaction of luminaries, and the support of institutions through researcher promotion and tenure decisions. Scholarly impact began focusing intently on bibliometrics and citation study in the late 1950s with Eugene Garfield's work and the subsequent launch of the Journal Impact Factor (IF), now owned by Thomson Reuters. The challenges with the Impact Factor are well documented and include self-citation, time delay in producing data, and the fact that it is a publication-level metric, not a metric of the author or the article. 
</p>

<p align="left">
As content distribution for scholarship has moved toward online distribution and a greater focus on the individual article, a variety of new metrics have developed and become commonplace in our community. Download counts, through COUNTER statistics, became one important metric, but again, these are primarily journal metrics, not individual item metrics. Additionally, download counting is subject to the same potential challenges as the IF, such as gaming and a focus on popularity over substance.
</p>

<p align="left">
Most traditional metrics focus on journals and their content, but they leave out a wide variety of non-traditional content such as datasets, software, visualization tools, or performance recordings, which are as, or even more, important than the journal article in some disciplines. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Many new forms of scholarly communication are gaining traction and researchers frequently turn to new forums for scholarship discussion. Blogs, Facebook, Twitter, Mendeley, Figshare, various repositories, and many other start-ups are rapidly becoming places where researchers share their work and discuss the work of others in their fields. These forums are generating a great deal of ancillary data about use and impact. However, as many service providers have grown to serve this assessment need, there is a great deal of inconsistency about the data gathered and how it compares across these different services. Scott Chamberlain, in his <i>Information Standards Quarterly</i> article, '<a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/chamberlain">Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons</a>', identified the challenges of comparing metrics from a variety of service providers, since their source data isn't always equivalent.
</p>

<p align="left">
Into this environment, the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) has launched an initiative to determine the need for, priorities of, scope, and definition of standards and best practices related to new forms of scholarly assessment, often called Altmetrics. With the generous funding of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, NISO began a two-phase initiative in 2013. The first phase is a series of in-person and virtual conversations to brainstorm and prioritize altmetrics issues that could be addressed with standards or best practices. In the second phase, working groups will be established to develop the identified standards or recommended practices.
</p>

<p align="left">
The first of three in-person meetings was held in San Francisco, CA in October 2013; a second was held in Washington, DC in December 2013; and a third is planned for Philadelphia on January 23, 2014, prior to the American Library Association Midwinter meeting. The meetings follow a common agenda of lightning talks on existing projects, brainstorming activities, and small group break-outs to discuss the proposed ideas. In the first meeting, break-outs focused on definitions, quality and data science, and business and use cases. In the second meeting, groups addressed definitions, stakeholder values, existing research on assessment, quality versus quantity, granularity of measurement, assessment and discovery, tools and community engagement, future proofing solutions, and identity management.
</p>

<p align="left">
Written notes, summaries of the breakout discussions, and video recordings of each meeting are available from the project webpage at: <a href="http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics_initiative/">http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics_initiative/</a>.
</p>

<p align="left">
The ideas generated from the three meetings will be reported out in a white paper that NISO will distribute in the spring of 2014. Following that, a community prioritization effort will take place, where all interested parties can provide feedback and "vote" for which projects should be given the highest priority and which are most achievable. The NISO Business Information Topic Committees will vet the ideas prioritized by the community review process during the summer of 2014. The three to six project ideas that receive the greatest support will then be advanced as new work items, contingent on NISO Voting Member approval. Some projects may be advanced as joint initiatives in partnership with other organizations. 
</p>

<p align="left">
As evidenced by the interest and participation in the first two meetings, as well as the feedback that NISO has received since initiating this project, the time is right to begin promulgating standards or best practices related to these new research assessment metrics. While no one system will ever be perfect, the goal of the NISO initiative is to provide a common set of definitions and methodologies for deriving base data from which valid conclusions can be drawn. When it comes to decisions about people's funding, promotion, and tenure, we must ensure that the data used in those decisions is as high quality as possible.

<p align="left">
The University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Linked Data Project provides a case study of the complex topic of linked open data; from emerging concept in librarianship to practical outcome. The project began with a small academic library study group created in April 2012 and comprised of professionals from various functional areas. The initial goal was to better understand Linked Data concepts and potential benefits to the Libraries. In October 2012 after reviewing literature, attending presentations, and discussing concepts, UNLV Digital Collections designed an exploratory project with several goals:
</p>


<ul type="disc">
	<li>Study the feasibility of developing a common process that would allow the transformation of metadata records from digital collections into linked data <i>preserving their original expressivity and richness</i></li>
	<li class="spacetop">Publish data from our collections in the Linked Open Data Cloud to improve discoverability and connections with other related data sets on the Web</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">
The project was led by two librarians who created several presentations to introduce the topic beyond the study group and communicate the impact of linked data to library colleagues. These sessions helped gain the support of the UNLV Libraries administration, and a graduate assistant was hired in summer 2013 to assist with technical implementation for the period of one academic year. By this point the authors had evaluated several technologies and conducted initial tests, which indicated that OpenRefine (aka Google Refine) would be helpful in cleaning metadata and generating linked data (RDF files).
</p>

<p align="left">
By the end of Fall 2013 the team achieved several important milestones:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Adoption of the Europeana Data Model to guide the transformation of digital collections metadata into Linked Open Data</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Use of OpenRefine software to prepare and convert metadata into triples (the transformation required the OpenRefine RDF extension)</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Use of OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server to store, publish and visualize Linked Data</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Transformation of a sample set of digital collection metadata records into Linked Data</li>
</ul>


<p align="left">
Various lessons were learned during the development of the project. The most critical include:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>While linked data is a highly complex topic, with several technical aspects, it is possible for digital collections librarians to create linked open data today using a few simple, free technology tools. </li>
	<li class="spacetop">The process of preparing metadata for transformation is the project phase that requires the most effort. </li>
	<li class="spacetop">The creation, management, and use/re-use of URIs for unique things (e.g., unique artifacts from local Special Collections) should follow well-defined rules and connect our data with other data sets.</li>
</ul>


<p align="left">
Future plans include developing a user interface capable of displaying our data as well as related data from other data sets; and to make our digital collections linked data publically available through such an interface and through a SPARQL endpoint. The team has already reported on this project via several channels (presentations, publications, workshops) and also plans to conduct cost/benefit analysis of creating linked data in the final project phase.

<i>Purposeful gaming and BHL: engaging the public in improving and enhancing access to digital texts</i> is a project whose goal is to significantly improve access to digital texts by evaluating gaming as a tool for crowdsourcing text correction of content from the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL).  This project tackles a major challenge for digital libraries: full-text searching of texts is significantly hampered by poor output from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Historic literature has proven to be particularly problematic because of its tendency to have varying fonts, typesetting, and layouts that make it difficult to accurately render.  
</p>

<p align="left">
The BHL is an international consortium of the world's leading natural history libraries that have collaborated to digitize the public domain literature documenting the world's biological diversity. Today BHL is the single largest, open-licensed source of biodiversity literature made available both through the <a href="http://archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3Abiodiversity">Internet Archive</a> and through a customized portal at <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/</a>.   BHL is a perfect testbed for investigating alternate solutions to the generation of digital outputs both because it is a significantly large corpus (over 42 million pages of scanned texts) and because most of its content is historic literature (the majority of BHL content was published between 1450s-1900s). OCR is also largely ineffective on hand-written texts such as field notebooks and multi-columned layouts such as those found in horticultural catalogs.  Both are growing content types in the BHL.  BHL's diversity of digital texts will help demonstrate if particular content types are more suitable to correction via gaming than others.   Project outcomes will demonstrate whether or not digital games are a successful tool for analyzing and improving digital outputs from OCR and transcription activities, because large numbers of users can be harnessed quickly and efficiently to focus on the review and correction of particularly problematic words by being presented the task as a game.  
</p>

This project was made possible in part by a National Leadership Grant for Libraries from the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>  (grant #LG-05-13-0352-13).  It runs from December 1, 2013 through November 30, 2015 and will be conducted by the Missouri Botanical Garden's Center for Biodiversity Informatics (CBI) in partnership with Harvard University, Cornell University, and the New York Botanical Garden.

For the <a href="http://linkedup-challenge.org/">Vidi Competition</a>, the <a href="http://linkedup-project.eu/">LinkedUp project</a> is looking for innovative and robust prototypes and tools that use open data and linked data for education. The submission deadline is 14 February 2014, Valentine's Day.
</p>

<p align="left">
'Linked Data' is a set of well-defined principles for sharing of large datasets on the Web. The huge success and widespread adoption of the Linked Data approach has led to the availability of vast amounts of public data such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-wordnet-rdf-20060619/">WordNet RDF</a> or the <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> initiative.
</p>

<p align="left">
We are looking for Web applications, apps, analysis toolkits, documented APIs or other tools that connect, exploit or analyse open or linked data and that address real educational needs. Your tool still may contain some bugs, as long as it has a stable set of features and you have some proof that it can be deployed on a realistic scale.
</p>

<p align="left">
Apart from an open track, the Vidi competition also has two challenging focused tracks. 
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Simplificator</b> calls for applications easing access to complex information by summarizing them in a simpler form. </li>
	<li class="spacetop"><b>Pathfinder</b> requires applications easing access to recommendation and guidance when choosing appropriate curriculum of courses and related resources.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">
The attractive prize money is not the only reason for entering the competition: it is also a great opportunity to work with a large, documented repository of linked datasets and to profit from our dedicated support. You can showcase your ideas, solutions and talent to a wide community of researchers and practitioners, and increase your network. If you need even more incentives for entering, then take a look at how happy our <a href="http://linkedup-project.eu/2013/09/17/veni-competition-winners/">Veni prize winners</a> were at the competition award ceremony at OKCon in September 2013.
</p>

<p align="left">
To give you a headstart, we have collected and catalogued a variety of data related to education. The <a href="http://data.linkededucation.org/linkedup/catalog/">LinkedUp Data Catalogue</a> contains linked data from &#150; amongst others &#150; universities, open educational repositories and government data in relation to education.

<p align="left">
The 19th edition of ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN took place from 4 - 6 December 2013 at the Hotel InterContinental in Berlin. Bringing together 2,195 delegates from 91 different countries, 318 speakers and 81 exhibitors, ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN had as its theme "Learning Moves", which explored the wide variety of surprising ways in which changes in learning are also changing us.
</p>

<p align="left">
The Opening Plenary on the 5th brought together three very different speakers to examine the ideas and trends behind this theme from their own viewpoints. After a welcome message from European Commission President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, in which the "Opening up Education" initiative was introduced, Prof. Viktor Mayer-Sch&#246;nberger, Dr Jeff Borden and Gianpiero Petriglieri talked on three crucial strands in modern e-learning: big data, neuroscientific research and leadership.
</p>

<p align="left">
It was to Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that the attention turned at the evening's debate &#150; a conference format introduced by OEB and hugely popular ever since. The motion, "This house believes MOOCs are doomed", inspired lively and uncompromising speeches from the four panelists. The battle between proponents of and objectors to the MOOC movement drew frank opinions from audience members too, who took to the floor at the end to comment on the future of MOOCs themselves. The motion was ultimately defeated. See the entire debate <a href="http://www.online-educa.com/audio-video-130005">here</a>.
</p>

<p align="left">
In addition to the plenaries and debate, over a hundred parallel sessions addressed many other aspects of the multi-faceted theme of ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN 2013. It was in these sessions, and in the thronging exhibition area, that the true variety of the conference was demonstrated: with speakers from all over the world coming to showcase, for example, their experiences with the use of virtual worlds, their latest research on student engagement, or their own innovations in the field of e-learning.
</p>

<p align="left">
This made the 2013 the conference one of the most diverse and fascinating ever held &#150; truly the place for people to get together and create the future of online learning. For more information on the outcomes of the conference, read the post-conference report available <a href="https://www.icwe-secretariat.com/news/oeb/postreport.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p class="orange">NISO Releases Draft Open Access and Metadata Indicators Recommended Practice for Comments
</p>

<p>January 6, 2014 &#151; &quot;The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) is seeking comments on the draft recommended practice <i>Open Access Metadata and Indicators (NISO RP-22-201x)</i>. Launched in January 2013, the NISO Open Access Metadata and Indicators Working Group was chartered to develop protocols and mechanisms for transmitting the access status of scholarly works, specifically to indicate whether a specific work is openly accessible (i.e., free-to-read by any user who can get to the work over the internet) and what re-use rights might be available. This draft recommended practice proposes the adoption of two core pieces of metadata and associated tags: &lt;free_to_read&gt; and &lt;license_ref&gt;. The first tag would indicate that the work is freely accessible during the specified timeframe (if applicable). The second tag would contain a reference to a URI that carries the license terms specifying how a work may be used....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The draft recommended practice is open for public comment through February 4, 2014. To download the draft or submit online comments, visit the Open Access Metadata and Indicators webpage at: <a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/oami/">http://www.niso.org/workrooms/oami/</a>.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Leading a Strategic Assessment Program in a Research Library: ARL to Offer Seminar for New Assessment Professionals
</p>

<p>December 20, 2013 &#151; &quot;[The Association of Research Libraries] is introducing a new educational opportunity for academic and research librarians: 'Leading a Strategic Assessment Program in a Research Library: An ARL Seminar for Recently Appointed Assessment Professionals.' This two-day, in-person seminar is designed for librarians and coordinators who are new to the roles and responsibilities of assessment. Assessment professionals from non-ARL libraries are welcome to register. The seminar will be supplemented with pre- and post-workshop webcasts and independent learning activities, plus connection with a network of experienced colleagues who will provide ongoing support. The seminar will be held at the ARL offices in Washington, DC, on March 20-21, 2014. Webcasts will be held in March and May.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This multimodal workshop experience will introduce participants to the practice-based framework of organizational performance assessment in libraries. As an orientation to the roles and responsibilities of assessment librarians/coordinators, coverage will include the context and rationale for library assessment and an overview of methodologies, tools, and techniques for library-wide assessment approaches. (The training will not provide in-depth instruction in a single tool, nor will it focus on a single functional or service area of the library.)

<p class="orange">In Memory of Digital Preservation Pioneer: Steve Puglia
</p>

<p>December 18, 2013 posting by Mike Ashenfelder, Library of Congress  &#151; &quot;Steven Puglia, manager of Digital Conversion Services at the Library of Congress, died peacefully on December 10, 2013 after a year-long battle with pancreatic cancer. Puglia had a profound effect on his colleagues here in Washington and worldwide, and there is a great outpouring of grief and appreciation in the wake of his passing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The testimony embedded in this tribute demonstrates that Steve's passing left the cultural heritage, conservation and preservation communities stunned, somber and affectionate. Their words attest to his character, his influence and the significance of his work. He was a rare combination of subject-matter expert and gifted, masterful teacher, who captivated and inspired audiences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Generous' is a word colleagues consistently use to describe Puglia &#151; generous with his time, energy, advice and expertise. He was a pleasure to be around, the kind of colleague you want in the trenches with you &#151; compassionate, kind and brilliant, with a wry sense of humor....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Colleagues declare that Puglia was a key figure in setting standards and guidelines. They report that he led the digital-preservation profession forward and he made critical contributions to the cultural heritage community. They praise his foresight and his broad comprehension of technology, archives, library science, digital imaging and digital preservation, all tempered by his practicality. And they all agree that the impact of his work will resonate for a long time.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>December 5, 2013 &#151; &quot;The President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, today (Thursday) announced a 'call for action' for EU countries to promote innovation. He also confirmed that the European Commission will provide more support for open resources in education.
Speaking at the opening session of ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN 2013, Europe's leading conference on technology-assisted learning, President Barroso said that the European Commission's new initiative 'Opening Up Education' is 'a call for action for member states of the EU and their educational institutions to revisit their strategies and educational models to become promoters of innovation.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He said that: 'The European Commission is, on its side, taking a number of initiatives to support member states' educational institutions, like ensuring that educational materials furthered through the Erasmus-plus programme become publicly accessible through open licenses.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He described the Commission's initiative on 'Opening Up Education' as 'an important milestone to raise attention and support for reforms in education which tap the potential of technology and open education resources.'&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Digital Preservation Pioneer: Gary Marchionini
</p>

<p>December 3, 2013 posting by Mike Ashenfelder, Library of Congress  &#151; &quot;In 1971, Gary Marchionini had an epiphany about educational technology when he found himself competing with teletype machines for his students' attention.
Marchionini was teaching mathematics at a suburban Detroit junior high school the year that the school acquired four new teletype machines. The machines were networked to a computer, so a user could type something into a teletype and the teletype would transmit it to the computer for processing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The school teletypes accessed 'drill and practice' programs. The paper-based teletype would print a math problem, a student would type in the answer, wait patiently for the response over the slow, primitive network and eventually the teletype would print out, 'Good' (if it was correct). 'The thing was noisy,' said Marchionini. 'But the kids still wanted to leave my math classroom to go do this in the closet. There was something about this clickety clackety paper-based terminal that attracted them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Eventually I realized that there were two things going on. One was personalization; each kid was getting his own special attention. The other thing was interactivity; it was back and forth, back and forth with the kids. It was engaging. That's what sparked my interest in computer interaction as a line of research.'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Today Marchionini is dean of the UNC School of Information and Library Science and he heads its Interaction Design Laboratory. The results of Marchionini's research over the years have influenced our daily human/computer interaction in ways that we'll never know.  Interfaces will continue to evolve and get refined but it is important to remember the work of people like Marchionini who did the early research and testing, labored on the prototypes and laid the foundation of effective human-computer interface design, making it possible for modern users to interact effortlessly with their devices.
Professors may not get the glory and attention that their work deserves but that's not the point of being a teacher. Teachers teach. They pass their knowledge along to their students and often inspire them to create the Next Big Thing.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>November 26, 2013 &#151; &quot;This November, Europeana &#150; Europe's digital library, archive and museum - celebrates two significant milestones &#150; its fifth birthday and the arrival of its 30 millionth cultural object, two years ahead of the 2017 target. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Today Europeana brings together the online collections of 2,300 galleries, libraries, museums and archives from across Europe, through both its website and an API. This means that anyone anywhere from members of the public to those working in the creative industries can explore Europe's cultural heritage and build their own services, apps or games with it....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Over the past five years, Europeana has become a driving force in the world of digital cultural heritage. The Europeana model was adopted by the Digital Public Library of America, and the organisation has become a global leader in areas such as open access. In 2012, Europeana created a watershed moment in open access when it released its entire dataset, 20 million items at the time, under a CC0 dedication, making all of its metadata freely available for use by all and reinforcing the importance of public domain for creativity.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">ARL Statistics 2011-2012 Published
</p>

<p>November 25, 2013 &#151; &quot;ARL (Association of Research Libraries) has released the <i>ARL Statistics 2011-2012</i>, the latest in a series of annual publications that describe the collections, staffing, expenditures, and service activities of ARL's 125 member libraries. Of these, 115 are university libraries (16 in Canada and 99 in the US); the remaining 10 are public, governmental, and nonprofit research libraries (1 in Canada, 9 in the US).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The questions and definitions in the 2011-2012 ARL Statistics survey were revised and modernized after an extensive review process led by the Task Force on Reviewing the ARL Statistics, the ARL Annual Salary Survey, and the ARL Supplementary Statistics. As a result of this revision process, the 'titles' variable now captures a count of all items across all formats, libraries now report e-books as a subset of volumes held, the expenditures section was revised to focus on whether expenditures are one-time vs. ongoing, fringe benefits expenditures are collected in separate questions, and a new section entitled 'Use of Electronic Resources' was added. The revised ARL Statistics survey also reflects the revised instructions from the US Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) regarding doctor's degrees and doctor's degree fields. Last, the subset of the main data that pertain to Special Collections expenditures and staffing was collected on a separate survey form in response to the growing interest in sharing information about Special Collections in a more systematic fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>November 19, 2013 &#151; &quot;The National Information Standards
Organization (NISO) announces the replacement of the maintenance agency for
the two-part American National Standard on the NISO Circulation Interchange
Protocol (NCIP), ANSI/NISO Z39.83, with a Standing Committee for ongoing
maintenance of the standard. NCIP addresses the need for interoperability
among disparate circulation, interlibrary loan, consortial borrowing, and
self-service applications by standardizing the exchange of messages between
and among computer-based applications. The NCIP protocol is widely supported
in integrated library systems (ILS) and resource sharing software.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Maintenance agencies were typically established for certain types of
information system standards where the community requires implementation
support and the tracking and resolution of problem reports,' explains Nettie
Lagace, NISO's Associate Director for Programs. 'In 2009, NISO moved the
NCIP standard to continuous maintenance, which allows for regular submittal
and review of proposed changes and more frequent updating of the standard.
The NCIP Implementers Group was changed at that time to a Standing Committee
to oversee the continuous maintenance process. In 2013, EnvisionWare, who
had been the Maintenance Agency for the standard decided to step down from
that role and the NCIP Standing Committee has agreed to take over its
responsibilities.'&quot;</p>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<center><i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: A letter to the Editor 
        printed on page 517 of the 6 May 1865 number of the London review <u>The 
        Reader</u>. To link directly to this page, connect with: http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S110.htm</i></center>
      <p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the review, headed as above, in your last number, 
        and signed &quot;J. S. M.,&quot;<a href="#1">*</a> the well-known writer does not 
        appear to me to have been quite successful in answering the arguments 
        of the pamphlet he criticizes. Indeed, on the most important point, his 
        own reasoning seems equally applicable to the opposite side of the question. 
        I beg leave, therefore, to make a few observations on what appears to 
        me, as I doubt not it must to many of your readers, a very inconclusive 
        part of his article. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Mill truly says, that a voter is rarely influenced 
        by &quot;the fraction of a fraction of an interest, which he as an individual 
        may have, in what is beneficial to the public,&quot; but that his motive, if 
        uninfluenced by direct bribery or threats, is simply &quot;to do right,&quot; to 
        vote for the man whose opinions he thinks most true, and whose talents 
        seem to him best adapted to benefit the country. The fair inference from 
        this seems to be, that if you keep away from a man the influences of bribery 
        and intimidation, there is no motive left but to do what he thinks will 
        serve the public interest--in other words, &quot;the desire to do right.&quot; Instead 
        of drawing this inference, however, it is concluded that, as the &quot;honest 
        vote&quot; is influenced by &quot;social duty,&quot; the motive for voting honestly cannot 
        be so strong &quot;when done in secret, and when the voter can neither be admired 
        for disinterested, nor blamed for selfish conduct.&quot; But Mr. Mill has not 
        told us what motive there can possibly be to make the man, voting in secret, 
        vote against his own conviction of what is right. Are the plaudits of 
        a circle of admiring friends necessary to induce a man to vote for the 
        candidate he honestly thinks the best; and is the fear of their blame 
        the only influence that will keep him from &quot;mean and selfish conduct,&quot; 
        when no possible motive for such conduct exists, and when we know that, 
        in thousands of cases, such blame does not keep him from what is much 
        worse than &quot;mean and selfish conduct,&quot; taking a direct bribe?
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, however, Mr. Mill means (though he nowhere 
        says so) that &quot;class interest&quot; would be stronger than public interest--that 
        the voter's share of interest in legislation that would benefit his class 
        or profession, would overbalance his share of interest in the welfare 
        of the whole community. But if this be so, we may assert, first, that 
        the social influence of those around him will, in nine cases out of ten, 
        go to increase and strengthen the ascendency of &quot;class interests,&quot; and 
        that it is much more likely that a man should be thus induced to vote 
        for class interests as against public interests, than the reverse. In 
        the second place, we maintain that any temporary influence whatever, which 
        would induce a man to vote differently from what he would have done by 
        his own unbiassed judgment, is bad--that a man has a perfect right to 
        uphold the interests of his class, and that it is, on the whole, better 
        for the community that he should do so. For, if the voter is sufficiently 
        instructed, honest, and far-seeing, he will be convinced that nothing 
        that is disadvantageous to the community as a whole can be really and 
        permanently beneficial to his class or party; while, if he is less advanced 
        in social and political knowledge, he will solve the problem the other 
        way, and be fully satisfied that in advancing the interests of his class 
        he is also benefiting the community at large. In neither case, is it at 
        all likely, or indeed desirable, that the temporary and personal influence 
        of others' opinions at the time of an election, should cause him to vote 
        contrary to the convictions he has deliberately arrived at, under the 
        continued action of those same influences, and which convictions are the 
        full expression of his political knowledge and honesty at the time?
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me, therefore, that if you can arrange 
        matters so that every voter may be enabled to give his vote uninfluenced 
        by immediate fear of injury or hope of gain (by intimidation or bribery), 
        the only motives left to influence him are his convictions as to the effects 
        of certain measures, or a certain policy, on himself as an individual, 
        on his class, or on the whole community. The combined effect of these 
        convictions on his mind will inevitably go to form his idea of &quot;what is 
        right&quot; politically, that idea which, we quite agree with Mr. Mill, will 
        in most cases influence his vote, rather than any one of the more or less 
        remote personal interests which have been the foundation of that idea. 
        From this point of view, I should be inclined to maintain that the right 
        of voting is a &quot;personal right&quot; rather than a &quot;public duty,&quot; and that 
        a man is in no sense &quot;responsible&quot; for the proper exercise of it to the 
        public, any more than he is responsible for the convictions that lead 
        him to vote as he does. It seems almost absurd to say that each man is 
        responsible to every or to any other man for the free exercise of his 
        infinitesimal share in the government of the country, because, in that 
        case, each man in turn would act upon others exactly as he is acted upon 
        by them, and thus the final result must be the same as if each had voted 
        entirely uninfluenced by others. What, therefore, is the use of such mutual 
        influence and responsibility? You cannot by such means increase the average 
        intelligence or morality of the country; and it must be remembered, that 
        the character and opinions, which really determine each man's vote, have 
        already been modified or even formed by the long-continued action of those 
        very social influences which it is said are essential to the right performance 
        of each separate act of voting. It appears to me that such influences, 
        if they really produce any fresh effect, are a moral intimidation of the 
        worst kind, and are an additional argument in favour of, rather than against, 
        the ballot.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other questions remain. Is the ballot necessary 
        to prevent bribery and intimidation? Is it so injurious to independence 
        of character as to overbalance its undoubted utility? I think Mr. Berkeley's 
        letter in the <i>Times</i> in reply to Mr. Mill, and the experience of 
        every general election, are sufficient to answer the first question in 
        the affirmative. The answer to the second entirely depends upon the state 
        of civilization and independence to which we have arrived; and it seems 
        to me that in the days of standing armies, of an elaborate Poor Law, of 
        State interference in education, of the overwhelming influence of wealth 
        and the Priesthood, we have <i>not</i> arrived at that stage of general 
        advancement and independence of thought and action in which we ought to 
        give up so great and immediate a benefit to thousands as real freedom 
        of voting, for the infinitesimal advantage to the national character which 
        might be derived from the independent and open voting of the few who would 
        feel it compatible with their duty to their families to struggle against 
        unfair influence and unjust intimidation.</p>

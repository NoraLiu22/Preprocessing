        Trinity Episcopal Church is located at 600 N. Euclid Ave. in the Central West End of St. Louis.
        The church is at the corner of Euclid and Washington, one block east of Kingshighway and one
        block south of Delmar.  We will be singing in the newly-renovated South Parish Hall which is
        on the Washington Ave. side of the building.  Please come to one of the two Washington Ave.
        entrances to the South Parish Hall as the church will not be open.  You may park in the west
        lot, off Euclid, or in the smaller east lot, off Washington.  The room is wheelchair accessible
        from the east parking lot.  If you park on the street before 7 pm you will need to feed the meter
        (20 minutes for a quarter).  You can find a google map on the church's website at
        <a href="http://trinityepiscopal.net"> trinityepiscopal.net</a>, in the "About Us" menu.
        If you consult that map please be advised that what appears to be a street just north of the
        church property is only an alley.</p>

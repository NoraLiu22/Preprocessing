For Internet users, the progression to using Uniform Resource Names (URN)          
will offer tremendous benefits. A excellent coverage of the issues involved          
was reported in <a href="../../february96/02arms.html">Uniform Resource Names (D-Lib Magazine,           
February 1996)</a>.          
There has been much discussion on the syntax and how URNs should be          
deployed on the Internet. This has led to a number of independent groups          
developing URN services. There was a need to bring together these groups          
and to learn from their collective experiences.          
          
<p>To foster this work, the URN Interoperability Project (TURNIP) was          
initiated by the DSTC late last year. This international collaborative          
effort is providing an experimental testbed for developers of URN services          
to evaluate their interoperability with other URN resolution services.          
Participants in the project include:

<p>Each organisation has independently developed URN resolution services, and          
through the TURNIP process, can now easily resolve each others URNs. Both          
URN resolvers are based on the use of the HTTP and DNS protocols, and as          
such, can be readily deployed on the Internet. Since WWW browsers are yet          
to support URNs, a simple proxy service is used to capture the URNs and          
forward to the resolver.          
          
<p>As an example, below is a sample list of URNs that can be resolved by the          
two services:

<p>One of the interesting outcomes of TURNIP is the use of different meta-data          
schemes. The meta-data, called Uniform Resource Characteristics (URC), are          
returned from the URN resolver. The DSTC has adopted the           
<a href="http://www.oclc.org:5047/oclc/research/conferences/metadata/dublin_core_report.html">Dublin           
Core</a>          
meta-data set, and CEO has used the <a href="http://web.nexor.co.uk/public/aliweb/doc/iafa.txt">IAFA           
templates scheme</A>. Both URN          
resolvers are independent of the URC scheme used, so can freely          
interoperate.          
          
As an example, Figure 1 below shows the output from the resolution of the          
URN: <i>&lt;urn:inet:dstc.edu.au:rdu/tr007></i>.

<p>        
<p>The URC meta-data describes the resource, in this case it describes a          
conference paper. As can be seen in the <i>Identifier</i> meta-data element, there          
are two URLs for this conference paper: a HTML and PostScript version. The          
user can then choose which version of the paper they require and follow          
that link.          
          
<p>The DSTC is exploiting the URN and URC technology to develop sophisticated          
resource discovery prototypes in its Open Information Locator (OIL)           
project. The OIL project addresses the emerging need for the discovery of          
resources on globally distributed heterogeneous networks. The OIL project          
takes a global view of resource discovery and focuses on access to          
large-scale collections of resources. That is, the primary target of OIL          
are large repositories of resources, such as Digital Libraries and the          
World Wide Web. A report on the <a href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/RDU/reports/OIL/oil-dl.ps">OIL           
project and Digital Libraries <i>[PostScript]</i></a> is          
available.          
          
<p>The next stage of TURNIP is to support the enhanced DNS extensions being          
proposed and to foster more groups joining the project.

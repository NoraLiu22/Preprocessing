Three years after the deep-space horror of Alien (1979), Ridley Scott imagined an urban future to rival Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. The ghost of Raymond Chandler’s bygone LA haunts its story of a Marlowe-like former detective (Harrison Ford) assigned to track down escaped ‘replicants’ – biologically engineered beings employed as slaves by their human masters.</p>

<p>Initially a critical and commercial flop, Blade Runner developed a huge cult following. Countless science-fiction blockbusters have tried to replicate it, but Scott’s original retains an unrepeatable intrigue in the central ambiguity of Deckard’s own identity.</p>

<p>“Science-fiction cinema is transformed forever in the furnace of production design.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>

<p>“Blade Runner distils the iconographies of dystopian science-fiction and transmogrifies them to produce the blueprint for seemingly every example of the genre to follow. As we have moved into the digital age and passed 2019, the year the film is set, Blade Runner’s analogue materiality now looks thoroughly retro-dystopian. But our deepest anxieties about the integrity of the self, our technology-constituted experience, environmental apocalypse and a polarised society in extremis have never felt more relevant.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>

<p>“Lawrence G. Paull’s cityscapes, Jordan Cronenweth’s cinematography, Vangelis’s electronic score and Rutger Hauer’s soulful android were all astonishing innovations that redefined movie sci-fi.” <strong>Andy Lea</strong></p>

Three years after the deep-space horror of Alien (1979), Ridley Scott imagined an urban future to rival Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. The ghost of Raymond Chandler’s bygone LA haunts its story of a Marlowe-like former detective (Harrison Ford) assigned to track down escaped ‘replicants’ – biologically engineered beings employed as slaves by their human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially a critical and commercial flop, Blade Runner developed a huge cult following. Countless science-fiction blockbusters have tried to replicate it, but Scott’s original retains an unrepeatable intrigue in the central ambiguity of Deckard’s own identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Science-fiction cinema is transformed forever in the furnace of production design.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Blade Runner distils the iconographies of dystopian science-fiction and transmogrifies them to produce the blueprint for seemingly every example of the genre to follow. As we have moved into the digital age and passed 2019, the year the film is set, Blade Runner’s analogue materiality now looks thoroughly retro-dystopian. But our deepest anxieties about the integrity of the self, our technology-constituted experience, environmental apocalypse and a polarised society in extremis have never felt more relevant.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lawrence G. Paull’s cityscapes, Jordan Cronenweth’s cinematography, Vangelis’s electronic score and Rutger Hauer’s soulful android were all astonishing innovations that redefined movie sci-fi.” <strong>Andy Lea</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Ridley Scott","producer":"Michael Deeley","writer":"Hampton Fancher, David Webb Peoples","featuring":"Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young"},"year":"1982","nameAndYear":"Blade Runner (1982)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"USA, Hong Kong","runningTime":117,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":54,"tied":true,"category":"critics"},{"position":62,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":{"critics":[{"firstname":"Nigel","surname":"Andrews","slug":"nigel-andrews","name":"Nigel Andrews","sortName":"Andrews, Nigel","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Former film critic of Financial Times.

On top of that, in today's culture, we are all rightly reflecting on our contextual biases and the social and institutional histories that have shaped who gets to make films and who gets to comment on them. Yet, this is made more uncertain by the quicksand of digital immediacy and an often kneejerk reactionaryism has been cultivated as a commodity. In this context, what also came into my mind (as the performance anxiety of list-making took hold) was the Bourdieu readings I've attempted to grasp in many an academic seminar, as a student and now as a teacher. Old Pierre has the effect of rendering anyone who professes a certain \"taste\" in art an impostor, a charlatan spinning a self-regarding tale of cultural positioning. So what criteria could I present to justify the above choices? Well, they are all films that had a transformative effect on my sensibility as a cinema lover. At the same time, I believe I could outline a reasonably solid case that they have all shaped the possibility of cinema, as an artform, a social mirror, a physical experience and a psychological dreamscape.

On top of that, in today's culture, we are all rightly reflecting on our contextual biases and the social and institutional histories that have shaped who gets to make films and who gets to comment on them.

In this context, what also came into my mind (as the performance anxiety of list-making took hold) was the Bourdieu readings I've attempted to grasp in many an academic seminar, as a student and now as a teacher. Old Pierre has the effect of rendering anyone who professes a certain \"taste\" in art an impostor, a charlatan spinning a self-regarding tale of cultural positioning.

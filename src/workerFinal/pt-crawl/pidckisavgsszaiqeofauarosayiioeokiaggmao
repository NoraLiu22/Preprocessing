<h2>
<p><a name="Heading10"></a><b>1	INTRODUCTION</b></p></h2>
<p></p>
Since  its  inception  the  Canadian  Charter  of  Rights  and 
Freedoms , has  been  criticised  as undemocratic. It gave a
small
coterie of politically unaccountable judges the power to override  the 
policy  preferences  of  the  people's  representatives.
 What's  more,  the
justification for this rested on the vagaries of rights, about which even the
converted cannot reach agreement.
Granted: parliamentary politics are not
perfect. But, as John Ely famously argued, 'we may grant until we're blue in the
face that
legislatures aren't wholly   democratic,   but   that   isn't   going 
to   make   courts   more   democratic   than legislatures.'<a name="FootnoteB2" href="#Footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter  Hogg  and  Allison  Bushell  have  recently  responded  that  this 
majoritarian objection to judicial review has been exaggerated
&#8212; at least
in the context of Canadian democracy.<a name="FootnoteB3" href="#Footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>They claim that an empirical
study of <i>Charter </i>cases and their legislative sequels  falsifies  the 
belief  that  the  Supreme  Court  inevitably  has  the  last  word  on rights.
Judicial review is not a veto over politics but the beginning of a 'dialogue'
about rights between courts and legislatures. The actual
effect of the
<i>Charter </i>is rarely to block legislative  policies  since  'decisions  of 
the  Court  almost  always  leave  room  for  a legislative response'
and
usually get one.<a name="FootnoteB4" href="#Footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>Hogg and Bushell's response to Ely might thus go something like this: 'we can
grant until  we're  blue  in  the  face  that  courts
 aren't  as  democratic 
as  legislatures,  but  that doesn't  change  the  fact  that  <i>Charter 
</i>review  rarely  prevents  a  competent  legislature from accomplishing its
original objectives'. After protracted debates over the
constant supply  of  new  theories  purporting  to  reconcile  judicial  review 
with  a  particular philosophical  conception  of
 democracy  or  political  legitimacy, 
Hogg  and  Bushell's argument   is   notable   for   its   theoretical   modesty.   It  
simply   insists   that,   even   if democracy   is   just   about   the   enactments   of   legislative  
majorities,   we   need
  to acknowledge  that  legislative  objectives  are  rarely  thwarted  by 
court  decisions  about <i>Charter </i>rights.</sup></p>
<p>One interesting question raised by Hogg and Bushell's study, which has been
much discussed in Canada,<a name="FootnoteB5" href="#Footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> is the extent to which it has relevance
beyond the particularities of  the  <i>Charter's  </i>structure  and  text,  and  specific  features  of
Canadian  history,  politics and  institutions.  Does  the  analysis  contain 
general  insights  about  the  democratic credentials  of  rights-based 
judicial  review?<a name="FootnoteB6" href="#Footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> This  article  seeks  to  shed  some  light  on
that question by asking a more specific one: does Hogg and Bushell's argument
have
any lessons to contribute to ongoing debates about rights-based judicial
review in the Australian constitutional context?</p>
<p>After explaining Hogg and Bushell's account of 'dialogue' in more detail
(Part 2), I examine, in Part 3, whether judicial review of
the limited rights
and freedoms currently contained  in  the  <i>Australian  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> 
</i>might  be  usefully  analysed  along  similar dialogic lines. While there
are reasons for concluding that the metaphor of 'dialogue'
has considerably less
resonance in Australia than in Canada, the idea nonetheless can be  invoked  to  challenge  the  straightforward
 sense  in  which  the 
High  Court  of Australia's word is sometimes taken to be final. In particular, I will
suggest that critics
of the High Court's controversial implied rights jurisprudence are apt
to consider its democratic costs higher than in truth they
are.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part  4</a>  of  the  article  considers  whether  the  possibility  that  a 
Canadian  style 'dialogue'  might  be  generated  in  other  jurisdictions
 should 
moderate  the  strong democratic   objections   raised   in   Australia   to   the  
(re)current   proposals   for   the
introduction  of  a  bill  of  rights.  This  discussion  essentially 
raises  two  issues:  (1)  the extent to which 'dialogue'
(of the sort described by Hogg and Bushell)
can overcome democratic objections to judicial review, and (2) whether, in any event,
the institutional interaction  between  courts  and  legislatures  in  Australia  would 
be  likely  to  take  a similar shape to
the purported 'dialogue' in Canada. I argue that, to
the extent Hogg and   Bushell   maintain   that   democratic   objections  
to   <i>Charter  
</i>review   cannot   be  sustained,<a name="FootnoteB7" href="#Footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>their  conclusions  overreach
their  analysis.  Indeed,  I  suggest  that  the metaphor  of  'dialogue'  is 
potentially  misleading
 and  that  the  phenomenon  under description might be
better described as 'institutional interaction'. Once the 'dialogue' between
courts and legislatures is so understood, the nature and limits of the lessons
of Hogg and Bushell's analysis become clearer. It
also becomes clear that
whether or not the  patterns  of  institutional  interactions  in  Canada  would
be  replicated  in  other
jurisdictions  and,  in  particular,  Australia  is  a
complex  question  about  which  doubts can be raised.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<p><a name="Heading20"></a><b>2	CANADA'S <i>CHARTER </i>DIALOGUE</b></p></h2>
<p></p>
<p>For  Hogg  and  Bushell,  courts  and  legislatures  enter  into  a 
relationship  of  dialogue whenever 'a judicial decision is open
to legislative
reversal, modification, or avoidance' by the ordinary legislative process.<a name="FootnoteB8" href="#Footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>In these circumstances the
'legislative body is in a position to devise a response that is properly
respectful of the <i>Charter </i>values that have been identified by the Court, [and to accomplish] the social or economic
objectives that the  judicial  decision
 has  impeded.'<a name="FootnoteB9" href="#Footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>The 
paradigm  case  of  'dialogue',  then,  is  where, following a court ruling, a
legislature changes the means for achieving their
objectives in  ways  more  attentive  to  <i>Charter  </i>rights  but  still 
substantially  accomplishes  the legislature's original objectives. Canada's
claimed <i>Charter </i>'dialogue' thus appears to be an observable practice of
routine interaction where the pursuit of legislative objectives is assumed
to be constructively modified (from a rights
perspective), but not impeded, by  judicial  input  into  the  law-making 
process.
 Although  Hogg  and  Bushell  clearly acknowledge that judicial review
continues to constrain the democratic process, they insist
that the 'final
decision [of the legislature] is the democratic one.<i>'</i><a name="FootnoteB10" href="#Footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>According to them  it  is  'rare  indeed  that  the  constitutional 
defect  cannot  be  remedied<i>'</i><a name="FootnoteB11" href="#Footnote11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>in  a  way which substantially accomplishes the legislature's original
objectives.</p>
<p>In  Canada,  this  so-called  'dialogue<i>'  </i>is  facilitated  by  a 
number  of  features  of  the <i>Charter</i>.  Most  obviously,  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  33</a>  gives 
the  legislature  power  to  override  many  <i>Charter </i>rights.<a name="FootnoteB12" href="#Footnote12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>However, although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a> gives legislatures an explicit power to reverse
judicial decisions,  Hogg  and  Bushell  emphasise  the  'development  of  a 
political
 climate  of resistance to its use.'<a name="FootnoteB13" href="#Footnote13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>The observed
'dialogue' in Canada has thus been substantially achieved through less explicit
means of overcoming judicial interpretations
of <i>Charter </i>rights.</p>
<p>The facilitation of dialogue has principally been achieved through operation
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 1</a> of  the  <i>Charter</i>,  which  subjects  rights  to  reasonable 
limits  capable  of  justification  in  a 'free and democratic society.'<a name="FootnoteB14" href="#Footnote14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>  The Supreme Court of Canada has held
that laws will be  justified  under  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  1</a>  where  they  pursue  an  important 
objective,  are  rationally connected with that objective, impair <i>Charter </i>rights no more than
necessary, and do not have a disproportionately severe effect on the persons to
whom they apply.<a name="FootnoteB15" href="#Footnote15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>As Hogg and  Bushell  indicate,  most  of  the 
work  in  this  justificatory  test  is  done  by  the  <i>least restrictive  
means   requirement   </i>of   the   proportionality   analysis.<a name="FootnoteB16" href="#Footnote16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>Most   legislation   is invalidated because there are thought to be less
restrictive means available; because the legislature is thought
to be swinging a
sledge hammer to crack a nut. Further, as the process of giving reasons for
concluding a law is not justified under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 1</a> will often give clues or even specific alternative suggestions as to
permissible legislative formulations for achieving its goals,
Hogg and Bushell
conclude that 'one can usually be confident that  a  carefully  drafted  "second
attempt"  will  be  upheld  against
 any  future  <i>Charter
</i>challenges.'<a name="FootnoteB17" href="#Footnote17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>That is to say, in highlighting exactly why the
chosen means are not the least  restrictive  means,  the  Court  will  often, 
to
 explain  its  reasons,  be  required  to imagine less invasive means which
would be more likely to pass constitutional muster. While
the democratic process
is indubitably influenced, Hogg and Bushell argue that it is not thereby 'stultified.'<a name="FootnoteB18" href="#Footnote18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally,  Hogg  and  Bushell  explore  the  idea  that  even  when  laws  are
not  justified under  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  1</a>  the  Supreme  Court  will  often  leave 
considerable  latitude  open  to  the legislature at the remedial stage,
particularly in
relation to remedying breaches of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a>  guarantee  of  equality.<a name="FootnoteB19" href="#Footnote19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>   For  example  in  <i>Eldridge  v 
British  Columbia  (Attorney-</i><i>General)</i><a name="FootnoteB20" href="#Footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> the Supreme Court of Canada held that, although
British Columbia's failure to  provide  adequate  translation  services  to  deaf
 people  violated
equality  rights,  the remedy   should   acknowledge   that   'there   are   myriad   options  
available   to
  the government that may rectify the unconstitutionality of the
current system.'<a name="FootnoteB21" href="#Footnote21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>As David Wiseman  explains,  '[t]he  Supreme 
Court  in  <i>Eldridge  </i>thus  took  responsibility  for establishing   the  
result   to   be   achieved   but   was   also   prepared   to   defer   to 

the government's    greater    capacity    and    legitimacy    to    determine  
the    means    of achievement.'<a name="FootnoteB22" href="#Footnote22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>Hogg  and  Bushell's  discussion 
focuses  on  the  legislature's  ability  to remedy  an  invalidated 
under-inclusive  law  by 
either  extending  the  benefit  to  the excluded
group or eliminating the benefit outright. Their claim is that 'democratically
elected bodies are still ultimately responsible for setting their own budgetary
priorities, albeit in a way that does not discriminate
against disadvantaged
groups.'<a name="FootnoteB23" href="#Footnote23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>The general point is this: even court declarations of invalidity are often premised
on the possibility or need for further legislative
activity; the image of courts as
simplistically usurping the role of the legislature is thus revealed as a distortion.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that Hogg and Bushell are careful to admit that
'there may be some circumstances where the court will, by
necessity, have the last
word.'<a name="FootnoteB24" href="#Footnote24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>  The most important such instance is where the court comes to the conclusion
that it is not the  <i>means  </i>a  law  adopts  to  achieve  an  objective  which  is
problematic,  but  rather  the law's <i>objective </i>itself. Dialogue depends, that is, on the
legislature's policy objectives not themselves being unconstitutional. However, the extent
of this problem
for the notion of 'dialogue' is easily overstated. Not only is it true that courts
rarely conclude that the legislature's
purpose is not 'pressing and substantial', it is also the
case that it remains open to the legislature to reformulate the objective
of laws which may
initially seem to directly restrict a <i>Charter </i>right.<a name="FootnoteB25" href="#Footnote25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>But in
those cases where the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a> legislative override is   unavailable,   if   the   Court   characterises   a   law's   purpose  
as   constitutionally impermissible,
and the law cannot be given a plausible
alternative objective, it thereby gives itself the last word.<a name="FootnoteB26" href="#Footnote26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>
<p>With respect to the findings concerning legislative sequels, Hogg and Bushell
found that in eighty per cent of cases surveyed 'legislative
action of some
kind' followed laws that  had  been  struck  down  on  <i>Charter 
</i>grounds.<a name="FootnoteB27" href="#Footnote27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>To  be  sure,  seven  of  those  cases involved  the 
legislature  simply  repealing  the  offending  provision,  and  in  a  'few'
instances  'the  remedial  legislation  merely  implemented  the  changes  the 
reviewing court  had  suggested.'<a name="FootnoteB28" href="#Footnote28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>Nonetheless,  Hogg  and 
Bushell  conclude  that  even  if  one excluded  from  the  notion  of  dialogue
those  cases  where  a 
legislature  seemingly reached  agreement  with 
judicial  interpretations  'there  would  still  be  a  significant majority of
cases in which the competent legislative body has responded to a <i>Charter
</i>decision  by  changing  the  outcome  in  a  substantive  way'<a name="FootnoteB29" href="#Footnote29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>and  that  'in  most  cases, relatively minor amendments were all that was
required in order to respect the <i>Charter</i>, without   compromising   the  
objective   of   the   original   legislation.'<a name="FootnoteB30" href="#Footnote30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>Thus,   their
conclusion is that even on a restrictive definition of 'dialogue' the phenomenon
is 'quite prevalent'.<a name="FootnoteB31" href="#Footnote31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>As  such  they  boldly  conclude  that  'the
critique  of  the  <i>Charter  </i>based  on democratic legitimacy cannot be
sustained';<a name="FootnoteB32" href="#Footnote32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>Alexander Bickel's 'counter-majoritarian difficulty',<a name="FootnoteB33" href="#Footnote33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>   an  academic  obsession  in  the  United  States,34  
should  not,  therefore,continue to vex Canadian legal scholars.</sup></p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<p><a name="Heading30"></a><b>3	DIALOGUE IN AUSTRALIA?</b></p></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Can a similar 'dialogic' story be told about judicial review in Australia
undertaken on the basis of the limited express and implied
rights under the
<i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>? Before  more  directly  approaching  this 
question  it  is  helpful  to  describe  briefly  the uneventful history of the
counter-majoritarian
difficulty in Australia.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<p><a name="Heading35"></a><b>A	The counter-majoritarian difficulty in Australia</b></p></h3>
<p>In   sharp   contrast   to   constitutional   scholarship   in   the   United
States,   Australian constitutionalists have been largely
untroubled by the
counter-majoritarian difficulty. This  is  not  because  the  High  Court  has 
refused  to  invalidate  democratically
 enacted legislation;  judicial  review 
has  always  been  regarded  as  'axiomatic'.<a name="FootnoteB35" href="#Footnote35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>The  reason  is
that,   despite   the   existence   of   some   limited   rights   provisions  
in   the   <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,<a name="FootnoteB36" href="#Footnote36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>judicial review has
focused on the High Court's role as the 'keystone of the  federal  arch'.<a name="FootnoteB37" href="#Footnote37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>The  general  thinking  has  been  that,  unlike  rights-based  judicial
review,  judicial  enforcement  of  the  'federal  balance'
 is  not  directly 
about  whether  or not there are limits upon what the majority might do, but
rather about which majority has
power over a particular subject matter.</p>
<p>This  is  not  to  imply  that  judicial  review,  both  in  particular 
instances  and  as  an institution,   has   been   uncontroversial.
  Indeed,  
for   some   time   Sir   Owen   Dixon's declaration, on being sworn in as Chief
Justice, that the High Court was to
be guided by nothing other than 'strict and complete legalism'<a name="FootnoteB38" href="#Footnote38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>has been
subjected to increasing scrutiny  and  scepticism.<a name="FootnoteB39" href="#Footnote39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>More  recently,
growing  concerns  about  the  legitimacy  of judicial review  have been
exacerbated by  the  High Court's  explorations
into implied constitutional restraints on legislative power. Thus, when legislation
is overturned on the  basis  of  so-called  implied
 rights  (most  notably  the  implied 
right  to  freedom  of political communication), the critics directly echo
Bickel. Rights-based
judicial review <a name="FootnoteB40" href="#Footnote40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>transfers power from the
legislature to a counter-majoritarian institution.<a name="FootnoteB41" href="#Footnote41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>Indeed in
Australia  the  critics  go  further:  not  only  is  this  new  rights-based 
review  counter- majoritarian, but the constitutional
rights have been smuggled
in the back door by the judges themselves, avoiding the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> referendum process
for formally amending the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<a name="FootnoteB42" href="#Footnote42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>This,
then, is doubly counter-majoritarian. To the extent some implied rights are now
firmly part of Australian constitutional doctrine,
the legitimacy of  rights-based  review  is  an  important,  if  not  preoccupying, 
question  of  Australian constitutional theory.</p>

<p>Can we, then, find traces of 'dialogue' in Australia's experience of
rights-based judicial review?<a name="FootnoteB43" href="#Footnote43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>The  idea  that  judicial  review 
based  on  the  limited  constitutional  rights  in Australia  can  be 
understood  as  initiating
 a  dialogue  between  the  judiciary  and  the legislature is, it must be said, an unlikely one. Very few rights-based
arguments,
even accounting for the limited express constitutional rights, have led to the
invalidation of legislation.<a name="FootnoteB44" href="#Footnote44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>And for all the academic and judicial
controversy over the legitimacy of implied rights, surprisingly few findings of
invalidity have
been forthcoming. Indeed, some  of  the  implied  rights  cases 
exciting  the  most  controversy  have  not  resulted  in legislative
invalidity.<a name="FootnoteB45" href="#Footnote45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>
<p>It is also of significance that, in the absence of an express bill of rights,
any attempt to study cases where legislation has been
struck down due to
'rights-based' legislative disabilities is complicated by difficulties concerning what exactly
constitutes a 'rights'
case.  So  while  decisions  invalidating  legislation  on  the  basis  of 
the  separation  of judicial power can be conceptualised
as some sort of
individual right to 'due process',<a name="FootnoteB46" href="#Footnote46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>the  jurisprudence  of  the 
High  Court  sometimes  has  a  more  metaphysical  bent  being preoccupied by
the <i>nature </i>of judicial power or the <i>essence </i>of judicial
process.<a name="FootnoteB47" href="#Footnote47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>Such an approach does not always bring the associated
human rights concerns to the surface. In particular, the recognition that the
interests justifying rights are not absolute and the concomitant legitimacy of
asking whether a burden on those interests is justifiable
&#8212; a recognition characteristic of comparative and international human rights
law &#8212; is not a  prominent  feature  of 
'judicial  power'  jurisprudence.  The 
characterisation  of  such cases  as  rights-based  is  thus  a  contestable 
one.<a name="FootnoteB48" href="#Footnote48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>Moreover,  given  that  the  sort  of dialogue  envisaged  by
Hogg  and  Bushell  paradigmatically  works  through  the  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  1</a> examination of
the necessity and severity of burdens on <i>Charter </i>rights, the absence of
a similarly structured doctrine in the 'due process' cases at least makes it
less likely an analogous phenomenon
might be present.</p>
<p>This is not to say that examples of arguable 'dialogue' cannot be found.
There are instances where it might be argued that the legislature
has, in response
to a finding of invalidity, engaged in 'dialogue'. There are some instances where the
legislative body has   explicitly
  acquiesced   in   the   Court's   decision   by  
repealing   the   offending provisions;<a name="FootnoteB49" href="#Footnote49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>though there are also
examples where invalidated laws have not attracted even this limited degree of
legislative response.<a name="FootnoteB50" href="#Footnote50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>
<p>There are also examples of new legislation attempting to be respectful of the
Court's constitutional objections while seeking to achieve
its original
objectives.<a name="FootnoteB51" href="#Footnote51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>A prominent example is <i>Nationwide News Pty Ltd v
Wills</i><a name="FootnoteB52" href="#Footnote52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>('<i>Nationwide News</i>'), one of the twin cases in   which   the   implied   right   to   free   political   communication  
was   dramatically announced
in 1992. That case invalidated a provision which
provided: 'A person shall not   ...   by   writing   or   speech   use   words 

calculated   to   bring   a   member   of   the Commission  into 
disrepute.'<a name="FootnoteB53" href="#Footnote53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>In  protecting  the  Commission  against  any 
criticism without  the  defences  of  justification  or  fair  comment,  the 
High
 Court  held  that  the impugned   provision   went   beyond   anything  
which   might   be   thought   to   be proportionate  or
 appropriate  and 
adapted  to  that  legitimate  purpose.  The  legislative sequel to
<i>Nationwide News </i>came in the same year as the case was decided.<a name="FootnoteB54" href="#Footnote54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>The section invalidated  was  deleted  and  replaced.  The  new  provision
gave  the  Commission protection of contempt of court,
as if it were a court.
Senator Bolkus explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new provision will replace a broader provision ... which the High Court
has recently found to be invalid. The High Court interpreted
that provision as
purporting to prohibit criticism  of  the  Commission  even  when  that 
criticism  was  honest  and  fair.  The
 new provision will not suffer from that defect.<a name="FootnoteB55" href="#Footnote55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, then, we appear to have a clear case of dialogue: the legislature is
responding to the Court's finding of constitutional invalidity
in a way which, to
quote Hogg and Bushell, required only a 'relatively minor' amendment which respects the
right in issue 'without
compromising the objective of the original
legislation'.<a name="FootnoteB56" href="#Footnote56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>
<p>However, although traces of 'dialogue' between legislatures and courts over
rights can  arguably  be  found,  they  would  not  be
 sufficient  to 
demonstrate  a  tradition  or current practice of 'dialogue' in Australia.
Indeed, even if one were to count the
'due process'  type  cases,  the  number 
of  examples  of  rights-based  restrictions  leading  to constitutional
invalidity in
Australia would remain too small a sample to safely infer much
about patterns of the institutional interaction which occurs between
courts and
parliaments. For Australian lawyers this claim is unlikely to raise more than a
yawn, for  in  addition  to  the  factors
 already  mentioned,  the  two  most 
prominent  structural features facilitating <i>Charter </i>dialogue &#8212; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 1</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">33</a> &#8212; are absent from the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. The absence
of an equivalent to the <i>Charter's </i>override provision means, in Australia,
it  must  be  agreed  that  'in  the  ultimate  analysis,  it  is  for  the 
Court  to determine
whether [a] constitutional guarantee has been infringed in a
given case.'<a name="FootnoteB57" href="#Footnote57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>(It is  worth  noting  that  the  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  128</a>  referendum  mechanism,  what  Ackerman 
would  call Australia's  'specially  onerous  lawmaking  path',<a name="FootnoteB58" href="#Footnote58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>cannot  serve  as  anything  like  a functional equivalent to the
<i>Charter's </i>override provision. It does not even come close to providing 
the  basic  requirement  for  dialogue  as  understood  by  Hogg  and
 Bushell,
namely, that the parties to the conversation are at least in a relationship
approximating equality  and  that  they  can
 converse  relatively 
promptly.<a name="FootnoteB59" href="#Footnote59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>)  Thus,  not  only  is  the existence  of  a  practice 
of  'dialogue'  unlikely,  but  it  might  be  thought  that  such  a practice
is unlikely to develop.</p>
<p>It  should  be  remembered,  however,  that  Hogg  and  Bushell  see  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  33</a> 
as  being,  in practice, 'relatively unimportant'.<a name="FootnoteB60" href="#Footnote60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>On their account
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a> has not been the driving force in the development of 'dialogue' in Canada; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 1</a> has been, they say, more
significant. Interestingly,  Australian  jurisprudence  on  limitations  on  the
implied  freedom of political
communication (and some other constitutional guarantees) has
developed in ways  similar  to  Canadian  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  1</a>  jurisprudence;  the  implied  freedom
is  not  considered absolute and is subject to a proportionality test not dissimilar to the
Canadian doctrine. In <i>Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation</i><a name="FootnoteB61" href="#Footnote61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>  a unanimous
High Court identified the test, for determining whether a limit on political communication is
justified, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]s the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end the
fulfilment of which is compatible with the maintenance
of the constitutionally
prescribed system of representative  and  responsible  government  and  the  procedure 
prescribed  by  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  128</a>  for submitting  a  proposed  amendment  of  the  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>  to  the  informed 
decision  of  the people?<a name="FootnoteB62" href="#Footnote62"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, this test, like the Canadian proportionality doctrine, requires
the Court to consider  the  importance  of  the  impugned
 law's  objective  in 
the  context  of  the  basic democratic structures  of  the  polity, and  then 
to  consider whether  the
 means  used to achieve that objective are
proportionate ('reasonably appropriate and adapted').<a name="FootnoteB63" href="#Footnote63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>
<p>It is, therefore, worth pursuing further the extent to which some of the
underlying conditions   for   the   emergence   of   a  
court/legislature  
'dialogue'   are   latent   within Australian   jurisprudence  on   the  
implied   freedom   of   political
  communication   &#8212; perhaps the most
lasting (and controversial) innovation arising from the High Court's sporadic
attentiveness
to human rights.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<p><a name="Heading50"></a><b>C	The constitutionality of regulating election advertising</b></p></h3>
<p>To examine this question I propose to consider it in the context of the much
discussed and  criticised  election  advertising  case
 &#8212;  <i>Australian 
Capital  Television  Pty  Ltd  v Commonwealth</i>.<a name="FootnoteB64" href="#Footnote64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>It was in this
case, along with <i>Nationwide News</i>, that the High Court announced   its  
discovery   of   the   implied   freedom   of   political   communication.   It
provides a
useful case study as many critics of constitutional rights in
Australia parade it  as  a  prime  example  of  rights-based  judicial
 review  gone  badly 
wrong;  good legislation lost on the say-so of seven unelected and comparatively
uninformed judges. I will
argue that there is more room for the legislature to respond to
this decision than commonly allowed. But first it is necessary to
outline the regulatory
regime which was invalidated in <i>ACTV</i>.</p>

<h4>
<p><a name="Heading60"></a><b><i>(a)	The regulatory framework</i></b></p></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p3d" class="autolink_findacts">Part IIID</a> of the <i>Broadcasting Act 1942 </i>(Cth)<a name="FootnoteB65" href="#Footnote65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>regulated
the broadcasting of political advertisements  on  radio  and  television  during
election  campaigns.  It  comprised  two
basic elements: (1) a general ban on
political advertising; and (2) an exception to that ban,  involving  the 
allocation  of  free
 election  broadcasts,  to  be  administered  by  the
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (<i>'</i>ABT<i>'</i>).<a name="FootnoteB66" href="#Footnote66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>Significantly, Part IIID would not apply in relation  to  any  particular 
election  until  the  making  of  regulations  dealing
 with  the application of
the free time provisions to that election.</p>
<p>The ABT's power to allocate free time for election broadcasts was to be
exercised pursuant to the following requirements. Ninety per
cent of the free
time available was to  be  divided  between  political  parties  represented  in  the 
Parliament  prior  to  the
calling of the election in proportion to the number
of first preferences they received at the previous election. The remaining ten
per cent of the free time was to be allocated on the basis of applications for
the grant of that time. The ABT had a duty to grant
free time to applicants who
were sitting senators seeking re-election not being members of a party that had already received a free
time allocation. Otherwise the
ABT was given the discretion, unconditioned by statutory criteria, to grant any
remaining free time
to political parties (so long as they endorsed one or more candidates) and
independent candidates.  The  free  time  provisions 
did  not  allow  the  grant 
of  broadcasting  time  to individuals or interest groups not seeking election.</p>
<p>The  High  Court  held,  on  the  basis  of  the  newly  discovered  freedom 
of  political communication, that the entire regime
was invalid.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<p><a name="Heading70"></a><b><i>(b)	The critique of the decision: blinded by the light?</i></b></p></h4>
<p>In  their  illuminating  and  influential  critique  of  <i>ACTV</i>,  Gerald
Rosenberg  and  John Williams argue that the High Court approached 'a near
absolutist position', where the introduction
 of  any  regulations  differing 
from  the  status  quo  would  'nearly  always' constitute  'an  abridgment  of 
the  guarantee
 of  political  free  speech.'<a name="FootnoteB67" href="#Footnote67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>In  their  view, 'there  is  nothing  in  the  decision  that  suggests  the  Court  would 
uphold  legislation regulating access
to the media'.<a name="FootnoteB68" href="#Footnote68"><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>
<p>These conclusions are, in my view, too strong. They are coloured by the view
that the High Court, dazzled by the luminescence of American
free speech
jurisprudence, uncritically  adopted  the  notion  of  the  'marketplace  of 
ideas'  and  wrongly  assumed existing
  practice   was   an   unregulated  
'market'.<sup>69    </sup>This   interpretation,   however, overestimates  the 
influence  of  the  marketplace  of  ideas  rationale  for  free  speech.  As
Rosenberg and Williams admit, the fact that United States cases were cited
liberally in the judgments does not in itself demonstrate
they were influential.
Their suggestion, rather,  is  that  the  'number  and  pattern  of  citations, 
and  the  analysis  the 
High  Court Justices offered, are, at the very least suggestive of influence.'<a name="FootnoteB70" href="#Footnote70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> Yet
in the case of most of  these  citations  it  is  far  from  clear  that  the  justices  (with 
the  possible  exception  of
McHugh  J)<a name="FootnoteB71" href="#Footnote71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>drew  any  conclusions  of
significance  about  the  marketplace  of  ideas rationale for the value of free
speech.</p>
<p>Most of the citations on which Rosenberg and Williams rely are found in the
course of two distinct arguments made by the High Court.
The first concerns the
implication of  the  freedom  of  political  communication.  The  Court  argued 
that  the  text  and structure
of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>evinced an intention to
entrench 'representative government'.  This  was  then  said  to  carry  an  implication  that 
freedom  of
 political communication  should  be  protected  <i>because  </i>it  is  'essential  to 
sustain  the  system  of representative  government  prescribed  by  the 
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.'<a name="FootnoteB72" href="#Footnote72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>So  when,  for  example, Mason CJ quotes Archibald
Cox to the effect that freedom of speech is necessary for people  to  'build 
and
 assert  political  power,  including  the  power  to  change  the  men who 
govern   them,'<a name="FootnoteB73" href="#Footnote73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>it   is   difficult   to   read   him   as  
saying   anything   about   the marketplace of ideas rationale for the
protection of
free speech. Indeed, to the extent that United States
jurisprudence was an influential contributor to the development of this argument,
it is more plausible to connect it with John Ely's argument
that judicial review (on the basis of free speech and other rights) should
focus
on maintaining the channels of political representation and
change.<a name="FootnoteB74" href="#Footnote74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>
<p>The second invocation of United States free speech jurisprudence in <i>ACTV
</i>related to  the  distinction,  drawn  in  some  judgments,  between 
restrictions  which  target  the content  of  ideas  directly
 and  those  which  target  the  means  of 
their  communication. This  distinction,  familiar  in  United  States  constitutional
 law, 
is  employed  to  place  a higher standard of justification on laws which regulate speech by
reference to content. Again,
however, there is no reason to link this distinction to a
'free-market' notion of speech; some such distinction <i>could </i>be linked to a variety of
justifications of free speech rights.<a name="FootnoteB75" href="#Footnote75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>
<p>It  might  be  acknowledged,  however,  that  while  the  Court's  citations 
to  United States&#8217; authority do not commit it
to a marketplace of ideas
understanding of speech, the  application  of  the  implied  freedom  in  the 
case  demonstrates  that
 a  free-market understanding  is  adopted  on  the 
basis  that  the  judges  conclude  that  'virtually  any government regulation
[will be seen] as interference with constitutional rights.'<a name="FootnoteB76" href="#Footnote76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>This is, I think, the crux of Rosenberg and Williams' argument. In their
analysis of Mason CJ's reasons, they rely heavily on the
following statement: 'The
consequence is that the severe restriction of freedom of communication plainly fails to preserve
or enhance
fair access  to  the  mode  of  communication  which  is  the  subject  of 
the  restriction.'  Surely, they conclude, it is '[o]nly
by viewing the current system as "fair"'
that Mason CJ can claim the Act fails to <i>preserve </i>or <i>enhance </i>fair
access.<a name="FootnoteB77" href="#Footnote77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>
<p>However,  as  Rosenberg  and  Williams  acknowledge,  all  of  the  majority 
judges plainly accept that the implied freedom is <i>not absolute</i>. In itself
this suggests that the Court  would  be  willing  to  uphold  at  least  some 
legislation  regulating  access  to  the
electronic  media  during  election 
campaigns.<a name="FootnoteB78" href="#Footnote78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>Even  those  judges  who  intimated  a higher   
justification    would    be    required    for    laws    regulating    the   
content
   of communication  held  that  it  was  nonetheless  necessary  to 
weigh  this  against  the competing interests.<a name="FootnoteB79" href="#Footnote79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>Moreover, all in
the majority accept that at least some purposes of the impugned legislation &#8212; safeguarding the integrity of
the
political process and levelling  the  playing  field  so  more  than  the 
wealthy  might  have  access  to  electronic political
advertising &#8212; were
legitimate legislative purposes. The majority held that the restrictions were
not <i>proportionate </i>to these legislative purposes. Thus, the best way to
respond  to  the  claim  that  'there  is  nothing  in  the  decision  that 
suggests  the  Court would  uphold  legislation  regulating  access  to  the 
media'  is  an  analysis  of  the  actual reasons given
for invalidating the
regime of Part IIID. If the objections to the legislation relied on by the Court
could conceivably be overcome
by modified legislation seeking to  achieve  the  same  objectives,  the  idea  that  the  Court  adopted  a 
near  absolutist position
is, to that extent, undercut.</p>

<h4>
<p><a name="Heading80"></a><b><i>(c)	Reasons for invalidation</i></b></p></h4>
<p>In the four majority judgments in <i>ACTV</i>, a number of reasons were
offered in support of   the   conclusion   that   the   impugned   provisions   were   not 
proportionate
  to   the legitimate objects of the legislation. It is always difficult in such
cases to identify any reason,  considered  in  isolation,
 as  being  dispositive  of  the 
case;  inevitably  each constitutional  objection  to  the  legislation  is  considered  in  the
context  of  its  overall operation. Notwithstanding such caveats the following reasons for
invalidation appear to be the most significant.</p>
<p>1	<i>Discrimination  against  those  not  seeking  elected  office</i>.  All 
majority  judgments emphasised  the  fact  that  a  complete  prohibition  of 
political  advertising  in  the powerful broadcast
media only applied to persons
who were not candidates and to   organisations   who   were   not   political   parties   endorsing
 
candidates   for election.<a name="FootnoteB80" href="#Footnote80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>According  to  Gaudron  J,  this 
curtailment  was  not  'reasonable  and appropriate ... in a context where
candidates and political
parties are allocated free time for their political
advertisements'.<a name="FootnoteB81" href="#Footnote81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>For Mason CJ, the concession that 'absolute equality in the sharing of free time is unattainable',82 was
insufficient to justify 
 the   inequalities   associated   with   the   complete  
exclusion   of   'electors, individuals,   groups   and   bodies   who
  wish   to   present   their  
views'   on   the broadcast media.<a name="FootnoteB83" href="#Footnote83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>
<p>2	<i>Discrimination  in  favour  of  established  political  parties  and 
interests</i>.  Most  majority judgments   emphasised   the   fact   that   the 
free   time   allocations   substantially favoured the status
quo; time being
allocated to the major parties according to their  success  at  the  previous 
election.  The  status  quo  has,
 of  course,  a  habit  of perpetuating itself
in any event. But the judges worried about this entrenchment of the status quo becoming
both a practical and a legal problem. In the
words of Mason CJ, '[b]y limiting [new and independent candidates] to a maximum
of ten
per cent of the free time available for allocation, Pt IIID denies them
meaningful access on a non-discriminatory basis'.<a name="FootnoteB84" href="#Footnote84"><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>
<p>3	<i>The   discretionary   application   and   administration   of   the  
regulatory   regime</i>.   The legislation    involved    two    discretionary  
features    which    attracted    adverse comment.  First,  there  was 
a 
concern  that  while  the  legislation  conferred  a discretion on the ABT to allocate five per cent of the free time to new
political
parties and independent candidates, it did not 'attempt to enunciate the
criteria according to which that discretion is to be exercised'.<a name="FootnoteB85" href="#Footnote85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>
But more important were concerns  about  the  applicability  of  the 
provisions  in  the  first  place.  Before  the regime could
come into
operation, it was necessary for the executive governmen to make regulations for the allocation of free time. The legislation
could
thus be applied  on  an  'ad  hoc  basis'  depending  on  what  suited  its 
interests  best.<a name="FootnoteB86" href="#Footnote86"><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>
<p>According  to  Mason  CJ  it  was  'difficult  to  conceive  of  a 
compelling,  even  of  a reasonable,  justification  for  a  regime
 restricting
freedom  of  communication which confers such an advantage on the Executive
government'.<a name="FootnoteB87" href="#Footnote87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="Heading90"></a><b><i>(d)	A possible 'dialogue' on election advertising?</i></b></p>
<p>We  are  now  in  a  position  to  evaluate  the  prevalent  claims  that 
Australia  'had  its window of opportunity' on the regulation
of election
advertising 'and the High Court slammed  it  shut'.<a name="FootnoteB88" href="#Footnote88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>Is  it 
accurate  to  conclude  that  there  is  nothing  in  the  decision suggesting
that modified regulation of political broadcasts
during elections might be
upheld?</p>
<p>I  have  already  noted  that  it  was  clearly  accepted  that  the  implied
freedom  is  <i>not </i>absolute,  and  that  the  legislation  served 
legitimate  purposes.  The  freedom  could therefore   be   restricted   by   a 
law
  which   was   proportionate   &#8212;   reasonably   and appropriately 
adapted  &#8212;  to  those  legitimate  purposes.  The
 Court  objected  to 
this particular regulatory regime, not regulation per se.</p>
<p>Of the specific reasons the Court offered for the conclusion that the
purposes of the legislation did not justify the extent of the
restrictions on
political communication, the third  is most  easily  dealt with.  The 
application  of  the  regime could  have 
been  made mandatory,  and  criteria 
established  for  the  distribution  of  free  time  amongst  parties and 
candidates  seeking
 office,  but  not  currently  represented  in  the 
Parliament.  Such modifications  would  necessarily  require  the  Court  to

scrutinise  its  other  objections with more care.</p>
<p>Taking   next   the   second   reason   for   invalidity   &#8212;  
discrimination   in   favour   of established  parties  &#8212;
 there  is  no 
reason  why  a  legislative  formula  which  could manifestly  be  seen  to 
work  towards  destabilising  established
 patterns  of  political power  might 
not  receive  a  more  sympathetic  judicial  response.  There  is  simply
insufficient  evidence
 in  the  judgments  to  conclude  that  a  formula  more
generous  to newcomers   would   not   have   significantly   diminished
  the  
Court's   constitutional concerns.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, much hinges on the first reason: the discrimination against
(due to the  exclusion  of)  those  not  seeking  elected
 office  from  use  of
the  electronic  media. How, if at all, might the exclusion of individuals and
interest groups from the free
time provisions be overcome in any legislative
response? Let me start by admitting that the complexity of electoral regulation
is
not to be underestimated. However, it is not my intention  to  argue  that  re-drafted  legislation  would 
<i>necessarily  </i>pass  constitutional muster,  nor  that  it  would,  in  all  respects,  be  <i>as 
</i>effective  as  the  invalidated  regime. Rather,  my  argument  is  simply  that  the  judgments  in  <i>ACTV 
</i>do  not  justify  the pessimism of the High Court's critics.</sup></p>
<p>In his reasoning, McHugh J suggested that there were 'means less drastic than
the provisions of Pt IIID' which were 'available to
eradicate the [perceived]
evil'.<a name="FootnoteB89" href="#Footnote89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>He went on  to  list:  '[t]he  creation  of  special  offences,  disclosure  of 
contributions  by  donors  as well  as  political
 parties,  public  funding, 
and  limitations  on  contributions'.<a name="FootnoteB90" href="#Footnote90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>Here, however, I have no
doubt that McHugh J seriously underestimates the complexity of such  forms  of 
regulation  and  the  extent
 to  which  most  have  been  tried  and  found
wanting in Australia (and elsewhere).<a name="FootnoteB91" href="#Footnote91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>More significant, in my
view, are alternative regulatory  regimes  somewhat  closer  to  the  central 
components  of  the  invalidated
legislation.</p>
<p>One way of conceptualising the objection that the legislation discriminated
against those  not  seeking  elected  office  is  to 
say  that  the  free  time
provisions  were  under- inclusive;  they  illegitimately  discriminated 
against  non-politicians  by
 not  including them  in  the  scheme.  In  theory,
under-inclusive  rules  can  be  remedied  in  two  ways. First,  the  benefits

conferred  by  the  rule  on  the  favoured  group  may  be  removed. Second, 
the  benefits  conferred  by  the law  can  be extended
 to  illegitimately
excluded groups.<a name="FootnoteB92" href="#Footnote92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>Conceivably,  the  free  time  provisions  might 
be  modified  in  either  of  these two general directions.</p>
<p>The  first  option  could  involve  an  extension  of  the  total  ban  of 
electronic  political advertising   during   an   election
  campaign   by  
simply   eradicating   the   free   time provisions. This possibility, which
would (perhaps even to a greater extent)
achieve the purposes sought by the
invalidated legislation, may, however, be thought to travel too far from the
legislature's original
approach.<a name="FootnoteB93" href="#Footnote93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>However within the general
direction of extending  the  ban,  we  should  recognise  that  it  need  not 
be  extended  in  a  blanket
manner. Exceptions made in favour of established
political parties remain a possibility so  long  as  their  discriminatory  effect
 is  more  confined  than  that 
generated  by  the original free time provisions. For example, free broadcasting
time allocated
to political parties might proceed on the basis of longer but
fewer broadcasting time slots. Under such a scheme the major parties
could communicate their policy platform
but would not  have  the  advantage  of  bombarding  the  electorate  with 
repetitive  two-minute
advertisements over the course of an election. A revised scheme might
also incorporate a 'right of reply', in defined circumstances,
for aggrieved third
parties.<a name="FootnoteB94" href="#Footnote94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> Changes to the legislation such as these, combined with efforts to resolve the other
problems identified by  the  Court,  may  well
 be  seen  as  appropriate  and  adapted  to 
the  legislature's objectives. Interestingly, Mason CJ explicitly recognised that a
'level
playing field' was not possible, but thought that this argument would only justify free
time provisions up to a point.<a name="FootnoteB95" href="#Footnote95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> For him it was not powerful enough to justify the
'inequalities inherent in the  regime  introduced  by  Pt  IIID',96  but  that
 does  not  mean 
that  it  might  not  justify some broadcast time being allocated only to those actually seeking
office.</p>
<p>The   second   general   approach   available   to   the   legislature  
would   entail   a consideration of extending limited access
to the electronic
media to parties excluded by the  free  time  provisions.  This  would 
potentially  involve  some  very  difficult
 policy issues. If interest groups
or 'third parties' were to be given entitlement to apply for free time  there 
would  be  questions
 as  to  how  eligibility  would  be  determined,  given 
the reality that the hopes of every group or individual could not be satisfied.
This problem would be alleviated to a small extent if the share of free time of
established political parties  was  also  reduced;
 but  the  problem  would 
not  evaporate.  Even  if  it  were possible to develop adequate criteria to
choose which third parties
were to be awarded free  time,<a name="FootnoteB97" href="#Footnote97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>some 
groups  would  inevitably  miss  out.  But  nonetheless  it  is  a  live
possibility that if the <i>extent </i>of the exclusion was diminished, combined
with a clearer explanation  that  there  were  no  clearly  less  restrictive
and  efficacious
 means,  the  law may well be justified.<a name="FootnoteB98" href="#Footnote98"><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>
<p>This,  however,  is  but  one  possibility.  Other  more  secure  options 
for  extending access  to  third  parties  might  involve
 simply  removing  the
ban  on  those  not  seeking election,   and   substituting   a   combination  
of   the   sorts   of   regulatory
  techniques suggested by McHugh J (for
example, spending limits and public funding) to regulate their access to the
media. Admittedly,
this would introduce complexities absent from the initial
regulatory scheme, and there would arguably be losses in the simplicity
and
perhaps efficacy of the regime. However, the availability of such options is
sufficient to illustrate  the  implausibility  of
 the  notion  that  the  Court
left  in  its  wake  a  humbled Parliament with no options to achieve its
policies.</p>

<h3>
<p><a name="Heading100"></a><b>D	The relevance of 'dialogue' in Australia?</b></p></h3>
<p>I hope my discussion of <i>ACTV </i>has at least shown that even in the
context of the limited rights-based review under the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, court decisions will often leave 'room  for  an  alternative  or  substitute  law  to  be  re-enacted  in  a 
form  that  still
accomplishes the objectives of the original invalid
law'.<a name="FootnoteB99" href="#Footnote99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>So, while Hogg and Bushell's metaphor   of   dialogue   is  
unlikely   to   provide   a   plausible   general   description   of
interactions between courts and legislatures over constitutional rights in
Australia, it at least   serves   to   remind   us   that
  the   common  
assumption   that   judicial   review   is straightforwardly   the   last   word
can   be   seriously   misleading.
  There   is   another important  lesson. 
Critics  of  the  High  Court's  implied  rights  jurisprudence  should  be wary
of overstating
its associated costs. The price to be paid for rights-based
review (cashed out, according to some, as a democratic deficit) depends
not just on
what the judges  say,  but  also  upon  how  legislatures  are  apt  to 
respond.  Australia  does  lack effective  regulation
 of  political 
advertising  during  elections  in  part  because  of  the decision in
<i>ACTV</i>. But a fuller explanation would include the fact that most (or, most
influential)  politicians  simply  lost  interest  in  the 
issue.  The  slowing
of  reform  which (for better or worse) judicial review will sometimes involve is necessarily
part of the price
we pay for whatever benefits are associated with it. Critics
of <i>ACTV </i>should be careful not to assume, by unnecessarily leaving the
last word to the judges, that that price is higher than it needs to
be.</p>
<p>These, however, are limited conclusions. I now want to ask whether the
possibility that  the  sort  of  'dialogue'  described  by
 Hogg  and  Bushell 
in  the  Canadian  context might  emerge  or  be  created  in  other 
jurisdictions  should  modify  the  views
 of  those who object on democratic
grounds to the introduction of a bill of rights in Australia. In particular,  I 
will  raise
 the  issues  of  the  extent  to  which  any  such  'dialogue'  can
overcome  democratic  objections  to  rights-based  judicial
 review  and 
whether,  in  any event,  the  institutional  interactions  of  courts  and 
legislatures  in  Australia  would  be
likely to take a similar shape, even if any bill of rights were to have
structural features similar to the Canadian <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<p><a name="Heading110"></a><b>4	DEMOCRACY,  'DIALOGUE'  AND  THE  AUSTRALIAN  BILL  OF RIGHTS
DEBATE</b></p></h2>
<p></p>
<h3>
<p><a name="Heading115"></a><b>A	'Dialogue' and 'democracy'</b></p></h3>
<p>Are  Hogg  and  Bushell  correct  to  conclude  that  'the  critique  of  the
<i>Charter  </i>based  on democratic legitimacy cannot be sustained'?<a name="FootnoteB100" href="#Footnote100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>To answer this question it is useful to outline   briefly   the   core  
democratic   objection   of   many   critiques   of   justiciable
constitutional
rights, noting also the standard lines of response.</p>
<p>There   are   a   large   number   of   different   democratically  
inspired   objections   to constitutional  rights  combined 
with  judicial  review.<a name="FootnoteB101" href="#Footnote101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>  Though 
such  concerns  have 'ebbed and flowed' they seem 'now to be again at high tide'.<a name="FootnoteB102" href="#Footnote102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> But at
the core of many objections is a comparative point concerning the democratic pedigree and
legitimacy of courts. Jeremy Waldron
is especially good at ramming it home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>whatever you say </i>about your favourite democratic procedures,
decision-making on matters of high importance by a small elite ... is going to score lower
than
decision-making by the people or their elected and accountable
representatives.<a name="FootnoteB103" href="#Footnote103"><sup>[103]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In short, unlike majoritarian legislatures, courts undertaking judicial
review are often considered democratic deviants.<a name="FootnoteB104" href="#Footnote104"><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>
<p>Waldron, of course, injects a novel sting into the tail of this familiar
argument. Not only are  courts  inevitably less  accountable
 to  the 
electorate  than are legislatures,  but judicial  review  in  appellate  courts 
itself  'embodies  a  form  of  majority-rule.'<a name="FootnoteB105" href="#Footnote105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>'The difference
between decisions by the court and decisions by the ... legislature or by the
electorate'  he  insists,  'is  not
 a  difference  in  decision-procedure,  it 
is  a  difference  in constituency:  a  constituency  of  nine  [in  the  US], 
as 
opposed  to  voting  constituencies numbered   in   the   hundreds   (in  
our   legislatures)   or   in   the   millions   (among
  the
voters)'.<a name="FootnoteB106" href="#Footnote106"><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>
<p>There  are  a  number  of  familiar  responses  to  such  arguments  against 
rights-based judicial  review.  One  broad  strategy
 is  to  attempt  to 
assuage  democratic  concerns  by placing the supposed problems in some wider
context. For example, it has
been noted that the counter-majoritarianism of the
<i>US <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>runs much deeper than judicial review:  '[j]udicial 
review'  notes  Neil  Komesar,  'is  only  one  of  many  "undemocratic"
institutional
choices in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'.<a name="FootnoteB107" href="#Footnote107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>A similar complaint
might be that, if it is democracy  one  is worried  about,  then the  fixation  on  justiciable
constitutional
rights seems  misplaced.  As  Edward  Rubin  writes,  '[t]he  more 
far-reaching  and  intractable source of tension' between our
institutions and democracy involves the
existence of the administrative state &#8212; that is, 'the existence of a massive, appointed,
and credentialed bureaucracy that carries out the great bulk of the government's
activities'.<a name="FootnoteB108" href="#Footnote108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>It has also been argued that the functional
differences between giving courts full judicial review powers   (considered  
undemocratic)
  and   powers   to   interpret   statutes   to   comport,
wherever possible, with rights (considered democratic) have been
overstated.<a name="FootnoteB109" href="#Footnote109"><sup>[109]</sup></a>Then there  are  various  US  studies  which 
basically  conclude  that  the  US  Supreme  Court follows  the  election 
returns,
 albeit  with  a  bit  of  a  time-lag.<a name="FootnoteB110" href="#Footnote110"><sup>[110]</sup></a>Another 
response designed to temper democratic objections to rights-based judicial
review might be to challenge  the  assumption
 (explicitly  articulated  by 
Waldron)  that  judicial  review involves  a  constituency  of  only  the 
individual  members  of
 the  highest  constitutional court.  Judicial  policy-making  and  doctrinal  creation,  it  has  been 
argued,  is  more complicated
 than  the  pronouncements  of  appellate  judges,
involving  an  institutional process  of  coordination  (operating  both 
vertically
 and  horizontally)  across  the  wider judiciary.<a name="FootnoteB111" href="#Footnote111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>While none of these arguments render judicial review 'democratic', they
can lead us to ask whether or not claims that we have 'government
by the
judiciary'<a name="FootnoteB112" href="#Footnote112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>and so on are a little overdone.</p>
<p>A  second  general  line  of  response  to  majoritarian  objections  to 
judicial  review  is more  direct:  'democracy'  is  not
 just  about  majority 
rule  but  includes  other  values  as well.<a name="FootnoteB113" href="#Footnote113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> Although I have some sympathy for such responses, to deny
judicial review is a  <i>more  </i>aristocratic  form  of  governance  than  having  rights
issues  determined  by legislatures does have a hollow ring. If democratic
values are
contested, then Waldron and  others  are  right  to  say  that  legislative  decision-making 
potentially  (perhaps normally)
involves more people in the determination of what those values will
be in a given polity than does decision-making by judges.<a name="FootnoteB114" href="#Footnote114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>But, in
the end, this fact about the relative inclusiveness of legislatures (if it be
one) does not tell us anything about what 'democracy'
 is  or  where  judicial  review  fits  in.  It  remains  the 
case  that  democracy, notoriously,   is   an   essentially   contested
 
concept:<a name="FootnoteB115" href="#Footnote115"><sup>[115]</sup></a>as   such,   it   cannot   uniquely determine  our 
institutional  structures;  as  such,  judicial  review  may  advance  some
conceptions
of democracy in some circumstances and impede others.<a name="FootnoteB116" href="#Footnote116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>In short, the question  of  whether  rights-based  judicial  review  is 
democratic  or  not,  can  only  be assessed  through  its
 likely  impact 
(which  may  well  be  uncertain  and  difficult  to ascertain) on the values
that animate democracy. The question
cannot depend simply on how one  conceptualises democracy.<a name="FootnoteB117" href="#Footnote117"><sup>[117]</sup></a>  Perhaps predictably, then, the
debate over the   desirability   of   rights-based   judicial   review   by  
reference   to   the
  meaning   of democracy has pretty much stagnated.</p>
<p>I  want  to  return  now  to  a  consideration  of  the  nature  and  force 
of  Hogg  and Bushell's  conclusions  about  the  democratic
 credentials  of 
<i>Charter  </i>review.  (Although some  Canadian  commentators  doubt  Hogg  and  Bushell's  empirical 
conclusions,<a name="FootnoteB118" href="#Footnote118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>  I am going to bracket that issue and ask whether their empirical
conclusions &#8212; even if true    &#8212;    render    democratic
   objections    to   
rights-based    review    redundant    or unimportant.)</p>
<p>A  useful  place  to  start  is  Jeffrey  Goldsworthy's  recent  argument 
that  Waldron's democratic  objections  to  constitutional
 rights,  based  on 
the  primacy  of  the  right  of equal  participation,  are  rebutted  by  the 
mere  existence  of  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  33.</a><sup><a name="FootnoteB119" href="#Footnote119"><sup>[119]</sup></sup>   As  Goldsworthy emphasises, Waldron's
argument is premised on the assumption that legislatures can only   respond   to
a   judicial
  determination   of   rights   by   attempting   to   secure   a
constitutional amendment, and that this will rarely be politically
feasible. If,
however, the  legislature  can  respond  to  a  court  decision  in  the 
ordinary  way,  then  there  is  no reason
 to  think  that  the  right  to 
equal  participation  in  the  determination  of  public policy  is  violated. 
It  might,  of
 course,  be  responded  that  there  is  something  non-
democratic  about  a  court  slowing  down  the  process  of  legal  change
 or 
becoming involved in the law-making process at all. But such a claim is too
strong; it would bring into   question   the   legitimacy
  of   the   courts  
undertaking   their   non-constitutional functions as well.<a name="FootnoteB120" href="#Footnote120"><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>
<p>Hogg  and  Bushell's  claims  are  consistent  with  Goldsworthy's  argument,
but  the tenor of their response to the democratic objections
to <i>Charter
</i>review strikes me as very different.  In  particular,  it  is  less 
philosophical  and  more  grounded  in  Canadian practice. Although
they cite <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
33</a> as one of the structural features of the <i>Charter </i>which facilitates 
dialogue  in  Canada,  Hogg  and  Bushell  are  not  principally  making  an
abstract  claim  about  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s  33's</a>  theoretical  role  in  preserving  citizens' 
equal  rights  to participate, or the ultimate right of Parliament to determine
rights
controversies. The purpose of their study of legislative sequels is to
support their claim that the majority's or Parliament's right
to govern has not been significantly eroded by the
<i>Charter </i>as it actually operates &#8212; even allowing for the fact that,
in practice, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a> is unlikely to be invoked in all but the most extraordinary of
circumstances. Their point, they maintain,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is that judicially-imposed constitutional norms rarely defeat a desired
legislative policy; they  generally  operate  at  the  margins
 of  legislative 
policy,  affecting  issues  of  process, enforcement, and standards, all of
which can accommodate most legislative
objectives.<a name="FootnoteB121" href="#Footnote121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>As such, the response is best characterised as an attempt to diminish the
force of majoritarian  objections  to  rights-based  judicial
 review  rather 
than  a  reconciliation  of the  practice  with  an  abstract  conception  of 
democracy  (such  as  the  right
 to  equal participation). It cannot, of
course, solve the counter-majoritarian difficulty completely; not least because
sometimes
issues at the margins can be thought to be of importance; not  least 
because  we  are  not  always  neutral  about  the  means 
by  which  we 
should pursue our objectives.<a name="FootnoteB122" href="#Footnote122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>  But it is one way to show that majoritarian
objections can be overstated.</p>
<p>Here  we  can  also  read  Hogg  and  Bushell  as  heeding  recent  calls 
for  the  debate about constitutional rights to become
more sensitive to the
facts, in recognition of the growing  realisation  that  the  issues  are  not 
susceptible  to  purely  abstract
 arguments about democracy or rights.<a name="FootnoteB123" href="#Footnote123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>Their argument indicates one example of insensitivity, in theories  such 
as  Waldron's,  to  facts  about  how  legislatures  can
 and  do  respond  to
courts   invalidating   their  legislation.   Such  facts  do   not,   strictly 
speaking,  render objections
such as Waldron's irrelevant; but they may absorb
much of their force. For Hogg  and  Bushell,  the  idea  that  the  <i>Charter 
</i>puts  rights  beyond  revision  by  anyone other   than   judges   is   too 
exaggerated   to   be   taken   seriously.   Even   if
  they   are 
exaggerating  a  bit  themselves,  their  point  is  nonetheless  a  useful 
corrective:  judicial review   need  
not,   and,   if   their   empirical  
findings   are   accurate,   often   does   not, significantly   diminish   the 
capacity
  of   Canadian   parliaments   to   implement   their policies.</p>
<p>However, it needs to be emphasised that <i>if </i>Hogg and Bushell think or
imply they have refuted all democratically inspired objections to judicial
review, they significantly overstate
 their  case.<a name="FootnoteB124" href="#Footnote124"><sup>[124]</sup></a>Many
democratic objections  to  judicial  review  are  not  merely about who gets the
final say. Despite the academic fixation on
the counter-majoritarian difficulty,
not   all   democratic   objections   to   judicial   review   focus   on   the 
courts' comparative
lack of democratic accountability. In particular, some
democratic objectors express  concerns  over  the  impact  of  judicial  review

on  the  overall  health  and  well- being  of  a  democracy.  Peter  Russell, 
writing  in  1983  on  the  possible  impacts  of
 the <i>Charter </i>on the
processes of government, eloquently presented an argument of this type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We  should  not  lose  sight  of  the  possibility  that  excessive  reliance
on  litigation  and  the judicial  process  for  settling
 contentious  policy 
issues  can  weaken  the  sinews  of  our democracy. The danger here is not so
much that non-elected judges
will impose their will on  a  democratic  majority,
but  that  questions  of  social  and  political  justice  will  be transformed

into  technical  legal  questions  and  the  great  bulk  of  the  citizenry 
...  will abdicate   their   responsibility   for
  working   out   reasonable  
and   mutually   acceptable resolutions of the issues which divide them.<a name="FootnoteB125" href="#Footnote125"><sup>[125]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The  source  of  the  danger  to  democracy  identified  by  Russell  is  not
simply  the courts'  power  of  judicial  review,  but
 includes  the  way 
political  actors  and  citizens might respond to what courts say. For instance,
under a system of constitutional
rights and  judicial  review: legislators  may  become unduly timid,  content 
to  leave  courts  to resolve controversial moral
issues; judicially articulated
constitutional norms may be misunderstood  by  legislatures  leading  them  to  unnecessarily 
jettison
 their  preferred policies; citizens may become more litigious, focused too narrowly on
their own rights; the courts may become the
focus of interest group politics the
resolution of which may be better thrashed out in legislatures; interest groups themselves may
be reconfigured,energised or dissipated in response to a particular court decision or the
introduction of judicial  review  itself.<a name="FootnoteB126" href="#Footnote126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>To  these  familiar 
arguments,  one  could,  no  doubt  add  other ways  in  which  constitutional 
rights  and  judicial  review
 <i>might  </i>work  to  weaken  the sinews of
democracy.</p>
<p>Thus  while  Hogg  and  Bushell's  argument  does  arguably  indicate  that 
Canadian legislatures  are  not  abdicating  their  responsibility
 to  take  a 
stand  on  many  rights controversies,  their  argument  does  not  dispose  of 
all  the  various  concerns  about
 the impacts of judicial review on the vitality of democracy. However, it might be
thought that  the  drift  of  their  argument,
 away  from  a  focus  on 
philosophical  conceptions  of democracy to a more fact-sensitive inquiry about
the actual impact of judicial
review on Canadian democracy, is something to be welcomed.</p>
<p>While  the  debate  will  no  doubt  profit  from  a  greater  understanding 
of  the  actual impacts of rights-based judicial review,
we need also to
appreciate the limits of such studies.  It  may  be  true  that 
non-consequentialist  commitment  to  ideals  such
 as democracy prove too
abstract to determine whether we should prefer the institution of rights-based  
judicial   review   to 
 its   absence.   But   if   we   change   our   focus  
to  consequentialist inquiries about institutional choice, we must also
admit
the difficulty of  that  task.  Adrian  Vermeule  offers  this  pessimistic  assessment 
about  fact-sensitive inquiries into
judicial review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The  information  necessary  to  make  the  assessment  [about  the 
desirability  of  judicial review] is unobtainable, or at best
excessively
costly to obtain; the scale of the questions is too  large;  the  interaction 
between  institutions  is  too  dynamic
 and  complex;  and  the possibility  of
unintended  consequences  from  any  choice of  institutional  arrangement 
is too great.<a name="FootnoteB127" href="#Footnote127"><sup>[127]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In  short,  fact-sensitive  inquiries  as  to  the  impact  of judicial 
review  on  democracy and  rights  inevitably  raise  issues
 of  causation  and
cultural  interpretation  of  such complexity   that   it   is   difficult   to 
even   imagine   how   they
  might   realistically   be resolved.<a name="FootnoteB128" href="#Footnote128"><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>Moreover, exactly what impacts rights-based review is found to have will
inevitably depend upon normative views about the functions
or purposes which it
is supposed to serve in a given jurisdiction. Peter Cane has recently made this
point in relation   to   studying
  the   impacts   of   judicial   review   of 
administrative   action   on bureaucratic behaviour:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Views  about  such  purposes  and  functions  [of  judicial  review]  affect 
the  choice  and definition  of  the  impacts  to  be
 studied,  and  the 
conclusions  drawn  from  the  data collected.  These  various  links  between 
views  about  functions  and
 purposes  on  the  one hand,  and  studies  of 
impact  on  the  other,  underline  the  importance  of  taking  care  in
defining
the term 'judicial review' in the phrase 'the impact of judicial
review'... [I]t is ... important   for   the   empirical   researcher
  to   address   and  
articulate   the   normative foundations on which the research, and the
conclusions drawn from it, are based.<a name="FootnoteB129" href="#Footnote129"><sup>[129]</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Fact-sensitive  inquiries  about  the  impact  of  rights-based  judicial 
review  are  thus unlikely to simply replace arguments
about the desirability of
justiciable constitutional rights, even as they add layers of sophistication to
the debate. This observation
applies generally  and  in  relation  to  Hogg  and
Bushell's  specific  study.  The  debate  over constitutional rights is likely
to remain messy and intransigent.</p>
<p>To the extent stronger claims are made on the basis of Hogg and Bushell's
study I suspect that any such claimants will have been,
at least partly, misled
by the chosen metaphor  of  'dialogue'.  The  notion  of  'dialogue'  provides 
an  overly  cerebral  and
abstract    account    of    the    phenomenon   
under    description.    The    process    under examination  might  be  better

described  in  the  more  prosaic  language  of  'institutional interaction'. 
Thus  described,  it  is  clear  that  so-called
 'dialogue'  between  courts 
and legislatures  in  Canada  has  no  theoretically  defined  scope  or 
nature:  patterns  of institutional
interaction are likely to change over time
and to be subject to a range of influences  (legal  doctrine  being  only  one 
such 
influence).  'Institutional  interaction'  is not  as  catchy,  but  it 
does  usefully  emphasise  the  contingency,  complexity,
 and changeability  of
the  observed  'dialogue'  without  implying  that  Canadian  courts  and
legislatures are  engaged in  an
amicable,  standing seminar on  rights 
discourse  where achieving  'reasonable'  outcomes  seems  inevitable  given 
sufficient
 communication between the discussants. It also highlights what I
take to be a general, and important, lesson   of   Hogg   and 
 Bushell's  
analysis:   in   addition   to   the   increasing   calls   for comparative
institutional analysis in the debate over
constitutional rights, we should also 
insist   upon   an   interactional   analysis.   It   may   be,   as   is  
often   claimed,
  that legislatures    have    greater    legitimacy    and   
institutional    competence    in    making determinations  about
 questions 
concerning  rights  than  do  courts.  But  this  either/or approach neither
captures existing reality nor the variety
of possibilities as to how the two
institutions might be beneficially combined in the search for better ways to
protect rights and
foster democratic ideals.<a name="FootnoteB130" href="#Footnote130"><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<p><a name="Heading120"></a><b>B	Creating 'dialogue' in Australia?</b></p></h3>
<p>Although I have argued that Hogg and Bushell's study does not resolve the
issue of the legitimacy of judicial review, I have also
accepted that its
findings do usefully indicate that  common  assumptions  about  courts 
necessarily  having  the  last  word  in
 rights controversies  are  often 
inaccurate  and  misleading.  Legislatures  can  and  do  achieve their
policies, notwithstanding
having their first legislative attempts invalidated,
and this does not always require reliance on a formal power of legislative
override.</p>
<p>I  now  want  to  briefly  raise  the  question  of  whether  the  patterns 
of  institutional interaction  described  in  Canada
 would  likely  be 
replicated  in  Australia,  even  if  any Australian bill of rights had similar
structural features to the <i>Charter</i>. The potential for what  Hogg  and  Bushell  call  'dialogue'  is  unlikely  to  ameliorate
any  objections  to constitutional rights
in Australia, if it is unlikely to develop in
practice.</p>
<p>Although the nature of any institutional interaction can undoubtedly be
influenced by institutional design, exactly what sort of interaction
might occur
will be difficult to predict.  It  is,  perhaps,  instructive  that  in  Canada 
there  is  still  no  uncontroversial
explanation for the virtual desuetude of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
33.</a><a name="FootnoteB131" href="#Footnote131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>Nor might it have been predicted that the existence of the
override, even if not regularly used, would contribute to fostering 'dialogue'
  through   other   means   &#8212;   by   arguably   emboldening 
legislatures   and chastening  courts  as  they  undertake  their
 interpretive 
task.  So  the  extent  to  which Australian   courts   would   become   the  
'last   word'   on   any   comprehensive
  set   of constitutional rights is a
question of considerable difficulty. Certainly, this cannot be determined  by 
simple  reference
 to  the  terms  of  an  Australian  bill  of  rights  or  any
associated   legal   doctrine.   Importantly,   for   reasons   already
  given,
while   such predictions  may  be  assisted  by  a  more  detailed  study  of 
the  actual  capacities  and operations 
of  courts  and  legislatures  in 
Australia  and  the  surrounding  legal  and political  cultures,  such 
undertakings  will  necessarily
 be  contestable  and  subject  to considerable
interpretive judgments.</p>
<p>It   is,   however,   possible   to   identify   potential   barriers   to  
the   development   of 'dialogue'  in  Australia.  For
 example,  doubts  about  the  emergence
and  viability  of  a Canadian-style  interaction  between  courts  and  legislatures  over

rights  in  Australia may  arise  from  the  fact  that  the  Australian  Parliament  is,  in 
practical  institutional terms, 
a  more  divided  and  to  that  extent  weaker  institution  than 
its  Canadian counterpart.<a name="FootnoteB132" href="#Footnote132"><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>Although  the  Canadian  Senate  has 
similar  formal  powers,  it  is  an appointed  body  and  has  tended  not  to 
obstruct  government
 policy.<a name="FootnoteB133" href="#Footnote133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>So  while  the Canadian  and 
Australian parliaments both  operate  in  the  context  of  well-entrenched
political parties, the government
in Canada has a freer legislative hand than is
likely to be  the  case  in  the  Australian  Commonwealth  Parliament.  Would  the

comparative political  strength  of  the  Australian  Senate  weaken  the 
Commonwealth  Parliament's capacity to respond quickly
and effectively to court
determinations which impede its policy  objectives?  In  practice,  once  the 
High  Court  says  legislation
 violates  rights,  it may be difficult indeed to
get redrafted legislation through the Senate &#8212; even if the redrafting is
a
good faith response to the Court's decision.<a name="FootnoteB134" href="#Footnote134"><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus,  while  Hogg  and  Bushell's  study  does  usefully  raise  questions 
about  the asserted  extent  of  democratic  costs  of
 constitutional  rights 
and  does  illustrate  the relevance of interactional and more 'fact-sensitive'
institutional analyses in
our debates over constitutional rights, any direct lessons to be drawn in the
Australian context are likely to remain fraught and
contestable.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<p><a name="Heading130"></a><b>5	CONCLUSION</b></p></h2>
<p></p>
<p>There are two principal conclusions which I would draw from my examination of
the relevance  of  Canadian  style  'dialogue'  to 
debates  about 
constitutional  rights  and judicial  review  in  Australia.  Both  conclusions,
however,  can  be  stated  at  a
 level  of generality  such  that  they  are 
applicable,  not  only  to  the  Australian  debate,  but  to general  debates
about
 the democratic legitimacy  of  rights-based  review. First, I have argued
that  Hogg  and  Bushell's  study  and  their  notion
 of  'dialogue'  does 
usefully invite  us  to  engage  in  more  fact-sensitive  inquiries  as  to 
the  extent  to  which  judicial
review, even in a jurisdiction such as
Australia which currently lacks anything akin to a   legislative   override   provision, 
 really   does   constitute  
the   last   word   in   rights controversies, so as to prevent democratically accountable legislatures
achieving their policy objectives (albeit through modified means). Once such
possibilities and facts are factored  into  the  calculus
 over  the  desirability  of  judicial 
review,  there  is  a  real possibility  that  the  'democratic  deficit'  generated  by

rights-based  judicial  review  is more modest than sometimes claimed.</sup></p>
<p>The second conclusion I would like to emphasise is that the existence of a
Canadian style 'dialogue' cannot overcome democratic objections
to judicial
review. Not only can it  not  straightforwardly  overcome  the  counter-majoritarian  difficulty, 
but  it  fails  to
fully address a host of other legitimate concerns raised
about the impacts of justiciable rights on the culture of democracy in a
particular jurisdiction. A related conclusion is that in Australia, and
elsewhere, we should not assume that merely by replicating
the structural
features of the <i>Charter</i>, we would thereby generate a pattern of
institutional interaction over rights similar to that which Hogg and Bushell
observed in
Canada. As such,  the  notion  of  'dialogue'  cannot  and  should 
not  prevent  us  from  continuing  to investigate  the  potential
 impacts 
that  rights-based  judicial  review  may  have  on  the operation  and 
vitality  of  democracy  in  Australia  or  elsewhere,
 even  if  it  provides
grounds  for  questioning  whether  some  of  its  supposed  democratic  costs 
have  been overestimated.</p>

<p><sup><a name="Footnote40" href="#FootnoteB40">[40]</a></sup>	In the case of review based on the implied right to political
communication in Australia, I use the phrase 'rights-based judicial
review' as convenient shorthand.
Although the High Court  prefers  to  speak  of  immunities  from  legislative  power 
(see,  eg,
 <i>Lange  v  Australian</i> <i>Broadcasting Corporation </i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 520</a>, 560), nothing for my
purposes turns on a strict application  of  the  Hohfeldian  conception  of  rights  relationships.
See  Wesley
 N  Hohfeld, <i>Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning
</i>(first published 1919, 2003 ed). Applying Hohfeld's nomenclature, one might say that an implied <i>right
</i>corresponds with a legislative <i>duty </i>to legislate in a particular way, whereas an
implied <i>immunity </i>corresponds with a legislative <i>disability</i>. In both cases the result is that
the legislature is denied power to enact certain legislation such as to enliven the democratic
objection.
This is not to say that invoking  the  language  of  rights  as  opposed  to  immunities  is  of
no  consequence.  For
example, conceptualising the implied right as a right, rather than an
immunity, may mean that the legislature has an obligation to
legislate in particular,
positive ways. That is to say that a right may correlate with a positive duty. Whereas violation of a
legislative
immunity will result in invalidity of a violating law (as the legislature has no
power in Hohfeldian terms),  the  violation  of
 a  right  need  not  lead  to  the 
invalidity  of  a  legislative  act  as  the relevant  legislative  duty  (for  example,  if
 it  is  a  positive 
duty)  may  be  better  enforced through  remedial  means  which  do  not  lead  to  the  striking  down 
of
 any  legislation.  See Denise  R&eacute;aume,  'Language,  Rights,  Remedies,  and  the  Rule 
of  Law'   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%201%20Canadian%20Journal%20of%20Law%20and%20Jurisprudence%2035" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988)  1  <i>Canadian</i> <i>Journal  of  Law  and  Jurisprudence  </i>35</a>  for  an  insightful 
discussion  of  these  concepts  in  the context of different types of constitutional rules and remedies.</p>
<p><sup><a name="Footnote41" href="#FootnoteB41">[41]</a></sup>	See Bickel, above n 33, 16.</p>
<p><sup><a name="Footnote42" href="#FootnoteB42">[42]</a></sup>	See, eg, Jeffrey Goldsworthy, 'The High Court, Implied Rights and

<p><sup><a name="Footnote43" href="#FootnoteB43">[43]</a></sup>	One  might  also  examine  legislative  responses  to  legislation 
invalidated  on  federalism grounds. However, in maintaining
the constitutionally mandated division
of powers, the High  Court  has  tended  to  rely  on  legal  tests  to  ascertain  the
<i>character  </i>of  the  challenged law &#8212;  is  the  law  one  with  respect  to  a  particular 
subject  matter?  Thus,  federalism  cases generally
make comparatively less use of legal tests which involve a
structured balancing of  competing  interests  and  principles  (akin
 to  the  Canadian 
proportionality  test).  For discussion  of  the  problem  of  'characterisation',  see  Leslie 
Zines,  <i>The  High  Court  and  the</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>(1997) 17-36. Though this contrast between
approaches is not always clear cut, one might expect there to be less scope for 'dialogue'
in relation to
federalism cases than cases concerning constitutional rights. Similarly, Roach,

defer the hearing

in s 101A(7) to hear the
proceedings in  camera.  It  is  further  proposed  that  s  101A(8)  be  amended

<p><sup><a name="Footnote124" href="#FootnoteB124">[124]</a></sup>      How strongly they wish to make such a claim is not entirely
clear. In their original article they claim that the democratic
objections to the <i>Charter </i>'cannot
be sustained', even though much of the language they use throughout their article is more
circumspect, see Hogg and Bushell,
 above  n  3.  Hogg  and  Thornton,  above  n  118,  534, 
concede  that  that  original conclusion was probably too strongly stated
&#8212; though those who
might persist in making democratic  objections  are  said  to  take  an  'extreme  position' 
and  the 
authors  reassert  the proposition  that  no  major  democratic  objectives  have  been
defeated  by  reason  of  <i>Charter</i> review.   What   follows   seeks   to   explain   why   their   original
conclusion   needs   to   be <i>substantially </i>softened.</p>

<p><sup><a name="Footnote130" href="#FootnoteB130">[130]</a></sup>      One  response  to  those,  like  Waldron  and  Ely,  who  say 
that  judicial  review  will  always score lower than decision-making
by legislatures is to insist upon a
different comparison,namely,  that  between  legislatures  <i>acting  alone  </i>and 
legislatures  acting  in  <i>combination  </i>with judicial review. See Leslie Green, 'Law's Rule'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2024%20Osgoode%20Hall%20Law%20Journal%201023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 24 <i>Osgoode

<p><sup><a name="Footnote134" href="#FootnoteB134">[134]</a></sup>      This point would not be relevant in Australian jurisdictions,
such as the Australian Capital Territory ('ACT'), which have a
unicameral legislature. The ACT
Legislative Assembly has recently enacted a statutory bill of rights, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/hra2004148/" class="autolink_findacts">Human Rights Act
2004</a> </i>(ACT). See generally ACT Bill of Rights Committee, <i>Towards An ACT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/hra2004148/" class="autolink_findacts">Human Rights Act</a>
</i>(May 2003). However, in a  jurisdiction  as  small  as  the  ACT  one  might  have  other 
concerns  about  whether  any positive
'dialogue' over rights would flourish, see Leighton McDonald,
'New Directions in the Australian Bill of Rights Debate'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%20Public%20Law%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] <i>Public Law

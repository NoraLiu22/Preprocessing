/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: The following is excerpted 
        from Chapter V of the 1893 edition of Wallace's regional study <u>Australasia</u> 
        (S720); it was later expanded into a longer essay (S583) included in his 
        <u>Studies Scientific and Social</u> (S727) in 1900. Original pagination

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 149]] </font>The aborigines 
        of Australia differ remarkably from those of all the surrounding countries, 
        while they agree so closely among themselves in every part of the continent 
        that they evidently form a single race. To recapitulate their main characteristics: 
        they may be described as men of medium stature, muscular, but with slender 
        arms and legs, rather large heads with broad foreheads and overhanging 
        brows, the nose thick and very broad at the nostrils, as with many of 
        the lower races, the mouth large and lips thick, but far less so than 
        in the negro races. In colour they are a deep copper or chocolate, never 
        sooty black as in the negro; the hair is long, glossy black or very deep 
        auburn, usually wavy or curly and very abundant, and the face is adorned 
        with a luxuriant growth of moustache, beard, and whiskers, usually with 
        an auburn tinge. These characters, in their combination, give to the face 
        as a whole a familiar appearance resembling that of the coarser and more 
        sensual types of western Europeans; while they are as totally removed 
        from any of the beardless Malayan and Polynesian tribes, or the woolly 
        or frizzly haired Papuans. They have sometimes a considerable growth of 
        hair on the body, especially on the chest and back, while the infants 
        are much lighter in colour than the adults, and <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        150]]</font> have a considerable amount of soft fur on the neck and back.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we turn to habits and customs for some light 
        as to their probable derivation, we find equally clear proofs that <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        151]]</font> we must go far beyond the limits of all immediately surrounding 
        peoples. While Malays, Papuans, and Polynesians all cultivate the ground, 
        and all build good permanent houses, the Australians never do one or the 
        other. The pottery of the Malays and Papuans, the bows and arrows of the 
        Papuans and other Melanesians, and the elaborate canoes of all these races 
        are equally unknown to the Australians, who thus remain among the savage 
        tribes who have made the very smallest advance on the road to material 
        civilisation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr. Curr's elaborate 
        work on &quot;The Australian Race&quot; an attempt is made to show that there is 
        a great resemblance in language and in many customs between the native 
        races of Australia and Africa. By comparing some words of the numerous 
        languages of Australia with the words of the same meaning in some of the 
        still more numerous African languages and dialects, a considerable number 
        of striking resemblances are found. But it is probable that an equal number 
        of resemblances could be found if the languages of any other part of the 
        world were taken for comparison, because many of the words used are either 
        onomatop&#156;ic or what may be described as functional. Thus words for the 
        &quot;lips,&quot; &quot;mouth,&quot; or &quot;head&quot; are expressed by labial sounds, for the teeth 
        by dental sounds, for the nose by nasals, such as <em>n</em>, <em>ng</em>, 
        or <em>ny</em>; and thus the names for these parts of the body often resemble 
        each other in the most remote parts of the world. So in the names for 
        father and mother the infantile <em>ba</em>, <em>pa</em>, and <em>ma</em> 
        occur in every part of the world, though sometimes transposed in their 
        meaning. Similar resemblances have been found by other writers among the 
        languages of the hill tribes of India, and with these races there is rather 
        more accordance in physical characters. Mr. Curr also adduces a considerable 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 152]]</font> number of curious customs which 
        are common to Australia and Africa: such as the great importance attached 
        to sorcery, the forming raised scars on the body, the habit of knocking 
        out the front teeth, of circumcision, of prohibition of marriage within 
        certain class divisions, the forms of burial, and some others. But some 
        of these customs are very widespread among savages; and unless it can 
        be ascertained that a considerable number of them are strictly limited 
        to Africa and Australia, they can afford no proof of a common origin to 
        the two races. More interesting is the fact that the peculiar Australian 
        weapon, the boomerang, finds its nearest representative in Abyssinia and 
        among the ancient Egyptians. This may indicate that the weapon had a wider 
        range in early times, but was gradually supplanted by the bow and other 
        superior weapons, but can hardly be held to prove identity of race in 
        opposition to so many characteristic differences.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking broadly, and without prejudice, at the 
        physical features of the Australians, they evidently belong neither to 
        the Negroid nor to the Mongoloid types of man, while in all essential 
        characters they must be classed as Caucasians. If we look abroad for other 
        isolated fragments of the same type, we find one in the Ainos of Japan. 
        These singular people agree wonderfully with the Australian type, but 
        are somewhat more hairy and of a lighter colour. They are also in a more 
        advanced stage of material civilisation, and are probably on a somewhat 
        higher intellectual and moral plane. Other fragments of the same great 
        primitive race exist in the Khmers and Chams of Cambodia, who are said 
        to be decidedly Caucasian in type; while their language has affinities 
        with those of Polynesia, where also Caucasian affinities are shown, especially 
        in some of the <font color="#990000">[[p. 153]]</font> inhabitants of 
        Micronesia. Of all these widely scattered Caucasian fragments we must 
        look upon the Australians as the lowest and the most primitive. Their 
        antiquity is, in all probability, very great, since they must have entered 
        their present country at a time when their ancestors had not acquired 
        the arts of making pottery, of cultivating the soil, of domesticating 
        animals, of constructing houses, or of fabricating the bow and arrow. 
        They thus afford us an example of one of the most primitive types of humanity 
        yet discovered.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What renders their uniform low condition more 
        remarkable is, that they must have been many times brought into contact 
        with more advanced races. There are some signs of intermixture in the 
        north with both Malays and Papuans, but this has had little or no effect 
        on the customs of the people. Some still higher race has evidently at 
        one time formed a settlement on the north-west coast, as indicated by 
        the very remarkable cave-paintings and sculptures discovered by Sir George 
        Grey. These exist in the valley of the Glenelg River in North-West Australia, 
        about 60 miles inland, and about 20 miles south of Prince Regent's River, 
        in a very rugged tract of country. The figures consist of representations 
        of human heads and bodies, apparently of females clothed to the armpits, 
        but all the faces are without any indication of mouths. The heads are 
        all surrounded with a broad kind of headdress or halo, and one of the 
        figures wears a necklace. They are executed in bright red on a clear white 
        ground, the clothing marked with a red pattern, and the broad hat or halo 
        in some of the figures is executed in blue, red, and yellow. The figures 
        are nearly life-size, and the largest is on the sloping roof of a cave, 
        appearing to look down upon the visitor. There are also some drawings 
        of kangaroos far <font color="#990000">[[p. 154]]</font> more finished 
        than anything done by modern Australians. On the roof of another cave 
        was found a full-length figure 10 feet high dressed in a loose red garment 
        from neck to ankles, the hands and feet well executed, and the latter 
        apparently covered with shoes. The white face is mask-like, showing the 
        eyes only, around which are circular concentric bandages, the inner one 
        yellow, the outer red, looking something like a broad cap and outer bonnet. 
        On the upper part of this are five letters or characters having an oriental 
        aspect. Although poorly executed, these figures all have a refined appearance 
        as utterly out of place among the Australian natives as would be any modern 
        work of art. Very near one of the caves there was found on a large vertical 
        sandstone rock a well-executed human head hollowed out to about an inch 
        and a half deep in the centre, the head being 2 feet in length and 16 
        inches broad. The singularity of it is that it is perfectly European in 
        type, both in form of head and features. The only other paintings which 
        appear to have a similar character are those discovered by Captain Flinders 
        in Chasm Island on the north-east coast, and which have been preserved 
        in a sketch by W. Westall, A.R.A., who accompanied Flinders as artist. 
        These form a long procession of human figures in pale red colour, rudely 
        executed but all apparently clothed in long garments. Near the head of 
        the procession is a much taller male figure, with arms outstretched and 
        holding a stick, and towards the middle is an equally tall female figure. 
        There are also some turtles and a swordfish pretty well drawn.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever were the people who executed these singular 
        paintings, they were probably the makers also of the two large square 
        mounds found by Sir George Grey in the same district. These were formed 
        of loose stones, but <font color="#990000">[[p. 155]]</font> were perfect 
        parallelograms in outline, and were placed due east and west. From the 
        drawing given of them they must have been heaped up with great care, since 
        they are finished to a sharp ridge with triangular ends just like the 
        roof of a building. Both were exactly the same length, 22 1/4 feet, but 
        they differed somewhat in width and height. One was opened, but nothing 
        was found inside it but a quantity of fine mould. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this same district 
        Sir George Grey noticed among the dark-coloured natives a few individuals 
        who were very much lighter in colour, he says, &quot;almost white&quot;; and he 
        thinks that these lighter people exercised authority; and he also describes 
        the native houses as being better constructed here than in other parts 
        of Australia.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good deal farther 
        south, on the upper Gascoyne River, Mr. Giles met with some natives who 
        were exceptionally good-looking. He says: &quot;Some of these girls and boys 
        had faces, in olive hue, like the ideal representation of angels; how 
        such beauty could exist among so poor a grade of the human race it is 
        difficult to understand, but there it was.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite evident that some colony has once 
        existed on the north-west coast either of shipwrecked Europeans, or of 
        some of the higher or more civilised Malays, and that after maintaining 
        themselves for some time and leaving behind them the curious paintings 
        and carvings here described, they have either left the country or been 
        exterminated by the natives. The remarkable costume of the figures should 
        give a clue to the designers, and there is, so far as I know, only one 
        locality where a similar costume is in use--the islands of Siau and Sanguir 
        north of Celebes. It is, however, difficult to see how these islanders 
        could have wandered so far away <font color="#990000">[[p. 156]]</font> 
        from home. Is it possible that some Chinese Christians, converts of the 
        early Jesuit missionaries, may have been wrecked on this coast, and that 
        the figures may represent their recollection of the pictures of saints 
        with haloes round their heads? Whoever the people were who executed these 
        paintings, it is quite certain they were not Australians.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion 
        here reached that the Australians, usually classed as one of the lowest 
        of existing races, are really of Caucasian type, and are more nearly allied 
        to ourselves than the civilised Japanese or the brave and intelligent 
        Zulus, may appear to some to be improbable or even absurd. But I venture 
        to think that it nevertheless most nearly accords with all the facts of 
        the case; and since it has been admitted that even some of the darkest 
        Hindoos are nearly allied to Europeans, there is less improbability in 
        the existence of some more archaic and less developed examples of the 
        same type. It also accords with all we are now learning of the vast antiquity 
        of the human race; since, if all the tribes now living can be classed 
        in one or other of the three great divisions of mankind, Negroid, Mongolian, 
        and Caucasian, or as probable mixtures of them, we are impressed with 
        the conviction that we must go back to periods to which the earliest historical 
        dates are but as yesterday in order to arrive at an epoch when the common 
        ancestors of these three well-marked types alone inhabited the earth. 
        Even then we shall have made no perceptible approach to the &quot;missing link&quot;--to 
        the common ancestor of man and the higher quadrumana. . . .</p>

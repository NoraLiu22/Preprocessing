                            fossil record is life&#8217;s evolutionary epic that 
                            unfolded over four billion years as environmental 
                            conditions and genetic potential interacted in accordance 
                            with natural selection. It could be likened to a movie 
                            recording the history of life across nearly four billion 
                            years of geological time. The problem is that only 
                            a small fraction of the frames are preserved, and 
                            those that have been preserved have often been chronologically 
                            scrambled. Viewed in this way, reconstituting the 
                            movie seems intractable, and yet science has done 
                            so. Frames are still missing, but the intricate, interwoven 
                            plots are largely revealed. The movie shows a cycling 
                            planet, with life originating in the sea, and the 
                            appearance and disappearance of, as <a href="Evolution/Darwin.htm">Darwin</a> 
                            described in <a href="Evolution/OriginofSpecies.htm">Origin

                            published in the mid 19th century became the framework 
                            for many scientific disciplines to use fossils to 
                            recover the missing frames and their ordering in time. 
                            Some one hundred years after Darwin the mechanisms 
                            of genetic memory and common descent have been elucidated 
                            at the molecular level. In this new era of sequencing

                            science can infer protein lineage dating back into 
                            the Proterozoic, the tangible evidence in the imperfect 
                            fossil record remains paramount to the delineation

                          of sequences (of DNA, RNA and proteins) alone and molecular
                            phylogenetics analysis confirm evolution and deny
                           creationist 
                          concepts. The process of evolution by natural selection
                            saves (i.e., conserves) important DNA coding sequences
                           
                          over vast expanses of geological time. Molecular analyses
                            show that the proteins responsible for basic cell
                           organization 
                          and function have truly ancient Precambrian origins.
                            A highly conserved sequence is a strand of DNA in
                           a 
                          gene that contains a sequence of nucleotides that is
                            highly similar (i.e., homologous) across a wide range
                           
                          of organisms. Such highly conserved sequences code
                           for  proteins essential for survival, and have their
                           origins 
                          in a common ancestor. Natural selection retains the
                            sequence since adverse mutations would likely impair
                           
                          survival or reproductive function in the species. Among
                            the most commonly conserved genome sequences are
                           those 
                          that code for the sites where small molecules bind
                           to  protein receptors, often initiating gene transcription
                           
                          of RNA, and subsequent protein production. For example,
                            the figure to the right depicts the primary estrogen
                           
                          estradial (the small green molecule) attached to the 
                          binding domain of the estrogen protein nuclear receptor
                           (the red ribbon). The <a href="Ockham%27s%20razor">estrogen

                          in

                          body of research supports origin of the nuclear receptor
                          protein into the precambrian. Research has demonstrated
                           that vertebrate estrogen receptors (even the ancient
                          lamprey are estradiol
                          (female sex hormone) receptors,
                          though non-vertebrate estrogen receptors (e.g.,
                          amphioxus or lancelet, marine organisms that may be
                          the most basal subphylum of chordates) are not; Ockham's
                          razor then suggests that most primitive estrogen receptors
                          were not able to bind estradiol but had a different
                          function, and that hormone regulation by estradiol
                          evolved in the vertebrate
                          lineage, possibly following gene duplication.</font></p>

                        major and minor branching points of the great tree of 
                        life. Without fossils, inferring when genotype change 
                        occurred requires the use of the molecular clock hypothesis, 
                        which states that nucleotide or amino acid substitutions 
                        (mutations) occur at a constant rate. In other words, 
                        the amount of difference between two sequences can be 
                        used to infer when in geological time that ancestral sequence 
                        diverged occurred, thereby forming a phylogenetic branching 
                        point. Actually, the rate of mutation differs among groups 
                        of organisms, among genes, and even among different portions 
                        of the same gene. Because of this, molecular clocks used 
                        in molecular phylogenetics must be calibrated with fossils 
                        to ascertain when groups and clades of organisms appeared. 
                        To repeat, the fossil record is absolutely critical for

                          is: Is the fossil record adequate? Here the answer is, 
                          it depends on who you ask. A survey of the opinions 
                          leads to the conclusion that the fossil record is pretty 
                          much adequate, and constantly improving particularly 
                          in recent decades. We will revisit these questions later, 
                          but first a large amount of background is required.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                          is important to address the rarity of fossils in the 
                          context that for any particular organism that once existed, 
                          the probability that it today is part of the fossil 
                          record is infinitesimally small. Such profound rarity 
                          is a consequence of three factors: 1) fossil formation 
                          is a rare event; 2) fossil survival is a rare event; 
                          and 3) an exceedingly tiny fraction of surviving fossils 
                          will ever be accessible to be found, though the crust 
                          of the earth is filled with them. We&#8217;ll examine 
                          these factors in sequence.</font></p>

                          likelihood of an organism becoming fossilized is poor,

                          of tissues will become fossilized. If death is the primary 
                          prerequisite for fossil formation, then the second prerequisite 
                          is the forestalling of the gory ravages of decay, where 
                          the deceased becomes an ecosystem and feast unto its 
                          own for an astonishing diversity of life forms from 
                          microscopic bacteria to large predators. The transformation 
                          of an individual deceased organism into a fossil is 
                          a probabilistic rarity, and the vast majority of remains 
                          that are not eaten are either turned to dust or dispersed

                          but many aspects are part of a relatively new field 
                          termed Taphonomy, which studies the decay and destruction

                          can envision that, as the ancient earth&#8217;s crust 
                          cooled, a time was eventually reached when rain from 
                          a dense atmosphere containing all the water was not 
                          immediately evaporated. Once begun, hard rains fell 
                          and fell for countless millennia finally filling the 
                          awaiting ocean basins. With the first rainfall, the 
                          inexorable processes of erosion and dissolution began, 
                          wearing away the then barren earth&#8217;s crust and 
                          ultimately filling the awaiting ocean basins with not 
                          only water, but also the dissolved elements needed for 
                          life in its most primitive manifestation to appear in 
                          the primeval seas. <a href="fossilrecord/images/storm.gif"><img src="fossilrecord/images/stormt.gif" width="150" height="102" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="right"></a></font></p>

                          rain begat the seas, where life appeared, and began 
                          wearing the land away, forming the sediments needed 
                          to cover and preserve the traces of living organisms 
                          known as fossils. The formation and transport of sediments 
                          might be likened to a never ending snow storm. Relentlessly 
                          the sediments have been carried by the rainwater, down, 
                          down, down by the inexorable force of gravity. Perhaps 
                          the flakes were sometimes light and sparse, and other 
                          times a veritable blizzard, but without cessation. The 
                          sediments were also an implacable force grinding away 
                          everything in its path. We now know that geological 
                          time is replete with orogeny (Greek for &quot;mountain 
                          generating&quot;) events that are the result of plate 
                          tectonics. These events have pushed up huge mountain 
                          ranges, on the land, or in the seas, many of which have 
                          been mostly or completely worn away (see example &#8211; 
                          the Appalachian Orogeny). Mountains that were miles 
                          high have been ground down to remnants of former greatness, 
                          testimony to the scale and power of the rain and the 
                          sediments.</font></p>

                            Although they are present, transitional forms are 
                            rare in the fossil record. In fact, the fossil record 
                            demonstrates that some species have remained essentially 
                            unchanged for millions of years. This makes sense, 
                            because if a species is well adapted to its environment, 
                            its current traits will continue to be selected for. 
                            A species will only undergo major change, if its environment 
                            changes in a way which leaves it significantly less 
                            well adapted to survive. Such transitions tend to 
                            occur rapidly. A mammal species for example, might 
                            evolve into another distinct mammal species in less 
                            than a hundred thousand years. In the history of life, 
                            that is a short period of time. Speciation of plants 
                            and simpler animals, can occur much more rapidly. 
                            This evolutionary pattern of long periods of geologic 
                            time with little change, punctuated by short periods 
                            of rapid change, is referred to as punctuated equilibrium.</font></p>

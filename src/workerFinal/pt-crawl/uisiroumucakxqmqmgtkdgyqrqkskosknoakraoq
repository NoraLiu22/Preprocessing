	Noughts	And Crosses - The oldest graphical computer game</font><br><br><br>
	<b>Introduction</b><br><br>
	Electronic calculators appeared between the two world wars, mostly because 
	of the need of calculating balistic calculations. Each balistic weapon used 
	a specific hand calculated table of trajectories. Calculating a single table took a
	considerable amount of time.
	Electronic calculators partially solved this problem until computers arrived.
	They were the next generation of electronic calculators: they executed a
	sequence of instructions called <b>program</b> (software).<br><br>

	In the 1940s, computers had very limited abilities and could only
	execute a very short program. But they were revolutionar. They
	could compute a table of square roots, solve complex equations, etc.<br><br><br>

	<b>EDSAC, first computer (United Kingdom, 1949)</b><br><br>
	The first programs in the world were written on <b>EDSAC</b>,
	a unique computer built in <b>1949</b> at the <b>University of Cambridge</b>
	in the <b>United Kingdom</b>. One computed a table of square roots,
	another computer a table of prime numbers.<br><br>

	Early computers like EDSAC occupied a huge place, mainly
	because they used vaccuum tubes (the semi-conductors predecessors)
	which took much more place than a microprocessor and required a
	lot of power. Computers were also limited by two other factors:
	their speed and their memory. Computing a typical arithmetic table
	often required many hours or even days (something that
	engineers were used to).<br><br>

	EDSAC used 32 mercury delay lines (or "long tanks") storing 1024
	words. Each tank stored 16 words of 35 bits. EDSAC also used 3
	monitor tubes (CRTs), one of which displayed the contents of one
	of the long tanks. Thus, the display was a matrix of 35 x 16 dots.
	EDSAC was not very stable but worked pretty well. It operated 600
	instructions per second.<br><br><br>

	<b>Noughts and Crosses by A.S. Douglas</b><br><br>
	The picture shown on the top of this page is a simulation of
	<b>Noughts And Crosses</b>, a Tic-Tac-Toe game programmed in <b>1952</b>
	by <b>A.S. Douglas</b> who was passing his PhD degree at the
	University of Cambridge. His ingenious idea was	the use of the
	tank display CRT as 35 x 16 pixel screen to display his game.<br><br>

	The game was played against the machine and the player determined
	who played first (EDSAC / USER). Once the game started, the player
	specified where he wanted to place his nought or cross using a
	mechanical telephone dialer.<br><br>

	The reason why A.S. Douglas programmed this game is his PhD
	dissertation about Human-Computer interraction. People willing to
	read this dissertation will need to visit the library of the
	University of Cambridge in order to obtain a copy.<br><br>

	People willing to simulate this game can follow
	<a href="http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~edsac/">this link</a>
	to download the latest version of the <b>EDSAC simulator</b>
	(both MAC and PC versions are available). The software
	includes a number of programs and subroutines, recent
	contributions from EDSAC amateurs, as well as a very
	detailed documentation for those willing to write EDSAC
	programs.<br><br>

	Noughts and Crosses is considered as being the first real
	graphical computer game and preceeds Space War by almost a decade. One might wonder why it had no success outside
	of the University of Cambridge. The reason is obvious: EDSAC
	was unique, so nobody could play the game outside of the
	University.<br><br>

	EDSAC Simulator...:<br><br></font></p>

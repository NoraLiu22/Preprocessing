/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

      <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--The good 
        people of San Francisco, at least that portion of them present in this 
        large and intelligent assemblage, owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. Albert 
        Morton for securing the services of so eminent a lecturer as will address 
        you to-night upon a subject of such vital importance to humanity. All 
        honor to the man, say I, who has the courage to follow the truth wherever 
        it may lead, and to assert his convictions thereof in the face of a skeptical 
        and conservative world. The scientific thought of the present day is so 
        materialistic in its tone and teachings, is really so little schooled 
        in the occult laws and forces that dominate the material universe, that 
        it needs an old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring it to a realising 
        sense of its relation to the Infinite Spirit, and in harmony with the 
        eternal fitness of things. I say that the scientific world is so skeptical 
        upon these subjects that it affords many of us a great satisfaction to 
        be able to note such noble exceptions as Professors Crookes, Varley, Zollner, 
        Hellenbach, Flammarion, Hare, and last, but not least, the distinguished 
        scientist, Prof. Alfred Russel Wallace, whom I now have the pleasure of 
        introducing to you.</font></p>
<center><p><font size="+1">_________________________</font></p></center>

      <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man die shall he live again? This is the 
        question which in all ages has troubled the souls of men; the prophets 
        and the wise men of antiquity were in doubt as to the answer to be given 
        it. Philosophy has always discussed it as one of the unsolved problems 
        of humanity, while modern science instead of clearing up the difficulty 
        and giving us renewed hope, either ignores the question altogether or 
        advances powerful arguments against the affirmative reply. Yet the ultimate 
        decision arrived at, whether in the negative or affirmative, is not only 
        of vital interest to each of us individually, but is calculated, I believe, 
        to determine the future welfare or misery of mankind.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the question should be finally decided in 
        the negative, if all men without exception ever come to believe that there 
        is no life beyond this life, if children were all brought up to believe 
        that the only happiness they can ever enjoy will be upon earth, then it 
        seems to me that the condition of man would be altogether hopeless, because 
        there would cease to be any adequate motive for justice, for truth, for 
        unselfishness, and no sufficient reason could be given to the poor man, 
        to the bad man, or to the selfish man, why he should not systematically 
        seek his own personal welfare at the cost of others.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-being of the race in the distant future, 
        set before us by some philosophers, would not certainly influence the 
        majority of men, more especially as the universal teaching of science 
        is, that the entire race, with the world it inhabits, must sooner or later 
        come to an end. &quot;The greatest good to the greatest number,&quot; that noble 
        idea of many philosophers, would never be admitted as a motive for action 
        by those who are seeking their own personal welfare. The scoffing question, 
        &quot;What has posterity done for us?&quot; which influences many men even now, 
        would then be thought to justify universal self-seeking, utterly regardless 
        of what might happen to those who come afterwards. Even now, notwithstanding 
        the hereditary influences, the religious belief and religious training 
        in which our characters have been moulded, selfishness is far too prevalent. 
        When these influences cease altogether, when under total incredulity and 
        with no influences whatever leading men to self-development as a means 
        of permanent happiness, the inevitable result will be that might alone 
        would constitute right, that the weakest would always and inevitably go 
        to the wall, and that the unbridled passions of the strongest and most 
        selfish men would dominate the world. Such a hell upon earth as would 
        thus be brought about will happily never exist, because it would be founded 
        upon a falsehood, and because there are causes now at work which forbid 
        the disbelief in man's spiritual nature and his continued existence after 
        death.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, then, consider what is the nature of 
        these causes and influences, and how it has happened that earnest scientific 
        seekers after truth are so often the advocates of a disbelief which, if 
        it became universal and if founded on truth, would be so disastrous to 
        humanity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the last century the bulk of civilised 
        mankind implicitly accepted the belief in a future life and in the essential 
        spiritual nature of man. Now the most advanced thinkers reject it as not 
        founded on evidence, as incredible or even as impossible. A considerable 
        portion of the more intelligent among working classes adopt their teachings. 
        What is it that has brought this about?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belief in a future life has been bound up 
        with, and perhaps rested upon, the belief in the existence and occasional 
        appearance on earth of spiritual beings, of the spirits of the dead, and 
        of such popular phenomena as ghosts, visions, warnings, premonitions, 
        etc. Beliefs of this nature prevailed almost universally up to about two 
        centuries ago, when they came to a comparatively sudden end, and have 
        since been treated by the educated in general as fables and superstitions, 
        and this view has become so general and so ingrained that many people 
        will not allow that the question is even open to discussion at all, even 
        to admit the possibility of such phenomena as actual facts, but consider 
        it the mark of ignorance and degrading superstition. This almost sudden 
        revulsion of feeling (for it is mere feeling, not belief founded on knowledge 
        and inquiry) may be, I think, clearly traced to the current action of 
        two powerful causes: one of them the witchcraft mania of the middle ages, 
        the other the rise of physical science.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witchcraft mania which prevailed through 
        the whole of the middle ages grew in intensity and horror until it culminated 
        in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, during which thousands and 
        tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of persons, most 
        of whom were perfectly innocent and many of them far wiser and better 
        than their accusers, were tortured and massacred in the belief that they 
        had held actual personal communication with Satan. The whole religious 
        world was permeated with the belief in diabolism, so that any accusation 
        was sufficient to cause a person once arrested as a witch or a wizard 
        to be convicted. Innocent men, women, and children by thousands were murdered 
        to satisfy the craving after the excitement of demoniacal revelations 
        that then prevailed. Some who visited the sick and healed them were accused 
        of effecting cures by satanic power and burned as witches.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror, the wickedness, the superstition 
        and absurdity of many of these witchcraft persecutions naturally led to 
        a reaction among intellectual and humane people. They saw that much of 
        what they believed was certainly false; they too hastily concluded that 
        there was no truth underlying, and it was at this very time that all these 
        horrors were being perpetrated that the sun of modern science rose and 
        shed its splendor over the world. Galileo, Copernicus, Harvey, and Bacon, 
        Newton and others were then investigating the phenomena of the material 
        universe, while Berkeley and Descartes were laying the foundation of a 
        skeptical philosophy; men's thoughts were being led away from superstitious 
        horrors to the contemplation of nature and of the human mind, and then 
        witchcraft with the very groundwork of belief in the spiritual and future 
        immortality of man became branded as unclean and superstitious.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lecky, in his important work on &quot;The History 
        of Rationalism in Europe,&quot; says that this change of opinion was not founded 
        on evidence and reason, but merely on feeling and impulse. He admits that 
        the facts and arguments were alike in favor of the beholders of the reality 
        of the phenomena of witchcraft. Such men as Glanvil, Dr. Henry More, and 
        Robert Boyle, the <font color="990000">[[p. 3530]]</font><strong> </strong>most 
        illustrious scientific man of his age, with all the judges of England, 
        including Lord Hale--men who had all of them either personally investigated 
        the facts or carefully weighed the evidence--were met only with ridicule 
        or with the weakest show of argument. When judges refused to convict and 
        punish witches, the whole subject dropped out of the sight and knowledge 
        of the intellectual world.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another very interesting and important 
        reason why there was, or appeared to be, a sudden cessation of the witchcraft 
        phenomena. Witches, in our opinion, are persons who are peculiarly gifted, 
        and what we now call mediums, and who during at least three or four centuries 
        were systematically persecuted and murdered. The result was that all having 
        these peculiar gifts were exterminated out of the world, and the natural 
        result was that the phenomena of which they were the cause, or mediums, 
        ceased to exist, till a fresh crop as it were of these peculiarly gifted 
        individuals had grown up.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now since that time science and man's command 
        over nature have advanced with giant stride, while philosophy has sounded 
        the depths of the universe and has found no standing ground of the supernatural. 
        Heat and light and electricity have been traced to the motions of the 
        molecules of matter; even vital forces, the forces upon which depend the 
        growth and motion of the organic world, have also been shown to be transformations 
        of that energy which has been traced back to the molecular motion of matter. 
        This dependence of life itself upon matter has produced in the existing 
        generation of scientific men a frame of mind which finds no place in nature 
        for spirit, and which believes that matter in motion, the very molecular 
        matter which we see and feel and weigh and measure, comprises the whole 
        universe, is the source of all the forces and all the manifestations of 
        life that exist or that can possibly exist.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This skepticism is so widespread that it pervades 
        the churches themselves. Bishop Colenso and Charles Voysey are but the 
        extreme wings of a body of intelligent clergy who do not believe in miracles 
        as a scientific fact.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science has penetrated so far into the mysteries 
        of nature without finding spirit that it cannot believe that spirit exists, 
        whilst physiologists who have traced every manifestation of mind and brain 
        work are unable to believe in the possibility of any mind without a corresponding 
        material brain.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the midst of this nineteenth century 
        world of thought, a world which is either grossly materialistic or pantheistic 
        or idealistic, that modern Spiritualism has fallen like a thunderbolt 
        from a clear sky, emphatically demonstrating the action of mind without 
        any material mind, and the exertion of force without any material body, 
        and that by means of a vast amount of constantly recurring facts, which 
        have forced themselves upon all classes--men of science, men of business, 
        men of religion. It is in the most materialistic epoch of the earth's 
        history, in the midst of a society which prides itself on discarding all 
        superstition and basing its belief on the solid foundation of physical 
        science, that this new and unwelcome visitor has intruded itself, and 
        maintained a vigorous existence for more than thirty years; has made its 
        way into every civilised country in the world, has an extensive literature, 
        a large number of papers, and hundreds of organised societies, counts 
        its converts by millions in all kinds of society--among the crowned heads 
        and aristocracy, and those who occupy the highest ranks in science, literature, 
        and philosophy, as well as among the masses--while in hosts of individual 
        cases it has done what no religion has been able to do, convinced the 
        skeptic and the agnostic and the hard-faced materialist of the reality 
        of a spiritual world and of a future life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable acquaintance with the history and 
        literature of this movement--in which I have myself taken part for twenty 
        years--has failed to show me one single case in which any man who, after 
        careful inquiry, has become convinced of the truth and reality of the 
        spiritual phenomena, has afterwards discredited it or regarded it as a 
        base imposture or delusion. And it must be remembered that as a rule all 
        educated, and especially all scientific men, come to the investigation 
        of this subject with a very strong prejudice against it, as being almost 
        certainly based on credulity and fraud which they will easily detect and 
        expose. This was the frame of mind with which the inquiry was begun by 
        Prof. Hare, the first American chemist of his day; by Judge Edmonds, one 
        of the most acute and truth-seeking of American lawyers; by the Hon. Robert 
        Dale Owen, a most intellectual and philosophical materialist; by Mr. Crookes, 
        one of the first chemists of the present age, and by scores of others 
        that could be named. These men all devoted not a few hours or days or 
        even weeks to a hasty examination of the subject, but many years of patient 
        inquiry and experiment, and the result is in every case that the more 
        thoroughly the subject was investigated, the more able and intelligent 
        the inquiries, the more seriously do its foundation facts and main doctrine 
        become established.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its whole course and history, therefore, proclaimed 
        it to be neither imposture nor delusion, nor the survival of the beliefs 
        of savages, but a great and all important truth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now briefly enumerate the varied phases 
        of the phenomena of Spiritualism, and will then consider what is their 
        bearing on the doctrine of a future life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phenomena may be broadly divided into two 
        groups: physical and mental. The former, however, as well as the latter, 
        almost always imply the action of mind in their production.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first division we have simple physical 
        phenomena, and among which must be grouped an immense variety of effects, 
        such as sounds of all kinds from the most delicate tick up to blows as 
        loud and vibrating as those produced by a sledge hammer, and certainly 
        not produced by human agency. Then we have the alteration of the weight 
        of bodies, which has been often tested. I have frequently seen in the 
        presence of the celebrated medium, Mr. Home, a large dining table weighed 
        in a bright light, when there was no means of deception. This table changed 
        its weight to the amount of thirty or forty pounds.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again we have the phenomena of articles 
        of various kinds being moved without human agency, such as chairs, tables, 
        and musical instruments. These are the most common and familiar phenomena 
        to all those who have investigated the subject. Still more curious is 
        the conveying of bodies to a distance; flowers and fruits are the most 
        common of these, but also other bodies, such as letters and various small 
        objects have been conveyed long distances--sometimes several miles.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again we have that curious phenomenon which 
        is recorded more or less throughout history, the raising or levitation 
        of human bodies into the air and sometimes conveying them a considerable 
        distance. These have been repeated over and over again under various circumstances, 
        and have even included living persons. I will in illustration of this 
        mention one remarkable circumstance of the kind which I observed myself, 
        because it happened to occur when there was no professing medium present. 
        It was in a friend's house in London. An artist and his family held s&eacute;ances 
        once a week; on one occasion the medium was not present, being ill, and 
        one of the daughters, who had proved to be a medium, was in a remarkable 
        manner moved about the room. On this occasion we put out the light as 
        usual, the young lady sitting between her brother and a friend, who held 
        her hands. The darkness in this case, you will see, was one of the conditions 
        which render what happened still more difficult. After a little while 
        the two persons who held her hands said, &quot;She is gone.&quot; On that instant 
        a light was struck and she was found lying at full length upon a broad 
        mantel some feet away, with her clothes tucked around her so that she 
        lay perfectly comfortable. This was a thing she could not have done under 
        the circumstances in the dark.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More remarkable by far than these, because beyond 
        all human power to produce, is the tying of knots on endless cords, the 
        taking of coins out of sealed boxes, and the passage of solid rings over 
        a body far too large for them to pass over by any natural means. All these 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 3531]]</font> things happened in the broad daylight 
        in the presence of Zollner and two of his colleagues. He has recorded 
        them most accurately in a work which many of you know.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other occasions a very curious thing happened, 
        and that was the apparent passage visibly of matter through matter without 
        disorganising or disrupting that matter. I have frequently myself seen, 
        in good light, sticks and handkerchiefs pass through a curtain, yet an 
        examination of the curtain immediately afterward did not show any change 
        in it whatever.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This enables us to understand many of the other 
        phenomena which are happening every day. This concludes a rough outline 
        of what we may call the simpler of physical manifestations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have physical phenomena combined with 
        mental phenomena, such as direct writing and drawing. This is now such 
        a general phenomena that almost every one may have the opportunity of 
        testing for themselves. It appears in an infinite variety of ways. Papers 
        thrown upon the floor and taken up a few minutes afterwards are found 
        to be written upon; papers inclosed in looked drawers are found to be 
        written upon; spirit-writing comes upon the ceiling in inaccessible places. 
        Then again is that which occurs in closed slates and often in the presence 
        and under the hand of the person witnessing it. Often these communications 
        are lengthy, and not infrequently contain matters of private interest 
        to the persons who receive them. They often occur in languages which the 
        medium does not understand; sometimes they occur in languages that no 
        one present understands and which they have considerable difficulty in 
        getting interpreted, but generally, I think, they are interpreted and 
        found to be some definite language. A friend of mine in England obtained 
        in his own family, without any other medium, writing in a language they 
        did not understand, and which he had the greatest difficulty in having 
        interpreted, until he found a missionary from the South Sea Islands, to 
        whom it was familiar. It was correctly written, and no one in the house 
        knew a single word of it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another wonderful physical phenomenon is 
        the writing in colors of various kinds which are not present to produce 
        them. Drawings occur also in equally varied forms. Some of these are done 
        in pencil, apparently, or in ink; some are done in colours; many have 
        been done, to all appearance, in water colors, and taken up in a few seconds 
        are found to be wet; others are done in oil colors. There are instances 
        where the visitor has received a painting on a card from which he had 
        first torn off a corner, showing that the picture was produced on the 
        same card.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to another set of phenomena which 
        may be termed musical phenomena. Musical instruments are played; sometimes 
        locked and closed pianos are played. I have seen a musical box which has 
        played and ceased playing at a person's request. One of the most remarkable 
        phenomena, and which has been seen by tens of thousands of persons, was 
        the playing upon an accordion held only in one hand, the keys being touched 
        and played upon by invisible hands, producing most beautiful music.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have chemical phenomena. These consist 
        chiefly, first, protection from the effects of fire. Mr. D. D. Home--recently 
        dead, and perhaps the most remarkable medium that ever lived--used to 
        take out of the fire a brilliant red hot mass of coals, carry them about 
        the room in his hands, and by his peculiar power could tell certain persons 
        who were able to have them placed in their hands, and they would never 
        feel them. On one occasion the well-known writer, Mr. S. C. Hall, had 
        placed upon his head a great mass of burning coals which shone through 
        his white hair, and was witnessed by a large party present, and his hair 
        was not scorched and he felt no pain whatever.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the curious phenomena is the production 
        of luminous bodies apparently giving out a bright phosphorescent kind 
        of light. These have been examined by Prof Crookes; he has had them placed 
        in his hands, and he makes the declaration that modern chemistry is unable 
        to account for them, and not able to produce anything like them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing on from these we come to another set 
        of phenomena still more marvellous called materialisation, or the production 
        of temporal spiritual forms out of surrounding matter. The first produced 
        were human hands which sometimes wrote visibly, could be touched and were 
        tangible; then human faces were produced; then after a considerable time 
        the entire human form was produced, and it has now become very common, 
        as it was promised some ten or fifteen years ago; but we all doubted whether 
        that could be the case; nevertheless, it is a well known circumstance 
        thoroughly decided by all persons who have investigated this subject. 
        Mr. Crookes examined this subject many years ago, and has published the 
        results.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination was critical and carefully carried 
        on for weeks together in his own house, in his own laboratory, with all 
        his own methods. These figures were photographed, weighed, and measured; 
        he did everything that a scientific man possibly could, and he has declared 
        that absolutely and positively they are real existences--spiritual existences--because 
        they are only temporary; they come and pass away again. These materialised 
        bodies are now not unfrequently actually seen to form and then seen to 
        dissolve again into a mist and finally totally disappear. We have, therefore, 
        the most absolute and perfect proof that these things are realities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to another set of phenomena which 
        serves as the most perfect scientific test of the reality of these phenomena 
        you can possibly have, that is the power of photographing these forms. 
        If they were not real they could not be photographed; but we have photographs 
        of those seen and of those that are not seen. These photographs have been 
        taken not merely by professional photographers, but frequently taken at 
        home in the private laboratories of amateurs who have studied the subject 
        solely to arrive at the truth, who have no possibility of being deceived, 
        and who have demonstrated that these photographs are realities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still further than photographs is another marvellous 
        phenomena, and that is the production of casts of hands and feet and even 
        faces of these temporarily formed spiritual beings. These cases were made 
        in melted paraffine. Paraffine is melted in a large quantity of boiling 
        water, and the hands have to be dipped in the melted paraffine, and then 
        are taken out and are left floating in another vessel of cold water beside 
        it. These moulds are found entire, so that the aperture at the wrist is 
        much smaller than the hand. Certainly no human hand could come out of 
        it. Feet have been produced in the same way, which must have been accomplished 
        by some unseen power. In one case a gentleman in Washington obtained in 
        this way a cast of two clasped hands complete to the wrists. That is an 
        absolutely physical impossibility for any human being to do.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nobleman in Paris a few years ago carried out 
        a long series of experiments on this subject. After hands and feet had 
        been moulded, casts of faces and figures were obtained, male and female, 
        of Greek type. The medium was a very ordinary person, as I know him personally. 
        These casts are to be seen in London, and are exceedingly beautiful; and, 
        moreover, were recognised at once by this gentleman and by an American 
        gentleman, with whom I conversed about it, as forms they had seen produced 
        by materialisation, and at their request, the casts were produced.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes an outline of the chief and most 
        remarkable physical phenomena.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to mental phenomena. These mental 
        phenomena are more interesting to Spiritualists, but generally the less 
        interesting and less convincing to the outside public who are skeptical. 
        They consist first of what is termed automatic--that is, writing done 
        by the hands of persons against their will or without their will; done 
        involuntarily--the matter that is written is not known to them. Sometimes 
        they think it very silly, and would not write anything so foolish; at 
        other times it is clever, and beyond their power to produce. We have every 
        kind of writing produced in this way; much of it gives good advice, sometimes 
        information on matters of importance which the person does not know. In 
        one <font color="990000">[[p. 3532]]</font> case a friend of mine, and 
        a very eminent physician and physiologist in England, acquired this peculiar 
        power and made a special study of it for many years. He commenced it merely 
        as a curious physiological study; it has become a constant habit with 
        him now, and is of great service to him in his business, frequently warning 
        him that as a physician he would be called to a certain patient at a certain 
        time, which is invariably correct.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another set of phenomena is termed clairvoyance 
        and clairaudience; the seeing of spirits and the hearing of spirits. Persons 
        who have this power are able to describe what they see and describe the 
        words they hear in such a manner that the friends of these spiritual persons 
        are able to easily recognise them. Sometimes these persons are able to 
        give information of what is going on at a distance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another of these curious mental phenomena 
        is trance speaking. There are mediums now in all parts of the world who 
        have this wonderful faculty. It begins generally almost or quite involuntarily. 
        The person goes into a trance, and then begins to speak without knowing 
        it. After a time they gradually get to know they are speaking, but do 
        not themselves voluntarily speak on the subjects that they are discussing. 
        Many of these are, at first, ignorant persons, utterly without the knowledge 
        and power to speak on the subjects they do speak on.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these English trance speakers, Mr. J. 
        J. Morse, is now in this city, and many of you no doubt will hear him. 
        I saw him in London many years ago when he was first developed. At that 
        time Sergeant Cox, a great literary man, said: &quot;I have put to him the 
        most difficult questions in psychology, and received answers always full 
        of wisdom in choice and elegant language, yet a quarter of an hour afterwards 
        he was unable to answer the simplest query, and was even at a loss for 
        language to express a commonplace idea.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another interesting little test in connection 
        with this medium, which I think I was the means of bringing forth myself. 
        His spirit-guide (whom I believe is so still) gave a Chinese name at the 
        time, and claimed to be a Chinese philosopher; he gave the name of Tien 
        Sien Ti. At that time, I believe, nobody knew what this meant. I happened 
        to have a friend who had been an interpreter to the government in China, 
        and one day I asked him, without mentioning anything else, what this name 
        meant. He answered: &quot;Why, that means heavenly spirit guide.&quot; I think that 
        is a wonderful test.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again we have a remarkable power connected 
        with this trance speaking, which many mediums have, the power of impersonation, 
        or it may almost be called transfiguration. The medium seems taken possession 
        of by another person, and acts the character so perfectly in voice and 
        manner, and sometimes even in change of countenance, that he or she resembles 
        the person who wishes to manifest themselves, and is recognised by their 
        friends. This resembles, when the agency is powerful and sometimes disagreeable, 
        almost exactly what was called in olden time demoniacal possession. Sometimes 
        persons in this state are able to hold conversations with persons who 
        speak a language of which they have no knowledge themselves. We have the 
        most positive evidence of this that can possibly be obtained, in the case 
        of Judge Edmonds, whom I have mentioned. His own daughter, a young lady 
        who had an ordinary school education, frequently spoke and held conversation 
        in many European languages, and some Indian, which her father declares 
        she had no knowledge of whatever in her natural state.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may mention that Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker, 
        a sister of the late Henry Ward Beecher, is one of these remarkable personating 
        mediums. She has the power of going into a trance, and during that time 
        her countenance and figure change apparently so as to resemble those who 
        speak through her.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to another singular power--we can 
        hardly say whether physical or mental. It is the power of healing. There 
        are various forms of this power. The medium is able to see and describe 
        the whole internal anatomy, see the disease, tell exactly where it is, 
        and what it is, and prescribe the remedy. In other cases the medium is 
        able to effect a cure by touches of the hand.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here we have a series of twelve distinct 
        classes of phenomena--twelve great roots of phenomena, each of which includes 
        an enormous variety of separate phenomena, often varying from each other. 
        These occur with mediums who are of all ages and conditions, educated 
        and ignorant, young girls and boys as well as grown women and men. In 
        every one of these classes the phenomena have been submitted to the most 
        critical examination by thousands of clever and skeptical persons for 
        the last thirty years, and in every one of these classes of phenomena 
        have been as thoroughly demonstrated as any of the great facts of physical 
        science. In view of the numerous eminent men who have investigated this 
        matter and given us their decision, we may entirely throw aside the idea 
        that imposture, only in a slight measure, has produced these various phenomena.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now pass on to consider what are the 
        great striking characteristics of these phenomena. Looked at as a whole 
        what do they teach? In the first place, they seem to me to have the striking 
        characteristics of natural phenomena as opposed to artificial phenomena; 
        they have the character of general uniformity of type coupled with variety 
        of detail. In every country of the world, whether in America or Europe 
        or Australia, whether in England or France or Spain or Russia, we find 
        the phenomena of the same general type, while the individual differences 
        among them show that they are not servilely copied one from the other. 
        Whether the mediums are men or women, boys or girls, or even in some cases 
        infants, whether educated or ignorant, whether even they are civilised 
        or savage, we find the same general phenomena occurring in the very same 
        degree of perfection.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conclude, then, that the phenomena are natural 
        phenomena; that they were produced under the action of the general laws 
        which determine the inter-relations of the spiritual and material worlds, 
        and are thus in accord with the established order of nature.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next place--and this is perhaps the most 
        important characteristic of these phenomena--they are from beginning to 
        end essentially human. They come to us with human actions, with human 
        ideas; they make use of human speech, of writing and drawing; they manifest 
        wit and logic, humor and pathos, that we can all appreciate and enjoy; 
        the communications vary in character as those of human beings; some rank 
        with the lowest, some with the very highest, but all are essentially human. 
        When the spirits speak audibly, the voice is a human voice; when they 
        appear visible, the hands and the faces are absolutely human; when we 
        can touch the forms and examine them closely we find them human in character, 
        not those of any other kind of being. The photographs are always the photographs 
        of our fellow creatures; never those of demons or angels and animals. 
        When hands, feet or faces are produced in paraffine moulds they are all 
        in minutest details those of men and women, though not those of the medium. 
        All of these various phenomena are of this human character. There are 
        not two groups or two classes, one of which is human and the other sub-human, 
        but all are alike.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this overwhelming mass of evidence, 
        what are we to think of the sense or the logic of those who tell us we 
        are all deceived, and almost all these communications and these phenomena 
        come from what they call elemental spirits, or rather low spirits who 
        have never been human? Evidence for this belief I can find none whatever 
        that is not of the most flimsy description. It might be illustrated by 
        our receiving a letter from Central Africa written in good English writing, 
        on American or European paper, written with a steel pen, good chemical 
        ink, and simply because it was signed Satan or Elemental, we should jump 
        to the conclusion that all that region was inhabited by devils or elemental 
        spirits.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing now from the general view of the essentially 
        human character of spirit manifestations, we find a mass of evidence of 
        identity of the spirits who communicate with us, of actual men and women 
        who have lived upon the earth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 3533]]</font> First, 
        we have a general proof of this in the fact of the special languages used 
        in these communications. Any country where English, French, German, or 
        any other language is spoken, the bulk of the communications are in those 
        languages respectively. The Indian spirits who so often in this, their 
        native country, act as the controls of mediums, usually speak in broken 
        English, or some mixture of Indian. Written communications come in many 
        languages, usually intelligible to the recipient, but sometimes, as I 
        have said, not so, and given as tests of spirit power, but always they 
        are some known human languages. To suppose that any lower class of beings 
        should have developed all the forms of human civilised speech seems grossly 
        absurd.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the special points of the identity 
        of spirits with deceased human beings, the evidence is abundant. I will 
        mention a case or two illustrative of this point, taken from my own personal 
        experience, or from the experience of personal friends from whom I have 
        had them direct.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most interesting demonstrations of 
        personal identity was given to me by a gentleman in Washington--perhaps 
        he may be known to some of you--Mr. Bland, a well-known friend of the 
        Indians. He had frequent sittings with a lady medium who was not professional, 
        not paid, but a personal friend of his own. Through this lady medium he 
        obtained frequent communications from his own mother. He knew nothing 
        of spirit photographs, but on one occasion his mother, through this medium, 
        told him that if he would go to a photographer in Cincinnati (I think 
        in Cincinnati he was then living) that she would try and appear upon the 
        plate with him. No photographer's name was mentioned--merely a photographer. 
        He asked the medium if she would go with him. They went out together and 
        went into the first photograph gallery they came to, and asked to have 
        a sitting. They both sat down together and the photographer took the picture 
        of the two, and when he developed the picture said there was something 
        wrong about it because there were three faces instead of two. They said 
        they knew it and it was all right, and to Mr. Bland's astonishment there 
        was the third face, but it was not the face of his mother. This is very 
        important from what follows. He went home and inquired how it was that 
        the face of somebody else came upon the plate. The spirit of his mother 
        then told him that this was a friend who had gone with her who was more 
        experienced in this than she was and had tried the experiment first, but 
        if he would go a second time she would then appear herself. They did so, 
        and on the second occasion the portrait of his mother appeared. Then a 
        friend suggested, to avoid all possibility of doubt of the photographer 
        having got hold of a picture of his mother, that he ask her to appear 
        again upon the plate with some slight change in her dress, which would 
        serve to show it was not a trick of any kind. They went the third time. 
        On this occasion there was another picture, very much like the first, 
        but with this slight difference that she wore a different brooch. These 
        three pictures he showed to me, and I had the account of them from his 
        own mouth. Assuming that he has told the truth, I see hardly any possibility 
        of arriving at any other conclusion than that there was a real communication 
        between himself and his deceased mother.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clear and striking test case was given 
        me by a friend in Washington, a gentleman of the United States army. He 
        has been studying Spiritualism for nearly thirty years. He has had frequent 
        communications from a daughter who died many years ago. On one occasion 
        there came to him in the real visible form a beautiful young lady that 
        he did not know, but who gave her name as Nellie Morrison, and she said 
        she was a friend of his daughter. The next day his daughter came and he 
        asked her who Nellie Morrison was, and she told her father that she was 
        a friend of hers; that she was the daughter of a certain officer, said 
        what his rank was, and all about him, and that he died in Philadelphia. 
        He then made inquiries and ascertained that there was such an officer 
        by that particular name, and that he died at the time alleged. Then he 
        thought he should like more information, so the next time one of these 
        spirits came he asked for further information. He was told that this young 
        lady died also in Philadelphia, where she died, what was her age, and 
        gave the address of her mother-in-law with whom she had lived several 
        years previously. My friend went to Philadelphia, first of all called 
        at the place where she was said to have died, found it perfectly correct; 
        then called upon the mother-in-law, and found that correct.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on another occasion this figure appeared 
        again, and she was remarkable for having most beautiful golden hair, and 
        he asked whether he might have a piece of this hair cut off. He cut off 
        some of this hair, and kept it, has it still, and showed it to me. He 
        went again to call upon the mother-in-law and simply showed this hair--very 
        remarkable in color. The moment she saw it she said, &quot;Why, that is Nelly's 
        hair.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was still one more test on another occasion. 
        When his daughter appeared to him, his daughter spoke of this young lady 
        as Ella. He asked if her real name was Ella, and she answered that they 
        used to call her Ella. He therefore wrote to the mother-in-law to ask 
        whether her daughter-in-law's name was called Ella, and found it was correct.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what makes this series of tests most marvellous 
        and most wonderful, they were all obtained, not from one medium but from 
        different mediums, at different times, and in three cities. There is an 
        accumulation of tests one upon the other, that it seems to me impossible 
        to explain or to get rid of in any other way than that of genuine spirit 
        manifestation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a personal case is better than any second-hand, 
        I will also give you one which happened to myself in America, though not 
        so marvellous as those I have just stated. I had a brother with whom I 
        spent seven years of my early life. He died more than forty years ago. 
        This brother before I was with him had a friend in London whose name was 
        William Martin; my brother's name was William Wallace. I did not know 
        his friend's name was William, because he always spoke of him as Martin; 
        I knew nothing more. But my brother has been dead forty-four years, and 
        I may say that the name of Martin has never occurred to my mind, probably 
        at all during the last twenty years. The other day when I was in Washington 
        attending some s&eacute;ances there, where people receive messages on 
        paper, I received, to my great astonishment, a message to this effect: 
        &quot;I am William Martin; I write for my old friend William Wallace to tell 
        you that he will on another occasion, when he can, communicate with you.&quot; 
        I am perfectly certain that only one person in America knew my brother's 
        name or knew of the relation between my brother and Martin, and that was 
        my brother here in California. I am perfectly certain that no person in 
        the East could possibly have known either one name or the other. Therefore 
        it seems to me this was a most remarkable proof of identity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A volume could be filled of similar and even 
        far more startling facts, proving the personal identity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there are many people who have had only the 
        smallest glimpse of the subject who say, &quot;O yes, the facts may all be 
        true, but these things are certainly not produced by spirits of dead men, 
        for that is absurd.&quot; I ask, &quot;Why absurd?&quot; I have never received any rational 
        answer whatever. I have never been able to find out why it is absurd.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now briefly call your attention to a few 
        of the historical and moral teachings of Spiritualism, supposing it to 
        be true. It seems to me to be no small thing that the Spiritualist is 
        able to accept as history much that the scientist is obliged to reject 
        as imposture or delusion. The Spiritualist can look upon the great Grecian 
        philosopher, Socrates, as a sane man, and his demon as an intelligent 
        spiritual being or guardian angel. The non-Spiritualist is obliged to 
        believe that one of the noblest and purest and wisest of men was not only 
        subject all his life to a mental delusion, but was so weak or foolish 
        or very superstitious during his whole life as not to discover that it 
        was a delusion; they are obliged to hold that this noble man, this subtle 
        reasoner who was looked up to, loved, and admired by the great men who 
        were his pupils and disciples, was imposed upon by his own fancies, and 
        during a long life never discovered they were fancies. It is a great relief 
        not to have to think thus of Socrates.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next place, Spiritualism allows us to 
        believe that the oracles of antiquity were not, from beginning to end, 
        impostures, and that the most intellectual and acute people that ever 
        lived upon the globe were not all deceived. We are told by the historian 
        Plutarch that the prophecies of certain oracles never proved false or 
        incorrect. Would such positive statements be made by such a writer if 
        these oracles were all guesses or imposture? The recorded experiences 
        and demonstrated facts of Modern Spiritualism alone enable us to understand 
        these more ancient recorded facts.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, both the Old and the New Testament 
        are full of Spiritualism, and Spiritualism alone can reconcile the Bible 
        with an intelligent belief. The hand that wrote on the wall at Belshazzar's 
        feast, and the three men unhurt in the fiery furnace, are to Spiritualists 
        actual facts which they need not explain away. St. Paul's statements in 
        regard to Spiritual gifts are to them perfectly intelligible. When Christ 
        cast out evil spirits we can believe that he really did so. We can believe 
        that he turned water into wine, and that the bread and fishes were renewed 
        so that five thousand were fed, as extreme manifestations of power which 
        is still daily at work among us.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, the miracles imputed to the saints 
        come into the same category. We can understand that the great and good 
        St. Bernard performed wonders in broad daylight before thousands of spectators, 
        and which are recorded by eye witnesses. He himself was much troubled 
        by them, wondering why it was such a great gift was bestowed upon him, 
        and feared lest it should make him less humble.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, witchcraft is intelligible to the 
        Spiritualist. Many of the characteristics and phenomena of witchcraft 
        he has witnessed. He is able to separate the facts from the absurd inferences 
        of the people who viewed it with superstition and regarded it as diabolism, 
        which false interpretation resulted in all the horrors of the witchcraft 
        times.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritualism demonstrates the existence of forms 
        of matter and modes of being which are unacceptable from the standpoint 
        of mere physical science. It shows us that mind may exist without brain, 
        and disconnected from any material body that we can detect, and it destroys 
        the presumption against our continued existence after the physical body 
        is disorganised or destroyed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It further demonstrates, by direct evidence as 
        conclusive as the nature of the case admits, that the so-called dead are 
        still alive--that our friends are often with us, though unseen, and give 
        direct proof of a future life, which so many crave, but for want of which 
        so many live and die in anxious doubt. How valuable the certainty to be 
        gained from spiritual communications, removing all questionings as to 
        a future existence. A clergyman, a friend of mine, who had witnessed the 
        spiritual phenomena, and who before was in a state of the greatest depression 
        caused by the death of his son, said to me; &quot;I am now full of confidence 
        and cheerfulness; I am now a changed man.&quot; This is the effect of Modern 
        Spiritualism on a man who had before that rested his belief in Christianity. 
        And this is the best answer to those who ask, &quot;What is the use of it?&quot; 
        Yet many still ask this question, still seek for what they term some practical 
        good, some effect on their material being.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider for a moment what would be the 
        answer of a missionary who was asked by a Zulu or a Chinaman, &quot;What good 
        will Christianity do me? Will it make me live longer? Will it cure me 
        when sick? Will it save my crops from blight? Will it give me good luck 
        in gambling? Will it make me able to conquer my enemies?&quot; Would not the 
        missionary have to reply that it would do none of these things? And yet 
        many who ask this question believe in and pride themselves on their Christianity 
        and civilisation again and again ask the very things of Spiritualism, 
        as if these were the only result which, in their opinion, would make it 
        worth having. To such I can only say that I pity their ideas of spiritual 
        truth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential teaching of Spiritualism is that 
        we are all of us in every act and thought helping to build up a mental 
        and spiritual nature which will be far more complete after the death of 
        the body than it is now; just as this mental fabric is well or ill built, 
        so will our progress and happiness be aided or retarded; just in proportion 
        as we have developed our higher mental or moral nature, or starved it 
        by misuse or undue prominence or physical or sensual enjoyment, shall 
        we be well or ill fitted for the larger life. Spiritualism also teaches 
        that every one will suffer the natural and inevitable consequences of 
        a well or an ill spent life; and the believer receives certain knowledge 
        of these facts regarding a future state.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the existence of evil, that problem of the 
        ages, may be dimly apprehended by Spiritualists as a necessary means of 
        spirit development. The struggle against material difficulties develops 
        the qualities of patience and perseverance and courage, and undoubtedly 
        the fruits of the ages, mercy, unselfishness, and charity could not possibly 
        be exercised and trained except in a world where wrong and oppression, 
        misery and pain and crime, called them into action. Thus even evil may 
        be necessary to work out good. An imperfect world of sin and suffering 
        may be the best and perhaps the only school for developing the highest 
        phase of the personified spiritual existence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now, my friends, to the best of my ability, 
        given you an outline of the facts and teachings of the philosophy of Spiritualism. 
        If I shall have induced even one or two of you to inquire for yourselves 
        earnestly and persistently into this momentous question, I shall be fully 
        rewarded. I now wish you farewell.</p>

<h2>
<a name="Heading6"></a><b>PART I &#8212; INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
<p>For the last 40 or more years, academic administrative lawyers have advocated
an ever-more expansionary role for judicial review of
administrative action, and
their urgings have usually been well-attuned to similarly expansionist
tendencies on the part of the judges.
Expansionists grew accustomed to being on
the winning side, both in Australia and England, but we in Australia are
beginning to learn
that nothing lasts forever, even while the English expansions
continue at almost break-neck speed. Three High Court cases are especially
noteworthy. They are <i>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and
Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte
Lam</i><sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> ('<i>Lam</i>'); <i>NEAT
Domestic Trading Pty Ltd v AWB
Ltd</i><sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> ('<i>NEAT Domestic</i>');
and <i>Griffith University v
Tang</i><sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup> ('<i>Tang</i>').</p>
<p>There will be ups and downs, of course, and it would take more than just
three High Court decisions to turn around the ship of judicial
review. There is
nevertheless some considerable portent in those decisions. This article will
examine only three sets of issues arising
from the cases.</p>
<p>The first set of issues derives from <i>Lam</i>, so far as it scorned the
language of legitimate expectations. That was entirely understandable and need
have been nothing more than
a repudiation of inarticulacy, were it not for the
way it was used in <i>Tang</i>.</p>
<p>The second set of issues derives from <i>NEAT Domestic</i>, which ruled that
the statutory privileges of Australia's monopolist bulk wheat exporter were
unrestrained by any considerations
of public interest. That was said to follow
from the premises that the company concerned was subject neither to review under
the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/" class="autolink_findacts">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</a></i> (Cth)
('<i>ADJR</i>') nor common law judicial review. Both the premises and their
relevance to the conclusion need examining.</p>
<p>The third set of issues is more complicated, because it comes bundled up with
a number of other issues from which this article will
attempt to keep its
distance. <i>Tang</i> denied <i>ADJR </i>coverage of university decisions made
under contract or any other consensual arrangement. That was relatively
uncontroversial because
<i>ADJR</i> is limited to decisions made under
enactments, and there was a long line of authority that this meant (in part)
that the enactment
itself must be the source of the decision's force or effect.
A contract's legal force comes from the general law, not statute. However
the
Court added a minimum force requirement &#8212; the decision's force or effect
must be such that it creates or alters legal rights
or obligations. That
requirement was said to come from Queensland's equivalent of <i>ADJR</i>, but
the Court suggested that in the field of federal judicial review, it could also
be found in the constitutional concept of 'matter'.
That need not have raised
concerns either, because there can be no 'matter' before a federal court in a
constitutional sense unless
some kind of legal rights, duties or liabilities are
at stake, and there can be no federal jurisdiction without a 'matter'. However
<i>Tang</i> ruled that while the University's non-statutory student misconduct
code promised natural justice, the Court would not enforce that
promise, which
was (applying <i>Lam</i>) a mere expectation rather than a legal
entitlement.</p>
<p><i>Tang</i> spells long-term trouble in two respects. First, it is the
strongest indication so far that the High Court will resolve the long-running
debate about the provenance of natural justice against the 'common law' school
led originally by Mason CJ and in favour of the 'implied
or imputed intention of
Parliament' school, led originally by Brennan CJ. This is because <i>Tang's</i>
result would have been different if the misconduct code had been subordinate
legislation. Secondly, and following on from this, <i>Tang</i> also signals
doubts about the possibility of seeking judicial protection of any kind under
relationships covered only by 'soft law'
&#8212; guidelines, procedure manuals,
internal disciplinary codes, and so forth.</p>
<p><i>Lam</i>, <i>NEAT Domestic</i> and <i>Tang</i> have already generated an
unusually large number of articles and comments, each presenting a somewhat
different take on what the
cases decided and therefore on their possible
consequences. Many of the comments on <i>Lam</i> focused on its reversal of an
earlier decision's attempt to patch over the dualist
divide<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup> between domestic and
international law, and they are irrelevant to this
article.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup> In any event, <i>Lam</i>
can no longer be called a recent case. Even if one were to focus only on <i>NEAT
Domestic</i> and <i>Tang</i>, however, there have been over 25 articles and
comments so far,<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> the great bulk of
them extremely critical of the majorities' reasoning, both in doctrinal and
policy terms. Underlying those criticisms
is what appears to be a profound
pessimism as to where the High Court is going in administrative law. The
commentators are keeping
excellent company. Kirby J condemned <i>NEAT
Domestic</i> as a 'wrong turning'<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup>
and 'alarming' for its 'serious reduction in accountability for the exercise of
governmental power'.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> Combined with
<i>Tang</i>, his Honour saw the two decisions as 'an erosion of one of the most
important Australian legal reforms [namely, the <i>ADJR Act</i>] of the last
century'.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> By contrast, his Honour
was largely unfussed by <i>Lam's</i> disparagement of the terminology of
'legitimate expectations', a disparagement he saw as essentially
semantic.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>One might well ask whether there is room for yet another article. Readers
must judge that for themselves, but this article will differ
in two respects. It
will argue that the pessimism about the sustainability of some of the 'core'
achievements of judicial review
in the last 30 or so years has missed the mark.
Specifically, there is no clear and present danger to Australia's expansionist
cases
regarding standing to sue and the expansion of natural justice beyond the
realm of strict legal rights. Pessimism on those scores
is misplaced. Secondly,
however, this article will argue that the recent cases will make it very
difficult for those seeking some
purchase out of the internal guidelines, rule
books and practice manuals of both public and private authorities. These are the
'soft
laws' that abound in both public and private spheres &#8212; 'rules' with
neither statutory nor contractual force. Australia's version
of the rule against
fettering statutory discretions has led its courts to decline to enforce soft
law as such, whether overtly or
via natural justice
principles.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup> The natural justice
consequences which Australian courts give to soft law are strictly procedural,
so that soft law can be 'broken'
if procedural unfairness is avoided (usually by
giving prior warning).<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>England's case law has been handling soft law issues for over 40 years
now.<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup> Perhaps the greatest
accelerant to their case law was the overthrow of their once-total prohibition
against estoppel in public law.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup>
Decisions under the soft law of public authorities have been judicially reviewed
on a number of grounds. These include procedural
unfairness, error of law or
misinterpretation of the rules,<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup>
irrationality, abuse of power, and (very occasionally) substantive unfairness.
The soft law decisions of private bodies exercising
large disciplinary powers
are also subject to judicial supervision in England on the same grounds,
although procedurally that exercise
is not called 'judicial
review',<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup> because the soft law is
given a somewhat fictional contractual status.</p>
<p>Speaking very broadly, the critical issue for Australia concerns judicial
review's adaptability to the changing forms of public power.
This article would
not advocate following all of the English developments. Our courts should
nevertheless recognise that public power
is increasingly exercised from places
within the private sector, by non-government bodies, and according to rules
found in management
manuals rather than statute books. If judicial review is
about the restraint of public power, it will need to confront these shifts
in
who exercises public power, and in the rules by which they exercise it.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading33"></a><b>PART II &#8212; LAM</b></h2>
<p>The issues in <i>Lam</i> are too well known to need more than a very brief
sketch. Whilst serving a lengthy prison sentence for heroin trafficking, Mr Lam
was officially warned that he might be deported because of his undoubtedly 'bad
character'. He was given a chance to explain why
he should not be deported, and
he presented a comprehensive submission. This included material from the woman
caring for his two
children. The Department had told him that they wanted to
contact the carer, but they changed their minds without warning him. He
wanted
to say that this was itself a breach of procedural fairness, not because he
would have done anything different (because he
would not), but simply because it
was a promise broken without any prior warning, and therefore a negation of a
'legitimate expectation'.
The argument was hopeless because there was no
'practical injustice',<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup> although
there has understandably been some concern since <i>Lam</i> as to the
circumstances in which 'practical injustice' might be considered a live issue
and as to who might bear the evidential and
legal
burdens.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Court gave a range of reasons for rejecting Mr Lam's appeal to the
concept of 'legitimate expectations'. Most of those reasons
are not strictly
germane to this article. As used in the cases, the 'expectation' was often
something that the subject had not entertained
in fact. Rather, the subject
could more accurately be said to have
'naturally'<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup> or 'reasonably'
assumed a certain course of conduct on the decision-maker's part or taken it for
granted.<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup> It is submitted that in
such cases, it might be more straightforward to talk of 'reasonable
assumptions'.</p>
<p>Where the decision-maker actually created the relevant expectation in the
subject's mind (for example, by promising a certain course
of conduct), then it
is strictly superfluous to refer to a 'legitimate expectation'. Its legitimacy
is not relevant. Its existence
is indeed relevant, but only because the
decision-maker was its cause. The focus should be on whether the
decision-maker's conduct
in making and then breaching the expectation was fair
in the circumstances. Of course, there will usually be no unfairness if the
subject was adequately forewarned of the decision-maker's change of
course.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup> However, <i>Lam's</i>
bottom line was that it is not <i>necessarily</i> a breach of natural justice to
disappoint the expectation without prior warning. The focus must remain on
whether the departure from
the promised conduct was unfair in the circumstances,
and it was clearly not in <i>Lam</i> itself, because Mr Lam had in effect
conceded that he had not been misled into presenting anything less than his full
case.</p>
<p>So far as 'legitimate expectation' was meant to indicate something akin to a
vested legal right or interest deserving of natural justice
protection,
<i>Lam's</i> judgments said that it was both unconvincing and
unnecessary.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup> Kirby J took no
part in <i>Lam</i>, but he subsequently agreed that this usage of the term was a
'fiction' that is no longer
necessary.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Acknowledging the redundancy of this particular usage of 'legitimate
expectations' was welcome. Lord Denning had invented the term
to describe the
nature of a putative deportee's interest in his unexpired visa, but <i>Kioa v
West</i><sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup> had since delivered
natural justice to putative deportees who had no semblance of legal entitlement
because their visas had expired.
<i>Lam's</i> insistence that this use of
'legitimate expectations' was redundant was surely a win for administrative
law's expansionists, although
'reaffirmation' might strictly be more accurate
than 'win', because there were earlier judgments giving strong support to the
view
that there was a prima facie entitlement to natural justice whenever state
administrative power was aimed directly at an individual
on grounds personal to
that individual.<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup> In other words,
natural justice had expanded from the protection of a person's interests, to the
protection of a person. In <i>Kioa</i> itself, Brennan J had supported this
expansion so that judicial review would keep pace with the extension of state
power.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup> His Honour had argued
that state power intruded into many facets of individual autonomy (an 'almost
infinite variety of interests')<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup>
which were simply beyond meaningful analogy to 'legal rights or interests'. He
had concluded that they were nevertheless equally
deserving of natural justice
protection, and that the terminology of 'legitimate expectations' gave him no
assistance in coming to
that conclusion.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly for <i>Tang</i>, all of <i>Lam's</i> judgments
emphatically insisted that whatever may be said for or against a subject's
'legitimate expectations' (whether actually
held or reasonably assumed), it was
wholly impermissible that they be enforced as such. Although Mr Lam had
disclaimed any argument
to the contrary, the judgments correctly observed that
his argument came very close. Mr Lam had argued that the only circumstance
in
which the promise could <i>not</i> be broken was where the subject was given
adequate prior warning. In essence, the Court reasoned that if breaking a
promise is fair
if forewarned, then the critical test is fairness, not warning.
Were it otherwise and fairness was to be irrelevant to Mr Lam's circumstances,
then the Court would indeed have been enforcing expectations generated by
promises.</p>
<p><i>Lam</i> therefore rejected enforcement of expectations as such, and it
<i>explained</i> this by saying that expectations were not 'substantive rights'.
Whether the case was one where expectations would trigger a natural
justice
entitlement otherwise lacking,<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup>
or was simply a situation where they would assist in determining what might be
procedurally fair in any particular context, the highest
protection that natural
justice gives to legitimate expectations is procedural. This will usually amount
to a warning, and if natural
justice is breached, the decision will be quashed,
leaving the decision-maker free<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup>
to come to the same conclusion after warning the subject that the promise no
longer holds. The Court said that to go further (as
the English cases have
done)<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup> would be tantamount to
converting a 'procedural' protection into a 'substantive
right'.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two conclusions are inevitable. First, <i>Lam's</i> distinction between the
'procedural' protections of natural justice and 'substantive rights' meant that
even if one were to speak
of an 'entitlement' or 'right' to natural justice, it
would still be something different from a 'substantive' right. That is really
only a semantic point, but it will be submitted that it must be borne in mind
when reading <i>Tang</i>. The second conclusion is that a decision-maker's
promise can generate an expectation sufficient in itself to trigger the
procedural
'right' to natural justice, even though the subject has no
substantive rights at stake. That too must be borne in mind when reading
<i>Tang</i>, which adds a worrying proviso.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading57"></a><b>PART III &#8212; NEAT DOMESTIC</b></h2>
<p>So far as it covers the export of wheat in bulk, Australia's wheat market has
long been subject to federal regulation, on the hypothesis
that the
international wheat market is subject to entrenched market failures, including
anti-competitive conduct on the part of the
United States and the European
Union, and a lack of market transparency. Federal and State regulation was also
upheld for a number
of years on the basis that it could be used to protect the
growers, levelling out the troughs and spikes in an otherwise volatile
market.
Federal regulation used to be effected through a statutory creation called the
Australian Wheat Board ('the Board'), which
was the sole owner of the export
wheat 'pool'. In other words, the Board was a classic case of regulation through
the rights of ownership
&#8212; a common style of regulation before the era of
privatisation and outsourcing. The Commonwealth government still retains a
large
measure of control over the wheat export market, although this is no longer
achieved through its rights as owner.</p>
<p>At the time relevant to the <i>NEAT Domestic</i> litigation, legislation had
abolished the Board's domestic monopoly in 1984, and amendments in 1998 to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</i> <i>1989</a></i> (Cth) ('<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i>') had
transferred the Board's wheat to a private sector company which was subsequently
listed as AWB Ltd, a company incorporated
by registration under the generic
<i>Corporations Law</i> then applying. Its constitution required it to look out
for its profits and the interests of wheat growers, and those requirements
applied equally to its wholly owned subsidiary, AWB (International) Ltd
('AWBI'). A new regulator was established to replace the
old Board. This was the
Wheat Export Authority ('the Authority'), a statutory authority with very
limited functions. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 57</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i> provided that
anyone other than AWBI needed the Authority's approval before they could export
in bulk, and no approval could be given
unless AWBI also approved. Refusals on
AWBI's part to accede to requests for permission to export would have risked
action against
it for breach of the restrictive trade practices provisions of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</i> <i>1974</a></i> (Cth) ('<i>TPA</i>') were it not for
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(6).</a> Subsection (6) deemed AWBI's exports <i>and</i> 'anything ... done
by [AWBI] under this section or for the purposes of this section' to have been
'specifically authorised' for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57.</a> Conduct so 'authorised'
attracted no liability for breach of the <i>TPA's</i> restrictive trade
practices provisions.</p>
<p>The issue in <i>NEAT Domestic</i> was whether AWBI's persistent blocking of
NEAT's applications to the Authority for export approvals was 'specifically
authorised'
for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(6).</a> If not, then there was a chance of
suing AWBI for breaching the <i>TPA</i>. NEAT argued that the refusals were not
'authorised' because they were 'unlawful' or even 'invalid' on the
administrative law ground
that AWBI had applied a blanket policy of refusing all
applications, and had not considered NEAT's applications on their merits.
AWBI
had certainly been perfunctory and downright rude in its treatment of NEAT's
applications, but need it have been anything else?
As a private sector company
legitimately focused on the profit motive, was it entitled to take the view that
<i>any</i> relaxation of its export monopoly could constitute a threat to its
own markets? Gleeson CJ and Kirby J thought not.</p>
<p>The joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ appeared to be radically
different on this point.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup> It not
only said that AWBI <i>could</i> regard all parallel exports as a threat to its
bottom line; it even hinted that this was the only view
possible.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup> Two separate pieces of
amending legislation have since pulled the rug out from underneath that
particular argument. The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i> was amended in
2003<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> to provide that when
deciding whether to grant export consents, the Authority had to 'seek to
complement' AWBI's net returns 'while
at the same time seeking to facilitate the
development of niche and other markets where the Authority considers that this
may benefit
both growers and the wider
community.'<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second amendment occurred in 2006, as a short-term response to a public
scandal. A royal commission report had upheld many serious
allegations against
AWBI's parent company in relation to its wheat sales to Iraq in contravention of
the UN's oil-for-food sanctions
program.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup> Both the government and
the Authority were found to have been asleep on the job, with serious
repercussions for Australia's wheat
exports. The government's short-term fix was
to secure temporary legislation<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup>
which did two things. First, it empowered the Minister to override any decision
of the Authority approving or rejecting an application
for export consent.
Secondly, it transferred AWBI's role under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(3B)</a> to the Minister, with an
explicit direction that it be exercised according to the Minister's view of the
public interest. At the
time of writing, the government had not decided whether
it would relinquish the Minister's temporary veto power over other would-be
bulk
exporters, and if so, whether that power would be restored to AWBI or to any
other company. It seems fairly clear, however,
that if the monopoly power is to
remain, the Authority will have to be prodded from its torpor. One might also
predict that any longer
term controls over wheat exporting will have to be
exercised on public interest grounds. <i>NEAT Domestic</i>, therefore, may soon
be of largely historical interest so far as it related specifically to the wheat
marketing laws.</p>
<p>However, <i>NEAT Domestic's</i> potential impact remains large because its
judgments went further than addressing whether NEAT's pleaded ground of review
had been
made out on the facts or was ever available. The joint judgment's
reasons for concluding that AWBI could legitimately oppose all
parallel exports
led their Honours to two further and far more significant conclusions. The first
was explicit, namely, that AWBI
was immune from judicial review's remedies,
whether under <i>ADJR</i> or at common law. The second was implicit, namely,
that not only were judicial review's <i>remedies</i> unavailable, but also its
<i>grounds</i>, even in a 'private law' action (such as NEAT's damages claim for
breach of the <i>TPA</i>).<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup> These
conclusions were not required for the disposition of the case, and it is
therefore submitted that it is worth testing them.</p>
<p><i>Kioa</i> held that the fact that <i>ADJR</i> applied (in those days) to
migration decisions was irrelevant to the question of which (if any) of its
grounds of review conditioned
the valid exercise of those
decisions.<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup> In other words, the
grounds of judicial review do not always come as a package. That result surely
cuts both ways, so that the fact
that one ground of judicial review is
unavailable does not necessarily entail the unavailability of judicial review on
any other
ground.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one could make a case for the imposition of some of judicial
review's principles even if one were to concede the unavailability
of its
remedies. Imagine, for example, that there had been two companies (NEAT and
another) seeking approval to sell the same quantity
and quality of wheat to the
same buyer for the same price. Imagine further that NEAT's competitor won the
approval because it bribed
AWBI. The conduct surrounding the bribe would
probably constitute a criminal offence even if the Authority were kept in the
dark,<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> and one could surely argue
that a criminally corrupt decision on AWBI's part was not 'specifically
authorised' under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(6)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i>, and therefore not
protected from suit for violation of the <i>TPA</i>. Just as private sector
clubs and sporting associations are often required to observe natural justice
even though judicial review
is not the vehicle for enforcing that
requirement,<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup> there was room in
<i>NEAT Domestic</i> for arguing that AWBI's conduct was subject to <i>some</i>
of judicial review's <i>grounds</i> if not its <i>remedies</i>. Gleeson CJ's
dissent raised similar concerns, when he supposed that AWBI would not be
'authorised' to act on the bases of personal
animosity or
favouritism.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>The great bulk of the literature which is critical of <i>NEAT Domestic</i>
has tended to focus on the reasons for its conclusion that judicial review was
unavailable as against AWBI, whether under <i>ADJR </i>or at common law. Taking
<i>ADJR</i> first, the majority held that the company's power to grant or refuse
its consent came from its status as a normal private sector
company, rather than
from the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i>. That Act was seen merely as making consent
a precondition to an approval from the
Authority.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup> It is indeed valid to
distinguish between Acts which empower or merely recognise a person's consent
(or veto), but reasons need to
be given for choosing either
characterisation.</p>
<p>One could conceive of a planning law which conditions the success of my
neighbour's development application upon my consent. That
would hardly make my
refusal an exercise of public power sufficient to require its exercise according
to judicial review's principles.
In <i>NEAT Domestic</i> itself, the majority
said that it was 'neither necessary <i>nor appropriate</i> to read' AWBI's veto
power as deriving from the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing
Act</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></sup> It was certainly not
'necessary' because the Act did not explicitly address the
point,<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></sup> but one might question
whether it was also inappropriate. The majority's only hint as to why it was
inappropriate to read AWBI's
decision as one made under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing
Act</a></i> was that the Act carefully distinguished the roles of the company and
the Authority, and that it was easier to imply 'public interest'
limitations on
the Authority's discretion than on AWBI's role. In contrast, Gleeson CJ thought
that it was wrong to view AWBI as
representing only its members' interests. Its
monopoly was, in his Honour's view, conferred because the company was thought to
represent
wider interests, including those of other growers, and the general
public.<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The majority gave two more reasons for its conclusion that judicial review
was unavailable, but it seems that these related more generally
to common law
judicial review than to <i>ADJR</i> review. Both reasons linked back to AWBI's
nature as a private sector company focused on maximising its profits. This
article has
already mentioned one of those reasons, which was the view that the
company could reasonably regard <i>all</i> parallel exports as constituting some
sort of threat to its own profits. The other reason was that the company's
private status and
profit-maximising character pulled against interpreting the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i> as imposing any enforceable duty upon the company
even to consider an application (to the Authority) for export approval, let
alone
to consider it with some undefined public interests in
mind.<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a></sup> It seems that their
Honours thought it improbable that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i> would have
intended to impose the same or similar requirements to consider 'public'
interests on two bodies at two different stages.</p>
<p>It is submitted that the element common to each critical component in the
majority's reasoning was not (as some have contended) that
AWBI was 'private'.
That fact was taken as the starting point of an inquiry which assumed (for the
sake of argument) that judicial
review and its principles might sometimes apply
to private bodies.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a></sup> Rather, the
common element was the perceived incompatibility of a profit-maximising company
having to pay regard to the interests
(including the profits) of others.</p>
<p>One of public law's classical building blocks has been the difference in
starting points between public and private bodies. Provided
they do not invade
other people's rights or violate positive law, private actors are not legally
obliged to consider the interests
of others, let alone to further those
interests. This assumes an overall public benefit (at least in the economic
sphere) from a
society composed of entirely self-regarding autonomous
individuals. Public authorities start with an opposite presumption, that all
public power is held on the public's behalf, to the exclusion of the personal
interests of those who wield it. The assumption here
is that office-holders can
act without regard to their self-interests, an assumption, incidentally, which
public choice theory would
deny. Each assumption has its fierce supporters and
detractors, but Anglo-Australian administrative law has rarely questioned this
particular building block. Its best-known exposition appeared unchanged in the
late Professor Wade's work through nine editions:</p>
<blockquote>
The powers of public authorities are therefore essentially different from those
of private persons. A man making his will may, subject
to any rights of his
dependants, dispose of his property just as he may wish. He may act out of
malice or a spirit of revenge, but
in law this does not affect his exercise of
his power. In the same way a private person has an absolute power to allow whom
he likes
to use his land, release a debtor, or, where the law permits, to evict
a tenant, regardless of his motives. This is unfettered discretion.
But a public
authority may do none of these things unless it acts reasonably and in good
faith and upon lawful and relevant grounds
of public interest. &#8230; The whole
conception of unfettered discretion is inappropriate to a public authority,
which possesses
powers solely in order that it may use them for the public
good.<a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></blockquote><p>The word here
italicised is axiomatic, just as it was in <i>NEAT Domestic</i> &#8212; the
imposition of public law restraints upon private actors is axiomatically
'<i>inappropriate</i>'. By contrast, European legal systems have long restrained
private rights-holders with variants of an 'abuse of rights'
concept,<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup> a concept unknown to
the common law.<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>The trouble is that a binary divide between utter selfishness and saintly
altrusim cannot work in a world where power and the institutions
which wield it
are hybridised, being neither wholly private nor public. The imposition of
other-regarding duties upon public actors,
and the denial of such duties in the
case of private actors, assumes that public actors perform only public
functions, and that private
actors perform only private functions. Private
bodies performing public functions simply fail to accord with the traditional
asumptions.
Even if self-interest is the very essence of an ideal-type private
<i>body</i>, it makes no sense to conclude that any governmental
<i>functions</i> it might also be exercising are therefore immune from public
law considerations. Hybrid bodies fit neither the public nor the private
ideal
types. One could add that even if the distinction were to work as a merely
indicative criterion of the availability of judicial
review's <i>remedies</i>,
it could not work as any sort of criterion for determining which one or more of
judicial review's <i>principles</i> should restrain the exercise of public power
by private bodies.</p>
<p>Even if AWBI's commercial focus made that company an inappropriate repository
of a duty to consider the commercial interests of others,
that was no reason to
remove the company entirely from the regime of judicial review and its remaining
principles. AWBI had more
than just the ordinary power of a company to say 'no'
to a question from the Authority. It had more power than the Authority itself,
which had no relevant function without the company's consent. Whether the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/wma1989162/" class="autolink_findacts">Wheat Marketing Act</a></i> granted or merely recognised that power was a
distinction relevant only to the issue of <i>ADJR</i> coverage. It was not put
forward as the test for determining the availability of common law judicial
review. It seems that the common
law's judicial review was held to be
unavailable because the Court did not envisage any middle ground between utter
selfishness and
complete altruism.</p>
<p>If <i>NEAT Domestic</i> is disappointing, therefore, it is not because it
asked the wrong question, but because it posed the wrong test for answering it.
The real question for common law judicial review should be whether AWBI was
exercising public or private
power.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup> That is how the English
cases frame the issue,<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></sup> although
<i>NEAT Domestic</i> framed it in terms of the distinction between self-centred
and altruistic bodies.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a></sup> Framed so
obliquely, one should not be too surprised that the question received an answer
so plainly wrong.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading99"></a><b>PART IV &#8212; TANG</b></h2>
<p>Of the three major cases on which this article focuses, <i>Tang</i> is both
the most complex and the most worrying, not because of its outcome (which was
entirely predictable) but because of its reasoning.
The University had
terminated the enrolment of a doctoral student (Ms Tang) who had allegedly been
caught fabricating her research
results. Ms Tang alleged breaches of natural
justice and of the University's disciplinary code. What sank her case was that
the University's
code was soft law &#8212; it was neither primary nor
subordinate legislation. She failed in her attempt to invoke the judicial review
jurisdiction of Queensland's equivalent of <i>ADJR</i>, because the relevant
decisions had not been made 'under an
enactment'.<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>The same result would have been on the cards if the University rules which Ms
Tang alleged were broken had been contractual. The Full
Court of the Federal
Court had long decided against <i>ADJR</i> coverage for contractual decisions,
whether those were decisions about awarding contracts or decisions 'under'
existing contracts.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a></sup> However,
neither party alleged a contractual relationship between Ms Tang and the
University. Nor had Ms Tang sought common law judicial
review.</p>
<p>In brief, <i>Tang's</i> joint judgment said that there were two components of
<i>ADJR's</i> requirement that reviewable decisions be made 'under an
enactment':</p>
<blockquote>
The determination of whether a decision is 'made ... under an enactment'
involves two criteria:  first, the decision must be expressly
or impliedly
required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself
confer, alter or otherwise affect legal
rights or obligations, and in that sense
the decision must derive from the enactment.  A decision will only be 'made ...
under an
enactment' if both these criteria are
met.<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
majority's view of the first component is
welcome.<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a></sup> Their Honours said that
it is easily satisfied, because even if the relevant Act did not 'require' the
decision,<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a></sup> or explicitly
authorise it, it will frequently be appropriate to imply that a decision was
'authorised'. For example, a decision
to make a contract is sufficiently
'authorised' by an Act which gave its maker contractual capacity. In that sense,
statutes 'authorise'
the contracts of all statutory authorities and all
companies whose corporate status derives from statute. However, a statutory
capacity
to decide something is only half the battle. The second step is to ask
whether the 'decision ... itself' has created, altered or
imposed legal rights,
duties or liabilitites. The existence of this second step is not immediately
obvious from <i>ADJR</i> itself, but <i>Tang's</i> implication of some sort of
extra requirement was readily understandable.</p>
<p>If <i>ADJR</i> had extended to the contractual decisions of all companies
incorporated under statute and to all statutory authorities, there would
have
been a huge disconformity between the scope of judicial review under <i>ADJR</i>
and the common law. As already noted, English judicial review has extended to
private bodies so far as they are exercising public
power (the <i>NEAT
Domestic</i> problem), an extension which has shifted focus from the nature or
status of the decision-making body to the nature of its power.
That in its turn
has led to decisions rejecting judicial review coverage of government's
contractual decisions, mainly (if not solely)
because their power is
consensual.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a></sup> One can understand
the High Court's attempt to keep the scope of <i>ADJR</i> and common law
judicial review roughly in parallel. It is that attempt which underpinned the
joint judgment's explanation of why
<i>ADJR</i> provides no coverage to
contractual decisions.<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a></sup> The
judgment explained that a decision to make a contract has no binding
consequences until the counterparty consents, at which point
the consequences
are provided by the general law and not by statute. Similarly, decisions under
existing contracts generally owe
their force only to the general law of
contract, and not to statute. The judgment emphasised the consensual nature of
contractual
power, in contrast to a statutory power <i>unilaterally</i> to
affect another's rights or
obligations.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></sup> There is an obvious
parallel with the common law's reasons for refusing judicial review of
contractual decisions.</p>
<p>It is submitted that the requirement that the decision should 'itself' affect
rights or obligations was not intended to be taken literally.
Whether it is a
decision to make a contract or one made under an existing contract, it is
submitted that the decision will 'itself'
have the relevant effect if it
<i>triggers</i> statutory consequences with impacts in the realm of legal rights
or obligations.</p>
<p>The joint judgment's extended explanation of why <i>ADJR</i> provides no
coverage of contractual decisions was relevant in <i>Tang</i>, even though
neither party had alleged a contractual basis for the University's misconduct
rules. The judgment characterised the
relationship between Ms Tang and the
University as merely 'consensual', although its consensual nature was weaker
than that applying
under contract, because it was terminable by either party at
will, being based upon
'mutuality'.<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[63]</a></sup> If the University's
relationship with its student was truly consensual and terminable at will, then
the judgment reached the only
conclusion available, because the University could
hardly be said to have 'breached' a provision in a code which imposed no legal
restraints on either party. Further, the same result would have applied even if
Ms Tang had sought common law judicial review.</p>
<p><i>Tang's</i> real disappointment, however, lies in its conclusion that there
was nothing more to the university-student relationship than mutual
consent. The
relationship between universities and their students is notoriously unequal.
That alone would not warrant calling universities'
power 'public', but there are
additional factors. Universities receive massive public support in specie and in
kind from State and
federal governments. Depending on the university's principal
location, they pay the price of having State, Commonwealth or Territorial
government nominees on their governing bodies. University degrees receive
legislative 'brand' protection against non-accredited bodies
handing out awards
with the same or similar titles. Students can borrow against their future income
tax liabilities to pay for their
fees. Each jurisdiction's Ombudsman has
jurisdiction over university decisions and conduct, and each jurisdiction's
Auditor General
has jurisdiction. Many universities have their State Governor as
official visitor. Ministers and oppositions alike freely offer their
views on
how universities should be run and even, on occasion, what they should teach.
Even if one were to apply as an indicative
test the old distinction between
self-regarding and altruistic bodies, universities would surely be treated as
bound to act in the
public interest, and none of them would contend that they do
otherwise.</p>
<p>One could produce a tortured analysis of the relationship between each
statute and each university to sustain each of these points
in the argument, but
the end result would be obvious. More importantly, it is submitted that the
joint judgment itself would not
deny the 'publicness' of the universities' power
in a very general sense. What counted in that judgment was not whether the
University
was exercising power that could be called 'public', but whether that
power's impact could be traced to a statute or subordinate legislation.
In other
words, what mattered was that the University's academic misconduct code lacked
statutory force. The code could have been
brought into force as subordinate
legislation, and if it had, then <i>ADJR</i> would have provided coverage and,
it is submitted, the judgment would also have seen no obstacle to common law
judicial review. This
appears reasonably clearly from the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
Nor is it to the point that the Council, rather than exercise its powers of
delegation to the Committees involved, might have exercised
its power to make
university statutes or rules. The exercise of one rather than another concurrent
power available to the University
is insufficient to attract the Review Act
[Queensland's equivalent of ADJR] to decisions later made by the Committees.<br>
The decisions of which the respondent complains were authorised, albeit not
required, by the University Act. The Committees involved
depended for their
existence and powers upon the delegation by the Council of the University under
ss 6 and 11 of the University
Act. But that does not mean that the decisions of
which the respondent complains were 'made under' the University Act in the sense
required to make them reviewable under the Review Act. The decisions did not
affect legal rights and obligations. They had no impact
upon matters to which
the University Act gave legal force and effect. The respondent enjoyed no
relevant legal rights and the University
had no obligations under the University
Act with respect to the course of action the latter adopted towards the
former.<a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[64]</a></blockquote><p>Some important
conclusions follow if this reading of <i>Tang</i> is correct, namely, that it
was the lack of statutory force in the University's academic misconduct code
which made all the difference.
In one sense, that reading is obvious because
<i>Tang's</i> issue was whether the challenged decision was made 'under an
enactment' for <i>ADJR</i> purposes. However, the joint judgment's conclusions
in the second paragraph of the above quotation were also relevant to common law
judicial review in the exercise of federal jurisdiction. The judgment rightly
sought to give Queensland's <i>JRA</i> the same interpretation which would apply
to cases brought under the Commonwealth's <i>ADJR Act</i>. In the Commonwealth
context, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> restricts the exercise of judicial power to the
resolution of 'matters', a term which requires the presence of 'some immediate
right,
duty or liability to be established by the determination of the
Court.'<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>The judgment's exposition of the two components to <i>JRA's</i> requirement
that the challenged decision be made under an enactment stated that it drew
'support' from the need to construe the same
term as it occurs in <i>ADJR</i> in
a manner which accommodates the constitutional requirement that there be a
'matter' for judicial
resolution.<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[66]</a></sup> The inference was
that there were two reasons for saying that <i>Tang's</i> result would have been
the same, even if one were to hypothesise switching its facts from a Queensland
university to the Canberra-based
Australian National University ('ANU'). The ANU
is subject to <i>ADJR</i>. The first reason would have been based purely in the
statutory construction of <i>ADJR</i>. However, that construction would have
received 'support' from the federal judiciary's restriction to the resolution of
'matters',
because Ms Tang's allegations would have failed to raise a 'matter'.
There would have been no 'matter' in a constitutional sense
because the
University neither created nor overrode any relevant legal rights of Ms Tang,
and the University lacked any relevant
legal obligations. On the other hand,
there would have been a 'matter' if any one or more of those three factors were
present. The
inference that there would have been no 'matter' on the
hypothesised facts means that both common law and <i>ADJR</i> review would have
been unavailable against the ANU.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this article to analyse the complexities of the
constitutional learning on what is needed to constitute
a 'matter' for the
purposes of federal jurisdiction. One can note, however, that purely advisory
opinions are said to lie outside
the definition of 'matter' and, as importantly,
it is not entirely clear when an opinion might be said to be purely
advisory.<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[67]</a></sup> Declaratory relief
used to be restricted to cases where other relief was either granted or
claimable, but that changed over a century
ago with the introduction of the new
Judicature Rules, allowing the court to 'make binding declarations of<i>
right</i> whether any consequential relief is or could be claimed, or
not'.<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[68]</a></sup> The word here italicised
has long been a puzzle, because the provision has been acknowledged as providing
for declaratory relief
even though there is no cause of action. In effect, the
ability to seek declaratory relief <i>is</i> the 'right'. Gibbs ACJ said in
<i>Sankey v Whitlam</i>  that 'the word "right" ... is used in a sense that is
wide and loose.'<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[69]</a></sup> The English
Rules have dropped it,<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[70]</a></sup> but not
before their courts started referring to 'the development of a new advisory
declaratory jurisdiction'.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[71]</a></sup> In
Australia, Hutley JA said that 'right' is used in a sense broad enough to go
beyond any legal bonds between the parties, but is
still confined to the 'sphere
of legal relations'.<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[72]</a></sup> That might
even stretch to allowing declaratory relief against a club for breach of its
rules at the instance of a
non-member.<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[73]</a></sup> Until <i>Tang</i>,
one would not have doubted the availability of at least declaratory relief to
someone in Ms Tang's position. Even if her relationship
with the University was
based upon 'mutuality', the University had always asserted its intention to
abide by its own 'rules', and
that would have sufficed for the declaratory
jurisdiction of a State Supreme
Court.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[74]</a></sup> One of the concerns
flowing from <i>Tang</i> must be whether it will lead to a narrowing of the
availability of declaratory relief when it is sought in the exercise of federal
jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading135"></a><b>PART V &#8212; DISENTANGLING TANG</b></h2>
<p><i>Tang</i> has come in for some fierce criticism on the ground that it
effectively puts both statutory and common law judicial review off-limits
for
litigants without an existing or putative legal right, duty or liability. The
argument is that <i>Tang</i> has narrowed the concept of 'matter' by ruling that
'legal rights, duties or liabilities' no longer include 'interests' falling
short
of those three terms. The critics conclude from this that <i>Tang</i>
undermines the liberalisation of the rules about standing to sue, and that it
undermines the expansion of natural justice to realms
where (as in <i>Kioa</i>)
the subject has no legal rights or interests to protect. It is submitted that
these criticisms have missed their proper target.</p>
<p>Taking the standing rules first, it is submitted that those without legally
recognisable rights, duties or liabilities will still
have standing to sue if
they are relevantly aggrieved or affected. <i>Tang</i> explicitly acknowledged
that the cases on standing are no longer
rights-focused.<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[75]</a></sup> Kirby J's
dissent alleged that the majority's view of a 'matter' meant that there was no
point in having liberalised standing rules,
because a case would never get to
that point if a case with interests less than rights would never meet the new
test of 'matter'.<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[76]</a></sup> With respect,
that is correct only if one were to treat the requirement that there be some
legal right, duty or liability as one
which falls only upon the subject who
challenges the government party's decision or conduct. Despite some
post-<i>Tang</i> confusion as to whether that was the majority's
intent,<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[77]</a></sup> it is submitted that the
requisite rights, duties or liabilities need not belong
to<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[78]</a></sup> or be imposed upon the
subject who is challenging the government action. It will remain sufficient to
constitute a 'matter' if the
subject is challenging a government party for
breach of a legal restriction upon the latter's capacity or powers, although the
challenge
may have to be by common law judicial review or even a non-supervisory
remedy rather than by review under <i>ADJR</i>. For example, a government party
purporting to enter into a contract in breach of a legislative restriction can
still be corrected
by court order, even though the unlawful decision to enter
the contract was not a decision under an enactment for <i>ADJR</i>
purposes.<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nearly 15 years before <i>Tang</i>, the High Court granted declaratory relief
to a person and his company who were acknowledged to have no relevant legal
rights. That
was in <i>Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission</i>
('<i>Ainsworth</i>'),<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[80]</a></sup> where the
Commission was held to have breached its natural justice obligations towards the
applicants. Without giving them any warning,
let alone a chance to defend
themselves, the Commission had been highly critical of the applicants in a
report it had sent to Parliament,
but its Act protected it from defamation
liability. Brennan J said that the Commission's report</p>
<blockquote>
did not affect the [applicants'] &#8230; rights or liabilities and it did not
subject their rights or liabilities to any new hazard.
There has been no
exercise of a statutory power the setting aside of which would change the
[applicants'] legal rights or liabilities.
The only, though significant, way in
which the Report affected the interests of the [applicants] was by damaging
their reputations.<a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[81]</a></blockquote><p>The
critical factor for Brennan J was whether the Commission was exercising
statutory power. His Honour was extremely doubtful as
to the availability of
judicial review if the Commission had been exercising non-statutory or
prerogative power.<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[82]</a></sup> His judgment
was in that respect simply one of several instalments in a debate that continues
to this day as to whether some<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[83]</a></sup>
or all of judicial review's grounds must be traceable to statute, or whether
(and if so, in what circumstances) some grounds have
a common law provenance
such that they can restrict the exercise of non-statutory public
power.<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[84]</a></sup> However, Brennan J had no
doubt about the applicants' entitlement to declaratory relief, because the
Commission was exercising statutory
power, and:</p>
<blockquote>
the broad purpose of judicial review is to ensure that statutory authority,
which carries with it the weight of State-approved action
and the supremacy of
the law, is not claimed for or attributed to decisions or acts that lie outside
the statute.<a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[85]</a></blockquote><p>His Honour was
undeterred by the consideration that anyone could write a report, albeit without
an immunity from defamation
liability.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[86]</a></sup> For Brennan J,
therefore, judicial review's primary job was to enforce the statutory limits to
the exercise of public power. It was
neither limited to the protection of an
applicant's rights,<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[87]</a></sup> nor limited
to the protection of anyone's rights or interests. The latter proposition
emerged only inferentially in <i>Ainsworth</i>, but his Honour had already made
it explicit only two years earlier, in <i>Attorney-General (NSW) v
Quin</i>.<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[88]</a></sup> His Honour there
insisted that the court's role in judicial review was 'the declaration and
enforcing of the law which determines
the limits and governs the exercise of the
repository's power', regardless of whether that might achieve the correction of
'administrative
injustice or
error'.<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[89]</a></sup> The focus on illegality
would in his Honour's view take precedence over a focus on rights or
interests:</p>
<blockquote>
The consequence is that the scope of judicial review must be defined not in
terms of the protection of individual interests but in
terms of the extent of
power and the legality of its exercise. In Australia, the modern development and
expansion of the law of judicial
review of administrative action have been
achieved by an increasingly sophisticated exposition of implied limitations on
the extent
or the exercise of statutory power, but those limitations are not
calculated to secure judicial scrutiny of the merits of a particular
case.<a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[90]</a></blockquote><p>The 'consequence' to
which his Honour referred in <i>Quin</i> was, with respect, fairly obvious
&#8212; particularly in light of the liberalisation of the rules as to standing
and <i>Kioa's</i> extensions to the scope of natural justice. The fact that
Gummow J quoted that passage with approval in <i>NAIS v Minister for Immigration
and Multicultural and Indigenous
Affairs</i><sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[91]</a></sup> therefore makes it
even less probable that his Honour would have intended <i>Tang's</i> joint
judgment (in which he participated) to be taken as an implied repudiation of
that aspect of <i>Quin</i>. There can still be a 'matter', therefore, even
though the relevant government decision impacts only on mere interests.</p>
<p>The second major concern raised by <i>Tang's</i> critics relates to the
future of natural justice. Here the critics are closer to the mark, but still
not directly on-target. The
joint judgment said that 'under private
law',<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[92]</a></sup> Ms Tang's legal
relationship with the University was unaffected by her expulsion, because she
had 'at best a consensual relationship,
the continuation of which was dependent
upon the presence of mutuality'.<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[93]</a></sup>
Her expulsion changed no legal rights or obligations as between the parties. In
other words, Ms Tang had no private law right to
delay that withdrawal, and the
University had no private law obligation to maintain its consent. If it had been
otherwise and either
she or the University had private rights or obligations
affected by the expulsion decision, there would have been one less hurdle
to the
conclusion that it was a decision 'under an enactment'. The joint judgment then
stated:</p>
<blockquote>
It may, for the purposes of argument, be accepted that the circumstances had
created an expectation in the respondent that any withdrawal
from the PhD
candidature programme would only follow upon the fair treatment of complaints
against her. But such an expectation would
create in the respondent no
substantive rights under the general law, the affecting of which rendered the
decisions she challenged
decisions made under the University Act. What was said
by Kiefel J<a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[94]</a> and Lehane
J<a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[95]</a> on the point in Lewins, and subsequently
by this Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous
Affairs; Ex
parte Lam,<a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[96]</a> supports that
conclusion.<a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[97]</a></blockquote><p>That is a
difficult passage. It will be recalled that <i>Lam</i> characterised an 
'entitlement' to natural justice protection as a 'procedural' right, rather than
a 'substantive' right. Assuming
the same distinction in <i>Tang</i>, therefore,
the University's 'promise' (by way of its academic misconduct code) of fair
treatment neither impaired nor regulated
its capacity to withdraw its consent to
their relationship at any time. If their relationship had been restrained by
substantive
rights or obligations, then the validity of any expulsion decision
might well have depended upon the University either honouring
its code or giving
fair warning of impending dishonour.</p>
<p>It was one thing for <i>Lam</i> to say that bureaucrats' promises generate
only procedural protections. <i>Tang</i> took this a step further by saying that
they generate nothing at all, unless they are made to a rights-holder, or made
by an obligation-holder,
or both. <i>Tang</i> treated bureaucrats' promises of
procedural fairness as effective only in the context of decisions affecting
substantive rights or
obligations. In effect, if the source of natural justice
is merely a bureaucrat's promise, there must be something else that the
promise
protects or restricts &#8212; something which conforms to the constitutional
requirement of a right, duty or liability. One
of <i>Tang's</i> results,
therefore, is the contrast between the scope of procedural fairness in statutory
and non-statutory settings. It is argued
that in statutory settings, <i>Kioa</i>
and <i>Ainsworth</i> remain unaffected by <i>Tang</i>, so that a statutory power
can still be conditioned upon the observance of procedural fairness even where
there are no rights to
protect.<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[98]</a></sup>
In non-statutory settings, however, natural justice cannot exist by itself
&#8212; it needs something 'substantive' to protect or
enforce. Beyond that,
<i>Tang</i> did not explore whether (or in what circumstances) natural justice
can exist in non-statutory settings where there is something substantive
to
protect or enforce.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>Tang</i> did not resolve the debate as to whether natural
justice is a construct of statutory interpretation. <i>Tang</i> left unexplored
those cases in which natural justice applies to contractually-based
decision-making. Such cases have typically involved
the disciplinary decisions
of professional and sporting associations. In terms of procedure, contractually
sourced natural justice
obligations are not enforced by applications for
'judicial review', although there is an obvious cross-over of
doctrine.<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[99]</a></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading175"></a><b>PART VI &#8212; SOFT LAW AND NON-STATUTORY
POWER</b></h2>
<p>If the procedural restraints of natural justice cannot exist in a vacuum,
their context must be the restraint of 'power'. In the judicial
review context,
that appears to mean the decision-maker's power unilaterally to alter (and
perhaps even to create) legal rights or
obligations. <i>Tang's</i> exclusion of
consensually based power can be taken to limit the scope of judicial review,
although it should not be taken to deny
the availability of natural justice
protections on a contractual basis.</p>
<p>Nor should <i>Tang</i> be taken as rejecting judicial review of the exercise
of any other sort of non-statutory public power. Strictly speaking, <i>Tang</i>
did not settle that particular debate because the sole question on appeal was
the scope of Queensland's version of <i>ADJR</i>. However this article has
already noted the joint judgment's indications that Ms Tang would have lost a
common law judicial review
application in the exercise of federal jurisdiction
if she had been an ANU student. Had the ANU's hypothetical university code been
'hard law', it would have constituted an 'obligation' upon the university
sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement of
a 'matter', and been
judicially enforceable even if Ms Tang lacked any 'substantive'
rights.<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[100]</a></sup> Had the ANU's
hypothetical university code been 'soft law' (as in the case of the Griffith
University code), it would have failed
to engender substantive rights or
obligations sufficient to meet the constitutional requirement of a 'matter'. In
other words, soft
law is not binding as such, even though it can generate the
procedural obligations of natural justice if there are other substantive
rights
or obligations to protect or enforce. Those substantive rights or obligations
can be sourced to statute or contract, but the
question which now arises is
whether they can also be sourced in other ways to the common law.</p>
<p>Queensland's <i>JRA</i> differs from the Commonwealth <i>ADJR </i>in only one
material respect. It contemplates judicial review remedies against non-statutory
decision-making where the decisions are
taken under schemes or programs that
receive funds appropriated by Parliament or raised pursuant to
statute.<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[101]</a></sup> The Court noted that
provision, but left its meaning for another day because it was not
pleaded.<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[102]</a></sup> At some point,
however, someone will have to explain the juridical basis of subjecting a
soft-law scheme or program to at least some
of judicial review's
principles.<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[103]</a></sup> The explanation
might be that it was this extension of <i>JRA's</i> scope beyond that of <i>ADJR
</i>that 'hardened' the soft law. Or it might be that programs in receipt of
funding appropriated by Parliament are sufficiently connected
to the legislature
to overcome any concerns about the source of authority for judicial review of
non-statutory power.<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is submitted that a third (and preferable) alternative would be to view
this extension of Queensland's <i>JRA</i> as simply the adoption of a reform
recommendation of the Commonwealth's Administrative Review
Council,<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[105]</a></sup> which had wanted
<i>ADJR</i> expanded to keep pace with some of the more recent expansions in the
scope of common law judicial review. On this view of the common
law powers of
State Supreme Courts, judicial review of non-statutory public power never needed
legislative authorisation, and does
not need it
now.<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[106]</a></sup> It is a jurisdiction
which all of Australia's superior courts of general jurisdiction have inherited
from their Westminster forebears.
That is not to deny the differences between
reviewing statutory and non-statutory power, because it is more difficult to
locate and
define the parameters of non-statutory power.</p>
<p>If one accepts the possibility of common law judicial review of non-statutory
public power, one can then move to a consideration of
the relevance (if any) of
soft law in that context.<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[107]</a></sup>
Furthermore, whilst recognising the possibilities for legal effects flowing from
soft law, one must at the same time avoid committing
to a theory of Executive
legislative capacity.</p>
<p>There is a large literature debating the definitions of prerogative power,
Executive power (if that is different at the Commonwealth
level), and the scope
(if any) for judicial review of such
powers.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[108]</a></sup> It would be
relatively uncontroversial to allow for judicial review where a decision-maker
has purported to act as the Crown's delegate
in a non-statutory context but has
in fact exceeded the terms of the instrument of
delegation.<sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[109]</a></sup> Other variants of
non-statutory power can be imagined. These would include prerogative (or
Executive) power which is unique to government,
and non-statutory power by which
government can create, change or affect legal rights or obligations. The oldest
example would be
the common law search warrant. Perhaps the most difficult
variant would involve the government's exercise of a non-statutory power
which
is neither unique to government nor capable (without consent) of altering,
creating or affecting legal rights or obligations.</p>
<p>Take the example of the non-statutory criminal injuries compensation scheme
considered in <i>R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board; Ex parte
Lain</i>.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[110]</a></sup> Anyone can hand out
money, and anyone can establish guidelines by which they will do that. It is
submitted that if (as in England)
a court were to characterise decision-making
under the guidelines as an exercise of public power, then the government's
decision-makers
could be constrained by some at least of judicial review's
principles. These would sometimes include natural justice, and the guidelines
might sometimes be relevant in a natural justice inquiry. They might arguably
also have relevance to other judicial review restraints
upon the exercise of
public power. Just as natural justice does not exist on its own, soft law has no
relevance by itself, but might
become relevant in ascertaining the limits of
public power.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading194"></a><b>PART VII &#8212; CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p>This article has taken a less pessimistic view of the trilogy of High Court
cases than most of the commentaries. However, it agrees
with the principal
criticism made by Mantziaris and
McDonald,<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[111]</a></sup> which was that the
real issues have tended to be submerged. They argued that the real issues were
ultimately about the normative
task of characterising power as public or
private, and that the constitutional learning on what constitutes a Chapter III
'matter'
is a poor tool to use for that task. Perhaps the results would have
been the same in any event, although the optimist might be permitted
to doubt
that. </p>
<p><i>Lam</i> was right to deny judicial enforcement of government-induced
expectations regardless of considerations of unfairness, but that is
because
judicial review's remedies are procedural, avoiding a usurpation of the
decision-maker's powers. It is not because statute
is the only way in which
public power can be created or confined.</p>
<p><i>NEAT Domestic's</i> turning point was the fact that AWBI had to focus on
maximising its profits. That led to an unnecessary conclusion that the company
need never think of anything else. It is still the case that public and private
power are usually distinguished by reference to whether
the decision-maker has
always to be altruistic, but that binary distinction breaks down in the case of
private bodies performing
private and governmental tasks. If the question had
been expressed as whether a private sector company was a hybrid exercising
public
power, the result may well have been different.</p>
<p><i>Tang's</i> result was entirely predictable because if <i>ADJR's</i>
restriction to statutory decision-making is to mean anything, then the odds are
that it excludes coverage of government's commercial
powers so far as these are
truly consensual. <i>Tang's</i> fault, though, was in failing to see the
realities of public power behind a consensual, non-statutory facade. Consensual
power should
not be subject to judicial review, not because it is non-statutory,
but because it is not public. The classic image of a contract
is as an
instrument of exchange, whilst the classic image of judicial review is the
enforcement of express or implied legal rules,
where 'rules' are seen as
commands.<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[112]</a></sup> However classical
imagery can sometimes be misleading. Some government contracts are in reality
rules, and the same is true of some
non-contractual relationships adopting a
seemingly consensual form. The characterisation of Ms Tang's relationship with
her former
university as merely consensual is nothing short of
breath-taking.</p>
<p>This article has also discussed another concern flowing from <i>Tang</i>,
which is the reviewability of exercises of public power which are in 'breach' of
soft laws, constituted by practice manuals, procedure
pamphlets, guidelines and
so forth. <i>Tang's</i> implication that a soft-law right or obligation is never
sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement of a 'matter' is
unsatisfying
because it avoids the principal question, which is whether there
has been an exercise of public power in breach of legal restraints.
Unless one
were to subscribe to the view that judicial review cannot police the exercise of
non-statutory power, one should recognise
soft law's potential relevance as a
source of restraints upon the exercise of public power. Just as the common law
can be a source
of public power, so too can it be a source of restraints upon
public power.</p>
<p>In any event, there was undoubtedly a real dispute between the parties as to
whether the University had adhered to its misconduct
code. That would probably
have been a sufficient basis for an application to a State Supreme Court for
declaratory relief, and it
is to be hoped that <i>Tang</i> will create no
constitutional impediment to a similarly broad declaratory power being exercised
in federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>There is still time to back away from <i>Tang's</i> more serious
implications. Strictly speaking, the case determined only the scope of
<i>ADJR</i> review. Its disregard of the University's soft law need have no
ramifications beyond the construction of <i>ADJR's</i> requirement of a decision
'under an enactment'. Further, its resort to the constitutional concept of
'matter' was doubtless done
with the best of intentions, to keep <i>ADJR</i> in
synch with Queensland's <i>JRA</i>, and to keep both in synch with judicial
review at common law and under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(v)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. It is
nevertheless essential that non-statutory judicial review retain sufficient
flexibility to be able to check the legality of
the exercise of public
functions, whether they be exercised by public or private bodies, and whether
their source of power be statute,
Executive or prerogative power, or the common
law. It is also essential to maintain some room for the operation of such of
judicial
review's principles as may be appropriate, in contexts where judicial
review's remedies are not available.</p>

principles has unearthed 'legitimate expectations', 'abuse of power',
'unfairness' per se, equality
of treatment, and 'good administration',

issue has become when the court chooses to order the administration
to deliver a
substantive outcome, and on that issue, the cases and commentary are
understandably unclear. Their lack of clarity is
not assisted by a proliferation
of categories. In essence, the cases seem to allow such orders in exceptional
cases, where the judge
believes that only a few will benefit and where the cost
to the state will not outweigh the fairness of enforcing the substantive
outcome.

Mantziaris and McDonald, above n 6, 45&#8211;7. Mantziaris and McDonald went
further than this article,
saying that the public/private distinction was the
real issue for <i>Tang</i> and also, so far as <i>ADJR</i> was involved, for
<i>NEAT Domestic</i>. It is submitted that <i>ADJR's</i> jurisdictional
requirement that there be an administrative decision under an enactment cannot
be entirely morphed into the common
law's public/private power inquiry. It must
be taken seriously as an issue of statutory interpretation, albeit one that is
inevitably
influenced by normative considerations. That is an unfortunate
consequence of <i>ADJR's</i> design; see Aronson, above n 6, 207&#8211;9. If
there is any part of <i>ADJR</i> which could serve to incorporate the function
of the common law's public/private distinction, it must be found in ss 5, 6 and
7 which
all allow applications for 'an order of review' for various grounds, and
in s 16's description of those 'review' orders, a description
which amounts to a
list of the remedies typically available in judicial review at common law. Cf
the case law on s 9 of <i>ADJR</i>: Aronson, Dyer and Groves,<i> </i>above n 11,

<p align="center"><b><a name="Smallpox Mortality and Vaccination"><big>Smallpox Mortality and
Vaccination</big></a></b></p>

<p>HAVING been led to enquire for myself as to the effects of Vaccination in preventing or
diminishing Small-pox, I have arrived at results as unexpected as they appear to me to be
conclusive. The question is one which affects our personal liberty as well as the health
and even the lives of thousands; it therefore becomes a duty to endeavour to make the
truth known to all, and especially to those who, on the faith of false or misleading
statements, have enforced the practice of vaccination by penal laws.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose now to establish the following four statements of fact, by
means of the only official statistics which are available; and I shall adopt a mode of
presenting those statistics as a whole, which will render them intelligible to all. These
statements are:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1.)-That during the forty-five years of the Registration of deaths and
their causes, Small-pox mortality has very slightly diminished, while an exceedingly
severe Small-pox epidemic occurred within the last twelve years of the period.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2.)-That there is no evidence to show that the slight decrease of
Small-pox mortality is due to vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3.)-That the severity of Small-pox as a disease has not been mitigated
by vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(4.) -That several inoculable diseases have increased to an alarming
extent coincidently with enforced vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first, second, and fourth propositions will be proved from the
Registrar-General's Reports from 1838 to 1882; and I shall make the results clear and
indisputable, by presenting the figures for the whole period in the form of diagrammatic
curves, so that no manipulation of them, by taking certain years for comparison, or by
dividing the period in special ways, will be possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The diagrams show, in each case, not the absolute mortality but the
deaths per million living, a method which eliminates the increase of population and gives
true comparative results.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><a name="VACCINATION HAS NOT DIMINISHED SMALL-POX."><strong>VACCINATION

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="diag.html" target="_blank">DIAGRAM</a> I. Exhibits* [<font
SIZE="2">*The Diagrams in the First Edition stopped at 1882. In this Edition the later
years are added without variation of the text, which these later years do but accentuate.
Complaint has been made of this presentment. It is the most accurate that can be made. The
favorite method of averaging in such a manner as to take all the sharp lines from the
curves, totally obscures the epidemic nature of the disease of Small-pox, its great
characteristic feature. No truer presentment than that chosen can be adopted. The line of
official vaccinations includes, for 1884-5-6, official re-vaccinations, which have not
been given since 1872, or the fall would be much more pronounced for these
years.&#151;ED.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the deaths from Smallpox, in LONDON, for every year from 1838 to 1882,
while an upper line exhibits the deaths from the other principal zymotic diseases given in
the Registrar-General&#146;s Annual Summary for 1882, (except Cholera, which is only an
occasional epidemic,) namely,&#151;Scarlet fever and Diphtheria, Measles, Whooping Cough,
Typhoid and other fevers, and Diarrhcea. A dotted line between these shows the mortality
from fevers of the Typhoid class [<font SIZE="2">From the Registrar-General&#146;s Annual
Summary of Deaths, etc., in London, 1882. Table 23, <i>p. </i>xxv.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first thing clearly apparent in this diagram, is the very small
diminution of Small-pox corresponding with the epochs of penal and compulsory vaccination;
while the epidemic of 1871 was the most destructive in the whole period. The average
diminution of Small-pox mortality from the first to the second half of the period, is 57
deaths per million per annum. Looking now at the upper curve, we see that the mortality
from the chief zymotic diseases has also decreased, [<font SIZE="2">From 1838 to 1853, the
average Small-pox death-rate exceeded that of the years 1854 to 1867 by 229 per million
living. But the average of the years 1868 to 1886, exceeded that of the years </font>1854
to 1867 by 46 per million] more especially during the last 35 years; but the decrease of
these diseases is not, proportionally, so great, owing to the fact that deaths from
Diarrhoea have considerably increased in the latter half of the period. On the other hand,
Typhus and Typhoid fevers have diminished to a much greater extent than Small-pox, as
shown by the dotted line on the diagram, the reduced mortality ,from this cause alone
being 382 per million, or more than six times as much as that from Small-pox. Every one
will admit that this remarkable decrease of Typhus, &amp;c.,<font SIZE="2"> The deaths
from Typhus, [Enteric, and Fever, 1871-80, were less by 540 per million than in the ten
preceding years. The years 1881 to 1886 show a further reduction, as compared with 1871 to
1880, of 125 per million living. &#151; ED.]</font> is due to more efficient sanitation,
greater personal attention to the laws of health, and probably also to more rational
methods of treatment. But all these causes of amelioration have certainly had their effect
on Small-pox; and as the mortality from that disease has not equally diminished, there is
probably some counteracting cause at work. So far, therefore, from there being any proof
that vaccination has diminished Small-pox in London, the tendency of the
Registrar-General&#146;s facts, (and there are no other facts which are trustworthy,) is
to show that some counteracting cause has prevented general sanitation from acting on this
disease as it has acted on Typhus, and that cause may, possibly, be vaccination itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will now turn to <a href="diag.html" target="_blank">DIAGRAM</a>
II., which gives a representation of similar statistics for England and Wales,<font
SIZE="2"> [From the Registrar-General&#146;s Annual Report, 1882. Table <i>32, </i>p.
xliii.]</font> except that unfortunately there is a blank in the record for 1843-46, in
which years the Registrar-General informs us, &quot;the causes of death were not
distinguished.&quot; Here too we perceive a similar decrease in Small-pox mortality,
broken by the tremendous epidemic of 1871-2, while the other chief zymotic diseases
represented by the higher line, show more irregularity, but a considerable recent
decrease. For all England, as for London, the tables show us that Typhoid fevers have
decreased far more than Smallpox, (but for clearness the curve of Typhus is omitted,) and
we have, therefore, again, no reason for imputing the decrease in Smallpox to vaccination.
But we may go further than this negative statement, for we have&#146; fortunately, a means
of directly testing the alleged efficacy of vaccination. The eleventh Annual Report. of
the Local Government Board gives a table of the number of successful vaccinations, at the
expense of the Poor Rate, in England and Wales, from 1852 to 1881. From the figures of
this table I have calculated the numbers in proportion to the population of each year, and
have exhibited the result in the dotted line on my DIAGRAM II.; and to this I beg to
direct the reader&#146;s attention, since it at once dispels some oft-repeated erroneous
statements<font SIZE="2"> [I have examined every Report of the Local Government Board,
with the intention of giving the total vaccinations for the whole period embraced in this
Diagram II. But the total vaccinations are not tabulated, and are only given in the text
for the years since 1872. Hence the official vaccinations only appear here, with such
vaccinations as are tabulated. &#151;ED.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first place we see that, instead of vaccination having increased
since the enforcement of penal laws, it has actually diminished; so that the statement so
often made by official apologists for vaccination, and repeated by <font SIZE="2">SIR LYON
PLAYFAIR </font>in his speech to the House of Commons, June, 1883,&#151;that the
progressive efficiency of legal vaccination has diminished Small-pox, <i>is absolutely
untrue, since there has been a decrease rather than an increase of &quot;efficient
vaccination.&quot; [</i><font SIZE="2">It is curious that even the Registrar-General
appears to be ignorant of the fact that, official vaccination has not increased it
efficiency since the penal laws came into force. In his Report for 1880, p. xxii., he
says&#151;&quot; These figures show conclusively that <i>coincidently with the gradual
extension of the practice of vaccination, </i>there has been a gradual and notable decline
in the mortality from Small-pox at all ages.&quot; As, however, there has not been shown
to have been any such &quot;gradual extension of the practice of vaccination,&#146; but,
so far as official records go, just the reverse, the whole argument falls to the ground!
It is true that this curve does not exhibit the numbers of the vaccinated population,
which there is no means of arriving at.]</font></p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MR. MARSON, the Surgeon of the Small-pox Hospital, told the Select
Committee, 1871, answer 4,190 :&#151;&quot; The public are pretty largely vaccinated now,
and will be more so every year, I should think as time goes on. There is one point which
has not been very clearly brought forward this morning, and that is the increase of
Small-pox after vaccination year after year. When I first went to the hospital, 35 years
since, from 1835 to 1845, the admission of patients into the Small-pox hospital was 44 per
cent, of Small-pox after vaccination; from 1845 to 1855, 64 per cent. ; from 1855 to 1865,
78 per cent.; and during 1863 and 1864, 83 and 84 per cent. Those are patients who have
been vaccinated.&quot; Thc line of official vaccination in the diagram, shows that Mr.
MARSON was mistaken as to the amount of public vaccination, and that it was a larger
incidence of Small-pox among the vaccinated he was witnessing; not the result of extension
of vaccination.&#151;ED.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A </font>temporary increase in the number of vaccinations always takes
place during an epidemic of Small-pox, or when an epidemic is feared; but an examination
of the curve of vaccination does not support the statement that it checks the epidemic. On
careful inspection it will be seen that on three separate occasions a considerable <i>incease
</i>in vaccinations was followed by an <i>increase </i>of Small-pox. Let the reader look
at the Diagram, and note that in 1863 there was a very great number of vaccinations,
followed in 1864 by an <i>increase </i>in Small-pox mortality. Again, the number of
vaccinations steadily rose from 1866 to 1869, yet in 1870-71 Small-pox mortality
increased; and yet again, in 1876 an <i>increase </i>in vaccinations was followed by an <i>increase
</i>of Small-pox deaths. In fact, if the dotted line showed <i>inoculation </i>instead of <i>vaccination,
</i>it might be used to prove that inoculation caused an increase of Small-pox. I only
maintain, however, that it does <i>not </i>prove that vaccination diminishes the mortality
from the disease. During the panic caused by the great epidemic of 1871-2, vaccinations
rose enormously, and declined as rapidly the moment the epidemic passed away, but there is
nothing whatever to show that the increased vaccinations had any effect on the disease,
which ran its course and then died out like other epidemics.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has now been proved from the only complete series of official
records that exist:&#151; <br>
(I.)&#151;That Small-pox has not decreased so much or so steadily as Typhus and allied
fevers. <br>
(2.)&#151;That the diminution of Small-pox mortality coincides with a <i>diminished, </i>instead
of an increased efficiency of official vaccination.<br>
(3.)&#151;That one of the most severe epidemics of Small-pox on record, within the period
of accurate statistics, occurred after 33 years of official, compulsory, and penal
vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These three groups of facts give no support to the assertion that
vaccination has diminished Small-pox mortality; and it must always be remembered that we
have actually no other extensive body of statistics on which to found our judgment. The
utility or otherwise of vaccination is purely a question of statistics. It remains for us
to decide, whether we will be guided by the only trustworthy statistics we possess, or
continue blindly to accept the dogmas of an interested and certainly not infallible body
of professional men, who once upheld inoculation as strongly as they now uphold
vaccination.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="SMALL-POX HAS NOT BEEN MITIGATED BY VACCINATION.">SMALL-POX HAS
NOT BEEN MITIGATED BY VACCINATION.</a></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is often asserted that, although vaccination is not a complete
protection against Small-pox, yet it diminishes the severity of the disease, and renders
it less dangerous to those who take it. This assertion is sufficiently answered by the
proof above given, that it has <i>not </i>diminished Small-pox mortality; but more direct
evidence can be adduced.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best available records show that, the proportion of deaths to
Small-pox cases is the same <i>now, although a large majority of the population are
vaccinated, </i>as it was a century ago before vaccination was discovered. DR. JURIN, in
1723; the London Small-pox Hospital Reports, 1746-63; DR. LAMBERT, 1763 ; and REES&#146;
Cyclopedia, 1779; give numbers varying from 165 to 253 as the per-centage of mortality
among Small-pox patients in hospitals ; &#151; <i>the average of the whole being </i>I8.8 <i>percent.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now for the epoch of vaccination. MR. MARSON, 1836-51, and the Reports
of the London, Homerton, Deptford, Fulham, and Dublin Small-pox Hospitals, between 1870
and 1880, give numbers varying from 14.26 to 2I.7 as the deaths per cent. of Small-pox
patients, <i>the average being </i>18.5. And this, be it remembered, under the improved
treatment and hygiene of the nineteenth as compared with the eighteenth century.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These figures not only demonstrate the falsehood of the oft-repeated
assertion that vaccination mitigates Small-pox, but they go far to prove the very
opposite&#151;that the disease has been rendered more intractable by it; or how can we
account for the mortality among Small-pox patients being almost exactly the same now as a
century ago, notwithstanding the great advance of medical science and the improvements in
hospitals and hospital treatment ? [<font SIZE="2">The following authorities have been
examined for the facts and figures of this section.</p>

affected by more recent experience, excepting in this way:&#151;That the great extension

Objection has been taken to JURIN&#146;S figures. JURIN, it must be remembered, was trying
to induce people to accept artificial Small-pox by inoculation, and he gives his figures
to show the great fatality of Small-pox taken in the ordinary way by infection. He would
therefore certainly not err in making it too mild. The total experience of the
Metropolitan Asylums Board, up to the issue of the last report to the managers, is given
in the Appendix&#151;ED.]</font><b></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="SMALL-POX IN THE ARMY AND NAVY,">SMALL-POX IN THE ARMY AND
NAVY,</a></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here we have a crucial test of the efficacy or uselessness of
vaccination. Our Soldiers and Sailors are vaccinated and re-vaccinated in accordance with
the most stringent official regulations. They are exceptionally strong and healthy men, in
the prime of life, and if Vaccination is of any use, Small-pox should be almost unknown
among them, and <i>no soldier or sailor should ever die of it. </i>They are in fact often
spoken of as a &quot;perfectly protected population.&quot; Now let us see what are the
facts.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Return has been issued to the House of Commons, &quot;Small-pox (Army
and Navy),&quot; dated &quot;August, 1884,&quot; giving the mean strength, the number of
deaths from Small-pox, and the ratio per thousand in each service for the twenty-three
years 1860-82. An examination of this Return shows us that there has not been a single
year without two or more deaths in the Army, and only two years without deaths in the
Navy. Comparing the Return on &quot;Vaccination, Mortality,&#146; No. 433, issued by the
House of Commons in 1877, we find that, in the twenty-three years 1850-72, (the latest
there given,) there were many years in which no adult Small-pox deaths were recorded for a
number of large towns of from 100,000 to 270,000 inhabitants. Liverpool had none in 3 of
the years, Birmingham and Sunderland in 7, Bradford and Sheffield in 8, Halifax in 9,
Dudley in 10, while Blackburn and Wolverhampton were each totally without adult Smallpox
mortality for 11 out of the 23 years!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that the cases are not strictly comparable, because for
these towns we have only deaths of persons aged 20 and upwards given separately, whereas
the ages of the Army and Navy range chiefly from about 17 to 45. But, considering the
extremely unsanitary state of many of these towns, and their great preponderance in
freedom from Small-pox, there is clearly no room left for the alleged effect of <i>revaccination
</i>in securing to our soldiers and sailors immunity from the disease.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But let us now look at the averages for the whole series of years, as
affording the best and only reliable test. On working these out carefully I find the mean
Small-pox mortality for the 23 years to be, in the Army 82-96, which we may call 83 per
million, and in the Navy </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[<font SIZE="2">The 45th Report of the Registrar-General, (Tables 63
and 4,) gives 25 Small-pox deaths among 195,937 British Merchant Seamen in 1882. This is
at the rate of 127 per million, against the above 157 for the Navy. We have no reason to
believe that re-vaccination is common in the merchant service. In the Navy, therefore, the
influence of re-vaccination appears to be hurtful rather than beneficial&#151;ED.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">157 per million. Unfortunately no materials exist for an <i>exact </i>comparison
of these rates with those of the civil population; but with much labour I have made the
best comparison I can arrive at. From the Census General Report, 1881, and the Reports of
the Registrar-General for the same 23 years as are included in the Army and Navy Return, I
have been able to ascertain the Small-pox mortality of males in England and Wales between
the years 15 and 55, taken as best representing those of the two services; and the result
is a mean Small-pox death rate of 176 per million)</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>[The following are the data on which this calculation is founded :&#151; <br>
In the General Report of the last Census, Table 14, p. 89, the numbers of males at
successive ages are given for the three last Censuses&#151;1861, 1871, and i88t. By a
simple calculation it is found that the number of males of all ages is to that of males
aged <i>K </i>5&#151;55 in the proportion of 1 to .528.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 4. p. 78, of the same Census Report, gives the male population
for the middle of each of the 23 years included in the Army and Navy Return. The mean of
these numbers is 11,167,500; and this sum, multiplied by the factor .528, gives 5,896,500
for the average male population of the ages 15&#151;55 for those years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the tables of &quot;Causes of Death at different Periods of
Life&quot; in the twenty-three successive Reports of the Registrar-General, 1860-1882, I
have extracted the deaths from Small-pox of males aged 15&#151;55, the mean annual value
of which is 1,041 ; and this number, divided by the number of millions in the
corresponding population (5.8965), gives the death-rate per million = 176.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The limit of age, 15&#151;55, has been taken because the General Report
of the Census of 1881, Table 40, gives, for the Army and Navy, 7,530 men over 45, and
28,834 under 20 years of age.</p>

<p>ED-The Small-pox death-rate for same ages, England and Wales, for the years 1850 to
1870, was only 109 per million. Supplement to 35th Report, Table 2, p. 2. The enormous
increase is due to the epidemics since 1870.&#151;ED.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be observed that this is but little more than the Navy
mortality, though more than double that of the Army, and the question arises, to what is
the difference due. And first, why is the Small-pox mortality in the Navy nearly double
that of the Army? The regulations as to re-vaccination are the same in both, and are in
both rigidly enforced, and the men are pretty equal in stamina and general health. The
cause must therefore be in the different conditions of life of the two services; and it
seems to me a probable supposition, that the difference arises chiefly from the less
efficient ventilation and isolation which are possible on board ship as compared with Army
Hospitals<i><font SIZE="2"> </font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2"><i>[</i>An Officer of the Royal Marine Artillery, of
great experience, confirms this view. He assures me that isolation is absolutely
impossible on board a ship of war. But if this is the explanation of the phenomenon, it is
itself a proof of the complete inefficacy of re-vaccination, which not only does not
protect men from <i>catching </i>Small-pox, but allows them to <i>die </i>of it quite as
much as&#151;and, allowing something for the superiority of sanitation, even more
than&#151;the adult civil population, only partially vaccinated and hardly ever
re-vaccinated!]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The general mortality of the Navy from disease appears (from the
Registrar-General&#146;s Report, 1882, Tables 59 and 65,) to be considerably less than
that of the Army, so that the greater mortality from Smallpox must be due to some special
conditions. But whatever these are, the conditions of the civil population are certainly
much worse. Two thirds of the families inhabiting Glasgow live in houses of one or two
rooms only, and many other towns, including London, are probably not much better. Under
such conditions, and with the low vitality induced by insufficient food, over work, and
bad air, we should expect the Small-pox mortality of our civil population to be very much
greater than that of the picked class of sailors who enjoy ample food, fresh air, and
medical attendance. Where then is the alleged &quot;full security&quot; afforded by
re-vaccination, and how are we to characterise the statements circulated at the expense of
the public, that &quot;Small-pox is almost unknown in the Army and Navy?&quot; </p>
<font SIZE="2"><i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[</i>The following are a few of these assertions. The italics are to

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Lancet,&quot; of March 1st, 1879, says
:&#151;&quot;Vaccination needs to be repeated well once in a lifetime, <i>and then the
immunity is almost absolute.&quot;</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medical Officer of the General Post Office says, in a circular dated
June, 1884.&#151;&quot; The <i>only means </i>of securing protection against Small-pox is
by re-vaccination . . . . it is desirable, <i>in order so obtain full security, </i>that
the operation should be repeated at a later period of life.&#146;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the tract on &quot;Small-pox and Vaccination&quot; issued by the
National Health Society, and now being widely circulated at the expense of the ratepayers,
with the sanction of the Local Government Board, we find this statement :&#151;&quot;
Every Soldier and Sailor is re-vaccinated; the result is that <i>Smallpox is almost
Unknown in the Army and Navy, </i>even amid surrounding epidemics.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The above statements are proved by the Official Returns now issue to be
absolutely untrue, and must have been ignorantly and recklessly made without any adequate
basis of fact.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to draw a legitimate conclusion from the facts, it is, that
the re-vaccination to which our soldiers and sailors are subjected, renders Small-pox more
fatal when it attacks them, for thus only can we explain the large mortality among picked
healthy men under constant medical supervision, and living under far better sanitary
conditions than the mass of the civil population.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One other mode of comparison can be made, showing that even the Army
Small-pox death-rate is but little better than that of some large towns, during the same
period. The rate per million for the adult population, between the ages 15 and 55, on an
average of the years 1860-82 for five very large towns was as follows :_*</p>

<font size="1">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>*<font SIZE="2">These figures have been thus obtained&#151;the
Registrar-General&#146;s Summary, 1882, (Table 7, p. xv.) gives the Small-pox deaths per
1,000, for twenty great Towns, for the years 1872-82. The Parliamentary Return,
&quot;Vaccination, Mortality,&quot; 1877, gives the Small-pox mortality and population of
a considerable number of towns for the years 1847-72. From these two official papers the
Small-pox mortality per million of the whole male population from 1860 to 1882, for such
towns as occur in both the tables, is easily obtained. The average Small-pox death-rate
for all England is found to be 211 ~7, while that of the ages 15&#151;45 is 176. These
numbers are in the proportion of 1<i> </i>to .83; hence the total Small-pox mortality of
any town multiplied by the factor .83 will give, approximately, the mortality at ages
15&#151;45. The proportion has been obtained from males only, but that of the two sexes
combined will not be materially different.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course there are many other towns which have a much higher
mortality, but very few are much worse than the Navy. The very worst large town which I
can find in the Reports is Newcastle-on-Tyne, which for the same period had an adult
Small-pox mortality of 349 per million. But the fact that five of our most populous towns
have considerably less adult Small-pox mortality than the Navy, and one of them but little
more than the Army, amounts to a demonstration of the uselessness of the most complete
re-vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The general mortality of our adult population is much greater than that
of the Army and Navy. From the official sources of information already quoted, I find that
the average mortality of the adult male population of England, of the ages 15&#151;55, for
the years 1860-82, was about <u>11,300</u> per million.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That of the Navy, for the same period, was <u>11,000</u> per million
from all causes, and only <u>7,150</u> from disease.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That of the Army, at home, was <u>10,300</u> per million. Abroad it was
nearly double (19,400), but this included all the deaths from casualties, exposure,
&amp;c., in the Abyssinian, Afghan, Zulu, Transvaal, and other petty wars.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus the superior physique of our soldiers and sailors, together with
the sanitary conditions under which they live, are fully manifested in a mortality from
disease much below that of the adult civil population of comparable ages. If we make the
same allowance for the influence of these causes in the case of Small-pox, there remains
absolutely nothing for the alleged protective influence of re-vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely we shall now hear no more of the re-vaccinated nurses in
Small-pox hospitals, (as to whom we have no statistics, but only vague and usually
inaccurate assertions,) when we have a great, officially recorded experiment to refer to,
extending over 23 years and applied to more than 200,000 men, the results of which
directly contradict every professional and official statement as to the safeguard of
re-vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><a name="VACCINATION ITSELF A CAUSE OF DISEASE AND DEATH.">VACCINATION
ITSELF A CAUSE OF DISEASE AND DEATH.</a></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been now shown, vaccination is quite powerless either to prevent
or to mitigate Small-pox. But this is not all, for there are good grounds for believing
that it is itself the cause of much disease and serious mortality.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was long denied by medical men that syphilis can be communicated by
vaccination; but this is now universally admitted, and no less than 478 cases of
vaccine-syphilis have already been recorded.[<font SIZE="2">See Ms.. TEBB&#146;S &quot;<a
href="../../v/tebb1/1.html">Compulsory Vaccination in England,</a>&quot; p. 25, (Note,)
for a list of the authorities for these cases.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But there is also good reason to believe that many other blood-diseases
are transmitted and increased by the same means, since there has been for many years a
steady increase of mortality from such diseases which is terrible to contemplate. The
following table gives the increase of five of these diseases from the
Registrar-General&#146;s Annual Report for 1880, (page lxxix., Table 34,) and it is very
noteworthy that, in the long list of maladies there tabulated, no others, (except
Bronchitis, which often follows vaccination though not, probably, transmitted by it,) show
any such striking and continuous increase, while the great majority are either stationary
or decreasing.</p>

<font SIZE="2"><i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*</i>This Table has not been continued in later Reports; but we find
that Cancer (the only disease of the five separately tabulated) goes on steadily
increasing, the mortality for the five years, 1881-85, being given in the 48th Report as
follows :&#151;Syphilis, 92; Cancer, 544. Small-pox, for the same period was 78.&#151;ED.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We here see a constant increase in the mortality from each of these
diseases, an increase which in the sum of them is steady and continuous. It is true, we
have not, and cannot have, direct proof that vaccination is the sole cause of this
increase, but we have good reason to believe that it is the chief cause. In the first
place it is a <i>vera causa, </i>since it directly inoculates infants and adults, on an
enormous scale, with whatever blood-disease may exist unsuspected in the system of the
infants from whom the vaccine virus is taken. In the next place, no other adequate cause
has been adduced for the, remarkably continuous increase of these special diseases, which
the spread of sanitation, of cleanliness, and of advanced medical knowledge, should have
rendered both less frequent and less fatal.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <i>increased deaths from these five causes, from </i>1855 <i>to </i>1880,
<i>exceed the total deaths from Small-pox during the same period! </i>So that even if the
latter disease had been totally abolished by vaccination, the general mortality would have
been increased, and there is much reason to believe that the increase may have been caused
by vaccination itself.*</p>
<font SIZE="2"><i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* </i>It has been boldly asserted by the Government Department
controlling vaccination, [Eleventh Report of the Medical Officer to Local Government
Board, p. vi., et seq.,] that even if some children are killed by vaccination, 12,000
lives are annually saved by it. The basis of that assertion is <i>an estimate </i>which
contradicts the official vaccination returns at almost every point. The estimate and
assertion are false to the facts which are obtainable.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The above noted estimate is taken to prove that 94 per cent. of London
children under ten years of age are vaccinated, and that 95 per cent. of the population
[p. 41] are vaccinated. This statement is further assumed to be supported by an
examination of &quot;53,185 children in various national, charitable, and parochial
schools and workhouses in London.&quot; Such is the odious rigour of vaccine regulations
in our &quot;national, charitable, and parochial workhouse schools,&quot; that I should
not have been surprised if, of these children, not one was found unvaccinated The parents
of these poor children have had no one to defend them by paying fines for neglect of the
vaccination. Yet this &quot;inspection&quot; showed 6 per cent, to have &quot;no
vaccination scar,&quot; or to be doubtful as to vaccination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is on such bases, that tremendous statements, such as that noted
above, are founded; and to shade off the impudence of this one it is further declared that
&quot;the estimate of the number of the unvaccinated is probably too high.&quot; Our
responsible ministers have been appealed to respecting such a base use of official
reports, and have had the humour to refer the objector to the very officials who have so
degraded their department of &quot;the public service.&quot; These, in turn, when appealed
to, refer to the head of the department; meanwhile the false statement is repeatedly
quoted, and stands as first used.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Reports of the Local Government Board, show that only once have
there ever been more than 87 per cent. of the births of the country vaccinated, and in
London 3 or 4 per cent, fewer. The last year reported, 1886, gives 30,000 fewer official
vaccinations than 1877, when it was over 86 per cent. of the births. The plan of the
officials is to get 94 per cent, vaccinated, by deducting the infants who died
unvaccinated from the total births, and treating the rest as <i>&quot;surviving.&quot; </i>I
know no more condemnable trick. Death is as busy with vaccinated as with unvaccinated
children. &#151;ED.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IN his speech in the House of Commons, June 19th, 1883, SIR LYON
PLAYFAIR made the following statement : &#151; &quot;An analysis of 10,000 cases in the
Metropolitan Hospitals shows that 45 per cent. of the Unvaccinated patients die, and only
15 per cent. of Vaccinated patients ;&quot; and he further showed that statistics of a
similar character had been published in other countries. It will no doubt be objected by
my readers that these statistics, if correct, are a complete proof of the value of
vaccination; and I shall be expected to show that they are incorrect or give up the whole
case. This I am prepared to do; and I now undertake to prove&#151; firstly, that the
figures here given are unreliable; and, secondly, that such Statistics <i>necessarily </i>give
false results unless they are classified according to the age-periods of the patients.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="THE PERCENTAGES OF VACCINATED AND UNVACCINATED UNRELIABLE."><strong>THE
PERCENTAGES OF VACCINATED AND UNVACCINATED UNRELIABLE.</strong></a></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The simple fact of death from Small-pox is easily ascertained, and has
been for many years accurately recorded.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, whether the deceased person had been vaccinated or not, is a fact
by no means easily ascertained, because confluent Small-pox (which alone is ordinarily
fatal) obliterates the vaccination marks in the worst cases, and the death is then usually
recorded among the unvaccinated or the doubtful. For this reason alone the official <i>record&#151;vaccinated
</i>or <i>unvaccinated&#151;is </i>altogether untrustworthy, and cannot be made the
subject of accurate statistical enquiry.*</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*As an instance of the reticence of officials on the subject. I cannot
find any details in the Registrar-General&#146;s reports respecting vaccinated persons
dying of Small-pox until 1874. For that year 270 vaccinated persons are reported dying of
Small-pox. Then for years no information is given, until 1879, when it is again inserted.
For that and the subsequent years we have 2,512 vaccinated persons returned as dying of
Small-pox. Several thousands are noted as &quot;not stated as to
vaccination.&quot;&#151;ED.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But there are other reasons why the comparison of the deaths of these
two classes is worthless. Deaths registered as <i>unvaccinated </i>include&#151; <br>
(I)&#151;Infants dying under vaccination age, and who, therefore, have no corresponding
class among the vaccinated, but among whom the Small-pox mortality is greatest.<br>
(2.)&#151;Children too weakly or diseased to be vaccinated, and whose low vitality renders
any severe disease fatal.<br>
(3.)&#151;A large but unknown number of the criminal and nomad population who escape the
vaccination officers. These are often badly fed and live under the most unsanitary
conditions; they are, therefore, especially liable to suffer in epidemics of Small-pox or
other zymotic diseases.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is by the indiscriminate union of these three classes, together with
those erroneously classed as unvaccinated owing to the obliteration of marks or other
defect of evidence, that the number of deaths registered <i>&quot;unvaccinated&quot; </i>is
swollen far beyond its true proportions, and the comparison with those registered <i>&quot;vaccinated&quot;
</i>rendered altogether untrustworthy and misleading.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a mere inference, for there is much direct evidence that
the records &quot;unvaccinated&quot; and &quot;no statement&quot; in the Reports of the
Registrar-General are often erroneous. As the chief argument for vaccination rests upon
this class of facts, a few examples of the evidence referred to must be here given.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(I.)&#151;MR. A. FELTRUP, of Ipswich, gives a case of a boy aged 9, who
died of Small-pox, and was recorded in the certificate as &quot;unvaccinated.&quot; By a
search in the register of successful vaccinations it was found that the boy, Thomas
Taylor, had been successfully vaccinated on the 20th May, 1868, by W. Adams. <i>(Suffolk
Chronicle, </i>May 5, 1877.)<br>
(2.) In &quot;Notes on the Small-pox Epidemic at Birkenhead, 1877.&quot; By FRAS. VACHER,
M.D., (p. 9.,) we find the following :&#151;<br>
&quot;As regards the patients admitted to the fever hospital or treated at home, those
entered as vaccinated displayed undoubted cicatrices, as attested by competent medical
witnesses, and those entered as not vaccinated were admitted unvaccinated or without the
faintest mark. <i>The mere assertions of patienls or their friends that they were
vaccinated counted for nothing, as about </i>80 <i>per cent. of the patients entered in
the third column of the table </i>(&#145;unknown&#146;) <i>were retorted as having been
vaccinated in infancy.&quot; </i>(The italics are my own.)<br>
(3.)&#151;Bearing upon this important admission, we have the following statement in DR.
RUSSELL&#146;S Glasgow Report, 1871-2 (p. 25):--<br>
&quot;Sometimes persons were said to be vaccinated, but no marks could be seen, very
frequently because of the abundance of the eruption. In some cases of those which
recovered, an inspection before dismissal discovered vaccine marks, sometimes &#145;very
good,&#146;&quot;<br>
(4.)&#151;&quot; The last epidemic of Small-pox which visited vaccinated Preston was in
1877. In February of that year, Dr. Rigby, the medical officer of the Union, sent out a
report, in which he stated that &#145;out of 83 persons admitted into the Fulwood
Small-pox Hospital, 73 were vaccinated.&#146; All recovered, he alleged, but the ten
unvaccinated cases all died. Here was a bold and specific statement; but what were the
facts revealed after careful investigation by two committees? The first case reported as
unvaccinated turned out to be <i>a revaccinated policeman, </i>named Walter Egan. Another
case reported as unvaccinated was a child named Mary Shorrock, <i>vaccinated by the very
medical officer who returned her as unvaccinated. </i>In all, six cases out of the ten
were proved to have been vaccinated, whilst three were doubtful, we not being able to
trace them.&quot;&#151;From letter of Mr. J. SWINDLEHURST, in the <i>Walsall Observer, </i>July
2 1st, 1888.&#151;ED.<br>
(5.) In 1872, MR. JOHN PICKERING, of Leeds, carefully investigated a number of cases
entered as &quot;not vaccinated&quot; by the medical officers of the Leeds Small-pox
Hospital, tracing out the parents, examining the patients if alive, or obtaining the
certificate of vaccination if they were dead. The result was, that 6 patients, entered as
&quot;not vaccinated,&quot; and still living, were found to have good vaccination marks;
while 9 others who had died, and whose deaths had been registered as &quot;not
vaccinated,&quot; were proved to have been successfully vaccinated. In addition to these,
8 cases were proved to have been vaccinated, some of them three or four times, but
unsuccessfully, and 4 others were certified &quot;unfit to be vaccinated,&quot; yet all
were alike entered as &quot;unvaccinated.&quot; The full particulars of this investigation
are to be found in a pamphlet by MR. PICKERING, published by F. PITMAN, 20, Paternoster
Row, London.<br>
(6.)&#151;As further corroborative evidence of the untrustworthiness of all records on the
subject emanating from medical men, the following quotation from an article on
&quot;Certificates of Death,&quot; in the <i>Birmingham Medical Review </i>for January,
1874, is important; the italics are my own :&#151;&quot; In certificates given by us
voluntarily, and to which the public have access, it is scarcely to be expected that a
medical man will give opinions which may tell against or reflect upon himself in any way.
In such cases he will most likely tell the truth, <i>but not the whole truth, </i>and
assign some prominent symptom of the disease as the cause of death. As instances of cases
which may tell against the medical man himself I will mention <i>erysipelas from
vaccination, </i>and puerperal fever. A death from the first cause occurred not long ago
in my practice, and although I had not vaccinated the child, yet <i>in my desire to
preserve vaccination from reproach, I omitted all mention of it from my certificate of
death.&quot;</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The illustrative facts now given cannot be supposed to be exceptional,
especially when we consider the great amount of time and labour required to bring them to
light; and taken in connection with the astounding admissions of medical men, of which
examples have been just given, they prove that <i>no dependence can be placed on the
official records of the proportions of vaccinated and unvaccinated among Smallpox
patients; </i>while, if MR. VACHER&#146;S method of registration is usually followed,
about 8o per cent. of those classed by the Registrar-General under the heading &quot;no
statement&quot; have been really stated, by their parents or friends, to have been
vaccinated.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="OUR HOSPITAL STATISTICS NECESSARILY GIVE FALSE RESULTS."><strong>OUR
HOSPITAL STATISTICS NECESSARILY GIVE FALSE RESULTS.</strong></a></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But a still more serious matter remains to be considered, and it is a
striking proof of the crude and imperfect evidence on which the important question of the
value of vaccination has been decided, that the point in question has been entirely
overlooked by every English advocate of vaccination, although it involves an elementary
principle of statistical science.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This point is, that until the records in our hospitals,
&quot;vaccinated&quot; and &quot;unvaccinated,&quot; are strictly correct, and properly
classified, it can be demonstrated that true results cannot be deduced from them.* [*See
remarks in the Appendix on the eruption.&#151;ED.]</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requisite comparison has, however, been made on a population of
about 6o,ooo, consisting of the officials and workmen employed on the Imperial Austrian
State Railways, by the Head Physician, DR. LEANDER JOSEPH KELLER; and his results during
the years 1872-3 are so important that it is necessary to give a brief abstract of them.[<font

Railway Company for the year 1873. Translated from the German by MRs. HUME-ROTHERY.

published:&nbsp; The Mitigation Theory of Vaccination: an Account of the Statistics

Austrian State Railways. By ALFRED MILNES, M.A.&#151;London: K W. ALLEN, Ave Maria Lane.]</p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1.)&#151;It is shown that the death-rate of Smallpox patients is
greatest in the first year of life, then diminishes gradually to between the 15th and 20th
year, and then rises again to old age; <i>thus following exactly the same law as the
general mortality.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2.)&#151;The Small-pox death-rate, among over 2,000 cases, was 17.85
per cent. of the cases, closely agreeing with the general average. That of the
unvaccinated was <u>23.2O</u> per cent., while that of the vaccinated was only 1<u>5.61</u>
per cent.</p>

<p>(3.) &#151;This result, apparently so favourable to vaccination, is shown to be wholly
due to the excess of the unvaccinated in the first two years of life,* <font SIZE="2">[*
This applies to Austria. In England vaccination is usually performed earlier, yet, in a
pamphlet entitled <i>&quot;Plain Fads an Vaccination,&quot; </i>by G. OLIVER, about 1872,
it was stated that in the Small-pox Hospital, Hampstead,&#151;&quot; The number of the
unvaccinated patients, up to the age of ten years, greatly preponderates over the
vaccinated of corresponding ages.&quot; In the Homerton Small-pox Hospital in the eight
years 1871-77, there were 147 unvaccinated patients under 2 years old, to 20 vaccinated,
including among these the doubtful cases.</font>] and to be <i>a purely numerical fact
entirely unconnected with vaccination. </i>This is proved as follows :&#151;Taking, first,
all the ages above 2 years, the death-rates of the vaccinated is <u>13.76</u>, and of the
unvaccinated <u>13.15</u>,&#151; almost exactly the same, but with a slight advantage to
the unvaccinated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking now the first two years, the death-rate is found to be as
follows :&#151; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vaccinated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unvaccinated<br>
First year of life&nbsp; 60.46
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
45.24<br>
Second year of life 54.05
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
38.10</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus the Small-pox death-rate is actually <i>less </i>for the
unvaccinated than for the vaccinated in infants, and <i>equal </i>for all the higher ages;
yet the average of the whole is higher for the unvaccinated, <i>simply on account of the
greater proportion of the unvaccinated at those ages at which the mortality is universally
greatest.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is thus made clear that any comparison of the Small-pox mortality of
the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, <i>except at strictly corresponding ages, </i>leads
to entirely false conclusions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This curious and important fact may perhaps be rendered more easily
intelligible by an illustration. Let us take the whole population up to 20 years of age,
and divide it into two groups&#151;those who go to school, and those who do not. If the
Small-pox mortality of these were separately registered, it would be found to be very much
greater among the non-school goers,&#151;composed chiefly of infants, and of children too
weakly to be sent to school, amongst whom the mortality is always very great, so much so
that a doctor of wide experience&#151;DR. VERNON, of Southport&#151;has stated that, he
had never known an infant under one year of age recover from Small-pox. But we should
surely think a person either silly or mad who argued from such statistics that
school-going was a protection against the disease, and that school children formed a
&quot;protected population.&quot; Yet this is exactly comparable with the reasoning of
those who adduce the greater mortality among unvaccinated Small-pox patients of all ages
and conditions, as the very strongest argument in favour of vaccination!</p>

<p>Good statistics [It <font SIZE="2">must be insisted upon, over and over again, that
they are not good statistics, where the class under trial&#151;the vaccinated&#151;are in
great numbers of cases assumed not to be vaccinated against all testimony
available.&#151;ED.] </font>and good arguments cannot be upset, or even weakened, by those
which are bad. I have now shown that the main argument relied on by our adversaries, rests
on thoroughly unsound statistics, inaccurate to begin with, and wrongly interpreted
afterwards. Those which I have used, on the other hand, if not absolutely perfect, are yet
the best and most trustworthy that exist. I ask statisticians and men of unbiassed
judgment to decide between them. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="CONCLUSION FROM THE EVIDENCE.">CONCLUSION FROM THE EVIDENCE.</a></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result of this brief enquiry may be thus summarized</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(I.)-Vaccination does not diminish Smallpox mortality, as shown by the
45 years of the Registrar-General's statistics, and by the deaths from Small-pox of our
&quot;re-vaccinated&quot; soldiers and sailors being as numerous as those of the male
population of the same ages of several of our large towns, although the former are picked,
healthy men, while the latter include many thousands living under the most unsanitary
conditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2.)-While thus utterly powerless for good, vaccination * is a certain
cause of disease and death in many cases, and is the probable cause of about 10,000 deaths
annually by five inoculable diseases of the most terrible and disgusting character, which
have increased to this extent, steadily, year by year, since vaccination has been enforced
by penal laws!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><small>*the operation itself kills many.&nbsp; the registrar-General
gives, under the heading of Cow-pox and other effects [erysipelas, &amp;c.] of vaccination
for the years 1881-1886, the following deaths of infants under one year.&nbsp; In the
country, 255 deaths.&nbsp; In London, 61.&nbsp; Total for 6 years, 316.--ED.</small></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3.)-The hospital statistics, showing a greater mortality of the
unvaccinated than of the vaccinated, have been proved to be untrustworthy; while the
conclusions drawn from them are shown to be necessarily false.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If these facts are true, or anything near the truth, the enforcement of
vaccination by fine and imprisonment of unwilling parents, is a cruel and criminal
despotism, which it behoves all true friends of humanity to denounce and oppose at every
opportunity.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such legislation, involving as it does, our health, our liberty, and
our very lives, is too serious a matter to be allowed to depend on the misstatements of
interested officials or the dogmas of a professional clique. Some of the misstatements and
some of the ignorance on which you have relied, have been here exposed. The statistical
evidence on which alone a true judgment can be founded, is as open to you as to any doctor
in the land. We, therefore, demand that you, our representatives, shall fulfil your solemn
duty to us in this matter, by devoting to it some personal investigation and painstaking
research; and if you find that the main facts as here stated are substantially correct, we
call upon you to undo without delay the evil you have done.</p>

  <p>WE, THEREFORE, SOLEMNLY URGE UPON YOU THE IMMEDIATE REPEAL OF THE INIQUITOUS REPEAL
  LAWS BY WHICH YOU HAVE FORCED UPON US A DANGEROUS AND USELESS OPERATION-AN OPERATION WHICH
  HAS ADMITTEDLY CAUSED MANY DEATHS, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF GREATER MORTALITY THAN
  SMALL-POX ITSELF, BUT WHICH CANNOT BE PROVED TO HAVE EVER SAVED A SINGLE HUMAN LIFE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><a name="&nbsp;APPENDIX"><strong>&nbsp;APPENDIX</strong></a></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IN addition to other difficulties besetting the students of our
Hospital records, one stands prominently forward as exceeding the others. DR. WALLACE has
referred to the difficulty of comparing vaccinated with those called un-vaccinated, who
are a mixed class, often not even classed in age together. But a greater omission must be
complained of.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only correct way of classing Small-pox patients is by age and by
eruption. The eruption, or the state of the skin, is the only scientific guide to the
nature of the disorder. One kind of Small-pox is so mild, that even bad nursing can hardly
kill the patient&#151;another kind so fatal, that not the best nursing and greatest skill
can cure it. As a rule these two kinds are lumped together without any distinction, and
even when given they are not often divided into vaccinated and un-vaccinated. In general
summaries this classification is universally disregarded.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Metropolitan Hospitals have been in operation since 1869. During
the 16 years reported upon to the managers, since that time they have received 53,579
cases of Small-pox for treatment. Of this great total, no fewer than 41,061 are classed as
vaccinated, 5,866 unvaccinated, and the remainder as &quot;doubtful.&quot; The fatality of
the un-vaccinated and doubtful is very heavy, but this is largely due to considerations as
to the people who are the unvaccinated, which have already been urged, and which are
greatly strengthened by facts now to be adduced.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Handbook, 1887, giving these particulars, has no
&quot;doubtful&quot; class until 1880. Before that period the un-vaccinated absorbed them
all.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to this doubtful class! Why are there any doubts in the
classification? The answer is that the vaccination marks are on the skin, and the skin is
the part of the patient most affected in the very bad cases. In the mild cases the skin
does not suffer much. The vaccination marks are clearly visible. And so the
&quot;good&quot; marks of vaccination will most certainly be most numerous in the mild
cases. But in the confluent cases the skin is badly affected. The pustules run together,
and if this eruption is over the vaccinated arm, no vaccination mark can be seen. But no
case is recorded as vaccinated unless a mark is seen. So it comes to pass, that such a
patient declaring himself vaccinated is put down as &quot;doubtful,&quot; or a &quot;said
to be vaccinated.&quot; We see now why this class is of heavy fatality. It receives the
doubtful bad cases, but never any doubtful mild ones.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is further confirmed by a reference to the most fatal cases of
all, the &quot;malignant.&quot; In these the skin is not degraded as it is in the
confluent; the eruption is suppressed, and the blood poisoned. But the vaccination marks
show. From several reports of medical super-intendants, I have collected 661 of these very
fatal cases. In only 8 cases were there &quot;doubts.&quot; The rest yield: vaccinated,
486 persons with 432 deaths; and un-vaccinated, 167 persons with 150 deaths. Nothing more
damaging to vaccination could be recorded. Yet in a purely age table; or in a table of
vaccinated and un-vaccinated, without reference to the state of the skin, all this is
buried.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see then that in the mild cases, error as to classification is very
unlikely ever to occur. In these no deaths need be feared, except from complications.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the malignant also, the classification is not likely to err ; but in
very few hospitals is this table given.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the class midway between these, the errors arise. Here the skin is
dreadfully affected, and the errors will be numerous; and it is difficult to see how any
errors can be made except in favor of the vaccinated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this middle or confluent class, lie nearly all the doubtful cases.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore imperative, that we should have a reclassification of
all our hospital Small-pox. The tables should be three in number&#151;of mild, confluent,
and malignant Small-pox. And the patients ranged under them in age, and with full credence
to testimony of patients and friends, as to the vaccination or non-vaccination of the
sufferers. With these materials, a series of authentic facts as to the incidence of the
disease would soon be available.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, we appear to be too much at the mercy of whims and fancies,
as to the classification of Small-pox.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may here mention a kindred matter. Chickenpox, as is well known is
not a fatal disease; yet so loath are medical men to return vaccinated children as dying
of Small-pox, that we find now numerous deaths returned as due to Chickenpox. It should,
no doubt, be vaccinated Small-pox. The last issue of the Registrar-General thus, [p.
xiii.,] refers to this: &quot;The deaths ascribed to Small-pox in 1886 numbered 275, and
were far lower in proportion to the population than in any previous year. There were,
however, also 93 deaths ascribed to Chicken-pox; and as this ailment is rarely, if ever,
fatal, in all probability most or all of these deaths were really due to Small-pox.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I greatly regret that DR. WALLACE&#146;S health has been so poor as to
have prevented his editing this reprint. He has, however, looked over the proofs, and
concurs in the emendations and notes which appear in this edition.</p>

  <p ALIGN="center">DARLINGTON, Aug 1888</p>
  <p align="center"><strong><font color="#000000" size="+2">Forty-five Years' Registration
  Statistics.<br>
  A Correction. (S509: 1895)<br>
  </font>&nbsp; </strong></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> </font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,--While thanking my friend Mr.
  Alex. Wheeler for his too complimentary references to the little I have done for the cause
  of freedom as regards the tyranny of the Vaccination laws, I wish to make a remark as to
  one portion of his article which conveys an erroneous impression. Mr. Wheeler says that he
  could not agree with my conclusion that &quot;Vaccination may have caused more deaths than
  smallpox itself.&quot; This I am not surprised at, because I do not myself accept such a
  statement, which is certainly not mine. My words, carefully chosen, are--&quot;an
  operation which has admittedly caused many deaths, which is probably the cause of greater
  mortality than smallpox itself&quot;--and I call attention to the change from the past
  tense in the first part of the passage to the present tense--&quot;is probably the
  cause&quot;--in the latter part. This clearly means, not that &quot;Vaccination may have
  caused more deaths than smallpox&quot;--as Mr. Wheeler states it, without any limitation
  of time, which would of course be an absurdity--but that, at the <i>present time</i>, as
  the result of general Vaccination for about fifty years, it may <i>now</i> be the cause of
  more deaths than smallpox. This conclusion is drawn from the table of the
  steadily-increasing mortality from certain inoculable diseases (page 24 of my pamphlet),
  which <i>increase</i>, in thirty years (1850-1880), was 357 per million (an increase which
  has continued since), while the deaths from smallpox have not, for many years, averaged
  more than <i>one-fifth</i> of this amount. If, therefore, only <i>one-fourth part</i> of
  the large and steady increase of these diseases is due to Vaccination, then my belief that
  Vaccination <i>is now</i> the cause of greater mortality than smallpox itself is fully
  justified; and in the contention that this is &quot;probably&quot; the case I do not think
  that I shall find myself in the minority among the readers of the <i>Inquirer</i>. This
  indirect effect of Vaccination is further increased by its direct effects, which are now
  known to be far more terrible, and to produce far greater mortality than was formerly
  suspected or admitted.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take the opportunity of requesting such of your
  readers as may have copies of my pamphlet to erase from line 11 on page 21, to line 9 on
  page 22, 2nd edition (or, in the first edition, from line 8 on page 20 to line 4 on page
  21--Ed. V. I.), as the figures and conclusions therein are erroneous.<br>

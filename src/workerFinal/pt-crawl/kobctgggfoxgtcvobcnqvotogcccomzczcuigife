<h2>Chinese Takeouts in Ottawa</h2>
<p><b>Canadian Chinese cuisine</b> is a popular style of 
cooking in take-out eateries found across Canada. It was the first
form of commercially-available Chinese food here, and until recently
it was the only form. It was developed by early Cantonese 
immigrants who adapted their traditional recipes to Canadian tastes,
focusing on fast cooking times, local ingredients, and preparation 
methods that made the dishes more agreeable to Canadians. 
<p>Takeouts are usually small family businesses, so the menus are variable,
especially chop suey, which means 'leftovers' in Cantonese.
In recent years, many of Ottawa's Chinese eat-in restaurants outside Chinese 
areas have converted to "all you can eat" buffets heavy with deep-fried breaded 
foods. Some new restaurants serve dishes based closely on today's regional 
cuisines of China. But, takeouts still serve mostly the food described here.
<p>Anglicised transcriptions of Cantonese are often used to describe the 
dishes. This was probably adopted originally to 
enable unilingual Chinese to take orders; even today half those of Chinese 
origin in Canada can speak neither English nor French, and the proportion was much 
higher a century ago. Since the names are transliterated, spellings
vary, e.g. foo young being fu yung in some.
I've found the following so far in Ottawa:
<ul>
<li><b>Cha Gio Chay</b> - Vegetables in a dough wrapper, deep-fried. Usually called
vegetarian egg roll or spring roll.
<li><b>Char Siu</b> - Pork marinated in Hoisin sauce, sugar and house spices then
broiled. Usually called barbeque pork; 'char' means fork and 'siu' roasted. 
<li><b>Chop Suey</b> - Bean sprouts and fine slices or strips of colourful
vegetables such as carrots and bright green edged bok choy, stir-fried together.
'Chop' is slang for 'quick' in Cantonese.
Originally a derogatory term, chop suey can be a gourmet dish when prepared 
with fresh vegetables steamed over a fine broth. 
<li><b>Chow Fun</b> - Broad rice noodles. 
<li><b>Chow Mein</b> - Usually chop suey accompanied by crunchy pan-fried noodles, or
in a nest of dry noodles. 'Cantonese Chow Mein' is usually noodles (mein) stir-fried
(so they are soft) with mixed vegetables and meats. Chow has become common
North American slang for food. 
<li><b>Dai Dop Voy</b> - Mixed meats stir-fried with mixed vegetables.
<li><b>Dim Sum</b> - "touch heart", any bite-sized dish that can be shared with friends
<li><b>Foo Young</b> - Egg omelet with other things, usually including bean sprouts. 
<li><b>Gai Lan</b> - Broccoli.
<li><b>Gee Bow Guy</b> - Sliced marinated chicken (guy) wrapped in rice-flour wrappers
with fresh ginger and onions, deep-fried.
<li><b>General Tsao Chicken</b> - Chicken, deep-fried then seasoned with ginger,
garlic, sesame oil and hot peppers.
<li><b>Guy Ding</b> - Chicken cut in cubes (ding), almonds and vegetables.
<li><b>Har Gow</b> - Steamed wheat-flour dumplings (gow) filled with shrimp (har). 
<li><b>Hoisin</b> - A sauce made from salt-fermented soy beans, honey, vinegar
and mild peppers. Sometimes made with peanut butter instead of bean paste.
Sold premade in Chinese groceries, often coloured red (an auspicious colour). 
<li><b>Hoy Fan</b> - Fine rice noodles.
<li><b>Jar Doo</b> - Lightly breaded deep-fried meat, usually chicken wings, 
usually seasoned with ginger, soy sauce and vinegar. 
<li><b>Koo Loo</b> - Marinated in sweet and sour sauce (a mixture of sugar and vinegar).
<li><b>Kung Pao</b> - Diced chicken stir-fried with peanuts and hot peppers. 
<li><b>Lo Mein</b> - Stir-fried egg noodles and vegetables. 
<li><b>Ma Po</b> - A spicy hot sauce.
<li><b>Moo Goo Guy Pan</b> - Sliced chicken with fresh mushrooms (moo goo) and mixed vegetables. 
<li><b>Moo Goo Har Kew</b> - Shrimp, fresh mushrooms and mixed vegetables.
<li><b>Moo She</b> - Vegetables, black mushrooms and shredded egg omelet with 
black bean sauce rolled up in thin unleavened pancakes. (The name refers to 
flower petals, which the shredded omelet resembles among the dark ingredients.) 
<li><b>Soo Guy</b> - Chicken coated with a batter and deep-fried. 
<li><b>Siu Mai</b> - Steamed rice-flour dumplings. 
<li><b>Sum Kew</b> - Three kinds of meat.
<li><b>Sum See</b> - "Three colours", a dish with 3 kinds of something, usually meat or mushrooms.
<li><b>Woh Sew Guy</b> - Chicken stuffed with minced bamboo shoots and water chestnuts, deep fried.
<li><b>Wonton</b> - A Chinese equivalent of ravioli, made with rice-flour wrapping and
usually containing pork. Usually served in broth as a dumpling, but sometimes deep-fried. 
<li><b>Woo Dip Har</b> - Stir-fried shrimp, bacon and eggs. 
<li><b>Wor</b> - A stock pot (slow-cooked).

<p>In the last few decades, Ottawa has become one of the most culturally diverse cities
in Canada. However, many of the stores that serve these cultures are so small they can't
afford expensive advertising such as the Yellow Pages. Here are my favourite specialty
places where you can buy their foods. Find them at

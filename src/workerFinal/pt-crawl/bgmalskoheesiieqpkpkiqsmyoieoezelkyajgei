<p><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Letter to the Editor of <b><i>The
New York Review of Books</i></b> on Stephen Jay Gould's "Darwinian Fundamentalism"
(June 12, 1997) and "Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism" (June 26, 1997)</font></font>
<p>John Maynard Smith, one of the world's leading evolutionary biologists,
recently summarized in the <i>NYRB</i> the sharply conflicting assessments
of Stephen Jay Gould: "Because of the excellence of his essays, he has
come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist.
In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his
work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly
worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized
because he is at least on our side against the creationists." (<i>NYRB</i>,
Nov. 30th 1995, p. 46). No one can take any pleasure in the evident pain
Gould is experiencing now that his actual standing within the community
of professional evolutionary biologists is finally becoming more widely
known. If what was a stake was solely one man's self-regard, common decency
would preclude comment.
<p>But as Maynard Smith points out, more is at stake. Gould "is giving
non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory"
-- or as Ernst Mayr says of Gould and his small group of allies -- they
"quite conspicuously misrepresent the views of [biology's] leading spokesmen."[<a NAME="f1"></a><a href="#1">1</a>]
Indeed, although Gould characterizes his critics as "anonymous" and "a
tiny coterie," nearly every major evolutionary biologist of our era has
weighed in in a vain attempt to correct the tangle of confusions that the
higher profile Gould has inundated the intellectual world with.[<a NAME="f2"></a><a href="#2">2</a>]
The point is not that Gould is the object of some criticism -- so properly
are we all -- it is that his reputation as a credible and balanced authority
about evolutionary biology is non-existent among those who are in a professional
position to know.
<p>Why is this important? Evolutionary biology is relevant to a large number
of fields -- medicine, neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, cognitive
science, molecular biology, etc. -- that sometimes have an impact on human
welfare. Many scientists in these fields look to Gould, as America's most
famous evolutionist, for reliable guidance on his field, and so the cumulative
effect of Gould's "steady misrepresentation" has been to prevent the great
majority of leading scientists in these disciplines from learning about
or profiting from the rapid series of advances made in evolutionary biology
over the last thirty years. Since these advances have something substantial
to contribute to the biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences, the myths
and inversions actively cultivated by Gould over the last two decades have
materially retarded progress in these fields, a outcome that -- given the
human consequences -- one can hardly celebrate.
<p>Now science does not progress by authority or majority, and so biologists
do not see his heterodox macroevolutionary speculations, for example, as
a problem (they make him interesting, and have occasionally provoked some
genuinely worthwhile discussion)[<a NAME="f3"></a><a href="#3">3</a>].
For biologists, the central problem is that Gould's own exposition of evolutionary
biology is so radically and extravagantly at variance with both the actual
consensus state of the field and the plain meaning of the primary literature
that there is no easy way to communicate the magnitude of the discrepancy
in a way that could be believed by those who have not experienced the evidence
for themselves. Gould has pioneered something new in letters, something
practitioners of science studies would find well worth studying: anti-Gricean
science.
<p>Grice argued that interpreting the meaning of utterances is only possible
because listeners implicitly assume that speakers intend their utterances
to be responsive to the surrounding discourse, relevant, and (for the most
part) truthful. Gould's writings are full of brilliant rhetorical devices
that violate and so exploit these Gricean assumptions. For example, one
of Gould's many anti-Gricean devices is to pound the table about the truth
of obviousities (e.g., "But does all the rest of evolution...flow by simple
extrapolation from selection's power to create good design of organisms?"
or -- our personal favorite -- "I do not believe that members of my gender
are willing to rear babies only because clever females beguile us") implicitly
persuading any sane listener that his opponents or some important consensus
somewhere must hold the opposite and absurd view, if only in some toned
down form. In this series, Gould deploys this but-I-tell-you-the-sun-really-does-rise-in-the-east
device hebephrenically.
<p>As a immensely popular writer, Gould is conscious that he is paradoxically
safe from exposure in whatever he asserts because only minuscule number
of his readers will actually consult the original sources, with all the
rest trusting his warmly benevolent and credible persona. He uses this
insulation to devastating effect. Everyone who overhears only one side
of a conversation (such as the 99% of his readership who are exposed only
to Gould's accounts) automatically reconstructs what the other side of
the conversation must have been, in order to make Gricean sense of why,
for example, Gould said what he did. Literature and life are full of cases
where the unscrupulous exploit situations in which they know the audience
can only hear their side of the conversation to paint a wholly false picture
of the opinions and actions of the other speaker. The senator who screams
"Take away your filthy bribe!" utterly persuades onlookers of what the
other person must have said in a way that makes further inquiry scarcely
seem worth the effort. Fortunately for the interested few, in the sciences
we have a "security camera" called the primary literature that can actually
provide the other side of the conversation. When the background literature
is filled in, the picture of Gould inverts like a Necker cube, and his
essays become revealed as mini-theatricals carefully staged for purposes
of self-aggrandizement rather than for the careful and charitable pursuit
of the truth. We propose to roll back the "security camera" by consulting
the primary literature that Gould pretends to be reacting against in his
recent outburst, and compare against his critical claims.
<p>What are these claims? Gould affirms that he, like Darwin, is an eminently
sensible pluralist who sees that "natural selection has been the main but
not the exclusive means of modification." He contrasts his (lip-service)
pluralism with its "uncompromising" and "fanatical" opposite -- the "strict"
"dogmatic" (and wholly imaginary) doctrine of attributing "everything of
any importance in evolution" to selection, which for his targets supposedly
becomes the "effectively exclusive" explanation for "all the phenomena
of organic diversity" from mass extinctions to silent nucleotide substitutions.
He then (incredibly) sets about lecturing evolutionary biologists about
a series of self-evident commonplaces of our field, implying (e.g., "My
third pluralistic corrective to traditional theory"...) or stating in his
best but-the-sun-does-rise form that these are either almost unknown to
or play little or no role in the scientific practice of "traditional" evolutionary
biologists and evolutionary psychologists. He claims to "take up the methodology"
of evolutionary psychology and baldly states that "disciples of this new
art confine evolutionary accounts to the workings of natural selection
and consequent adaptation for personal reproductive success." In particular,
any reader of English would understand Gould to be specifically claiming
that we are panglossian panadaptationists (although perhaps retrospective
panglossians), are either unaware of or do not use neutral theories of
evolution in our work, never consider or test byproduct hypotheses, are
unaware that byproducts and constraints exist and are ubiquitous in the
design of organisms, are befuddled by the pervasiveness of contingency
in evolution, spend our time concocting "untestable" and hence "unscientific"
post hoc just so stories, and so on.
<p>In order to measure these claims against the primary literature, however,
it is important to recognize that we are clearly prime exemplars of who
and what Gould felt he was attacking in his two part series. Gould would
have to stipulate this not just because we (with Symons, Daly & Wilson,
Buss, Shepard, Pinker, and a few others [<a NAME="f4"></a><a href="#4">4</a>])
are the researchers most often associated with the emergence of evolutionary
psychology, but because (1) he cites our book The Adapted Mind explicitly
in his attack as one of two key texts (and in fact the only nonpopular
treatment cited), and (2) our reasoning work is the only actual research
in evolutionary psychology that Gould manages to specifically discuss in
his entire two article peroration. Moreover, as scientists who have been
trained and published in evolutionary biology in addition to psychology
and anthropology, we are entirely representative of the evolutionary biologists
Gould targets as well. If there is any truth whatsoever in what Gould says
about evolutionary psychologists, adaptationists, or evolutionary biologists,
it would have to be true of us, and so our work can fairly serve as a test
case for Gould's essential accuracy.
<p>With this in mind, the issue we will be addressing is, are Gould's characterizations
of his opponents' positions intelligible exaggerations (e.g., saying we
use adaptationist principles exclusively when he means "more than I care
for"), do they move beyond exaggeration into the incoherently wrong (e.g.,
confusing cabbages with concubinage), or indeed do they often transcend
being completely wrong by aspiring to achieve the reverse of the truth
(e.g., locating the orbit of the moon within the Earth's core).
<p>We will start with Gould's first concrete statement about us. In it,
he characterizes the proposed function of the cognitive specializations
that we have experimentally investigated [<a NAME="f5"></a><a href="#5">5</a>]
as "the ability to detect infidelity and other forms of prevarication."
This is scores as completely wrong: the proposed mechanism does not detect
infidelity or deception, nor has anything whatsoever to do with either
deception or infidelity. Instead it is an enhanced cognitive ability to
reason about instances of compliance and noncompliance in situations of
reciprocal cooperation. This level of scholarly inaccuracy is entirely
standard for Gould whether discussing biology or psychology, but we admit
it registers only as a gross error (e.g., confusing Hoagy Carmichael with
Stokely Carmichael) and not as a complete mirror reversal of the truth.
<p>So what does the primary literature say about his bill of particulars
on ultra-Darwinism? The few who bother to look at the chapter that Gould
discusses on our reasoning experiments should be astonished to discover
that we tested not only an adaptationist hypothesis about human reasoning,
but six different byproduct hypotheses as well (byproduct hypotheses are
derived and tested regularly in our empirical papers, as they are routinely
in other "adaptationist" research in evolutionary psychology and biology).
Indeed, one literally could not open any paper of ours on psychology (including
the ones Gould cites) without finding careful discussions of adaptations,
byproducts, and features present through neutral drift or chance, along
with other determinants of evolutionary outcomes ("mutation, recombination,
genetic hitch-hiking, antagonistic pleiotropy, engineering constraints,
antagonistic coevolution" etc., etc.). However, rather than being satisfied
with Gould's preferred, and anti-empirical, stance that given the plurality
of possible explanations there is no way to tell which are true, our papers
show an intense concern with the full range of available empirical and
conceptual methods for falsifiably distinguishing the effects of chance,
byproduct, and selection.
<p>But what about our "sterile" and "impoverished" neglect of the "rich"
theory of neutralism? In our 1982 work proposing that parasite pressure
drove the evolution of sex and the maintenance of genetic polymorphism,
we explicitly used neutralist theories of evolution to evaluate contrasting
predictions about the distribution of alleles driven by chance vs. frequency-dependent
parasite pressure. In this way we were and are no different than any other
adaptationist biologist, who use molecular clocks and other applications
of neutralism routinely in research, as well as, for example, random walk
and byproduct null hypotheses. Several years later, we integrated these
theories about polymorphism and parasitism with other selectionist and
nonselectionist findings to derive a possible reconciliation for the apparently
contradictory empirical discoveries of (1) a Gray's Anatomy-style species-typical
human design and (2) the discovery by Lewontin and others of large reservoirs
of genetic differences between humans. In that article, we derive the result
that "most heritable psychological differences are not themselves likely
to be complex psychological adaptations. Instead they are mostly evolutionary
byproducts, such as concomitants of parasite-driven selection for biochemical
individuality..." or "genetic noise" -- and go on to say that researchers
will find it useful to identify the "differences that are adaptive (the
smallest category), (b) differences that are maladaptive, and (c) differences
that are effectively neutral (the largest category)." Here we claim that
thousands of interesting psychological phenomena (of interest to psychopharmacologists,
psychiatrists, behavior geneticists, personality psychologists, etc.) are
not adaptations, but are byproducts of adaptations, negative mutations,
or are the results of the neutral genetic variants analyzed in Kimura's
theory.
<p>Regarding historical contingency, in our 1981 paper attempting to derive
the principles of intragenomic conflict, we wrote that "the particular
sequence of intragenomic events may explain major trait sets in a way that
the simple appeal to ecological circumstances by themselves cannot. This
gives an unstable, interactive, and historical character to the evolutionary
process." As for panglossian attributions of optimality, we go on to say
that this conflict and its byproducts may explain why genetic systems "are
so filled with non-optimal aberrations."
<p>We mention this paper (aside from crossing two other false accusations
off the list) because of the light it throws on both Gould's attitudes
towards empiricism, and his campaign to stigmatize Dawkins, the brilliant
and authentic native voice of modern evolutionary biology. For twenty years
Gould has showered Dawkins with abuse, ostensibly because Dawkins has argued
(in Gould's present lame rendering) that "genes struggl[e] for reproductive
success within passive bodies (organisms) under the control of genes --
a hyper-Darwinian idea that I regard as a logically flawed and basically
foolish caricature of Darwin's genuinely radical intent." Foolish it may
sound, and wrong it might have been, but in all these years it has seemingly
not occurred to Gould to look at the natural world to see. This is just
what Eberhardt and we did in parallel papers on intragenomic conflict --
we derived clear predictions from the Dawkins/Williams view of the reality
of genic selection as distinct from individual selection, and substantiated
them with scores of well-documented phenomena. Now Gould may understandably
have missed those early papers, but 17 years of subsequent papers by Hurst,
Hamilton, Haig, Skinner, Werren and dozens of others in <i>Science</i>,
<i>Nature</i>,
<i>Evolution</i>, etc., have provided a formidable body of empirical support
for these and newer predictions about intragenomic conflict. This flood
of publications would have led an honest and scholarly soul to admit that
Dawkins has been brilliantly vindicated, or led a more abashed soul to
at least become silent on the subject, but it has led our anti-Gricean
simply to repeat the charges unamended even unto his latest article, falsely
communicating to his audience the natural world has had nothing to say
on the subject. Equally, no competent modern evolutionary biologist would
use the phrase or concept of "personal reproductive success" as Gould does
for "the Darwinian summum bonum" that defines what selection favors. This
is not just because the phenomena of intragenomic conflict deconstruct
that concept from below, but more profoundly because, at least since Hamilton's
classic work in 1964, biologists have recognized that selection will favor
decrements in individual reproductive success if that sufficiently enhances
the reproduction of kin. (Indeed, Gould's writings in general so often
lack any evident awareness of modern theories, distinctions, and tools,
that they give the impression to the biologically educated of someone who
has been "cutting class" for the last thirty years.)
<p>The "just so" story inversion: Gould once again propagates his famous
claim, accepted naively by nonbiologists, that the adaptationist program
as practiced by leading researchers consists inherently of post hoc and
unfalsifiable storytelling about the imagined ancestral functions of design
features that <i>one already knows about</i>. This exactly reverses the
practice: Given that we know so little about the human brain and cognitive
architecture, what researchers most desperately need are powerful theoretical
tools that can help them design experiments to more efficiently search
for otherwise unsuspected organization -- that is, for <i>design features
that have not yet been observed</i>. Modern selectionist theories are used
to generate rich and specific prior predictions about new design features
and mechanisms that no one would have thought to look in the absence of
these theories, which is why they appeal so strongly to the empirically
minded. It may certainly turn out, for example, that we are wrong in our
heterodox view that the faculty of human reasoning includes a large and
heterogeneous set of evolved, functionally specialized circuits (for cooperation,
threat, hazard avoidance, etc.). But the point is that modern evolutionary
functionalism led to a series of predictions about human reasoning that
no one would otherwise have thought to make or to test, and so to discoveries
that would otherwise not have been made (including of neural dissociations
along predicted functional dimensions of exactly the kind Gould claims
evolutionary psychologists have not provided). As we pointed out in the
Adapted Mind, "an explanation for a fact by a theory cannot be post hoc
if the fact was unknown until after it was predicted by the theory and
if the reason the fact is known at all is because of the theory...". Even
when adaptationists start with a known phenomenon, hypotheses about function
are used to make predictions about new and uninvestigated aspects of design.
Indeed, an exasperated George Williams and Randy Nesse, in their classic
appeal to the medical community to learn about and exploit modern evolutionary
principles in their research [<a NAME="f6"></a><a href="#6">6</a>], were
driven to construct a table of new adaptationist discoveries reported in
just a single volume of the journal <i>Evolution</i>, in a vain attempt
to counter this widely credited urban legend.
<p>It is exactly this issue of predictive utility, and not "dogma", that
leads adaptationists to use selectionist theories more often than they
do Gould's favorites, such as drift and historical contingency. We are
embarrassed to be forced, Gould-style, to state such a palpably obvious
thing, but random walks and historical contingency do not, for the most
part, make tight or useful prior predictions about the unknown design features
of any single species.
<p>This brings us finally to Gould's misrepresentation, delivered in his
best anti-Gricean form, on the impossibility of knowing the past. "But
how could we possibly obtain the key information that would be required
to show the validity of adaptive tales about an EEA [i.e., the environment
in which humans evolved]?" Well, as the <i>Adapted Mind</i> makes clear,
the goal of evolutionary psychology is to learn about the design of modern
humans, rather than, as Gould claims, to "show the validity of adaptive
tales" about the past. Yet Gould's argument that we can know nothing reliably
enough about the ancestral world from which to derive useful predictions
is marvelously telling about Gould, given that he has ostensibly dedicated
his life to the scientific study of the past. It is, nonetheless, patently
false.
<p>Those who actually work across disciplines on the inferential reconstruction
of the past realize that we know with certainty thousands of important
things about our ancestors -- many of which can be useful in guiding psychological
(or e.g., medical) research: Our ancestors nursed, had two sexes, hunted,
gathered, chose mates, used tools, had color vision, bled when wounded,
were predated upon, were subject to viral infections, were incapacitated
from injuries, had deleterious recessives and so were subject to inbreeding
depression if they mated with siblings, fought with each other, lived in
a biotic environment with felids, snakes, and plant toxins, etc. It is
a certainty that our ancestors lived in a world in which the principles
of kinematic geometry governed the motions of objects (a set of facts that
allowed Roger Shepard to develop his theories about the evolutionary foundations
of psychophysics that, in part, won him the National Medal of Science).
It is equally a certainty that hominids had eyes, looked at what interested
them, and absorbed information about what they were looking at, making
eye-gaze direction informative to on-lookers. Simon Baron-Cohen, at Cambridge
University, has elaborated a subtle and far-reaching research program based
on these obvious facts about the ancestral world, leading to the discovery
of a series of important cognitive, developmental, and neural phenomena.
And obviously, one can derive valuable experimental hypotheses even from
possible rather than certain features of the ancestral world, while the
many features of the ancestral world about which we are ignorant simply
do not form the basis for experiments.
<p>So, on our lack of pluralism, on neutralism, on confining ourselves
to selectionist stories, on a failure to consider or test byproduct hypotheses,
on genic selectionism, on post hoc accounts, etc., Gould has demonstrably
gone far beyond simple exaggeration, far beyond the wildly erroneous and
has sprinted back to his favorite haunt -- the land of joyous, abandoned,
systematic, and hilarious inversions of the truth. He cannot plead either
ignorance, or that we are unrepresentative, since <i>he</i> picked <i>us</i>
as his paradigm examples, <i>he</i> picked and enumerated his grounds for
criticizing us, and <i>he</i> even picked the texts on which these issues
could fairly be judged (all the points mentioned above are clearly reviewed
in the sources he cited, with the exception of intragenomic conflict, which
is only minimally mentioned in <i>The Adapted Mind</i>, although well-known
to anyone who has read a textbook or journal in the last decade). And excepting
macroevolution, these are even the themes on which he built his career,
and so on which he can be expected to have special expertise. If he is
so wrong here, on what ground less familiar to him can he be trusted as
an authority, or even a confused reporter, struggling to get the gist?
<p>What is so sorry about this situation is not that this is a rare excess
of Gould's, but rather that it is not. Biologists will recognize this as
completely representative of his usual spectacular distortions of evolutionary
biology. What is unrepresentative about this case is that Gould exposed
himself to the possibility of being tested by a moment of incautious specificity
in which he cited one primary text, and did so in a widely read forum that
takes letters.
<p>This brings us to, in the eyes of evolutionary biologists, the single
most significant and amazing of Gould's mirror reversals -- the panadaptationism
inversion: Gould has nearly made a career of claiming that modern evolutionary
biologists suffer from a tendency to uncritically overattribute adaptation.
The accusation of panglossianism is widely and uncritically believed on
Gould's authority by those too distant from the primary literature to know
better. What Gould knows, and trusts the reader not to know, is that the
revolution in evolutionary biology that began in the 1960's was rooted
exactly and specifically in a widespread reaction against and rejection
of the practice of overattributing adaptation. That is, what defined the
emergence of modern adaptationism as both a community and set of theories
was just this anti-panglossian revolution. In <i>Adaptation and Natural
Selection</i> -- what has been described both as the most important book
in evolutionary biology written in this century, and the defining volume
in modern adaptationism -- George Williams begins his summary in the table
of contents by saying "Evolutionary adaptation is a special and onerous
concept that should not be used unnecessarily, and an effect should not
be called a function unless it is clearly produced by design and not by
chance. When recognized, adaptation should be attributed to no higher a
level of organization than is demanded by the evidence." These are the
very first words in the book. It was just this adaptationist community
who cleansed biology of panglossianism, panadaptationism, fuzzy attributions
of function, teleology, and progress by a series of theoretical advances
(inclusive fitness theory, refinements on the units of selection, falsifiable
criteria for judging adaptation and its absence, etc.). In the years that
followed, they won this debate by establishing clear standards of evidence,
a tradition of rigorous hypothesis testing, and by being very restrictive
and narrowly selective in the scope of phenomena entertained as potential
candidates for functional explanation (indeed, as we shall see, more restrictive
than Gould is). Gould, starting over a decade later, borrowed this critique
without attribution. Amazingly, Williams' book and other similar references
are simply not cited by Gould in his critiques in what must qualify as
one of his most brazen examples of anti-Gricean manipulation, because he
then turns around and diametrically misrepresents the very community from
which he drew his ideas.
<p>Ironically, one of the theories that this revolution cast into doubt
as a probable panglossian overextension was the idea that species selection
plays a prominent role in building adaptations. Gould conceals this, for
this is a panglossian overextension that Gould himself champions, as one
dimension of his views on punctuated equilibrium. So Gould's claim in this
series that "The study of mass extinction has also disturbed the ultra-Darwinian
consensus" is yet still another inversion (who can keep up?), for random
contingency in <i>species</i> extinction (as opposed to the selection of
alternative alleles in populations) would only disturb species selectionists.
And, as Dawkins mordantly asks in his review of <i>Wonderful Life</i>,
"who is the most prominent advocate of higher-level selection today?"
<p>Now, given the foregoing, one is left with the puzzle of why Gould so
customarily reverses the truth in his writing. We suggest that the best
way to grasp the nature of Gould's writings is to recognize them as one
of the most formidable bodies of fiction to be produced in recent American
letters. Gould brilliantly works a number of literary devices to construct
a fictional "Gould" as the protagonist of his essays and to construct a
world of "evolutionary biology" every bit as imaginary and plausible as
Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Most of the elements of Gould's writing
make no sense if they are interpreted as an honest attempt to communicate
about science (e.g., why would he characterize so many researchers as saying
the opposite of what they actually do) but come sharply into focus when
understood as necessary components of a world constructed for the fictional
"Gould" to have heroic fantasy adventures in -- adventures during which
the admirable character of "Gould" can be slowly revealed.
<p>In the course of these engaging tales, Gould the author introduces us
to a gallery of vivid villains and ethnicities, such as "adaptationists,"
"Dawkins" and the soulless "hyperreductionists" with their vivisectionist
appetites, "Wilson" and the sinister "sociobiologists", "biological determinists,"
and most recently, the holy-rolling "Darwinian fundamentalists," including
"Maynard Smith" with his "simplistic dogmatism," "Dennett," "evolutionary
psychologists," and "Robert Wright." "Gould" the protagonist is a much
loved character (and not just in our household) who reveals himself to
be learned, subtle, open-minded, tolerant, funny, gracious to his opponents,
a tireless adversary of cultural prejudice, able to swim upstream against
popular opinion with unflinching moral courage, able to pierce the surface
appearances that capture others, and indeed to be not only the most brilliant
innovator in biology since Darwin, but more importantly to be the voice
of humane reason against the forces of ignorance, passion, incuriousity,
and injustice. The author Gould, not least because he labors to beguile
his audience into confusing his fictional targets with actual people and
fields, is sadly none of these things.
<p>Since Gould is not, in fact, more insightful than other evolutionary
biologists, the real world of evolutionary biology cannot offer the ready
victories and surmountable challenges that Gould needs to establish the
heroism of "Gould." So real evolutionary biology must be abolished. If
as a byproduct or spandrel of this abolition, a generation of scientists
and general readers alike are miseducated, that is a small price to pay.
And indeed the whole post-1964 edifice of modern evolutionary biology built
by Williams, Hamilton, and Maynard Smith and scores of others is left out
of Gould's books, which is something like leaving quantum mechanics out
of the history of 20th century physics.
<p>Yet in the final analysis, there are genuine grounds for hope in the
immense and enduring popularity of Gould. Gould is popular, we think, because
readers see in "Gould" the embodiment of humane reason, the best aspirations
of the scientific impulse. It is this "Gould" that we will continue to
honor, and, who, indeed, would fight to bring the illumination that modern
evolutionary science can offer into wider use.

<p>The European Visual Archive (EVA) is a two-year, transnational project that began on 1 December 1998. It is being funded in part by the European Commission via DGXIII, the directorate responsible for telecommunications and the information market.  The EVA project is one of 20 selected from a total of over 140 applicants under the INFO2000 programme call for initiatives to exploit Europe’s public sector information.

<p>The EVA project is a European Strategic project involving both private and public sectors to stimulate the use of multimedia information content by exploiting resources in public archives.  The principal aim is to enhance access to European Heritage through digital preservation of archival collections.  In the case of EVA, this means photographs from 1900 to the present being digitised and displayed on the World Wide Web.  The universal nature of the photograph makes an ideal subject for an international project.  The dream would be for a researcher interested in a particular subject and time span to have ready access via the Internet to images held in many different archives across Europe.  Thus, someone researching docklands pre-1914 could locate images in Antwerp and London and compare installations regardless of language or national barriers.

<p>The initial stage of the project is to establish a large enough digital databank of photographs from the archives of two major cities, London and Antwerp, to examine the best methods of digitisation, levels of description, and presentation on a website.

<p>A total of 20,000 photographic images will be made available to researchers. The EVA project aims to extend this to other European public archives who then will be able to benefit from the EVA project studies on description standards, image quality, metadata, copyright and pricing policies.

<p>At the end of the project, a working model will be developed so that all European public archives will be able to use the system.  This working model will have solutions to language barriers; will use appropriate search and navigation methods; will employ direct charging systems; and, thereby, will introduce a very easily accessible tool for the multimedia industry and all archive users.

<p>The EVA partners are:
<ul>
<li>Telepolis Antwerpen (TA) Belgium
<li>London Metropolitan Archives (LMA) UK
<li>Stadsarchief Antwerpen (SAA) Belgium
<li>Nederlands Instituut voor Wetenschnappelijke Informatiediensten (NIWI) Netherlands
<li>European Commission of Preservation and Access (ECPA) Netherlands
<li>Lernout and Hanspie Speech Products (L+H) Germany
</ul>
<p>The project is worth approximately 1 million ECUs, of which the European Commission contributes 50%.

<p>EVA will run in partnership with a number of other information projects including EUAN (the European Union Archive Network) from the INFO2000 programme.  Whereas EVA is starting at item-level description of archives, the EUAN project is starting at series-level description of archives.  It will be useful to construct an interface between these two projects each of which have similar challenges, both technical and legal, to meet.

<p>EVA will work within international standards already established and looks forward to close co-operation with the International Council of Archives (ICA) and regional and national archives in the European Union.  The results of the EVA project will be disseminated as widely as possible.

Director, FYI<br>

<p>The purpose of my article, "Building Earth's Largest Library: Driving Towards the Future" was to explore what might happen if we applied
the Amazon.com business model to the library world. You can read the full
text of the article at <a href="http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/mar/searcher.htm">http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/mar/searcher.htm</a>, but the gist of it is this:

<p>Amazon built Earth's Biggest Bookstore by allowing their customers to search
one huge catalog listing all of the 4 million books, CDs, and videos they
had a reasonable chance of getting, even though Amazon actually only
maintains a few hundred thousand of the most popular titles in it's own
inventories.

<p>So, suppose we built Earth's Largest Library by allowing our patrons to
search a huge catalog that listed all the books (and other materials) we
could get, instead of just those few items that happened to be in our own
collections?  There are any number of ways you could build such a catalog,
but probably the easiest and most straight-forward approach would be to take
the OCLC Worldcat database and combine it with a list of current and
forthcoming titles like that found on Amazon. That would give you a catalog
of around 43 million items -- certainly enough to qualify as Earth's
Largest Library, and enough to satisfy the needs of even your most
discriminating patrons. (I know, I know, this catalog wouldn't include a lot
of non-English language material, and it would be heavily focused on the
US -- but we'd try to address those problems in the next phase.)

<p>Suppose further, that we've gone through that catalog and, wherever possible, 
we've "enhanced"  our cryptic bibliographic records by adding cover art,
jacket copy, tables of contents, indexes, reviews, selections from the
text, and anything else that might help our patrons evaluate and select the
books they want -- just as Amazon has gone through and added all kinds of
content, special browsing arrangements, recommendation "engines" and other
features to try to make it as easy as possible for their customers to find
what they want.

<p>Finally, suppose we made this catalog available over the Web, so your
patrons could logon and search it from anywhere in the world any time of the
day or night -- just as they can now with the Amazon catalog. And when
your patrons searched the catalog, they would get back a result set that
showed -- not who owned the item, or where it was located (most could care
less) -- but how quickly they could get it (e.g., this title available
immediately from at your local branch; this title ships in 24 hours; this title ships in 2-3 days; etc.) When a person found what they were looking for, all they
would have to do is "click" to check it out. They could arrange to pick
it up at their local library or have it shipped directly to them for a
small additional fee.

<p>Of course, all of this would cost a lot of money -- Amazon spends around
12.5 million per year to develop and operate its catalog, Web site and
transaction system -- but that is only a small percentage of the 465 million
per year <b><i>Library Journal</i></b> estimates libraries are currently spending on
automation systems alone. And the question is, how many catalogs and
circulation systems do we need?  Do we really each need to spend the
millions we are spending to maintain separate, and often pretty rudimentary,
catalogs and circulation systems at each institution, or wouldn't it be
better to pool our funds and develop one really nice catalog and circulation
system that would work for all?

<p>The article goes on to explore the various ramifications such a system might
have on library operations: how you might be able to use it to transform the
way we do collection development; how libraries might be encouraged to make
their collections available for loan; potential new revenue sources it might
open up; and so forth -- all in much greater detail than I can relate
here.

<p>I am very gratified that the article has generated a substantial amount of
interest and comment, -- enough so that the editor,  Barbara Quint, has
asked me to do a follow-up piece to try to address the various issues that
have been raised. I would welcome comments, suggestions, and even
criticisms, from the readers of <b><i>D-Lib Magazine</i></b> who might have an interest in this
subject matter. The only thing I ask is that you please read the article
first. It is over 10,000 words in length, and it is almost impossible for me
to do the article justice in this forum. Also, I'll need to have any comments by June 1st
in order to insure they are incorporated into the upcoming piece.  You may
email me at <a href="mailto:coffman@cerfnet.com">coffman@cerfnet.com</a>, or phone me at 1-800-582-1093. Feel free to
say whatever you'd like, I welcome any and all comments. Finally, if you
would like to explore the subject in more depth, you should know that the
Internet Librarian Conference is planning a full track on Building Earth's
Largest Library at it meeting in San Diego this November. For further

<li><a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub82/pub82text.html"><b>The Future of the Past: Preservation in American Research Libraries</b></a> by Abby Smith, Council on Library and Information Resources, April 1999.

<p>This report was written for educators, university administrators, and scholars, and provides a summary of both the problems of preservation and  progress that is being made. It also discusses the shortcomings of using digital technology alone as the total solution to the problems of preserving deteriorating materials since, although digitization increases access to research material, digitization also can be both costly and unreliable.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.it-link.demon.co.uk/IV99/"><b>International Conference on Information Visualisation</b></a>, 14 - 16 July 1999, London, England, UK.</li>

<p>The sponsors describe the scope of this conference thus:</p>
<p>"There is a growing demand in establishing processes through which data and information can be best captured, archived, shared and explored. Visualisation of data, information and knowledge is at the forefront of these activities that has led to a convergence in the use of computing among various disciplines. The diversity and complexity of information and its applications has consequently created a domain of erosion of boundaries between information users and information originators. This revolution has in turn created new contexts, needs, and potential for interaction between users and information. Now the core question is, how will humankind tame this boundless potential? </P>
<p>"The theme chosen for this conference is "A PROGRESS FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE". Information Visualisation'99 (IV’99) conference aims to focus on the interdisciplinary methods and affiliated research done among various science disciplines, medicine, engineering, media and commerce. This three day event will focus on the research and developments conjured to meet the roaring demand of today’s "Information Transfer" through the medium of computing, accentuating on the linkage that shapes academia and industry with the goal of stimulating views and providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can discuss the latest developments linked to Information Visualisation."</blockqute>

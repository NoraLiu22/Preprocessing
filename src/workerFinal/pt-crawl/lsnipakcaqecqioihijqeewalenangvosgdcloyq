The brain in an adult is only 2% of the total body weight, but uses 20% of
the blood supply.  It must be IMPORTANT!  Don't forget to read about good

For grades K-6<p>

<img src = "mre.gif" align = left> Whether you bike, skateboard, or
rollerblade, it is a good idea to wear a
helmet to protect your brain.  To demonstrate this, get two eggs.  Pretend
that the egg shell is a skull and the inside of the egg is a brain. Spread
some newspaper on the ground (it helps clean-up).  Drop one of the eggs on
the newspaper...it should break....it was not wearing a helmet. Make a
helmet for the second egg.  This helmet can be made of paper, styrofoam, 
or anything else that will cushion the egg.  Drop the egg wearing the
"helmet."  Notice that it remained unbroken (we hope).  This should
reinforce the idea that wearing helmets while biking, skating, etc. is a
good idea. Actually, if the eggs break while wearing the "helmet," it is a
good opportunity to ask why...was the "helmet" unsafe? Did the egg fall at 
an angle so that it was not protected?  How would you make the best 
helmet? <P>
I have heard of people doing this experiment with a WATERMELON thrown off
of a roof, but I have never tried it.  I am sure that this demonstration
would have a great "impact" on all those who watch.<P>

<LI>Egg "Helmet" - newspaper, styrofoam, etc.
<LI>Tape (to hold "helmet on the egg)
<LI>Newspaper - a few sheets to spread on the ground to clean up is easy.
<LI>Markers - you could draw a picture of Mr. Egghead on your eggs.

<p align="left">&quot;In 1811 and 1812 the inhabitants of New Madrid District 
experienced a series of the most terrific earthquakes that have ever occurred on 
the American continent. The best account of these fearful convulsions that could 
be obtained is given in the following letter, written to Rev. Lorenzo Dow: <br>
<br>
&quot;NEW MADRID TERRITORY, MISSOURI, March 22, 1816. <br>
Dear Sir: In compliance with your request, I will now give you a history, as 
full in detail as the limits of a letter will permit, of the awful visitation of 
Providence in this place and its vicinity. <br>
<br>
&quot;On the 16th of December, 1811, about 2 o'clock A.M., we were visited by a 
violent shock of an earthquake, accompanied by a very awful noise, resembling 
loud but distant thunder, but more hoarse and vibrating, which was followed in a 
few minutes by the complete saturation of the atmosphere with sulphurous vapor, 
causing total darkness. The screams of the affrighted inhabitants running to and 
fro, not knowing where to go or what to do, the cries of the fowls and the 
beasts of every species, the cracking of trees falling, and the roaring of the 
Mississippi, the current of which was retrograde for a few minutes, owing, as is 
supposed, to an eruption in its bed, formed a scene truly terrible. From that 
time until about sunrise a number of lighter shocks occurred, at which time one 
still more violent than the first took place, with the same accompaniments, and 
the terror which had been excited in every one, and indeed in all animal nature, 
was now, if possible, doubled. The inhabitants fled in every direction to the 
country, supposing (if it can be admitted that their minds were exercised at 
all) that there was less danger at a distance from than near the river. In one 
person, a female [Mrs. Lafont], the alarm was so great that she fainted, and 
could not be revived. There mere severa1 shocks a day, but lighter than those 
already mentioned, until the 23d of January, 1812, when one occurred, as violent 
as the severest of the former ones, accompanied by the same phenonema as the 
former. From this time until the 4th of February the earth was in a continual 
agitation, visibly waving as a gentle sea. On that day there was another shock, 
nearly as hard as the preceding ones; next day four such, and on the 7th, about 
4 o'clock A. M., a concussion took place, so much more violent than those which 
had preceded it, that it was denominated the hard shock. The awful darkness of 
the atmosphere which, as formerly, was saturated with sulphurous vapor, and the 
violence of the tempestuous thundering noise that accompanied it, together with 
all the other phenomena mentioned as attending the former ones, formed a scene, 
the description of which would require the most sublimely fanciful imagination. 
At first the Mississippi seemed to recede from its banks, and its water gathered 
up like a mountain, leaving, for a moment, many boats which were here on their 
way to New Orleans, on the bare sand, in which time the poor sailors made their 
escape from them. It then rising fifteen or twenty feet perpendicularly, and 
expanding, as it were, at the same moment, the bank overflowed with a retrograde 
current rapid as a torrent. The boats, which before had been left on the sand, 
were now torn from their moorings, and suddenly driven up a little creek, at the 
mouth of which they laid, to the distance, in some instances of nearly a quarter 
of a mile. The river, falling immediately as rapidly as it had risen, receded 
within its banks again with such violence that it took with it whole groves of 
young cottonwood trees which ledged its borders.<br>
<br>
&quot;They were broken off with such regularity in some instances that persons who 
had not witnessed the fact would with difficulty be persuaded that it had not 
been the work of art. A great many fish were left on the bank, being unable to 
keep pace with the water. The river was literally covered with the wrecks of 
boats, and it is said that one was wrecked in which there was a lady and six 
children, all of whom were lost. <br>
<br>
&quot;In all the hard shocks mentioned the earth was horribly torn to pieces, the 
surface of hundreds of acres was from time to time covered over of various 
depths by the sand which issued from the fissures which were made in great 
numbers all over the country, some of which closed up immediately after they had 
vomited forth their sand and water, which, it must be remarked, were the 
substances generally thrown up. In some places, however, there was a substance 
resembling stone-coal or impure stone-coal thrown up with the sand. It is 
impossible to say what the depth of these fissures or irregular breaks were. We 
have reason to believe that some were very deep. The site of this town was 
evidently settled down at least fifteen feet, and not more than half a mile 
below the town there does not appear to be any alteration in the bank of the 
river, but back from the river, a small distance, the numerous large ponds, or 
lakes, which covered a great part of the country, are nearly dried up. The beds 
of some of these are elevated above their former banks, several feet, producing 
an elevation often fifteen or twenty feet from their original state, and lately 
it has been discovered that a lake (Reelfoot Lake) was found on the opposite 
side of the Mississippi in the Indian country, upward of 100 miles in length, 
and from one to six miles in width of the depth of from ten to fifty feet. It 
has communication with the river at both ends, and it is conjectured that it 
will not be many years before the principle part, if not the whole of the 
Mississippi will pass that way. We were constrained, by fear of our houses 
falling, to live twelve or eighteen months after the first shocks in little 
light camps made of boards; but we gradually became callous and returned to our 
homes again. Most of those who fled from the country in the time of the hard 
shocks have returned home. We have felt since their commencement in 1811, and 
still continue to feel slight shocks occasionally. It is seldom that we are more 
than a week without feeling one, and sometimes three or four a day. There were 
two this winter past, much harder than we have felt for two years before, but 
since then they appear to be lighter than they have ever been, and we begin to 
hope that erelong they will entirely cease. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have now, Sir, finished my promised description of the earthquake, imperfect, 
it is true, but just as it occurred to my memory, many of the most of the truly 
awful scenes having occurred three or four years ago. They, of course, are not 
related with that precision which would entitle it to the character of a full 
confidence that it is given to a friend. And now, Sir, wishing you all good, I 
must bid you adieu.<br>
Your humble servant, ELIZA BRYAN. <br>
<br>
&quot;The center of disturbance seems to have been in the vicinity of Little Prairie, 
as it was there the greatest damage was done. Mr. Godfrey Lesieur, then a boy 
living at that place, wrote a description of the phenomena, from which the 
following is condensed: The earthquakes spent their greatest force in Pemiscot 
County. The first shock occurred at 2 o'clock A. M., on December 16, 1811, and 
was very hard, shaking down log houses, chimneys, etc. It was followed at short 
intervals by comparatively slight shocks until about 7 o'clock in the morning, 
when a rumbling noise was heard in the west resembling distant thunder, and in 
an instant the earth began to shake and totter to such a degree that no one was 
able to stand or walk. This lasted about one minute, At this juncture the earth 
was observed to be rolling in waves of a few feet in height, with a visible 
depression between. Soon the swells were seen to burst, throwing upward large 
volumes of water, sand, and a species of charcoal, some of which were covered 
with a substance having a sulphurous odor. When these swells burst, large 
fissures were formed, running north and south, parallel with each other for 
miles. The rumbling noise and the waves seemed to come from the west and travel 
eastward, Slight shocks were felt at intervals until January 23, 1812, when the 
country was visited by another earthquake, equally as violent as the first, and 
characterized by the same frightful results. Then it was that the cry arose 
among the people, “sauze qui peut!&quot; (&quot;save who can&quot;), and all but two families 
left the country.<br>
<br>
&quot;After the terrible shock of the 7th of January slight ones were from time to 
time experienced, until the 7th of February, when another very severe one, 
having the same effects as the other occurred, and caused great injury to land, 
in forming more extensive fissures, sinking high lands, and forming it into 
lakes, and making deep lakes high land. </p>
<p align="left">It is a remarkable fact that so few casualties occurred during 
these terrible convulsions. Among the citizens there were but two deaths. Mrs. 
Lafont died from fright, and Mrs. Jarvis received an injury from the fall of a 
cabin log, from which she died a few days later. Several stories have been 
handed down of the curious freaks of the earthquake. One of the most remarkable 
incidents occurred ten miles below Little Prairie on Pemiscot River. An old man 
named Culbertson with his family lived on a short bend in the river. About an 
acre of ground lay between his house and the river, and in this space was 
situated the well and smokehouse. On the morning of the 16th of December, after 
the second hard shock had subsided, Mrs. Culbertson started to the well for 
water and to the smokehouse for breakfast meat, when, to her great astonishment, 
no well or smokehouse was to be seen. Upon further search, they were both found 
on the opposite side of the river, and a canoe was necessary to reach them. The 
swelling of the earth had formed a fissure across the bend wide enough to permit 
the whole volume of the water to pass through, and the great pressure upon the 
point thus isolated forced it to the opposite bank, when the next land wave 
appeared. <br>
<br>
&quot;These earthquakes were felt all over the Mississippi Valley, but no serious 
damage was done beyond a radius of about one hundred miles from Little Prairie. 
The following letter, written from Cape Girardeau to the Louisiana Gazette, 
indicates the extent of the damage at that place. <br>
<br>
&quot;CAPE GIRARDEAU, February 15, 1812.<br>
The concussions of the earthquake still continue. The shock on the 23d ult. was 
more severe and longer than that of December 16, and the shock of the 7th inst. 
was still more violent than any preceding, and lasted longer, perhaps, than any 
on record (from ten to fifteen minutes-the earth was not at rest for an hour). 
The ravages of this terrible convulsion have nearly depopulated the district of 
New Madrid; but few remain to tell the sad tale. The inhabitants have fled in 
every direction. It has done considerable damage in this place by demolishing 
chimneys and cracking cellar walls. Some have been driven from their houses, and 
a number are yet in tents. No doubt volcanoes in the mountains of the west, 
which have been extinguished for ages, are now reopened. <br>
<br>
&quot;The destruction of large areas of previously good land left many persons 
homeless and landless, who had obtained grants from the Spanish Government or 
had made entries under the United States. For the relief of such persons 
Congress, on February 17, 1815, passed a law, providing for the relocation of 
their claims. Persons who had lost lands to the amount of 160 acres or less were 
permitted to locate any amount not exceeding one quarter section upon any lands 
then open for settlement, but relocations of more than one section were not 
allowed to those who had lost a greater amount. This beneficent act in a great 
measure failed of its object. The manner of procuring a title under it was 
tedious and expensive, and the claims in most cases were purchased by 
speculators and land-sharks, in whose hands they became instruments of fraud.&quot;</p>

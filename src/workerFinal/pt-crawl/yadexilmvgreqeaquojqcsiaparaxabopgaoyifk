<br>
<i>Philosophy and Literature</i> 22 (1998): 478-85 
<p>
In <i>How the Mind Works</i>, Steven Pinker offers a splendidly fluent and lucid 
survey of evolutionary psychology. Pinker propounds the view that the mind has 
evolved under the shaping pressure of natural selection and that it has developed 
a number of mental "modules"--chunks of cognitive software--designed to solve 
specific adaptive problems. Apart from the sense organs, these postulated modules 
include adaptations for understanding arithmetic, logic, language, physical objects 
and forces, natural kinds (plants and animals), other human minds, kinship, social 
status relations, sexual behavior, parent-child relations, and the sense of individual 
identity. Evidence for the existence of such modules derives from an overlapping 
array of disciplines, from theoretical biology, behavioral genetics, cognitive 
and developmental psychology, comparative anthropology, animal ethology, experimental 
psychology, neurobiology, and endocrinology. Though he is not himself an original 
thinker--only a popularizer of an unusually high order--Pinker organizes all this 
information into an impressively coherent body of ideas. 1 
<p>
The inexorable logic of the adaptationist program requires that evolutionary psychology 
assume the position of a matrix discipline within the field of liberal education. 
From the adaptationist perspective, psychology is rooted in biology, and all cultural 
studies, including both the social sciences and the humanities, are rooted in 
psychology. Pinker formulates this logic with characteristic concision: 
<ol>
  The geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously wrote that nothing in biology 
  makes sense except in the light of evolution. We can add that nothing in culture 
  makes sense except in the light of psychology. Evolution created psychology, 
  and that is how it explains culture. (p. 210)
</ol>
Pinker’s voluminous bibliography gives ample evidence that a large cadre of evolutionary 
scientists are already striving to make good on such claims for a wide range of 
topics in the social sciences. Within the humanities, far fewer people have been 
at work and the program of research has been less clearly laid out. Drawing a 
parallel with the colonization of North America at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, 
we can identify the social sciences with the populous eastern seaboard and the 
humanities with the far western territory. However manifest the destiny, the continent 
remains to be mapped. 2 
<p>
Pinker’s disciplinary home base is in cognitive psychology and linguistics. (He 
is head of cognitive neuroscience at MIT.) To illustrate and decorate his text, 
he has collected a substantial number of relevant quotations from literature, 
but there is no evidence that his familiarity with most of the works he quotes 
extends very far beyond the quotations. His literary taste and judgment seem those 
of an undergraduate who is extraordinarily bright but who is much more sensitive 
to computers than to poems, plays, or novels. Nonetheless, conscientiously seeking 
to vindicate the scope of his title, Pinker ventures to situate literature, theoretically, 
within the general map of evolutionary psychology. 
<p>
Pinker poses a question that is basic for all mental operations within the evolutionary 
framework--the question of adaptive function. Displaying an excellent intuitive 
capacity for seizing on apposite commonplace, he identifies two obvious purposes 
of literature: instruction and entertainment, the <i>utile</i> and <i>dulce</i> 
of Horatian lore. The first of these, he supposes, might have some genuine adaptive 
value. Literature, like social gossip, teaches us about the games people play 
and prepares us to enter into such play. "Life is like chess, and plots are like 
those books of famous chess games that serious players study so they will be prepared 
if they ever find themselves in similar straits" (p. 542). Knowledge might be 
adaptive, but the pleasure afforded by art, Pinker thinks, is merely a non-adaptive 
exploitation of adaptive sources of pleasure. The arts respond to "a biologically 
pointless challenge: figuring out how to get at the pleasure circuits of the brain 
and deliver little jolts of enjoyment without the inconvenience of wringing bona 
fide fitness increments from the harsh world" (p. 524). In this respect, literature 
and the other arts would work in the same way as alcohol, drugs, and rich deserts. 
Hence Pinker’s suggestion that "music is auditory cheesecake, an exquisite confection 
crafted to tickle the sensitive spots of at least six of our mental faculties" 
(p. 534). The pleasure afforded by literature is of a similar kind: 
<ol>
  Now, if the intellectual faculties could identify the pleasure-giving patterns, 
  purify them, and concentrate them, the brain could stimulate itself without 
  the messiness of electrodes or drugs. It could give itself intense artificial 
  doses of the sights and sounds and smells that ordinarily are given off by healthful 
  environments. We enjoy strawberry cheesecake, but not because we evolved a taste 
  for it. We evolved circuits that gave us trickles of enjoyment from the sweet 
  taste of ripe fruit, the creamy mouth feel of fats and oils from nuts and meat, 
  and the coolness of fresh water. Cheesecake packs a sensual wallop unlike anything 
  in the natural world because it is a brew of megadoses of agreeable stimuli 
  which we concocted for the express purpose of pressing our pleasure buttons. 
  Pornography is another pleasure technology. . . . [T]he arts are a third. (pp. 
  524-25)
</ol>
Despite the concession to the utility of fiction as a model for moves in the game 
of life, Pinker’s wider exposition makes it apparent that like Freud he regards 
literary representation as largely a matter of pleasurable fantasy. It is different 
from pornography only in that the pleasure buttons it presses are not those literally 
and concretely of sexual activity. 
<p>
Pinker’s hypothesis about the pleasure of art reflects a prejudice common to evolutionary 
psychology--the idea that only those functions that evolved in the distant evolutionary 
past have any particular adaptive status. We can call this prejudice the bias 
for the EEA ("environment of evolutionary adaptedness"). Evolutionary psychologists 
tend to regard the EEA as a relatively static condition in which the human mind 
was fixed and finished sometime before the past 100,000 years or so. An important 
correction to this prejudice has been proposed in Steven Mithen’s recent book 
<i>The Prehistory of the Mind</i>. Mithen is a cultural archaeologist. He has 
fully assimilated the idea of "the modular mind," but he has also broken free 
from the premature concretization of the EEA. He describes the cultural revolution 
that took place about 40,000 years ago and that introduced complex multi-part 
tools and the elements of higher culture, including art, religion, and more complex 
forms of social organization. How to account for this explosion of creative activity? 
Mithen postulates an organically based cognitive development in which the previously 
separate domains of the mind became accessible to one another. He argues that 
the domains devoted to technical understanding, social interaction, and natural 
history blended together, and that out of this blend there emerged an entirely 
new range of creative cognitive activity. Mithen describes this new capability 
as "cognitive fluidity," and he argues cogently that it is the basis for all our 
more imaginative, inventive cultural achievements. 3 
<p>
Now, art, music and literature are not merely the products of cognitive fluidity. 
They are important means by which we cultivate and regulate the complex cognitive 
machinery on which our more highly developed functions depend. Because he does 
not understand the necessity of such cultivation, Pinker believes that we could 
do without music and undergo no significant loss in our capacity to function. 
"Compared with language, vision, social reasoning, and physical know-how, music 
could vanish from our species and the rest of our lifestyle would be virtually 
unchanged. Music appears to be a pure pleasure technology, a cocktail of recreational 
drugs that we ingest through the ear to stimulate a mass of pleasure circuits 
at once" (p. 528). If we compare the effects of music with those of recreational 
drugs, we can begin to understand the mistaken direction Pinker’s theory has taken. 
Drugs are disorienting and demoralizing. If young people use them habitually, 
they become incapable of adapting to the demands of a complex environment. Music 
has no such deleterious effect. More importantly, it seems very likely that people 
raised with no exposure to music, art, or literature would be psychologically 
and emotionally stunted, that they would be only marginally capable of developing 
in normal ways. They would probably have great difficulty learning to deal with 
their own emotions or to relate to other people with any sensitivity and flexibility. 
Their capacity for responding in creative ways to the demands of a complex and 
changing cultural environment would probably be severely impaired. 
<p>
If we shift from the metaphor of drugs to that of cheesecake, we find similarly 
misleading implications. Rich deserts offer a purely sensual stimulus. They appeal 
only to the taste buds. They have no intrinsic emotional or conceptual content, 
and they convey no information from one mind to another. In contrast, art, music, 
and literature embody emotions and ideas. They are forms of communication, and 
what they communicate are the qualities of experience. Someone deprived of such 
experience would have artifically imposed on him a deficiency similar to that 
which is imposed on autistic children through an innate neurological defect. 4 
Unlike autistic children, a child deprived of all experience with art and literature 
would still have innate capacities for social interaction, but these capacities 
would remain brutishly latent. The architecture of his or her own inner life and 
that of other people would remain dully obscure. In the place of meaningful pattern 
in the organization of emotions and the structure of human needs and purposes, 
such a child would perhaps scarcely rise above the level of reactive impulse. 
It is not difficult to imagine an inner life consisting of large desolate tracts 
of restless confusion sporadically traversed by violent and incomprehensible storms 
of fear and desire. When we speak of civilization as a form of salvation, it is 
from such conditions that we envision ourselves being saved. 
<p>
The argument I’ve been making for the vital role of art in the healthy development 
of human beings is a central didactic theme in the works of one of our most psychologically 
astute novelists. In his great novel, <i>Bleak House</i>, Charles Dickens presents 
us with a case that we can compare with Pinker’s notion of human beings who are 
musically deprived but who are nonetheless perfectly healthy, happy, and wise. 
As a foil for the full humanity and achieved civilization of his protagonists, 
Dickens depicts a family of misers, the Smallweeds, who are wholly practical in 
orientation. The family is one of Dickens’ most vividly conceived set of grotesques. 
Grandfather Smallweed is paralytic, cunning, and venomous. He subdues the expression 
of his spite toward those from whom he would extract wealth, but he consoles himself 
by flinging pillows and imprecations at his senile wife, who breaks imbecile silence 
only to chatter in incoherent phrases about money. The young male heir to the 
house, Bartholomew Smallweed, is "a weird changeling" with "an old, old eye." 
He "drinks and smokes, in a monkeyish way" and "is never to be taken in; and he 
knows all about it, whatever it is." Bart’s sister Judy "never owned a doll, never 
heard of Cinderella, never played at any game." Judy cannot laugh and is incapable 
of playing with other children. She is "a pattern of sordid age." Dickens explains 
that in its exclusive fixation on gain, this family has "discarded all amusements, 
discountenanced all story-books, fairy tales, fictions, and fables, and banished 
all levities whatsoever. Hence the gratifying fact that it has no child born to 
it and that the complete little men and women whom it has produced, have been 
observed to bear a likeness to old monkeys with something depressing on their 
minds." 5 
<p>
The Smallweeds are constitutionally predisposed to this grotesque withering of 
their humanity. In <i>Hard Times</i>, a more schematically didactic presentation 
of the same theme, there are again two children who have been deprived of all 
imaginative cultivation, Tom and Louisa Gradgrind. Unlike the Smallweeds, these 
children are potentially normal, and they do not take happily to the imaginative 
desolation that has been imposed on them. Their father is a utilitarian ideologue. 
Convinced that art and literature are a waste of time and an influence corrupting 
to mental discipline, he eliminates all such influences from their carefully controlled 
curriculum. As a consequence of his educational policy, his children are morally 
and emotionally impaired, and the action of the plot flows from these impairments. 
As adults, the Gradgrind children can neither achieve personal fulfillment nor 
function as responsible citizens. Louisa proves incapable of developing a healthy 
marital bond, and Tom degenerates into common crime as a means of financing his 
vices. 
<p>
Pinker’s manner is rather different from that of Gradgrind, but the difference 
is not all in Pinker’s favor. He is charming and witty, but he is too easily pleased 
with himself at having said something he deems provocatively clever, and he has 
not thought through the implications of his bright idea. Gradgrind is dull and 
oppressive, but he pursues his mistaken ideological convictions in a serious and 
determined way. When the consequences of his policy become apparent, he is capable 
of achieving a tragic recognition of his mistake. Pinker’s tonal range does not 
include the capacity for tragic recognitions. He is unfailingly pleasant and self-possessed. 
Within the even tenor of his style, the closest approximation to grief and anguish 
would be a momentary compunction at having failed to pass up a desert tray. 
<p>
For Dickens, the period of childhood is a highly sensitive and vulnerable stage 
in which the whole personality can be forever stunted and impoverished by inadequate 
imaginative stimulus. From Oliver Twist through Pip, his books are full of stories 
of children who have been abused and neglected and who are threatened with lifelong 
degradation. Some, like Smike in <i>Nicholas Nickelby</i> and the crossing sweeper 
Jo in <i>Bleak House</i>, don’t survive this treatment. Those who do, like David 
Copperfield and like Esther Summerson, the protagonist of <i>Bleak House</i>, 
do so because they create an imaginative world of their own, and within this world 
they fashion an environment that is adequate to their needs of self-development. 
To create an imaginative world in which to develop is not the same thing as merely 
fulfilling a fantasy of pleasure. Esther is raised in a household devoid of affection, 
under the shadow of an obscure religious condemnation, but through conversations 
with her doll she creates a small imaginary space for human affection. Within 
this space, she can keep her own emotional nature alive until her aunt dies and 
she is removed to a more genial environment. The conversations she has with her 
doll are not fantasies of pleasure; they are desperate and effective measures 
of personal salvation. As a small boy, David Copperfield is tormented and abused 
by his vicious stepfather, but close to his own room he discovers a neglected 
store of old books, including <i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>Humphrey Clinker</i>, <i>Don 
Quixote</i>, and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. What David gets from these books is not 
just a bit of mental cheesecake, a chance for a transient fantasy in which all 
his own wishes are fulfilled. What he gets are lively and powerful images of human 
life suffused with the feeling and understanding of the astonishingly capable 
and complete human beings who wrote them. It is through this kind of contact with 
a sense of human possibility that he is enabled to escape from the degrading limitations 
of his own local environment. He is not escaping from reality; he is escaping 
from an impoverished reality into the larger world of healthy human possibility. 
By nurturing and cultivating his own individual identity through his literary 
imagination, he enables himself to adapt successfully to this world. He directly 
enhances his own fitness as a human being, and in doing so he demonstrates the 
kind of adaptive advantage that can be conferred by literature.

<b>Notes</b> 
<p>
1. Steven Pinker, <i>How the Mind Works</i> (New York: W. W. Norton, 1997). In 
a concise survey of the field, "Evolutionary Psychology: A New Paradigm for Psychological 
Science," <i>Psychological Inquiry</i> 6 (1995): 1-30, David Buss gives a better 
sense of evolutionary psychology as a developing discipline. He acknowledges the 
challenges evolutionary psychology has to meet if it is to make good on its promise 
to provide a unfiying paradigm for all of psychology. 
<p>
2. To get a sense of where things stand in the evolutionary study of literature, 
see Joseph Carroll, <i>Evolution and Literary Theory</i> (Columbia: University 
of Missouri Press, 1995); Robert Storey, <i>Mimesis and the Human Animal: On the 
Biogenetic Foundations of Literary Representation</i> (Evanston: Northwestern 
University Press, 1996); Brian Boyd, "Jane, Meet Charles: Literature, Evolution, 
and Human Nature," <i>Philosophy and Literature </i>22 (1998): 1-30; and Joseph 
Carroll, "Literary Study and Evolutionary Theory: A Review Essay," <i>Human Nature 
</i>(forthcoming). 
<p>
3. Steven Mithen, <i>The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, 
Religion, and Science </i>(London: Thames and Hudson, 1996), 194. The most authoritative 
and influential exposition of evolutionary psychology, containing both its most 
profound theoretical formulations and its premature concretization of the EEA, 
is that of John Tooby and Leda Cosmides in "The Psychological Foundations of Culture," 
in <i>The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture</i>, 
edited by Jerome H. Barkow, Leda Cosmides, and John Tooby (New York: Oxford University 
Press, 1992). Tooby and Cosmides are the originary inspirations for Pinker’s conversion 
to evolutionary psychology. 
<p>
4. Autism has been a main source of evidence for the so-called "theory of mind 
module," that is, the module that enables people to imagine the inner lives of 
other people--precisely what autistic children cannot do. See Simon Baron-Cohen, 
<i>Mindblindness: An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind </i>(Cambridge, MA: MIT 
Press, 1996).

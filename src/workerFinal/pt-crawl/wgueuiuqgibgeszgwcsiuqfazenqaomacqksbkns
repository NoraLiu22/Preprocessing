      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A great deal of thought 
        must go into a reptile's captive environment. The type of environment 
        it needs will be based on how big the animal gets, how the animal lives 
        in the wild, how it gets water, and its macro- and microclimate requirements. 
        In other words, the captive habitat must contain the key elements of the 
        reptile's habitat in the wild. Deciding what habitat to set up for a captive 
        reptile depends upon:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">where in that wild 
          habitat the reptile lives;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> when it is active; 
          and</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> what its habits 
          are.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Commercial and Custom 
        Enclosures and Materials<br>
        </b>To construct a habitat in captivity, we must consider the size and 
        shape of the enclosure as well as the materials from which the enclosure 
        will be constructed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">There are many different 
        aquarium-type enclosures available commercially. The key thing to remember 
        is that they are aquariums. Most do not have tops that have been made 
        specifically for them. Some have been superficially adapted for the reptile 
        trade by the inclusion of a part fixed screen, part hinged glass top. 
        Some pet supply companies are making flat screens that can be placed on 
        top of standard aquariums. The problem with these enclosures is that they 
        are still based on a design that works well for fish, not for the varied 
        needs of reptiles. These enclosures generally do not have the height that 
        is required for arboreal reptiles. Their glass tops prohibit the proper 
        use of ultraviolet B-producing fluorescents (as UVB is filtered out by 
        glass and plastic). There is no safe way to mount heating equipment to 
        them or install shelving inside them. Many factory-fitted and after-market 
        tops fit so poorly or loosely that they are worthless in preventing a 
        determined snake from escaping.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">There are companies 
        making wooden, melamine/pressboard, and molded plastic enclosures. Too 
        often, however, these are modeled on the glass aquariums and so suffer 
        from the same drawbacks of those enclosures. Many are built in a simple 
        cube shape. Taller than the glass aquaria, they are usually not tall enough, 
        and are rarely wide enough for the full grown lizard or snake for which 
        they are being sold. Their large front-opening door makes it almost impossible 
        to prevent a motivated lizard from escaping when you open the door. Melamine 
        presents a problem in that, while the insides and outside of the enclosures 
        look good, and they clean and disinfect well, the sides of the openings 
        and doors are not finished on many of them. The exposed pressboard soaks 
        up liquids (spilled water, urates, cleaning and disinfecting solutions), 
        warping over time, often leaving escape-sized gaps or weakening the overall 
        structure so that the enclosure inhabitant can push its way out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Wire cages fabricated 
        for mammals or birds are sometimes used. Unfortunately, these are impossible 
        to heat and maintain the thermal gradients required by most reptiles without 
        heating the room in which the cage sits. The wire poses a danger to reptiles 
        as they can severely injure their snouts, toes, and tails by repeatedly 
        rubbing, climbing, trying to claw out or squeeze through the openings, 
        or when startled into a flight response.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hobbyists and herpetoculturists 
        are a creative group of people when it comes to modifying existing structures 
        into reptile habitats. Old armoires, prefabricated shower stalls, jewelry 
        or deli display cases, discarded television sets, and sturdy wooden book 
        cases have been converted into reptile enclosures.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A common failing with 
        many of these custom conversions, however, is the same as when you buy 
        an enclosure that appears large enough, or large enough &quot;for now&quot;: 
        the reptiles too often rapidly outgrow them. Because of the work and expense 
        that goes into converting a piece of furniture or buying a commercially 
        produced enclosure, most reptile owners are unwilling to repeat their 
        efforts one or two years down the line when the reptile has outgrown it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many people want to 
        set up naturalistic enclosures, with interesting layered substrates, plants, 
        branches, molded back and side walls, &quot;ponds,&quot; etc. The problem 
        with most is that, in trying to make it as attractive and 'natural' as 
        possible, there is too often insufficient room for the intended inhabitant 
        to properly move around, thermoregulate, access the necessary microclimates, 
        or feed. At least 30-40% of the floor space should be left open for the 
        reptile to easily move about, feed, water and defecate. There is no substitute 
        for an appropriately sized enclosure, nor for not expanding or providing 
        larger enclosures as required by the reptile's continued growth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Determining Enclosure 
        Size: Some rules of thumb</b><br>
        Many reptiles do well in spaces smaller than what would be suitable for 
        similarly sized mammals. However, space is very important for reptiles. 
        The space must be large enough to permit a proper temperature gradient 
        to be set up and maintained. Enough room must also be provided for the 
        animal to move around, thermoregulate, feed, drink, bask, and sleep.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The following dimensions 
        pertain to a single reptile being kept in a simply furnished enclosure. 
        The dimensions must be increased by one-half for each additional animal 
        housed together, with even more room provided for territorial species. 
        Additional room also needs to be provided if a naturalistic habitat is 
        being set up for the reptile(s), including leaving 30-40% of the floor 
        space free for movement, feeding, and defecating.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When calculating a lizard's 
        size for the purposes of determining enclosure size, you must include 
        the tail in the total size. The tail is just as important in the thermoregulation 
        and manufacturing of the precursors to vitamin D3 as the rest of the body. 
        You may think the following dimensions are excessively large, so I will 
        take this moment to note some herpetocultural and zoo sources specify 
        sizes dimensions even larger than those shown below.</font></p>

        can be deceptive about their requirements. Some small, active snakes such 
        as racers need more room, relative to body length, than do large, and 
        largely lazy, pythons and boas. Terrestrial, arboreal, and scansorial 
        snakes do not need to be able to stretch out full length in their enclosure. 
        They should be able to stretch out enough, however, to allow most of their 
        lung or lungs to extend full length. Semi-aquatic snakes require larger 
        enclosures to provide a water area large enough for them to comfortably

        a humidity retreat box, and a place to feed. Many of the enclosures at 
        pet stores and breeders, and pictured in many snake books, have barely 
        a few inches of exposed floor space, the rest of the enclosure being filled

          and semi-aquatic turtles need both a land and water area. The water 
          area must be large enough for them to swim freely through the water 
          to catch their food. Those species whose natural habits include burrowing 
          into the silt or sand at the bottom of their native lakes or rivers 
          must have similar substrate layers in the bottom of their enclosure. 
          This is in addition to the necessary depth and breadth of the water 
          and the additional space above the water line to preclude escape. For 
          some species of aquatic turtles, a haul-out place big enough for the

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Use a

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks to variations 
        of the The Tortoise and the Hare fable, most people think of tortoises 
        as slow-moving animals who do little with their time. As tortoise owners 
        will tell you, however, a healthy tortoise housed in a proper environment 
        is both active and quick. Box turtles are similarly wide-ranging and, 
        well, speedy. Many tortoises and box turtles range widely throughout their 
        habitat, with several sleeping and basking areas used every day. Most 
        are burrowers and talented diggers, easily digging under outdoor pen walls 
        and fences. They are also good climbers, especially tortoises. Escapes 
        can be prevented when they are housed indoors by building the enclosure 
        walls higher than they can stretch when they climb on the back of another 
        inhabitant or on top of a rock, log, or hide box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Tortoise and box turtle 
        enclosures need pans of shallow water that the chelonian can easily walk 
        into and drink from. Unlike the U.S. species of box turtles (Terrapene) 
        those from China and Indonesia (Cuora) are more aquatic in their habits, 
        and must have deeper, yet easily accessible, water in which to soak and 
        feed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Housing Different 
        Species Together<br>
        </b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many problems associated 
        with keeping members of different species, even orders, together. The 
        primary problem is that the individual animals may have commensal or other 
        organisms in or on their bodies with whom they have co-evolved. Having 
        co-evolved together, the host animal has some natural immunity to the 
        possible deleterious effects of the organisms. Exposing another reptile 
        to these organisms, however, could be fatal to that reptile. This is especially 
        true with animals from one continent being mixed with animals from another 
        continent. Too often, people try to mix species together who have completely 
        different habitat requirements. This will cause severe stress in the animal 
        whose needs are not being met and may ultimately be fatal to it. Problems 
        are also caused when housing predators with prey, even if that particular 
        predator may not prey on that species of prey. An example is housing a 
        bearded dragon and sand boa together. Not only are they from different 
        continents (potential for transmission of deadly organisms) but even though 
        the sand boa may not think of eating a large bearded dragon, the bearded 
        dragon, who is preyed upon by snakes in its native habitat, will always 
        be fearful, if not outright terrified, by the constant presence of the 
        boa.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Basing your decision 
        on what animals can be kept together cannot be made by looking at what 
        is being done in most pet stores. Most stores tend to house different 
        species or taxa together without regard for zoonotic transmission or habitat 
        requirements. Thus it is not uncommon to see iguanas housed with tortoises, 
        terrestrial turtles with aquatics, and temperate frogs with tropical lizards. 
        You must complete your own research, using encyclopedias, atlases, and 
        availing your self of information resources through the local herpetological 
        society, herpetoculture publications, and Internet resources.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lifestyles of the 
        Wild and Scaly</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Habitats<br>
        </i> </b> The habitat is where the reptile generally lives within its 
        ecosystem. Deserts, woodlands, temperate grasslands, savannahs, and tropical 
        forests are the ecosystems from which most of the reptiles in the pet 
        trade come. Habitats are a complex mix of temperatures, humidity levels, 
        photoperiods, elevations, organic lifeforms, inorganic matter, and space.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Aquatic</i>:<br>
        Aquatic reptiles need large bodies of water in which to swim, feed, and 
        thermoregulate. Some do haul out on land or rocks to sun themselves. The 
        enclosure needs to be strong enough and waterproofed to hold the water, 
        and provisions made for regular cleaning and disinfecting of the tank 
        as well as the filtration systems needed to keep the enclosures clean 
        on a daily basis. Care must be taken when supplying overhead heat sources 
        that the reptiles in the enclosure cannot get to them and topple them 
        into the tank. If submersible heaters are used to heat the water, they 
        must be shielded so that the animal cannot come into direct contact with 
        them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Arboreal</i>:<br>
        Many species of lizards and snakes spend most or all of their time in 
        trees, including anoles, water dragons, iguanas, various agamas and geckos, 
        boas and pythons. Arboreal enclosures therefore need to be tall as well 
        as have the necessary width. They must be outfitted with sturdy branches 
        or, for the large lizards and snakes, shelves for basking and roosting. 
        All fixtures in these enclosures must be securely fastened. The lighting 
        and heating elements must be shielded as these reptiles will easily climb 
        on and into them. If live plants are used in these enclosures, they must 
        be sturdy enough to withstand the clawing and crushing they will get, 
        or be easily removed and replaced with other plants when they get too 
        damaged for continued use. Live plants will also require that a partial 
        or complete drainage layer be used to catch the run-off when the plants 
        are watered. They must, obviously, also be non-toxic and harmless.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Fossorial</i>:<br>
        Many snakes and lizards, and some chelonians, are burrows, spending some 
        or all of their time covered by a few inches or more of substrate. Some, 
        like sand boas, are rarely seen above ground; others, like some skinks, 
        burrow away to sleep and digest. Enclosures for fossorial reptiles need 
        to be strong enough to safely hold several inches of burrowable substrate 
        over a drainage layer. They must also be tall enough to make it difficult 
        if not impossible for the inhabitant to climb up-and out-of the enclosure. 
        The same width and depth furnished to terrestrial reptiles must also be 
        provided.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Scansorial/Saxicolous</i>:<br>
        Many lizards live in rocky crevices, basking and hunting for food on rocky 
        walls and outcroppings. Rocks, cleaned and disinfected, can be arranged 
        and cemented together with a non-toxic silicone cement to provide walls 
        and outcroppings for such lizards. Caves and crevices can be built into 
        these structures to provide some natural hiding and sleeping places. Walls 
        need to be anchored to the back of the tank to prevent their toppling 
        over and crushing the enclosure inhabitants. Outcroppings should be well 
        balanced and partially buried in the substrate to ensure they are not 
        toppled or shifted around during use. Scansorial enclosures need sufficient 
        height and depth to be able to fit in the walls and outcroppings yet still 
        keep the reptiles safely distant from overhead heat and light sources. 
        They also need the width necessary for ample thermoregulation and food 
        gathering.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Semi-Aquatic/Riparian:</i><br>
        Some reptiles spend considerable amounts of time in the water swimming, 
        feeding, and sleeping, as well as basking on dry land. These enclosures 
        must provide ample room for the aquatic area setup as well as a terrestrial 
        portion; both must be large enough for the inhabitants to use them for 
        their intended purpose. As with aquatic enclosures, heating and lighting 
        must be securely mounted to ensure that they cannot be accidentally toppled 
        into the water.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Terrestrial</i>:<br>
        Terrestrial reptiles still make use of various irregularities in their 
        environment, irregularities often being different microclimates. Terrestrial 
        enclosures, then, must provide such irregularities. All type of terrestrial 
        reptiles will make use of such features as hide boxes or caves, areas 
        of higher humidity, and rocks, branches or shelves for climbing and sunning. 
        Ample width and depth of enclosure are required to ensure enough room 
        for the furnishings and adequate thermoregulation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Naturalistic Habitats</i></b><br>
        In creating habitats, you must begin to think of the interior space in 
        three dimensions. You will need to consider not only the reptile's living 
        spaces within the habitat but also your ability to easily get in to service 
        and clean the environment. A natural habitat setup in captivity unfortunately 
        does not include all the microorganisms found in the wild that would be 
        busily engaged in breaking down plant and animal wastes. The more difficult 
        or complicated an enclosure is to get into and service, the less likely 
        it is going to be done as often as needed. If you cannot devote the time 
        necessary to establish and maintain a complex environment, then consider 
        making one that is a bit less complex. Less complex does not mean uninteresting. 
        It can still be interesting and educational for you and the class, suitable 
        and interesting for the reptile, and not require major disassembly and 
        a full day to get in and clean!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Look at photographs 
        of your reptile's native habitat, or go out looking on your own. Visualize 
        each section of the scene by looking at it from the top down - down into 
        the ground. Note the uneven surface of the ground itself,, the different 
        heights of the plants growing there, the fallen branches, leaves, the 
        scattering of rocks or stones. If you are out in the wild, take a small 
        spade or stick and dig into the ground a bit. Look at and feel the earth 
        beneath the surface, the different textures, humidity, and temperatures. 
        The features on top of the ground constitute the topography of the habitat; 
        those at and under the surface are the substrata.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Creating a habitat means 
        recreating the key aspects of the topography and substrata. We begin constructing 
        the habitat from the substrata up, starting with the different substrates, 
        then building, layer by layer, the surface topography.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If you are using a glass 
        enclosure, make sure it is sturdy enough to hold the weight of the contents. 
        If you can find the older, metal-framed aquariums, they are stronger than 
        the all-glass ones. Keep in mind that the enclosure, especially a large 
        one, is going to be very heavy when you are done. It is best to set the 
        enclosure in its place first, then begin constructing the interior. When 
        buying or building enclosures, remember that the bottom several inches 
        of the interior will be given over to substrata and ground cover so always 
        buy or build taller enclosures than you might otherwise think you need.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Make a couple of sketches 
        of the interior, both as it will be seen from the front and from the top. 
        Begin to decide where you will make the high and low spots and place the 
        plants and other furnishings, keeping in mind the reptile's habits and 
        preferences for daytime basking, sleeping, feeding, and water use. Once 
        you have these figured out, you then will know where you need to place 
        the lights and heat sources. If you are limited by access to electrical 
        outlets as to where the lights and heat can be, then you will have to 
        design the interior based on where those lights must be placed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Artificial Habitats</b></i><br>
        Artificial habitats differ from naturalistic habitats in that they are 
        set up more simply. The needs of the reptiles for thermoregulation, lighting, 
        humidity, security, etc., are still being met, but in an environment that 
        does not particularly resemble the diversity of materials, elevations, 
        etc., of their native habitat. Artificial habitats should always be used 
        when animals are in quarantine prior to being introduced into their permanent 
        individual or community enclosures.</font></p>

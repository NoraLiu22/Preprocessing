At present, <strong>75% of the European building stock is energy inefficient</strong>.</p><p>All these aspects have a disproportionate impact on <strong>vulnerable segments of the population</strong> and can exacerbate social challenges like segregation, poverty and inequality.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, however, cities are hubs of creativity, innovation and education, and have the capacity to <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/urban-adaptation-in-europe-what-works" rel="noopener">affect significant systemic changes across a range of critical environmental issues.</a> Cities have their own governments and are often best placed for local action to <strong>tackle and resolve environmental challenges</strong>. Historically, municipalities have played a crucial role in improving waste, <strong>wastewater and water management, public transport and land use</strong> via integrated urban planning approaches. Today, they have an increasingly central role in tackling climate change mitigation and adaptation, ecosystem preservation and restoration and circular economy. In addition, the presence of accessible, high-quality green spaces in cities supports physical and mental health and social well-being.</p><p></p><p>Still, more must be done to create truly sustainable European cities.

On the one hand, urban sprawl encroaches on natural habitats and generates large amounts of pollution. On the other hand, resource use is typically more efficient and large-scale infrastructure projects can result in a lower environmental impact per person.</p><p>As such, the importance of effective urban planning is hard to overstate. Every decision about how we use the land in urban spaces can either improve peoples’ lives and reduce our impact on the environment or have precisely the opposite effect. The <a href="https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/urban-atlas" rel="noopener">Urban Atlas</a> suite of products gives users access to detailed land cover/land use maps for 788 Functional Urban Areas across Europe, as well as additional street tree maps, building block height measurements, and population estimates. These products provide information necessary for urban planners to make informed, data-driven decisions about things like green spaces, transportation networks, and emergency response plans.</p><div class="styled-callToActionBlock primary left has--align--left has--theme--primary align styled"><div class="block call-to-action align left"><a class="ui button primary" title="">Find out more about the Urban Atlas</a></div></div><p>  </p></div><div class="six wide computer twelve wide mobile six wide tablet column column-blocks-wrapper"><p></p></div></div></div><div class="eea hero-block inverted"><div class="hero-block-image-wrapper full-width"><div class="hero-block-image"></div><div class="hero-block-image-overlay dark-overlay-4"></div></div><div class="hero-block-inner-wrapper d-flex flex-items-center"><div class="hero-block-body"><div class="hero-block-text color-fg-white text-left"><h2 id="which-european-city-has-the-cleanest-air-what-about-your-city--" data-block="aa733d54-be49-4e01-8912-353dd0a77293"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="/en/topics/in-depth/urban-sustainability#which-european-city-has-the-cleanest-air-what-about-your-city--"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="2em" viewBox="0 0 36 36"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M27.1318,7.333 C24.4028,4.604 19.9618,4.604 17.2328,7.333 L12.9898,11.576 C11.8428,12.723 11.1288,14.248 10.9778,15.871 C10.8228,17.541 11.2708,19.211 12.2378,20.576 C12.4818,20.919 12.7278,21.213 12.9888,21.475 C13.7848,22.271 14.7778,22.868 15.8608,23.202 C16.5498,23.415 17.2548,23.519 17.9518,23.518 C19.7808,23.518 21.5598,22.804 22.8888,21.475 L23.9498,20.414 L22.5358,19 L21.4748,20.061 C20.1648,21.371 18.2388,21.842 16.4498,21.291 C15.6668,21.049 14.9778,20.635 14.4038,20.061 C14.2218,19.879 14.0478,19.668 13.8698,19.418 C13.1778,18.443 12.8588,17.249 12.9688,16.056 C13.0768,14.896 13.5868,13.808 14.4038,12.99 L18.6468,8.747 C20.5958,6.798 23.7688,6.798 25.7178,8.747 C26.6568,9.687 27.1748,10.942 27.1748,12.283 C27.1748,13.623 26.6568,14.878 25.7178,15.818 L27.1318,17.232 C28.4488,15.915 29.1748,14.157 29.1748,12.283 C29.1748,10.408 28.4488,8.65 27.1318,7.333"/><path d="M25.0107,16.5254 C24.2147,15.7294 23.2217,15.1324 22.1387,14.7984 C19.6417,14.0284 16.9477,14.6894 15.1107,16.5254 L14.0507,17.5864 L15.4647,19.0004 L16.5247,17.9394 C17.8357,16.6294 19.7587,16.1554 21.5497,16.7094 C22.3337,16.9514 23.0217,17.3644 23.5957,17.9394 C23.7777,18.1214 23.9527,18.3314 24.1307,18.5824 C24.8217,19.5564 25.1417,20.7514 25.0317,21.9444 C24.9237,23.1034 24.4137,24.1924 23.5957,25.0104 L19.3537,29.2534 C17.4047,31.2024 14.2317,31.2024 12.2817,29.2534 C11.3427,28.3134 10.8247,27.0574 10.8247,25.7174 C10.8247,24.3774 11.3427,23.1214 12.2817,22.1824 L10.8677,20.7684 C9.5507,22.0854 8.8247,23.8424 8.8247,25.7174 C8.8247,27.5924 9.5507,29.3504 10.8677,30.6674 C12.2327,32.0314 14.0257,32.7134 15.8177,32.7134 C17.6107,32.7134 19.4027,32.0314 20.7677,30.6674 L25.0107,26.4244 C26.1567,25.2774 26.8717,23.7524 27.0227,22.1294 C27.1777,20.4594 26.7297,18.7894 25.7617,17.4244 C25.5177,17.0814 25.2717,16.7874 25.0107,16.5254"/></g></svg></a>Which European city has the cleanest air?

text: Infographic representing the EEA’s conceptual model with six observation and analysis lenses to assess the role of cities in transitioning to urban sustainability. Long description: The infographic represents the EEA’s conceptual model with six observation and analysis lenses to assess the role of cities in urban transitions towards environmental sustainability. The infographic is primarily circular, with three main concentric layers. The outermost layer is labelled “context”, the second layer has six text items, each representing one of the six lenses. These are Governance, Knowledge, Finance, Data and Information, Technology, and finally Culture. The inner-most layer is much larger than the other two and is filled with 19 orange circles meant to represent “building blocks”, each with text inside them. In the center of the circle is a piece of text that reads, \"The (sustainable) City”. There are six arrows arranged radially around this text, each pointing at it, with the purpose of implying that the 19 orange circles all contribute to a sustainable city. Around the outside of the circular diagram are six cones pointed towards the center of the circle, which invoke an eye in profile, meant to visually represent the six lenses. They are labelled as follows: Healthy city lens, Circular city lens, low carbon city lens, green city lens, resilient city lens, and inclusive city lens.  The text inside the 19 orange building blocks are as follows: 1. collaborative and community-led initiatives; 2. participation and empowerment; 3. efficient material use and zero waste; 4. environmental quality; 5. social and environmental justice; 6. energy efficiency; 7. adaptive capacity; 8. resource efficiency; 9. low energy consumption; 10. public open space; 11. integrated planning; 12. renewable energy; 13. sustainable urban agriculture; 14. ecological multi-functionality; 15. green and blue infrastructure; 16. sustainability mobility; 17. housing planning; 18. built environmental quality; 19. green economy.

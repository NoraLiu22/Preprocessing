The <a href="http://www.humbox.ac.uk/">HumBox</a>, an online space for the sharing of teaching and learning resources in the humanities was launched for free access by the world wide community, at the end of February.
</p>

<p align="left">
The site uses the best principles of social networking sites to enable teachers in the humanities to showcase their teaching resources by publishing them on the web and sharing them with other practitioners. The HumBox currently has more than 1000 resources that have been contributed by 15 different Higher Education (HE) institutions in the UK, and has a growing user-community who review and comment on content; remix, edit and re-share resources, and use the site as a way to demonstrate their excellence in teaching and learning both through the resources they upload and the personal profile page they can create within the HumBox.
</p>

<p align="left">
The HumBox is a dynamic site that lets users see who is reviewing and downloading their resources; lets them bookmark 'favourites', and make collections of themed or related materials. Each resource and collection has a unique URL to which students and other users can be directed. The HumBox also offers advice on key issues related to the publication of open content on the site, including advice on intellectual property rights (IPR) and copyright; on reviewing open educational resources; on tagging, and advice on good practice in attribution.
</p>

<p align="left">
The HumBox is being developed as part of the HumBox project, funded under the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/oer.aspx">JISC/HEA UK Open Educational Content initiative</a>. The HumBox Project is a collaboration between four Higher Education Academy Subject Centres (English; History; Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies; and Philosophical and Religious Studies) along with eleven project partners in Humanities departments around the UK.

<p align="left">
CACAO (Cross-language Access to Catalogues And On-line libraries) is a European Union (EU) project, funded under the eContentplus program, that proposes an innovative approach for accessing, understanding and navigating multilingual textual contents in digital libraries and OPACs. CACAO offers a solution for cross-lingual and cross-border access to the contents of classical and digital libraries, enabling European users to find digital content irrespectively of their language. 
</p>

<p align="left">
By coupling NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques with available information retrieval systems the project aims at the delivery of a non-intrusive infrastructure to be integrated with current OPAC and digital libraries, crossing the chasm between sound innovation and adoption by library institutions for real life purposes. The result of such integration allows the user to express queries in his/her own language and retrieve volumes and documents in any of the available languages. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The proposed solution is based on the assumptions that users increasingly look at library contents using free keyword queries rather than more traditional library-oriented access (e.g., via Subject Heading). Thus, the adopted approach consists of translating the query into all the languages covered by the library/collection. Query translation is performed by means of bilingual dictionaries and features multi-word and named entities recognition, as well as state of the art techniques for query expansion and  translations disambiguation. 
</p>

<p align="left">
CACAO adopts a linguistic agnostic approach: a set of core  modules contain the logic of the system and focus on the management of the information harvested from libraries  (via the OAI-PMH protocol) while the resources needed for supporting specific languages, as  dictionaries, named entity recognizers, thesauri or lemmatizers, are included via external Web Services, thus allowing for an easy integration of new languages. CACAO infrastructure consists of a suite of web services exposing the system functionalities and includes a set of administration pages for configuring the different modules, monitoring exposed services and triggering off-line activities;  graphical user interfaces are built on the top of these services and feature faceted navigation. A prototype of the system can be viewed online at the official project website: &lt;<a href="http://www.cacaoproject.eu">http://www.cacaoproject.eu</a>&gt;. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The CACAO project ended in December 2009, but the the expertize capitalized during the project is going to be reinvested into Cross-Library Services (<a href="http://www.cross-library.com">http://www.cross-library.com</a>), a start-up company located in the region of Trento, Italy.

<p class="orange"><a name="MAHONY" class="plain">Digital Classicist Summer Seminar Series 2010</a></p>

<p>

</p>

<p align="left">
This Summer the Digital Classicist will once more be running a series of <a href="http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip">seminars</a> at the Institute of Classical Studies, University of London, with additional support from the British Library. The focus will be on the subject of research into the ancient world that has an innovative digital component. We are especially interested in work that demonstrates interdisciplinarity or work on the intersections between Ancient History, Classics or Archaeology and a digital, technical or practice-based discipline. 
</p>

<p align="left">
For those not familiar with what we do, the Digital Classicist, set up in 2004, is a network, a community of users that share a common interest. We have a <a href="http://www.digitalclassicist.org">website</a>, a <a href="http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org">wiki</a> and have joined our blog with the <a href="http://www.stoa.org/">Stoa Consortium</a>. As well as sharing information about ourselves and our own work, members collaboratively compile, review and comment upon articles on digital projects, tools, and research questions of particular relevance to the ancient world. They also list guides to practice, introduce the <a href="http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Discussion">discussion forum</a>  and, most importantly, list events. It is these events that more than anything else define the Digital Classicist community by providing a showcase for our members' research and a venue for discussion, introductions and inspiration for new collaborative relationships and projects.
</p>

<p align="left">
Classicists belong to one of the most interdisciplinary and diverse disciplines in the academy.  Classics departments are already filled with experts on literature, history, archaeology, ethnography, mythology, religion, philosophy, palaeography, linguistics, art, heritage and reception. These are scholars who are not only aware of the importance of applying the expertise of multiple disciplines to the complex problem of studying an ancient culture, but also of the importance of collaboration with academics from different backgrounds and with different skills.
</p>

<p align="left">
The most striking and successful aspect of Digital Classics is its sense of community and collaboration. Digital Classicists do not work in isolation; they develop projects in tandem with colleagues in other humanities disciplines or with experts in technical fields: engineers, computer scientists and civil engineers. They collect data, conduct research, develop tools and resources, and importantly make them available electronically, often under free and open licenses, for reference and for re-use by scholars, students and non-specialists alike. 
</p>

<p align="left">
In previous years collected papers from these seminars (and also our conference panels) have been published in a special issue of an online <a href="http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/4/">journal (2006)</a>, edited as a <a href="http://www.gowerpublishing.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calctitle=1&amp;pageSubject=1064&amp;sort=pubdate&amp;forthcoming=1&amp;title_id=9797&amp;edition_id=12252">printed volume (2007)</a>, and released as <a href="http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/index.html">audio podcasts (2008-9)</a>.
</p>

<p align="left">
The forthcoming Digital Classicist seminar series will be run on Friday afternoons 16:30 to 18:00 from June to mid-August. The programme will be circulated via various mailing lists and published on our <a href="http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/">website</a> where you can also find details of the previous series together with an RSS feed.

<p class="orange"><a name="HENSHAW" class="plain">The Wellcome Arabic Manuscript Cataloguing Partnership</a></p>

<p>
<i>Contributed by:<br />
Christy Henshaw<br />
Digitisation Project Manager<br />
Wellcome Library<br />
London, United Kingdom <br />
&lt;c.henshaw&#064;wellcome.ac.uk&gt;</i>
</p>

<p align="left">
The Wellcome Library, <a href="http://www.bibalex.org/English/index.aspx">Bibliotheca Alexandrina</a>, and <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London</a>, have formed a partnership to create a free searchable and scalable online catalogue of 500 chiefly medical manuscript books written in Arabic and preserved in the <a href="http://library.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Library</a>. Another aim of this joint project is to create a freely available cataloguing tool, which will facilitate remote cataloguing and access to the associated digitized images as well as exchange of metadata. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The project is partly funded by the Wellcome Trust  and partly by a grant from the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/digitisation/islamdigi.aspx">JISC's Islamic Studies Programme</a>. The project is expected to be completed by February 2011. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The cataloguing tool is based on the methodology designed by N. Serikoff to catalogue the <a href="http://library.wellcome.ac.uk/node273.html">Haddad</a> collection of Arabic manuscripts preserved in the Wellcome Library.  It has been made a provision for the cataloguing tool in the future to be adaptable to create image-linked descriptions of the manuscript books written in other Asian languages. The data will be stored in the ENRICH TEI metadata schema. The key requirements for the technical development are as follows: 
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Data repository</b> - ingest and storage of metadata, use of the TEI P5 / ENRICH schema, UNICODE, and data export to other standards. 
</p>


<ul type="disc">
	<li>creation of TEI P5 / ENRICH based XML schema </li>
	<li>creation of a conversion programme from TEI P4 MASTER and ArabTeX to the new schema </li>
	<li>store text as UNICODE </li>
	<li>identify non-UNICODE characters specific to medieval Arabic manuscripts and manage their input and display </li>
	<li>investigate problems/issues related to the storage, input and display of bi-directional UNICODE text </li>
	<li>create export facilities to the Wellcome Library's cataloguing system (MARC21). </li>
</ul>


<p align="left">
<b>Input system</b> - this will be the web-based user interface for administration, data input and QA. 
</p>


<ul type="disc">
	<li>design and build a web-based interface with template for data entry</li>
	<li>develop a workflow for data input </li>
	<li>create a facility to input Arabic characters (including non-standard characters) via a virtual keyboard and/or a transliteration scheme. </li>
</ul>


<p align="left">
<b>Delivery</b> - the cataloguing data, which reflect all the aspects of a medieval hand-written book as a physical and historic object and as an intellectual repository will be combined with high quality cover-to-cover images of each manuscript. These freely available digital objects can be embedded in teaching materials, presentations and publications, images can be reused and repurposed under the Creative Commons Licence. This will enable users anywhere in the world to copy, distribute, display, and make derivative works for non-commercial use based on these images.
</p>

<p align="left">
The website will be developed and hosted by the Bibliotheca Alexandria, while the Wellcome Library provides the cataloguing expertise and methodology, the digital images, and overall project management. King's College London (Centre for Computing in the Humanities) will manage the technical requirements specifications for the cataloguing tool, and create the TEI metadata template and mappings.

<p>

</p>

<p align="left">
The University of Sydney Library recently announced the launch of the Frontiers of Science <a href="http://frontiers.library.usyd.edu.au/">website</a>. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Forty-nine years earlier, in 1961, a brand new kind of comic was launched in the pages of the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>. More science fact than science fiction, and presented in dramatic black and white imagery, <i>Frontiers of Science</i> was a true life adventure of the story behind the amazing scientific breakthroughs of the day. Between 1961 and 1982 the syndicated comic strip appeared daily in over 600 newspapers worldwide.
</p>

<p align="left">
<i>Frontiers</i> was significant in communicating and popularising science in a way that ensured the widest contemporary audience of the day was informed about, and understood, scientific concepts, theories, processes, discoveries and developments. It used one of the popular media of the day &#151; newspaper comic strips.
</p>

<p align="left">
Not only informative it was also quirky in its appeal to science and the public imagination &#151; be it the space race, asteroids or medicine. It was published in a period where the popular perception was of science and technology providing solutions to the challenges of the mid-twentieth century.
</p>

<p align="left">
The digitisation of these strips was, then, both an opportunity to re-discover and celebrate these forgotten works, and a case study in science communication.
</p>

<p align="left">
<i>Frontiers</i> was co-written and produced by Professor Stuart Butler from the School of Physics at Sydney and journalist and film-maker Bob Raymond. The early art work in the series was by Andrea Bresciani, continued later by David Emersen. 
</p>

<p align="left">
In total 939 weekly episodes or "pulls" were created, each around a particular topic. Each pull had five strips, one for each weekday. The strips were initially published in the Sydney and within a few years the series was syndicated internationally &#150; to the <i>LA Times</i> for syndication throughout the USA and Canada, and to Editors Press in New York for syndication and translation for Europe, South America and Asia. The Press Feature Service handled syndication in the UK. Writing and artwork continued to be managed by Stuart Butler and Bob Raymond in Sydney.
</p>

<p align="left">
Publisher pulls and some of the original art work is located and archived in the Rare Books and Special Collections Library in Fisher Library at the University of Sydney. Digitisation and web site developed in association with Sydney eScholarship at the University Library. Digitisation was funded by the Science Foundation for Physics at the University of Sydney
</p>

<p align="left">
Details about the technologies enabling the project can be found on the website, and includes image and metadata storage in DSpace and rendering through XTF (eXtensible Text Framework) for browsing and searching.

<p class="orange">PLoS Launches Fast PDF Access with Pubget</p>


<p>March 2, 2010 &#151; &quot;Today, PLoS released Pubget links across its journal sites. Now, when users are browsing thousands of reference citations on PLoS journals they will be able to get to the full text article faster than ever before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Specifically, when readers encounter citations to articles as recorded by CrossRef (which are accessed via the 'CrossRef' link in the 'Cited in' section of any article's Metrics tab), a PDF icon will also appear if it is freely available via Pubget. Clicking on the icon will take you directly to the PDF....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...In this first phase, PLoS is linking to the free PDFs on Pubget. For those citations without a freely available PDF you have two options. The CrossRef link will take you to the publisher's site, where you can see if you have access. Or, if you work for any of the 200+ institutions in Pubget's network (for example MIT, and UCSF), you can use the citation to get the subscription PDFs right away on Pubget.com. If you want to add your institution to the Pubget network, just tell your library &#151; Pubget is free.&quot;</p>

<p>February 24, 2010 &#151; &quot;<a href="http://www.openaire.eu/">OpenAIRE</a> (Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe), a three-year project funded under the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission, has now taken up its work to implement Open Access on a pan-European scale. This ambitious effort unites 38 partners from 27 European countries. <a href="http://www.uu.nl/">Utrecht University</a> is the liaison for the Netherlands. <a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/">SURFfoundation</a> will be heading the helpdesk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The main goal of OpenAIRE is to support the Open Access pilot, launched by the European Commission in August 2008. This Open Access pilot, which covers about 20% of the FP7 budget, commits researchers from 7 thematic areas (Health, Energy, Environment, Information &amp; Communication Technology, Research Infrastructures, Socio-economic sciences &amp; Humanities and Science in Society) to deposit their research publications in an institutional or disciplinary Open Access repository, to be made available worldwide in full text. OpenAIRE will establish underlying structures for researchers to support them in complying with the pilot through European Helpdesk System, build an OpenAIRE portal and e-Infrastructure for the repository networks and explore scientific data management services together with 5 disciplinary communities.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Successful reuse of research data requires integrated approach</p>


<p>January 28, 2010 &#151; &quot;On 23-24 September 2009 an international discussion workshop was held in Berlin, prepared and organised by Knowledge Exchange. The main focus of the workshop was on the benefits, challenges and obstacles of re-using data from a researcher's perspective. The most important message from the wide variety of presentations was that successful reuse not only requires efforts directed at the technical issues, but also at providing
incentives for researchers, both to share and re-use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These incentives can be provided by funding opportunities, but also by
incorporating data sharing and re-use in the research assessment. The
issue of data re-use would be a lot more relevant to researchers if
publishers, for example, asked authors for data to underpin their
publications. Alternatively researchers' data being cited in a journal
should be rewarded. Technical aspects should also be addressed, e.g. by
supporting data storage and sharing facilities. This requires not only
specialised staff but also agreed standards (metadata, ontologies) which
will allow different datasets to be evaluated, compared and combined.
Researchers will need to be trained, but awareness will also need to be
created at a higher level. Bottom-up and top-down approaches need to
work in unison.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the workshop the use cases presented by researchers from a variety of
disciplines were supplemented by two keynotes and selected presentations
by specialists from infrastructure institutions, publishers, and
national and European funding bodies. Thanks to this broad approach it
became clear that certain challenges and obstacles are comparable across
disciplines and organisations. As a general recommendation the
participants agreed that it is time to cooperate in more ambitious
international activities to establish reliable and sustainable support
for initiatives in the field of data related research infrastructure...&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Elsevier's Scopus Partners with CWTS and SCImago to Offer Multidimensional Evaluation of Research Journals</p>

<p align="left">
<b><i>Metrics to be Powered by Scopus and Freely Available Online</i></b>
</p>

<p>January 26, 2010 &#151; &quot;TextElsevier, a world-leading publisher of scientific, technical and medical information products and services, today announced that its flagship product Scopus has successfully partnered with the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) and the SCImago Research Group, endorsing two complementary journal metrics, SNIP and SJR. The metrics will be freely available online at <a href="http://www.journalmetrics.com/">www.journalmetrics.com</a>, and integrated into Scopus, allowing researchers around the world to analyze journals within the abstract and citation database. The indicators will offer a greater currency and flexibility in journal performance measurement than any single-metric method currently available.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;SNIP, which stands for Source Normalized Impact per Paper, measures a journal's contextual citation impact and was developed by CWTS. It allows direct comparison of journals in different subject fields, by accounting for the frequency at which authors cite other papers, the speed of maturation of citation impact, and the extent to which the database covers the field's literature.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;SJR stands for SCImago Journal Rank, and was developed by the SCImago Research Group. It is a measure of the scientific prestige of scholarly sources: value of weighted citations per document. A journal transfers its own 'prestige', or status, to another through the act of citing it. In effect, this means that a citation from a source with a relatively high SJR is worth more than a citation from a source with a lower SJR....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The journal metrics will be updated twice annually and made available to Scopus subscribers at <a href="http://info.scopus.com">http://www.scopus.com</a> and to non-Scopus users at <a href="http://www.journalmetrics.com/">www.journalmetrics.com</a> free of charge.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Call for New Nominations for Memory of the World International Register</p>

<p>January 21, 2010 announcement from Punas Das &#151;  &quot;UNESCO is inviting new nomination proposals for inscription on its Memory of the World International Register, a list of library collections and archive holdings of world significance, which was established in 1997 to promote documentary heritage of universal value.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nominations should ideally be submitted through the National Commission for UNESCO or the Memory of the World National Committee in the country where it is located. Proposals should be based on the selection criteria listed in the General Guidelines to Safeguard Documentary Heritage, which stipulates that the most important criterion for inscription on the register is the universal significance of the documentary heritage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The deadline for the submission of nominations is 31 March 2010 and no late submissions will be accepted. They should be submitted to UNESCO's Memory of the World Secretariat either by mail accompanied by an electronic version on diskette, CD-Rom or USB key (addressed to Joie Springer, Memory of the World Programme, Information Society Division, 1, rue Miollis, 75732 Paris Cedex 15, France), or by email to j.springer&#064;unesco.org.&quot;</p>

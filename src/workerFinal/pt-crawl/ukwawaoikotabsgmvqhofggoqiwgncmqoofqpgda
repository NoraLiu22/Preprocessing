            The UK glow worm survey began in 1990. It is run by Robin Scagell, and has no official status, 
            funding or affiliation, but exists solely to gather information about a fascinating insect that most people don&rsquo;t even 
            realise exists in Britain. Information comes mostly from members of the public who see glow worms and want to know more about 
            them. Before the survey started, it was said that there were fewer than 100 sites where glow worms could be found in the UK. The 
            survey has shown that there are in fact hundreds of sites throughout the UK where they can be seen, and more sites are reported every year. 
            Please note that we never give out or list details of glow worm sites on private land, other than to bona fide researchers, 
            so if you have glow worms in your garden please tell us without worrying that you will get hordes of unwanted visitors in the dead of 
            night! You can report a site to us by filling in an 
            <a href="https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/glow-worm">online form</a>. The survey is now run within the national <a href="https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/" target="_blank">iRecord</a> database, so results are stored securely and nationally. We do not send out any junk mail or sell address lists! You can add pictures to your records using the report form.
            <p> The survey has been publicised in particular by the Weekend Telegraph (July 2006), National Trust magazine (Summer 2005), 
            BBC Wildlife Magazine, on BBC Radio 4, and by BBC TV&rsquo;s Country File and Springwatch.

                As we travel in our cars from one brightly streetlit area to another, we are unlikely to notice the tiny lights of glow-worms, 
                about as bright as an LED indicator on a TV. Yet they are still to be found, and they may be more common than you think. But despite 
                surveys over the years, researchers are still in the dark over the factors affecting the decline of glow worms, and even if they are 
                declining everywhere. What is needed is the widest possible survey of the remaining glow-worm habitats, which is where you can help.              
            <p>The glow worm, <em>Lampyris noctiluca</em>, is not at all worm-like but is a beetle up to 25 mm long. Only the wingless female glows strongly, 
            to attract the flying males. Each individual female has an adult glowing life of no more than a few weeks until she mates, since she dies soon 
            after laying her eggs. <p>After a few weeks the eggs hatch into larvae, and they remain as larvae for one or two further summers, feeding 
            on small snails which they apparently paralyse before sucking them empty. The two- or maybe even three-year gap between a mating and the    
            subsequent appearance of an adult helps to explain why you may find plenty on a site one year, yet few or none at all the next. And, 
            of course, sites where they seem to have died out can&rsquo;t be written off on the basis of a single night&rsquo;s search, or even several nights in one season. <p>

            Where should you look for glow worms? Though they are said to favour chalky or limestone areas, they have 
            been reported from many areas of Great Britain. The peak glowing period is evenings in June and July. People are often surprised 
            to discover glow worms in gardens, hedgerows or railway embankments where they had never been noticed before. Disused railway 
            lines are prime sites, in fact. Glow worms can also be found on cliffs, woodland rides, heathland and even valleys in Wales or 
            Scotland which meet none of the above criteria! There are few counties in the UK where they are not found somewhere, though they 
            are believed to be absent from the Isle of Man and Ireland. 
            <p>Having said that, I have had a report from Greystones, south of Dublin, which needs more recent confirmation. In 2009 
            I received a report that glow worms can be seen in the Wicklow Mountains but a request for confirmation to the Wicklow National 
            Park went unanswered. And in 2009 I also heard from Richard Fisk, who spotted what looked like glow worms at Killilane 
            near Rosslare. We really need verification of these reports by means of a photograph of the actual insects, so anyone in the 
            southeast of Ireland is requested to keep their eyes peeled and a camera at the ready.  <p>
            Glow worms are found in Jersey, but not in Guernsey or Alderney.

            <p>Some people like to keep glow-worm sites secret, for fear of the &lsquo;egg-collector&rsquo; mentality, 
            which I appreciate. But I believe that it&rsquo;s better to educate people that glow worms are best left alone rather than 
            taken in glass jars to entertain the kids, and the sites that are well-known and feature in glow-worm walks do not suffer any 
            obvious problems. There are far greater threats to them from ignorance and from lack of knowledge that the glow worms are there. 
            <p>
            Wherever you find small snails, though unfortunately not the large common-or-garden variety, it&rsquo;s worth looking for glow 
            worms. They prefer open grass or hedges to woodland, but rarely are they to be found on land which has been &lsquo;improved&rsquo; 
            for agriculture. Look for them from late May to early September (with a peak in mid July), as soon as it gets dark. They glow 
            for a few hours at a time, and usually stop glowing soon after mating. If you do see glow worms, don&rsquo;t disturb them and 
            certainly don&rsquo;t take them home as trophies, no matter how many there are on a site. Their continued existence at your site 
            could be on a knife-edge. But a short look by torchlight will do no harm, and you may see the smaller, darker (and virtually glow-less) 
            male mating &ndash; perhaps even several on one  female! 
            <p>
            You may also spot larvae, particularly on dark, moonless nights. They glow much more faintly, and only intermittently, for a few 
            seconds at a time. They are also not worm-like but have segmented bodies and six legs at the head end, quite similar to the adults. 
            They do, however, sometimes help themselves along  with their tails when moving, which makes them look a bit like caterpillars. 
            You are more likely to see them on vegetation, searching for  snails, than in the same areas as the glowing females. 
            It is important for the survival of the glow worm to find the sites where the larvae live, since only about one per cent of its 
            life is as an adult. Comparatively little is known about the preferred habitat of the larvae, so reports of them are always 
            welcome. They appear over a longer time span than the adults, supposedly between April and October &ndash; probably whenever 
            conditions are right for snails and slugs.

          The light from glow worms is cold, and is a form of bioluminescence. It is far more efficient than most light sources we are familiar 
          with. It is caused when a molecule called luciferin is oxydised to produce oxyluciferin, with the enzyme luciferase acting as a catalyst 
          in the reaction. Adult Lampyris noctiluca do not have the same control over the oxygen supply of many fireflies, which can switch their 
          lights on and off in an instant, and take minutes to switch on or off. Larvae, however, have smaller light-emitting organs and can 
          twinkle briefly. Male glow worms have the same ability, but it is rare to see them glow.

            </font></h2>
            
            Some people have asked about the conditions for encouraging glow worms or breeding them. If you don't have glow worms nearby, there is 
            no way of attracting them, any more than planting bamboo will attract pandas. But if you do have glow worms, you will want to know how to keep them. We still do not know why some colonies 
            die out even though there are no obvious factors such as destruction of habitat, use of pesticides or herbicides, or strong artificial 
            lighting of the site. Glow worms need a supply of small snails as food and therefore a patch of vegetation where they can find the 
            snails. They also need a comparatively open area where the females can display to attract a male in June, July and August. As they 
            retire into the ground during the day, high mowing does not appear to affect them unduly and very long grass may actually not be 
            very suitable. It is far better to keep a site under control than to let it become overgrown.              
            <p>
            However, my feeling (in discussion with a keen observer, Linda Worrall of Barrowden, Rutland) is that the best cutting regime is not 
            to cut at all during the glowing season from the beginning of June till the middle or end of August. If cuts are vital they should 
            be restricted to high cutting, so as not to get down to the insects which will be down in the understorey. A certain amount of hay 
            lying on the top is preferable to raking it up, which would probably disturb the glow worms, but what you have to avoid is cutting 
            in wet weather which will produce a thick mat of clippings that even the most determined glow worm will find it difficult to climb 
            through at night. 
            <p>
            The females may appear on footpaths  and there is therefore a danger period during summer if the path is heavily used in the late 
            evening while they are emerging to glow. There is not much that can be done about this other than getting people to walk in single
            file. 
            <p>
            As for breeding them, this has been done with varying results. Even under favourable conditions there may be a high mortality. Do 
            not carry home glowing females hoping that they will lay eggs, or even catch a female that has apparently been mated in the hope of 
            hatching a brood. It is better to leave them in the wild.

            <font color="#006600">Are glow worms declining and if so, why?              
            </font></h2> 
            
            This is a tricky one. Probably their numbers are on the decline, and on many individual sites they certainly have vanished, but with so little accurate historical information to go 
            on, it is hard to put numbers on it. Similarly, we can&rsquo;t be dogmatic about the reasons for any decline. If you study one site 
            over a period of years you find that numbers can vary wildly from year to year, and from place to place on the site. It's a mistake 
            to assume that high numbers are the norm, and be concerned about a decline when numbers are lower &ndash; you need to look at the long-term trend.
            However, Tim Gardiner has recently (2020) published an important paper which analyses data recorded using a standard method from a number of sites in Essex between 2001 and 2018, which 
            you can read <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/icad.12407" target="_blank">here.</a>   
            <p>The obvious factors which suggest themselves are:              
            <p>
            <b>Changes in habitat</b> When you go to the sites in the historical county-by-county records (see                
            <a href="#Counties">below</a>) you find that many have now been built on or have been &lsquo;improved&rsquo; in some way (eg an 
            open space has now been &lsquo;parkified&rsquo; by the removal of weeds.    
            <p>
            <b>Use of pesticides and herbicides</b> This is bound to have an effect on the prey of glow worms and on the insects themselves.  
            <p>
            <b>Artificial lighting</b> This has increased in extent enormously since the 1960s and few landscapes are now free from light 
            pollution. Even in country areas householders&rsquo; insecurity lights &ndash; pardon me, &lsquo;security&rsquo; lights &ndash;
            blaze across wide areas. There is no doubt that male glow worms are attracted to artificial lighting of any colour and this must 
            distract them from finding females. Even moth traps set up by entomologists themselves can be a factor. But without a detailed long-term site survey with accurate and consistent before-and-after 
            results there is no firm evidence that this does cause a decline. However, most glow-worm sites are in dark areas and this suggests 
            that lights do cause a decline. 
            <p>
            <b>Changes in land use</b> Much of what was open downland (such as on the Chilterns and South Downs) is now no longer grazed by sheep, 
            allowing them to become increasingly overgrown. Glow worms prefer open areas to dense undergrowth. The increasing amount of set-aside 
            land may be a positive change in the short term, if there are glow worms nearby to colonise the area.                
              <p>    
            We have become concerned that sheep grazing might not be as beneficial as we thought. In the past, both sheep and rabbits would keep 
            the grass short, but rabbits are now often shot, leaving it all to the sheep. Sheep&rsquo;s urine may be bad for snails, removing 
            the glow worms&rsquo; food supply. We need to find sites where there are known changes in management and reliable counts of glow-worm 
            numbers, to see if there is anything in this. 
            <p>
            <b>Parasites</b> On some sites, parasitic beetles may affect the population of glow worms. John Horne has written a report detailing his work showing how the small beetle <em>Alaobia scapularis</em> is parasitic on glow-worm larvae at a site in Hampshire. <a href="http://www.glowworms.org.uk/parasitic/parasitic.html" target="_blank"> Read it here</a>.

              splendidula</i>,found in mainland Europe.                
          
          <h2 style="font-family: Verdana">            
            <font color="#006600">Is it really a glow worm?              
            </font></h2>
            
            There are other creatures that emit some luminescence, including caterpillars and centipedes, and fungi can also glow. See
            <a href="geophil.html">here</a> for a photo of a geophilomorph centipede, for example.              
            <p> 
            Another cause of false reports of glow worms is actually light reflected from shiny leaves, dew or litter. So please 
            check that what you see really is a beetle with the light coming from the final tail segments.              
            <p> 
            Finally, we get occasional reports of fireflies in Britain  that is, insects glowing brightly while in flight. As far as we know these do not exist in the UK, and it is probable 
            that the reports refer to other flying insects seen in light beams. True fireflies swarm around a clump of bushes or in a glade 
            or wood. If you do come across fireflies in Britain then make every effort to catch and keep one and let us know immediately. 
            Fireflies are found in some places on the near Continent, and for a few reports go to the                    
          <a href="worldwide.html">International section</a>.

          <!--Report for 2018 (compiled December 2018)</h2></font color><p>
People often ask whether the year is a good or a bad one for glow worms, and as often turns out to be the case, 2018 was good in some places but bad in others. Does a hot summer such as that experienced in many parts of the UK in 2018 mean that there will be more glow worms? There doesn't seem to be an obvious link between warm weather in a summer and overall numbers. If it's cold in early summer, the appearance of glow worms will be delayed, and if it's warm they may appear earlier. What's more, warm summer nights are likely to bring the humans out into the countryside, so they are more likely to spot the glow worms. Overall we had the same number of reports as in 2017, but they were a little later in the year, with a peak in early July. In some areas, glow worms peak earlier than this, and in some, later, and there is a tendency for sites in the north to peak earlier than those in the south. In some previous years, glow worms have appeared very much later than this &ndash; in 2012, for example, the peak was in the third week in July.<br><br>However, a particularly dry year could affect glow worm numbers in subsequent years if larvae can't find sufficient food (snails or slugs) and 'decide' to delay their pupation to the adult stage for another year. It might be that numbers build up for a year or two, after which very large numbers might appear. After that, numbers might drop to more typical levels, or even lower, leading people to believe that there has been a collapse in the population.<br><br>          
          As in 2017, there was an increase in reports of the 'firefly lights' mentioned at the top of this page. They are apparently very convincing, and some reporters cannot believe that they are not seeing a real natural phenomenon. But despite appearances, they are entirely artificial. Glow worms just don't look like that, don't appear in winter, and don't climb up trees, believe us! <p>-->

          I produced reports of the survey in  1991 and 1992.  You can read most of the text of the <a href="92report.html">1992 
          report</a>, which contains lots of anecdotes and comments on glow worms, as well as a UK map of where they were seen in 1992. So 
          click on the link to see this 70k file.                    
          <p>    
          There is now an updated map of the sites reported to the survey, as of 2006. It includes sites recorded on the database plus some 
          reported to the BRC survey and placed only approximately. Please note that some sites for which we do not have accurate positions 
          are simply recorded at the lower left-hand corner of their 1 km grid square and when they are near the coast they may appear to be 
          out at sea, so please don't send in any quips about amphibious glow worms. It is available in two sizes:

          If you have found glow worms, please let us know where you saw them as it will help us to chart the existing numbers and geographical 
          distribution for future reference. An accurate grid reference to the site is really helpful to us, and online maps make it a simple matter to find it. We are now storing data on the iRecord system set up by the Biological Records Centre, so data will be held permanently for future use. Though records can be viewed by anyone who registers with the site, you are now able to 'blur' the accuracy to which anyone can view your location. We strongly recommend blurring to 1 km, which will avoid anyone identifying your home. We do not give out details of private sites to the public, so please do not worry that you will get people coming round to your garden 
          at the dead of night to see the glow worms! <a href="https://irecord.org.uk/enter-glow-worm-record"  target="_blank">Link to the online form</a>.

          You need not give your personal details if you don't wish to, and the data collected is used only for the purpose of wildlife recording &ndash; 
          we don't use our database for any other purpose, and certainly not for any mail shots.                            
          <p>
          If you would like to take part in the survey, it&rsquo;s probably best to start by finding glow worms on a known site (on public land) 
          so you know what to look for. See the <a href="counties.html" target="_blank">county lists</a> for places where they wre seen in the past, or for recent reports look at the <a href="http://ukglowworms.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>. Then you could look around for similar sites in your area. Old railway lines are ideal sites, but any unimproved grassland (that is, unimproved by farming techniques, and 
          with a variety of different vegetation) is worth a look. Go along after dark, with someone else for security, and take a torch to prevent you 
          falling down rabbit holes and to help you make notes. (Avoid very bright lights or those fluorescent camping lights that destroy night vision.)
          <p>
          Glow worms start to shine as soon as it gets properly dark, which means around the time you can no longer see colour in the landscape by 
          natural light. Count the glows you see (usually the adult females). If you plan to survey on several occasions it is a good idea to 
          develop a standard route so that you are always comparing the same area, even if this means missing a few. Keep notes, and draw a sketch 
          map of the area to help pinpoint where you saw the glow worms. Then fill in the online survey form. 
          </p>
          The form may look detailed, but if parts of it do not apply to your site or are hard to fill in just leave them blank. Please give as 
          accurate a site location as possible. It is important that we know exactly where glow worms are to be found so that changes can be 
          monitored over the years.

          The first national survey of glow worms was carried out by the late Anthony Wootton of Country-Side magazine (the journal of the 
          British Naturalists&rsquo; Association) during the 1970s. Members of the BNA were asked to send in records of sightings old and modern,

          with long-term monitoring of abundance to determine whether they are declining across a range of sites. The book is written with both amateur naturalist and

          <h2><font color="#006600">Glow worms under threat                 
          </font></h2>
          
          Colonies are still under threat. Tony Haywood reports: On the 20th June 2005 I reported 24 glow worms at a site near Stafford. A visit 
          last night to the site revealed a closure of the footpath/cycle-way. Repairs to holes in the path. It seems they have taken a 
          sledge-hammer to crack a nut and have decimated the colony. Large areas of the grassy area containing nettle, rosebay and the habitat 
          has been bull-dozed. Large piles of earth are ready to be spread, and will probably cover what remains of the colony. 4 glowing females 
          were there last night, they are in the path of work for next week I assume. If someone had said, "I know where there is a colony of 
          glow-worms, let's go and destroy it" they could not have been more accurate.  
          <p>
          <i>Unfortunately, glow worms are no better protected than, say, woodlice. But local authorities will often make efforts to protect the 
          colony if they know it is there, because of the great appeal of glow worms. However, you can't assume that they know about a colony. If 
          you know of any colony in a similar situation, it is a good idea to advise the local council or the county conservation officer of its 
          existence, as they should be consulted before any work is carried out. They may also need advice on how to protect the colony, in which 
          case please refer them to me. </i> 
          <p>
          In fact, Tony has now reported: The head conservationist for Stafford county council made an immediate visit to the site and stopped 
          work on the footpath. Damage limitation was achieved. I await next year's season with hopefulness.                          
          <p>    
          Update June 2009: Tony reports that the colony has recovered, and 25 glows were seen.

          <b>Tidy churchyards = no glow worms </b><br>Simon Frogley has been studying the glow worms in the churchyard at Overton in Hampshire. 
          He says:
          <br>They are down in number and size from 2002/3. In 2002 I often counted over 90, and once 120 on any one evening. This year 
          (2005) the maximum I've seen has been 47. However, I've been working with the vicar to try and get the policy changed there &ndash; did 
          a TV interview with him for Meridian and wrote an article for the parish magazine &ndash; it has become so tidy there, last year was 
          the worst, that there are few places left for snails or larvae. The best area for them now is a bank where the grass is left, so that 
          is where they are this year (for the first time in any quantity) but there is strong  street lighting above them there. Anyway, the 
          vicar is seeking support from parishioners to provide more cover in the areas that they used to favour, so that might help. 
          <p><i>We heard in 2010 that an area has been left unmown in the churchyard and by mid June glow worms were already in evidence.</i><p>
          The churchyard at Uplowman in Devon has suffered a similar fate. In 1992 we had reports of about 100 glow 
          worms visible there. Our correspondent writes: 'The churchyard used to have a huge population until the locals decided it would be a 
          good idea to tidy it up by spraying and using strimmers. Now down to single figures'. Only four were seen in July 2010.<p>
          You might think from the above that it is a bad idea to mow an area where glow worms are seen. However, they are equally at risk from lack of management. An area left to its own devices will in due course become a tangle of brambles and other vegetation. The best management is to allow a mosaic of weedy areas and shorter grass where the females can be seen. See the remarks above for management suggestions. <p> 
          <b>Glow worms at Broxbourne Woods</b> Basil Ezzat writes:<em> &nbsp;
          Tree felling and widening of the forest track within Broxbourne Woods (Ordnance Survey grid reference TL338082) have taken place through the glow worm habitat. The part of the woodland with the glow worm habitat is privately owned. The land owners have used machinery to excavate the top soil and using large rollers to compact the subsoil. The glow worms don't stand a chance.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land owners were fully aware of the location of the glow worms as they allow a conservation group run by Herts Count Council's Countryside Management Service to manage the vegetation for the benefit of the glow worms annually.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can you highlight that anyone coming to Broxbourne Woods is likely to see greatly reduced numbers.</em><p>
It may be that if this has happened outside the glowing season, at a time when some of the larvae may have been in the surrounding woodland rather than where the glowing females appear in summer. Some may have survived the devastation, though the glowing females may well appear in different places from before. Counts this year will be very important.<br>

          <h2><font color="#006600">Glow-worms in popular culture</h2></font>
          There are many references online to poems that feature glow worms, and other literary references, and in due course I will collect some here. <p>
          <strong>Thomas Hardy</strong>, famous for his novels about 19th century Wessex (mostly the present county of Dorset), refers to them in his book <em>The Return of the Native</em>, which though published in 1878 refers to the 1840s&ndash;1850s.<br><br> In Book 3, Chapter VIII, he sets a scene where two men are playing dice for high stakes in the heathland as twilight falls and <em>As their eyes grew accustomed to the darkness they perceived faint greenish points of light among the grass and fern. These lights dotted the hillside like stars of a low magnitude.</em> Determined to continue their game, one man <em>went hither and thither till he had gathered thirteen glowworms &ndash; as many as he could find in a space of four or five minutes.... It happened to be that season of the year at which glowworms put forth their greatest brilliancy, and the light they 

yielded was more than ample for the purpose, since it is possible on such nights to read the handwriting of a letter by the light of two or three.</em> <br><br>Note that the glow worms were not so plentiful that they could be gathered quickly, but their abundance is similar to that of a good site today. Even in the 21st century I have occasionally seen glow worms so densely scattered that, had I wished, I could have found 30 or 40 within the same space of time. <br><br>
          <strong>Dorothy Wordsworth</strong>, sister and constant companion to her more famous brother William, the poet, makes several interesting references to glow worms in her diaries at the beginning of the 19th century. I have collected her references and commented on them <a href="DorothyW.html">on this page</a>. <p>

          Someone who is interested in glow worms in <strong>Belgium</strong> is Raphaël de Cock, who hopes to carry out a European survey. He is interested in 
          the reasons why glow worms do glow, and believes that it may have originated as a warning mechanism, like the bright colours of some 
          insects (aposematism). Contact him <a href="glowcontacts.htm" target="_blank">here</a> or visit his website:

          carried out a survey of glow worms in <strong>Normandy</strong> in 2002. Visit his website at <a href="http://monsite.wanadoo.fr/verluisant" target="_blank">

          Around Zurich, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, <a href="glowcontacts.htm" target="_blank">Stefan Ineichen</a> is an urban ecologist investigating the 
          survival of glow worms in the country areas around the city, and even in cemeteries and gardens within Zurich itself. With financial 
          support he has started a Glühwürmchen Projekt which is using the insect &lsquo;as an attractive flagship species to improve habitats 
          and to get people connected with nature.&rsquo; He is studying the factors which affect the survival of the glow worm, and would be 
          pleased to hear from anyone who wants to help. We look forward to seeing the website which he is preparing.

          A survey in the French-speaking part of Switzerland was carried out 2001 by Centre Suisse de Cartographie de la Faune &ndash; contact                              
          <a href="glowcontacts.htm" target="_blank">Yves Gonseth</a> for details. It was publicised through the magazine Energie-Environnement 
          which is distributed free of charge to every French-speaking Swiss &ndash; about 880,000 people. The results were published in the 
          December issue of La Salamandre; 900 observations were received from around 500 people. Some have seen glow worms at 2000 metres in 
          altitude in the Alps. Click <a href="Swisssurvey.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a more detailed report and map.

          You can find a wealth of information and research about <strong>US fireflies </strong>on the web pages of Terry Lynch. Find them at                              
          <a href="http://www.byteland.org/firefly/firefly_notebooks.html" target="_blank">http://www.byteland.org/firefly/firefly_notebooks.html</a>. 
          This site gives masses of information about the rearing and preservation of the US firefly, <i>Photinus pyralis</i>, as well as 
          many links for further info. <p>
          Fireflies are also common in <strong>Portugal</strong>, where Gonçalo Figueira runs a investigation about them and other bioluminescent forms. More details on his <a href="http://pirilampos-lightalive.blogspot.pt/">blog (in Portuguese)</a>.

          Many British people say that their only encounter with fireflies has been in Italy, but there is no firefly survey in that country. However, interest is being raised by <a href="glowcontacts.htm" target="_blank">Giuseppe Camerini</a>, 
          and there is now a website devoted to fireflies in Italy, at <a href="https://www.lampyridae.it/en/firefly-watching/" target="_blank"> https://www.lampyridae.it/en/firefly-watching/</a>.<p>   
          Chip Fesko has contributed a <a  href="http://www.galaxypix.com/glowworms/chipspoem.html" target="_blank">poem
          </a> about the fireflies he saw as a child which may hit an old memory with others.

          In <strong>Nepal</strong>, <a href="glowcontacts.htm" target="_blank">Prem Bahadur Budha</a> is researching fireflies but can find very little literature 
          on the subject. If you have an interest in Asian firefly species please make contact directly. See his message on the

<div class="report">
<p>Two young people, Messieurs the Verreaux brothers, have recently arrived 
from a voyage to the ends of Africa, to the land of the Cape of Good-Hope. 
One of these interesting naturalists is barely eighteen years old, but he 
has already spent twenty months in the wild country north of the land of 
the Hottentots, between the latitudes of Natal [Port Natal 30 degrees South] 
and the top of St Helena Bay [33 degrees South]. How can one possibly imagine 
what deprivations he had to endure? Our young compatriots had to face the 
dangers of living in the midst of the natives of this zone of Africa, who 
are ferocious as well as black, as well as the fawn-coloured wild animals 
among which they live, about which we do not need to tell. We want to speak 
only about the triumphs of their collecting, and do not know which to admire 
more, their intrepidity or their perseverance. Humans, quadrapeds, birds, 
fish, plants, minerals, shells--all of these they have studied. Their 
hunting has given them  tigers [leopards], lions, hyenas, an admirable 
lubal [scavenger??], a crimson antelope of rare elegance, a host of other 
small members of the same [antelope] family, two giraffes, monkeys, 
long pitchforks [fouines??], very-curious rats, ostriches, birds of 
prey which have never been described before, a great quantity of other 
birds of all sizes, colours and species. They also have a collection of 
[bird's] nests, which could be the object of a charming descriptive 
essay; roots like onions, and other plants of remarkable shape and 
extraordinary size, snakes, a cachalot [??], and a crocodile of a 
type previously unknown.</p>

<p>But their greatest curiosity is an individual of the nation of the 
Betjouanas. This man is preserved by the means by which naturalists 
prepare their specimens and reconstitute their form and, so to speak, 
their inert life. He is of small stature, black of skin, his head covered 
by short woolly and curly hair, armed with arrows and a lance, clothes in 
antelope skin, [with a bag??] made of bush-pig, full of small glass-beads, 
seeds, and of small bones. Another thing that we are rather embarrassed to 
find a suitable term to characterise, is the very special accessory of modest 
clothing worn by the Betjouanas, which we find most striking.</p>

<p>Messieurs Verreaux have deposited their scientific riches at the 
stores of Monsieur Delessert, rue Saint-Fiacre, n.3. There they are 
generously put on display for the public, without charge. It would be 
well if the Jardin des Plantes (Botanical Gardens) took this opportunity 
to extend its collections, already so beautiful, to become even more 
desirable -- and to use the skills which they do not already possess of 
Messieurs Verreaux with the time, the talent, and the energy necessary to 
go out Africa to catch nature in the act.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>The arrows were missing from later displays of the body. 
The lance presumably refers to the long fishing-spear with barbs 
that he was exhibited with. The bag with small glass beads, seeds, 
and small bones, was probably buried with him. It could indicate that 
he was some kind of ngaka (traditional doctor). None of the grave goods 
were returned with the body sent to Gaborone in October 2000.</p>

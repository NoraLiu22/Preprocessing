ourfeast today, Jane called us up about 3 in the morning, to tell us of agreat fire they saw in the City.&nbsp; So I rose, and slipped on my nightgown,and went to her window, and thought it to be on the back side of <b>Markelane</b>(<a href="pepysmap4.html" target="_blank">Map 4</a>, <b><font color="#ED181E">10</font></b>)at the furthest, but being unused to such fires as fallowed, I thoughtit far enough off, and so went to bed again, and to sleep.&nbsp;<p>About 7 rose again to dress myself, and there looked out at the windowand saw the fire not so much as it was, and further off.&nbsp; So to mycloset to set things to rights, after yesterday's cleaning.&nbsp; By andby Jane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have beenburned down tonight by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning downall <b>Fishstreet </b>(<a href="pepysmap4.html" target="_blank">Map4</a>, <b><font color="#ED181E">2</font></b>), by London Bridge.&nbsp; So I made myself ready presently,and walked to the Tower, and there got up upon one of the high places,Sir J Robinsons little son going up with me; and there I did see the housesat that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire on thisand the other side the end of the bridge--which, among other people, didtrouble me for poor little Michell and our Sarah on the Bridge.<p>So down, with my heart full of trouble, to the Lieutenant of the Tower,who tells me that it begun this morning in the <b>King's bakers house inPudding-lane </b>(<a href="pepysmap4.html" target="_blank">Map4</a>,

of Fishstreet already.&nbsp; So I down to the water-sideand there got a boat and through bridge, and there saw a lamentable fire.&nbsp;Poor Michells house, as far as the <b>Old Swan </b>(<a

toremove their goods and leave all to the fire; and having seen it get asfar as the Steeleyard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into theCity, and everything, after so long a drought,

all; and word was carried in to the King, so I wascalled for and did tell the King and Duke of York what I saw, and thatunless his Majesty did command houses to be pulled down, nothing couldstop the fire.&nbsp; They seemed much troubled, and the King commandedme to go to my Lord Mayor from him and command him to spare no houses butto pull down before the fire every way.&nbsp; The Duke of York bid me tellhim that if he would have any more soldiers, he shall; and so did my LordArlington afterward, as a great secret.&nbsp;<p>Here meeting with Captain Cocke, I in his coach, which he lent me, andCreed with me, to Pauls; and there walked along Watling-street as wellas I could, every creature coming away loaden with goods to save--and hereand there sick people carried away in

will not obey me.&nbsp; I have been pull[ing] downhouses.&nbsp; But the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it."&nbsp;That he needed no more soldiers; and that for himself, he must go and refreshhimself, having been up all night.&nbsp;<p>So he left me, and I him, and walked home--seeing people all almost distractedand no manner of means used to quench the fire.&nbsp; The houses too, sovery thick thereabouts, and full of matter for burning, as pitch and tar,in <b>Thames-street </b>(<a href="pepysmap4.html" target="_blank">Map4</a>, <b><font color="#ED181E">7</font></b>)--and

it soon proved) that they must be in a little time removed from hishouse also--which was a sad consideration.&nbsp; And to see the churchesall filling with goods, by people who themselfs should have been quietlythere at this time.&nbsp;<p>By this time it was about 12 a-clock; and so <b>home </b>(<a href="pepysmap4.html" target="_blank">Map4</a>, <b><font color="#ED181E">9</font></b>), and

whichwas to look over my closet and please him with the sight thereof, whichhe hath long desired, was wholly disappointed, for we were in great troubleand disturbance at this fire, not knowing what to think of it.&nbsp; However,we had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry as at this time we couldbe.&nbsp; While at dinner, Mrs. Batelier come to enquire after Mr. Woolfeand Stanes (who it seems are related to them), whose houses in Fishstreetare all burned, and they in a sad condition.&nbsp; She would not stay inthe fright.&nbsp;<p>As soon as dined, I and Moone away and walked

<a name="Heading3"></a><b><i>SWEEDMAN V TRANSPORT ACCIDENT
COMMISSION</i></b><b>: STATE RESIDENCE DISCRIMINATION AND THE HIGH COURT'S
RETREAT INTO CHARACTERISATION</b></h1>
<p align="center"><b><i>Amelia
Simpson<sup><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[&#8727;]</a></sup></i></b></p>
<p>This Comment considers the High Court's recent decision in <i>Sweedman v
Transport Accident Commission</i>.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup>
The issue dealt with at greatest length in the judgments was the suggested
conflict between New South Wales and Victorian enactments
and the related
suggestion that constitutional principles would enliven to resolve this
conflict. A second issue, the potential application
of the s 117 prohibition on
State residence discrimination, attracted less detailed treatment. Nevertheless,
the Court's resolution
of this second issue is significant in its apparent
departure from the approach taken in the landmark case of <i>Street v Queensland
Bar Association</i>.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> While this
Comment will explain the Court's reasoning on both issues, analysis of the
decision will focus on the s 117 issue.</p>
<p>In short, my criticism is this: by treating the s 117 dispute as a question
of characterisation, and avoiding all reference to the
reasonableness of the
Victorian regime and its policy on extending indemnity, the joint judgment seems
to undercut<b> </b>the promise of a truly substantive understanding of
discrimination in the s 117 context. The analysis in <i>Sweedman</i> retreats
from the Court's earlier acceptance, evident in <i>Street</i>, of the
significant judicial discretion that is implicated when judges apply comparative
concepts like 'discrimination'. Whereas
<i>Street</i> foreshadowed a shouldering
of responsibility for the policy evaluation inherent in these assessments,
<i>Sweedman</i> suggests that the present Court is unwilling to engage in the
kind of candid exposition that is involved in discharging that kind
of
responsibility.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading10"></a><b>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</b></h2>
<p>The case arose out of a car accident occurring in New South Wales on 20 July
2006. The accident involved Mrs Sweedman, a New South
Wales resident driving a
car registered in New South Wales, and Mr and Mrs Sutton, Victorian residents
whose car was registered in
Victoria. </p>
<p>The Suttons claimed and received compensation for their injuries from the
Victorian Transport Accident Commission ('TAC'), a statutory
corporation
established by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/taa1986204/" class="autolink_findacts">Transport Accident Act 1986</a></i> (Vic) ('the Victorian
Act'). Broadly speaking, that Act establishes a no fault compensation scheme,
administered by the TAC, for
victims of road accidents occurring in Victoria
and/or involving Victorian residents or
vehicles.<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup> By s 109 of the Victorian
Act, a transport accident charge is collected from all owners of
Victorian-registered vehicles. This money
goes into the statutory fund out of
which compensation payouts are
made.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup> By s 94, owners and drivers
of Victorian-registered vehicles are indemnified for loss and injury resulting
from their involvement
in accidents. Anyone not protected by s 94 &#8212;
including non-Victorians driving vehicles not registered in Victoria &#8212; can
be pursued by the TAC in an action to recover costs. Section 104(1) allows the
TAC to seek indemnity from such persons where their
fault contributed to
injuries compensated under the Victorian
Act.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In April 2002, the TAC invoked this statutory right to indemnity against Mrs
Sweedman. It commenced proceedings in the County Court
of Victoria, seeking to
recover from Sweedman &#8212; in practice, from her third-party insurer &#8212;
the amount paid to the Suttons
as compensation under the Victorian Act. The
County Court reserved a series of questions for the Court of Appeal of
Victoria.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> The essence of these
questions was as follows:</p>
<p>1<i>	An extraterritoriality issue</i>: Does the Victorian Act s 104(1), as a
matter of construction, give the TAC rights against Mrs Sweedman?</p>
<p>2<i>	A choice of law issue</i>: If the case involves the exercise of federal
jurisdiction, does the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> </i>(Cth) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 79</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">80</a> affect the
Victorian Act's operation?</p>
<p>3<i>	Commonwealth constitutional issues</i>: Is the Victorian Act s 104(1)
invalid or inapplicable to Mrs Sweedman by operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 117</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">118</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, or constitutional principles relating to inconsistency
between State laws?</p>
<p>Counsel for Mrs Sweedman evidently conceded the extraterritoriality point
before the Court of Appeal &#8212; and the Court agreed
that such an operation
for s 104(1) of the Victorian Act was both intended and constitutionally
permissible.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup><b> </b>The Court of
Appeal also rejected Sweedman's argument that the proceedings were in tort and
in federal jurisdiction, such that the
choice of law rule that would be 'picked
up' by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 79</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">80</a> favoured the law of New South Wales.
While it was accepted that federal jurisdiction and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
were enlivened, Nettle JA found the claim was not tort-based but rather was
'enforceable as a quasi-contractual cause of action in
the nature of a quantum
meruit'.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> This meant that the
applicable choice of law rule actually pointed to Victorian law as the law to
govern the proceedings.</p>
<p>On the constitutional issues, the Court of Appeal rejected Sweedman's
argument that the Victorian Parliament lacked the constitutional
competence to
regulate the liability of New South Wales residents for accidents occurring in
New South Wales.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> It also rejected
the claim of s 117 discrimination, finding that the Victorian legislative
scheme's denial of benefits to persons
who had not paid vehicle registration
charges in Victoria was not relevantly
discriminatory.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading28"></a><b>THE HIGH COURT DECISION</b></h2>
<p>In the High Court the case for the appellant Sweedman focused on the
constitutional arguments that had been put, unsuccessfully, in
the Court of
Appeal.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup> The position of the
respondent TAC was supported by the intervening Attorneys-General for Victoria
and New South Wales. The Commonwealth,
South Australia and Western Australia
also intervened. In the result, a 5:1 majority dismissed the appeal, with
Callinan J dissenting.
This section of this Comment will examine the issues
raised and the positions taken in the three High Court judgments. The next
section
will explore the significance of the majority joint judgment's reasoning
on s 117 and raise some concerns about the approach taken
there.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading31"></a><b>Inconsistency as between State laws: </b></h3>
<p>The appellant contended for a principle of inconsistency, arising seemingly
by implication from the federal principle underlying the
<i>Commonwealth</i>
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, that would resolve 'clashes' between the laws of different
States. Specifically, she asserted that various provisions of the Victorian
Act,
including s 104(1), came into conflict with provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents
Act 1988</a></i> (NSW) ('the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">NSW Act</a>') when the former sought to attach legal
consequences to accidents occurring in New South Wales. The suggested
inconsistency principle
was developed by the appellant in terms familiar from
the High Court's s 109 inconsistency jurisprudence (eg, 'operational
inconsistency')
and also the common law constitutional jurisprudence on
extraterritoriality (eg, 'nexus'
test).<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup> The appellant contended
that the Victorian provisions depended for their operation, in this case, upon a
pre-existing tort liability
established by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">NSW Act</a>. Yet by also undermining
the policy objectives underpinning the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">NSW Act</a>, the Victorian provisions gave
rise to an 'operational inconsistency' on the facts of this case. The appellant
then contended that,
of the two Parliaments, the New South Wales Parliament
could claim the 'closer nexus' with those facts and the Victorian provisions
must therefore be rendered 'inoperative' here.</p>
<p>The majority joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ began
its analysis of the inconsistency issue with a series
of general propositions.
Their Honours noted that there was clearly a sufficient nexus to allow
provisions of the Victorian Act an
extra-territorial
operation.<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup><b> </b>They next
noted that inconsistency as between the laws of different States needs to be
understood against a backdrop of choice of
law rules. Application of those rules
ought, in many cases, to resolve particular conflicts that might otherwise throw
up inconsistencies.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup> The joint
judgment noted, however, that part of the appellant's argument was that these
choice of law rules might at times be displaced
by 'constitutional imperatives'
dictating a different result.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup><b>
</b>Next, the joint judgment noted the existence of a single national common law
regime of choice of law rules, which would have dictated
the same result in
litigation between these parties whether initiated in Victoria or in New South
Wales.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The joint judgment explained that the nature and purpose of the New South
Wales legislation weighed against the appellant's claim
of inconsistency between
State laws. The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">NSW Act</a> did not set out to establish an <i>exclusive</i> regime
for dealing with road accidents occurring in New South Wales. Nor did it attempt
to discourage or restrict claims for indemnity
like that envisaged by s 104(1)
of the Victorian Act, or displace the operation of choice of law
rules.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The choice of law issue was approached in the joint majority judgment in two
steps. First, their Honours determined the nature of
the legal claim that the
TAC was making against the appellant. They agreed with the Court of Appeal's
finding that the TAC's action
was not in tort, but rather was 'quasi-contractual
&#8230; in the nature of a quantum
meruit'.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup><b> </b>On that basis,
choice of law rules dictated that the governing law be that of whichever State
had the closest connection with the
obligation to indemnify. The joint judgment
found that, on the facts of this case, Victorian law enjoyed the closer
connection.<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup> Second, the joint
judgment considered the consequences, if any, of the proceedings being in
federal jurisdiction. Their Honours noted
that the enlivening of federal
jurisdiction brought <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> into play. However, in
this case, in the absence of any relevant statutory modification to the common
law position on choice of law,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> simply picked up and applied, unaltered, the
common law rule as just
described.<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, their Honours acknowledged that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> rule is made subject
to constitutional
constraints.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup><b> </b>The
appellant suggested two relevant constitutional limits on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80's</a> operation, one
being implied constitutional principles governing the resolution of
inconsistencies between State laws, the other
being the s 117 prohibition on
discrimination based on State residence. </p>
<p>As to the suggested principles governing inconsistency between State laws,
the joint judgment accepted that some such principles must
exist and would need
to be called upon in some cases to resolve apparent 'clashes' between the laws
of different States. However,
they avoided committing to any particular
formulation of such principles, on the basis that inconsistency was not a live
issue on
the facts of this case. There was, their Honours said, no direct
inconsistency, in the sense of conflicting commands, between relevant
provisions
of the New South Wales and Victorian statutory
regimes.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup><b> </b>Moreover, any
argument for inconsistency that depended overtly upon a 'cover-the-field'-style
analysis, as applied under s 109 to
inconsistency between Commonwealth and State
laws, was considered inappropriate as between States, given that no State enjoys
constitutional
paramountcy over
others.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup><b> </b></p>
<p>The appellant's more nuanced argument for a 'clash' &#8212; pointing up the
TAC action's tendency to undermine the policy objectives
of the New South Wales
regime &#8212; was also dismissed by the Court, on the basis that it required
too great an abstraction from
the specific context of the TAC's action against
Sweedman.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup> From the vantage point
of that action, 'the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">NSW Act</a> does not speak in any way which impairs or detracts
from the pursuit of [the TAC's]
claim.'<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup> Indeed, the joint
judgment noted, actions such as the TAC's constitute such a small fraction of
the claims made on NSW third-party
insurance funds that they could interfere
with the New South Wales Parliament's policy objectives in only the most
marginal sense.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, with no evident inconsistency on the facts, the joint judgment did not
need to take a view on the appellant's suggested constitutional
principles for
resolving such clashes &#8212; essentially a test turning on the 'greater
governmental interest' of one or other
jurisdiction.<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> Nevertheless,
their Honours expressed reservations about the proposed test. In particular,
they envisaged problems of measurement
and commensurability in the weighing of
competing 'governmental
interests'.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup> They did not,
though, give any clues as to what they would regard as a more satisfactory rule
or standard for the resolution of inconsistencies
between State laws. This, the
joint judgment said, 'awaits formulation on another occasion' in a case that
raises the issue more
squarely.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Justice Heydon, in a separate judgment, focused on demonstrating the lack of
any relevant inconsistency between s 104(1) of the Victorian
Act and relevant
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">NSW Act</a>. When compared with the joint judgment, Heydon J's
reasons give more thorough consideration to the detail of the appellant's
inconsistency
arguments. He identifies five distinct claims of relevant
inconsistency within the appellant's arguments and explains his reasons
for
rejecting each of these. These explanations reveal a quite specific and narrow
conception of what would amount to an inconsistency
as between two State laws, a
conception inimical to much of the appellant's case. In particular, Heydon J
thought that the New South
Wales Parliament's policy objectives concerning
'damages' claims could not be relevantly compromised by any rights the Victorian
Parliament might create concerning upstream <i>indemnity</i> for damages paid,
in view of the different nature of these two legal
rights.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup><b> </b>Moreover, on
Heydon J's reading of the New South Wales Act, this latter form of liability had
been contemplated by the Parliament
and the absence of any provision to curb or
control it was no oversight.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup>
Having found that the appellant's claims 'satisfy no possible test for
inconsistency', he saw no need to examine, or endorse, any
of the tests mooted
in argument.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Justice Callinan's dissenting judgment focused on the inconsistency and
choice of law issues, opting not to discuss the s 117 issue.
In keeping with a
now familiar pattern, Callinan J's differences with the majority sprang from his
uncompromising views about Australian
federalism and the importance of the
independence and integrity of States under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup> Justice
Callinan characterised the Victorian Act's purported operation in this case as
an instance of the 'excessive exercise of
long-arm jurisdiction' and charged the
majority with contributing to a 'disturbing trend' of 'jurisdictional
overreach'.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Essentially, Callinan J found that there <i>was </i>a significant 'clash'
between the laws of Victoria and New South Wales in the circumstances of this
case &#8212; significant enough
to require a constitutionally mandated
solution.<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup> The clash followed, he
said, from important differences in the liability and compensation regimes
established under the Victorian
and New South Wales
statutes.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup><b> </b>In particular,
he pointed to the importance of finality in determinations of liability under
the New South Wales regime. He saw this
as an intended benefit to New South
Wales insurers which the Victorian Act, with its provision for findings of
ongoing and extended
liability, seemed to strip away, in so far as it exposed
those insurers to indemnity
claims.<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup><b> </b>It did not
matter, he said, that the New South Wales regime had not attempted explicitly to
block the application of other States'
laws to injuries occurring in New South
Wales &#8212; inconsistency could be inferred readily enough without such
express advertence.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Justice Callinan's difference with the majority flowed not only from this
finding of inconsistency &#8212; he also took a different
view of the relevant
choice of law principles and their application in this case. He explained at
length his view that choice of
law principles, when properly chosen and applied
to the facts, revealed this dispute to be more closely connected with New South
Wales than with Victoria. He found that the New South Wales Parliament had the
greater connection with and interest in the factual
event that gave rise to
these proceedings &#8212; being a road accident occurring in New South Wales,
and involving one vehicle registered
there and one driver resident there. While
Callinan J thought this dispute was essentially grounded in a tort claim, such
that the
choice of law principles for tort law would apply, he also took the
view that New South Wales probably had the closer connection
even on applying
other choice of law principles, as the majority had
done.<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>These two findings &#8212; as to inconsistency and choice of law &#8212;
underpinned Callinan J's arrival at a constitutional solution.
He found that the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>must recognise and protect New South Wales' pre-eminent
&#8212; if not entirely sovereign &#8212; authority in respect of its own
territory.<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> That pre-eminence was
threatened here by the purported application of Victorian law that would
frustrate 'the objects of the [New
South Wales] Act of enabling the early
investigation, assessment, and settlement of
claims'.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup> The bottom line for
Callinan J was that States should not have their legislated policy objectives
thwarted by the 'long-arm' operation
of another State's laws &#8212; and such a
restriction on State legislative competency must be implicit in the
<i>Constitution's </i>federal arrangements. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading75"></a><b>Section 117 discrimination:</b></h3>
<p>The appellant argued that, by operation of s 104(1) of the Victorian Act upon
her, she suffered discrimination on the basis of her
State of residence, from
which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would immunise her. Had she been a
resident of Victoria, she argued, the car she was driving at the time of the
accident would likely
have been registered in Victoria and she would, therefore,
have enjoyed immunity from indemnity proceedings brought under s 104(1)
of the
Victorian Act.</p>
<p>The joint judgment gave two reasons for finding s 117 inapplicable in the
present case. First, their Honours noted that the appellant
had urged the Court
to focus upon the 'reality of the situation' before it, in keeping with the s
117 doctrine's emphasis on 'substance
and practical
operation'.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup><b> </b>However, they
said, this focus was not in fact to the appellant's advantage in this case. The
burden of indemnifying the TAC would
really be born by her third-party insurer,
which as a corporation was not a 'subject of the Queen' enjoying s 117's
protection.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup><b> </b>Thus, if
Sweedman suffered no burden in reality, the joint judgment thought it doubtful
that there was any 'disability or discrimination'
upon which s 117 could
operate.</p>
<p>The other problem that the joint judgment identified with the appellant's s
117 argument centred on the 'ground' on which the alleged
discrimination was
said to be based. Their Honours noted that s 94 of the Victorian Act &#8212;
indemnifying owners and drivers of
Victorian registered vehicles from liability
for injuries caused &#8212; was 'not conditioned by
residence.'<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></sup> In other words, they
thought it significant that the benefit of that indemnity attached because of
the place of a vehicle's registration,
rather than a person's place of
residence. So, a Victorian resident driving a vehicle not registered in Victoria
would not enjoy
the s 94 indemnity. Conversely, non-Victorian residents would
enjoy the indemnity, when driving vehicles registered
there.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></sup> On this basis the joint
judgment considered the exemption from liability conferred by s 94 to be 'in a
practical if not also legal
sense, the consideration for payment of the
transport accident charge.'<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a></sup><b>
</b>Accordingly, their Honours understood the indemnity not as a privilege
reserved to Victorians but rather as a benefit purchased by
many Victorians, as
well as some non-Victorians. The differential treatment, such that any existed,
was not 'attributable to residence',
as residence is not the 'discrimen [the
law] chooses'.<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Having found that the differential treatment of the appellant, under s 104(1)
of the Victorian Act, was not dispensed by reference
to her State of residence,
the joint judgment saw no need to continue further with its s 117 analysis. That
is, their Honours chose
not to consider whether the differential treatment might
be justified as appropriate and adapted to the attainment of a legitimate
policy
goal.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Justice Callinan found it unnecessary to consider the s 117 argument, having
grounded his reasons in the inconsistency and choice
of law points &#8212;
though he did allude to the relevance here of the real detriments Sweedman would
suffer, as he'd earlier
mentioned.<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></sup> Justice Heydon simply
agreed with the joint judgment as to the s 117
issue.<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading90"></a><b>SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE S 117 REASONING</b></h2>
<p>As foreshadowed, the analysis in this Comment is directed to the s 117 issue.
While the constitutional choice of law and inconsistency
issues have been before
the High Court several times in recent years and have benefited from detailed
scholarly analysis,<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a></sup> s 117 has
maintained a much lower profile of late. The <i>Sweedman </i>case presented the
Gleeson Court's first significant opportunity to delve into discrimination on
the basis of State of residence.
The last time that the High Court had squarely
faced s 117 had been twelve years earlier in <i>Goryl v Greyhound Australia Pty
Ltd</i>.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup> The treatment given to
the s 117 issue in <i>Sweedman </i>is, accordingly, significant, even while
taking up just 13 paragraphs of the joint judgment. As is so often the case in
judicial reasoning,
what the Court left unsaid in <i>Sweedman</i> may reveal
just as much about its position on s 117 as do the views made explicit.</p>
<p>I will first discuss the emphasis placed on characterisation in the
resolution of the <i>Sweedman</i> s 117 problem and explain how this departs,
and retreats, from the approach to s 117 analysis outlined in the landmark
decision in
<i>Street v Queensland Bar
Association</i>.<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></sup> Most
significant is the Court's fairly thin account of how 'substance' should inform
s 117 analysis. This account led it, among other
things, to neglect the 'natural
concomitant' analysis foreshadowed in <i>Street</i>. Next, I will consider the
joint judgment's failure to address the major fault line emerging between the
judgments in <i>Street</i>, which concerns the appropriate way of undertaking
the balancing necessitated by s 117's concern with discrimination. Finally, I
will examine the joint judgment's apparent approach to the identification of the
'burdens' from which discrimination analysis must
proceed: an approach which
offers some guidance on questions of onus but little on questions of
materiality. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading96"></a><b>Characterisation over 'substance'</b></h3>
<p>One widely discernable marker of the High Court's recent return to more
legalistic forms of analysis, in its constitutional jurisprudence
as elsewhere,
is the tendency to resolve disputes at the level of characterisation. Doing so
often enables judges to reason to a
conclusion in a way that circumvents the
need for any sort of analysis &#8212; such as the application of a 'balancing'
test &#8212;
that might require overt judicial assessments of a law's
'reasonableness' or any other evaluation of non-legal policy issues and
values.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a></sup> In <i>Sweedman</i>, just
this sort of manoeuvre is evident in the resolution of the s 117 issue.
</p>
<p>While the decision of the High Court in
<i>Street</i><sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a></sup><i> </i>was
complicated by the fact that it comprised seven separate judgments, there is one
thing on which the judges all agreed &#8212;
the s 117 limitation should be
understood and applied by reference to a substance-based test. It was
unnecessary for the Court to
elaborate on and refine this test in the subsequent
<i>Goryl </i>case &#8212; there, the facial nature of the discrimination meant
that the case was easily
resolved.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a></sup> In <i>Sweedman</i>,
however, where the suggested discrimination was not evident on the face of the
impugned law, the precise contours of a substance-focused
test assumed greater
importance. </p>
<p>The joint judgment in <i>Sweedman </i>revealed a preference for<b> </b>a
fairly 'thin' conception of the 'substance' that must inform the application of
s 117. The joint judgment<i> </i>emphasises the need to isolate an impugned
law's 'discrimen' &#8212; the basis on which it draws a distinction among legal
subjects
&#8212; in order to test it against the s 117 prohibition. Their
Honours acknowledge, in keeping with <i>Street</i>, that the idea of a law's
discrimen must be understood substantively &#8212; that is, that the basis on
which the law distinguishes
among different classes should be considered by
reference to more than just the law's explicit terms. In the case before them,
their
Honours found that the relevant discrimen was, as a matter of substance,
the place of a vehicle's registration, rather than the place
of residence of its
owner and/or driver.<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a></sup><b> </b>Yet
it is questionable whether that supposedly substance-focused view in fact
scratched deep enough into the law's operational context
to really be much of an
advance on a form-focused determination. </p>
<p>Section 104(1) of the Victorian Act, when read in conjunction with associated
provisions, indeed did extend the suggested privilege
&#8212; exemption from
indemnity action &#8212; by reference to the place of a vehicle's registration.
That was certainly true as
a matter of legal form. But was it also true as a
matter of 'substance', as the joint judgment insisted? The joint judgment noted
that the Victorian regime allowed for non-residents to take advantage of its
provisions, and so to share in the indemnity enjoyed
by those within the scheme.
Yet a finding that a legal benefit is theoretically open to all does not equate
with a finding that,
'in substance', those benefits are not the preserve of one
State's residents. The joint judgment in <i>Sweedman</i> said nothing about the
proportion of vehicles registered in Victoria that corresponded to owners or
drivers not resident in Victoria.
Assuming that such instances represented a
tiny fraction of registrations, a solid argument might be made that having one's
vehicle
registered in Victoria is a 'natural concomitant' of residence in
Victoria that should be bundled with that residence for purposes
of s 117
analysis.</p>
<p>This idea of 'natural concomitants' of a person's State of residence emerged
in <i>Street</i>.<i> </i>There, a range of views was expressed as to what kinds
of distinctions, not themselves constructed around categories of residence
and
non-residence, might nonetheless amount 'in substance' to discrimination on the
basis of residence. Several judges mentioned
or alluded to the idea that certain
'natural concomitants' of a person's State of residence might, if used as the
basis for a distinction
from which disadvantage flowed, infringe the s 117
limitation.<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a></sup> Chief Justice Mason
explained this idea in a way that emphasised its usefulness in weeding out
intentional, but disguised, preferencing
of in-State
residents.<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a></sup> For Brennan J, the
idea of natural concomitants of State residence seemed also to contemplate
unintended disadvantage suffered by
out-of-State residents through the practical
operation of a State law.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a></sup> On
either understanding of the concept, it seems destined to take judges out of the
realm of legalistic analysis, necessitating assessments
of the broader social
and economic realities against which laws have their impact.<b> </b>It is not
surprising, then, that the current High Court, with its well-established
majority preference for the avoidance of such assessments,
would say nothing
about 'natural concomitants' in the course of its analysis in <i>Sweedman</i>.
</p>
<p>The High Court's silence on the potential for this kind of reasoning is made
all the more conspicuous by the fact that such analysis
was undertaken carefully
and at length in the Court of Appeal below. There, the leading judgment of
Nettle JA considered carefully
the argument that garaging, and thus registering,
one's vehicle in Victoria is a natural concomitant of Victorian residence. He
noted
that under the Victorian Act 'a vehicle cannot or at least should not be
registered unless it is ordinarily garaged in
Victoria'.<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a></sup> This, when combined
with 'the reality of car ownership' that people ordinarily garage their cars at
or near their homes, led Nettle
JA to conclude that the place of vehicle
registration is indeed a natural concomitant of State residence. Accordingly,
the former
could be bundled with the latter for purposes of s 117
analysis.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></sup> On this footing Nettle
JA found prima facie discrimination in s 104(1) of the Victorian Act and
proceeded to the next stage of s
117
analysis.<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[63]</a></sup></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading113"></a><b>The preferred balancing modality &#8212; continuing
uncertainty</b></h3>
<p>By 'next stage' I am of course referring to the question of whether
disadvantageous treatment of out-of-State residents is excusable
on some basis,
an aspect of s 117 analysis that was sidestepped in the <i>Sweedman </i>joint
judgment. In <i>Street </i>there had been unanimous agreement that not all
disadvantages referable to out-of-State residence will infringe the s 117
prohibition.
While all judgments in <i>Street</i> envisaged some process of
balancing the protection for out-of-State residents against competing
considerations, they proposed divergent
principles and tests for taking this
qualification forward. <i>Sweedman</i> presented the High Court with a long
awaited opportunity to consolidate, or at least express some preference among,
these tests and
principles. Disappointingly, though, the entire issue was ducked
in the joint judgment, meaning that the long-standing uncertainty
continues.</p>
<p>The approaches to balancing taken in <i>Street </i>are conventionally thought
to fall into two main camps. Most judges saw the limits of s 117's reach as best
administered by making
the prohibition explicitly defeasible. That is, after
forming a preliminary view that an impugned law did indeed generate disadvantage
for some, which was in substance referable to their State of residence, these
judges would then ask a separate, supervening, question.
That question, in
essence, would be whether the different treatment could be justified by
reference to legitimate State policy goals,
reflecting the State's special
responsibilities to its own
citizens.<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[64]</a></sup><b> </b>Justice
Gaudron, and perhaps also Deane J, favoured a more holistic view. They saw any
relevant policy considerations as factors going
to the very existence of
discrimination, which was defined as different treatment <i>without</i> adequate
justification.<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[65]</a></sup><b> </b>In the
subsequent case of <i>Goryl</i> Dawson and Toohey JJ doubted that the difference
that emerged in <i>Street </i>was material or meaningful, even while offering no
explanation for this view.<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[66]</a></sup> </p>
<p><i>Sweedman </i>takes that denial a step further, by ignoring the difference
altogether. The joint judgment did not even enter into a discussion of
whether
or not the impugned distinction in the Victorian Act was justifiable. In
insisting that this distinction was not based on
or referable to a person's
State of residence, it deftly avoided engaging with questions of its
reasonableness or justifiability.
A fleeting nod to this aspect of s 117
analysis might be found in the comment that the transport accident charge,
levied under s
109 of the Victorian Act, represented the 'consideration' for the
indemnity extended to some under ss 94 and
104(1).<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[67]</a></sup> Beyond that, however,
the only reference to balancing is in the joint judgment's refusal to engage in
it. In concluding their s 117
discussion, their Honours insist:</p>
<blockquote>
It is unnecessary to consider, on the footing that there was a disability or
discrimination attributable to residence, whether this
was appropriate and
adapted (sometimes described as 'proportional') to the attainment of a proper
objective.<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[68]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Even
while denying the need for any balancing analysis, the joint judgment is here
issuing conflicting signals as to which approach
might be favoured if and when
the Court addresses the issue. On the surface, the quoted statement uses
language that seems consistent
with a preference for the layered,
defeasibility-based approach to balancing. Yet the accompanying citation is to a
case from a different
constitutional discrimination context in which the
holistic approach of Gaudron J was seemingly
endorsed.<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[69]</a></sup> </p>
<p>This elision, and non-discussion, of the distinct balancing models emerging
from <i>Street </i>stands in sharp contrast with the approach taken in the Court
of Appeal, where Nettle JA was at pains to tease out the alternatives
and apply
them systematically.<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[70]</a></sup> The High
Court's non-clarification of this aspect of its s 117 jurisprudence means that
litigants, and lower court judges, will be
forced to continue the practice
adopted by Nettle JA of considering particular problems against a string of
differently formulated
tests. Nettle JA's assured execution of this task shows
that in particular cases it may prove merely cumbersome, rather than paralysing.
Nevertheless, the States, at least, were likely hoping for some further clue as
to how the Court will approach the balancing question
in future cases. If
nothing else this might clarify precisely where within the High Court's broader
constitutional non-discrimination
jurisprudence the most useful analogies might
be found.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[71]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In any event, both of the alternative balancing modalities emerging from
<i>Street</i> clearly involve judicial evaluation of the policy objectives
underlying a State law and the reasonableness with which the law pursues
those
objectives. Hence it may not be surprising that the current Court would prefer
to say nothing than to venture unnecessarily
into this uncomfortable territory.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading129"></a><b>Identifying 'burdens': issues of onus and
materiality</b></h3>
<p>A further way in which the <i>Sweedman </i>majority seems to have curtailed
the scope of the s 117 limitation concerns its approach to identifying the
'burdens' against which
the limitation protects. Recall that the joint judgment
attached significance to what it saw as the 'practical reality' of the suggested
burden flowing from s 104(1) of the Victorian Act. Their Honours noted that 'it
was not asserted that [the appellant] had any direct
personal financial interest
in the outcome of the case' and that her third-party insurer was evidently the
bearer of any discriminatory
burden flowing from s
104(1).<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[72]</a></sup><b> </b></p>
<p>The significance of this is of course that third party insurers are not
'subjects of the Queen' and so do not enjoy the personal immunity
conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
117</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. However, even if the appellant did not
specifically advance the point, some degree of personal burden might
nevertheless be deduced.
Justice Callinan pointed out several bases for thinking
that the appellant and other insured persons in her situation would not
necessarily
emerge from a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s104.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 104(1)</a> indemnity action unscathed. These included:
potential damage to a person's reputation in being named as defendant,
especially where
adverse judgment is entered; exposure to the stress and
inconvenience of being called to give evidence interstate; and, more
specifically
here, provision in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">NSW Act</a> for insurers to claim a $500 excess
from policy holders found to be 'at
fault'.<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>Any of these burdens, if not equally felt by persons enjoying indemnity under
s 104(1) of the Victorian Act, could be viewed as a
potential trigger for
State residence discrimination analysis. And while a burden like exposure to the
$500 excess might not be self-evident,
such that the onus of pleading it would
fairly rest with the appellant, other potential burdens relating to reputation,
inconvenience,
and such like might seem much more self-evident. Yet the
<i>Sweedman </i>joint judgment seems to imply that a litigant seeking to engage
s 117 must specifically plead each potential burden, irrespective
of how
self-evident it seems &#8212; a potentially important procedural pointer that
the joint judgment does not go out of its way
to underline. </p>
<p>Issues of materiality also arise when considering what kinds of factors are
potential 'burdens' for s 117 purposes. In <i>Sweedman</i>, if the majority
judges did give any thought to the potential 'burdens' relating to reputation,
inconvenience, and such like these
evidently did not reach whatever threshold of
materiality those judges had in mind. Some advertence to this issue in the joint
judgment
would have been helpful. The kinds of imposition that will be
sufficient to amount to a 'burden' &#8212; where such burdens are a
precondition
for any finding of discrimination &#8212; is an important issue of principle
bearing on the scope of the s 117 limitation,
and on which the Court's views are
not yet known.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading136"></a><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h2>
<p>Given the Gleeson High Court's evident discomfort with the review of
legislative policy determinations, we should not be surprised
to see the Court
baulking at the implications of any truly substantive analysis in
<i>Sweedman</i>. Such analysis would have involved passing judgement on the
fairness of the entire system of motor vehicle accident compensation
in
Australia and its State-based
nature.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[74]</a></sup> Some minds, including
some members of the current High Court, would view such determinations as being
beyond the High Court's competence
and legitimate institutional bounds. Yet much
of the reasoning in <i>Street </i>seemed to envisage policy questions of that
breadth and magnitude being susceptible to review against the s 117 limitation.
Indeed,
the judgments in <i>Street</i><b> </b>seemed to be in basic agreement
that s 117 was included in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> <i>precisely to</i> provide
an outlet for resolving tensions and collisions between the
<i>Constitution's</i> 'national unity' objectives and the expectation of some
necessary State autonomy.<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[75]</a></sup> But
while the Mason High Court might have been comfortable in the role of candid
contributor to broad policy debates, the current
Court has generally preferred
to avoid such engagement.<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[76]</a></sup>
<i>Sweedman</i>, on the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> issue,<i> </i>is entirely consistent with that
trend.</p>
<p>The focus in the joint judgment on isolating a law's 'discrimen' is
characteristically legalistic. It reflects a thin understanding
of the
'substance' that is supposedly <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117's</a> concern, enabling the Court to sidestep
the serious evaluation of suggested rationales for allowing particular State
laws to have
a different impact on locals and outsiders. The reinterpretation of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> in <i>Street </i>was intended to throw off the shackles of a legalistic
view of discrimination, with most of the judgments committing to a substantive
<i>conception</i> of discrimination, not just a substance-focused test. The
reasoning in <i>Sweedman</i> seems a significant retreat from that commitment,
with the potential to leave <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> much depleted as an effective check on State
parochialism.                      </p>

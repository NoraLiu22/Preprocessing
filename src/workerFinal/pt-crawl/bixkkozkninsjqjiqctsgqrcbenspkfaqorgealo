        <strong>Abstract</strong> Despite a number of advances in method in recent 
        years, biogeography remains a field with a poorly developed philosophical 
        core. As a result, its historical and ecological sides remain as isolated 
        from one another as ever. In this essay I argue that a more unified approach 
        to biogeographic studies will become possible only when workers realise 
        that it is necessary to reject absolute space, "geography as handmaiden" 
        approaches to distribution problems in favour of structuralist models 
        compatible with both probabilistic spatial interaction and deterministic 
        phylogenetic kinds of thinking. Pros and cons of regionalist, vicariance, 
        and panbiogeographic approaches are weighed in this regard; it is shown 
        that the primary objections of the latter schools to the approach of the 
        former are vitiated when one dwells on second-order, rather than first-order, 
        interpretations of regional faunal structure. This approach makes it possible 
        to construct joint taxonomic/spatial models conducive to pattern analysis; 
        the latter permits the genesis of hypotheses that can be tested through 
        independently conceived theories of process (such as vicariance). An example 
        of the kind of pattern study envisioned, involving generalised track depiction, 
        is briefly described. A suggested cycle of research is thus laid out in 
        which systematic revision becomes a function of a joint "natural" spatial 
        and phylogenetic/historical approach to the subject.</font></p>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this essay I should like to make a plea 
        that one would not think necessary: to return the "geography" to (historical) 
        biogeography. Between geographers and historical biogeographers there 
        has been relatively little communication and, like Stoddart (1985), I 
        consider this a problem. By far the majority of those publishing work 
        with biogeographical themes are biologists. Most biology-trained biogeographers 
        appear to have little or no familiarity with the theoretical, philosophical, 
        and methodological literature of geography; this, at least, seems to be 
        the only conclusion that can be drawn from the almost total absence of 
        referral to such in their papers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographers themselves are notorious "borrowers" 
        of philosophy and theory from other fields, of course, but their applications 
        and extensions of such are distinguished by the necessity of having to 
        deal with the "how's"--not just "what's"--of very complex and explicitly 
        spatial contexts. The overtly "open" nature of geographical systems has 
        forced those who study related matters to specialise in the development 
        and use of analytical techniques linking causal processes to spatial structure, 
        and I feel it is time that biology-trained biogeographers became more 
        conscious of these; and even more so, the philosophical rationale for 
        their application.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest my arguments here be cast aside a priori 
        as the irrelevant musings of a non-biologist, I should point out that 
        there is some historical precedent for believing that biologists should 
        give continuing attention to what might be called, for want of existing 
        terminology, the "structural geography" of their subject. The two most 
        important conceptual breakthroughs in the history of biogeography--those 
        fashioned by Wallace and Croizat--consisted of new interpretations of 
        the meaning of aggregate patterns of distribution, and this can hardly 
        be viewed as other than a distinctly geographical matter.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace is not generally recognised as a geographer 
        (even, in fact, by geographers); elsewhere (Smith 1984a, unpubl. data), 
        however, I have made what I feel is a strong argument that he was, in 
        effect <font color="990000">[[p. 774]]</font> a geographer "with a consuming 
        interest in the subject of evolution." As Fichman (1977) has shown, the 
        faunal regions model he adopted strongly contributed to his overall evolutionary 
        position: it provided a structure complementing his understanding of the 
        relation of dispersal to biological change. Others (Brooks 1984; Browne 
        1983; McKinney 1972; Smith unpubl. data) have pointed out, moreover, that 
        Wallace's views on species divergence and the theory of natural selection 
        in general were closely tied to his interest in distribution-related matters.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[It perhaps should be emphasised at this point 
        that Wallace did not fail "to recognise the fundamentals of biological 
        classification"--as Nelson (1983, p. 489) has, by inference, accused. 
        Wallace was no idle theoriser, being one of history's most productive 
        field collectors, and the author of over 500 pages of systematic revisions 
        (mostly of birds and insects). He wrote a fair amount on the theory of 
        systematics as well, and a lot of what he had to say has a surprisingly 
        modern feel (see, for example, Wallace 1856, 1863, 1864, 1874).]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Croizat, though primarily a biologist, also had 
        a consuming interest in both distribution patterns per se and the geographical/ecological 
        conditions contributing to these. Though he is sometimes viewed as an 
        "anti-dispersalist," it is closer to the truth that his studies focused 
        on exposing the <em>limitations</em> of dispersal as an explanatory vehicle. 
        This paved the way, via Hennig's work (especially Hennig 1950, 1966), 
        for the emergence of modern vicariance theory. Croizat's own synthesis, 
        "panbiogeography", is notable for its rejection of a "standard-based" 
        regional structuralism (i.e., the approach of Wallace and his followers) 
        and promotion of a position emphasising taxon-specific trends of spatial 
        affinity (i.e., the "generalised track" notion, which is usually logically 
        extended to the study of inter-taxon trends as well).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what follows I suggest that a "structural 
        geography" approach--though not the one specifically adopted and promoted 
        by Wallace--remains the most profitable starting point for historical 
        biogeographic analysis. At the same time, I reject Wallace's dispersalism-dominated 
        understanding of the evolution of present patterns of distribution, preferring 
        Croizat's more adaptable "panbiogeography", which better lends its way 
        to an integration of the role of vicariance. I hope to show, however, 
        that the two approaches are not nearly so different as is now imagined, 
        partly because Wallace's structural framework can be restated in more 
        "natural" terms, and partly because many biologists have mistakenly (or 
        tacitly) assumed that vicariant speciation events--quite possibly the 
        primary immediate cause of distribution patterns--are synonymous with 
        the process of evolution in general. As a result, I will also reject the 
        attempts by panbiogeographers and vicariance biogeographers to make the 
        "tree-thinking" of phylogeny-centred models the point of departure for 
        spatial studies of evolution. Rather, I submit, it is more profitable 
        to pursue taxon-level spatial analysis through: (1) an explicit consideration 
        of the second-order characteristics of the overall distribution patterns 
        of the group under study, followed by; (2) tests of theory suggested by 
        such.</p>
      <p><strong>A GEOGRAPHER'S CRITICISM OF (HISTORICAL) BIOGEOGRAPHY AS A "BIOLOGICAL" 
        STUDY</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a well-known paper, Gould &amp; Lewontin (1979) 
        produced a critique of the work of biologists who accept an "adaptations/adaptation" 
        view of the nature of evolution by natural selection. I accept the majority 
        of that discussion, which amounts to a plea that evolutionists not abandon 
        structuralist interpretations of change linked to the "Bauplan" concept. 
        Perhaps, however, the structural controls on evolution are to be more 
        easily identified in facets of environmental organisation than in the 
        individual lineages that trace their way through time as elements of the 
        latter. This reasoning emerges from studies I have been carrying out in 
        an attempt to realise a more internally consistent model of biological 
        change than that offered by selectionist concepts.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere (Smith 1984b, 1986c) I have worked 
        out a theory of evolutionary change that focuses on the manner of turnover 
        of resources vital to organismal existence; this, in contrast with models 
        dwelling on organismal unit-level concepts such as "natural selection" 
        and "competition" (nonetheless, characteristics of the latter processes 
        are deducible from the process outlined in the model). To summarise a 
        very long argument in a few words, I have suggested that range <em>change</em> 
        can be viewed as a function of geographic variation in the characteristics 
        of regularity in availability of, and optimality in level of, certain 
        resources--especially water--vital to all life forms. The critical concept 
        is that populations should probabilistically tend to extend toward areas 
        where conditions are more optimum in the above sense, selecting into existence 
        whatever new adaptive characteristics that "will <font color="990000">[[p. 
        775]]</font> work" as they do. Adaptation is thereby conceived as a correlative 
        process of "keeping up with" the changes in spatial interaction implicit 
        in organism-environment relations; i.e., an organism's adaptive suite 
        may be considered a direct expression of all the interactions (and in 
        turn morphological/physiological/behavioural adjustments) it must enter 
        into to remain "at the right place at the right time", <em>all the time</em>, 
        to collect/process all resources necessary to its existence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this starting point, a wide range of processes 
        leading to observable characteristics of organismal distribution can be 
        deduced; moreover, the perspective yields a fundamental criticism of "adaptation"-based 
        thinking: the historical sequence of species divergence--and associated 
        trends of adaptive change--define a conceptually different realisation 
        of structure than does evolution in general. With respect to any given 
        group (or all groups at once), the first process consists of an idiosyncratic 
        response to environmental conditions yielding adaptive suites that mediate 
        an ongoing ecological process of entropy maximisation. Adaptations are 
        a resulting product of evolution but not, in the first instance, a <em>cause</em> 
        of same. The character of a population's gene pool <em>does</em>, of course, 
        constrain the range of possible further change <em>in that lineage</em> 
        (in the sense of Wiley &amp; Brooks 1982, 1986), but this restriction 
        can be viewed as incidental to the evolutionary process as a whole, which 
        more generally revolves around the creation of increasingly complex and 
        efficient forms of interaction <em>among</em> organisms and their environment.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This construction completely resolves the "adaptation-process/adaptation-structure" 
        dilemma stated by Lewontin (1984, pp. 237-238) as: "the process is <em>adaptation</em> 
        and the end result is the state of being <em>adapted</em> . . . the problem 
        is how species can be at all times both adapting and adapted." An organism 
        can at one time be both "adapted" and "adapting" because <em>both</em> 
        terms describe an ongoing process of change that can only be understood 
        in terms of interactions <em>between</em> things. Strictly speaking, it 
        is the conditions of interaction that "evolve", not the individual components 
        that mediate this interaction. Thus, adaptations are epiphenomenal, reflecting 
        (cryptic) standing relationships more than discrete structures. Viewed 
        in this fashion, they constitute, <em>in sum</em>, mediators of an ongoing, 
        probabilistically-realised resolution of environmental equilibrium.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This understanding leads to the conclusion that 
        species populations should tend to expand or contract in <em>common</em> 
        directions, though at <em>rates</em> peculiar to each (i.e., depending 
        on the flexibility of the gene pool of each; for evidence, see Smith 1984b). 
        This is significant for the possibilities it raises vis-a-vis normative 
        forms of study: when the "individualistic hypothesis" is demonstrated 
        in this fashion to be wholly fallacious (see Smith 1986c for discussion), 
        distribution ranges can be treated as logically equivalent units of information, 
        and their pattern of combination/correlation opened to probabilism-based 
        interpretations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above concepts are related to the "Bauplan" 
        matter as follows. As just suggested, what should most properly be considered 
        as evolving on the surface of the earth is the surface of the earth--a 
        complex pattern of spatial interaction <em>among</em> organisms and their 
        environment (a concept not far removed from Croizat's definition of panbiogeography). 
        This leads to the idea that none of the related concepts of divergence, 
        adaptation, speciation, or specialisation represents a process that can, 
        without introducing considerable illogic, be reasonably synonymised with 
        the term "evolution". The four processes just listed are in effect evolutionarily 
        neutral: any individual that comes into being eventually meets a finite 
        end (whether through replacement, as in cells; death, as in individual 
        organisms; extinction, as in populations, etc.). Existence in the form 
        of populations, for example, is best interpreted as a response to ambient 
        conditions that are prior; i.e., as a vehicle supporting a negative feedback 
        loop that <em>restores</em> the equilibrium the overall system loses when 
        species entities change range and must enter into new associations. As 
        I interpret things, evolution per se is assured, as already suggested, 
        by the tendency of populations to disperse toward less stressful environments 
        (this (1) reduces the degree of specialisation required to exist, because 
        the organism's energy budget can be apportioned to less stressful demands 
        of "being in the right place. . ." type, and (2) eventually produces increasingly 
        flexible and permanently appropriate populations whose interactions support 
        a steady state resource turnover cycle--see discussion in Smith 1984b, 
        1986c). The point to be taken is that we would be better off looking for 
        the causal basis of a "Bauplan" at the environmental--biogeographical--level 
        than through examinations of secondary responses to the same (i.e., adaptive 
        morphology and behaviour) that permit little in the way of generalisation 
        (or even recognition, given the compounding difficulties of the idiosyncratic 
        nature and usual obscurity of the effects themselves).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 776]]</font> Organisms 
        exist under probabilistic conditions of association with their environment 
        (again, including other organisms). Although it is undoubtedly true that 
        individual lineages represent stores of information (in the Wiley &amp; 
        Brooks sense, for example), such stores are little more than programmes 
        for operation within a pre-existing setting. Though such programmes vary 
        from taxon to taxon, their operation within their environment is maintained 
        through probabilistic, not deterministic, interactions. Persistence as 
        an element of an enveloping larger system is <em>entirely</em> a matter 
        of information exchange. An organism is from top to bottom an open system; 
        when it dies the locus of temporary storage it represented disappears, 
        but is recapitulated <em>both</em> in its progeny and changes it effected 
        in the composite nature of its environment (through its physical rearrangement 
        of the "actors" contributing to the spatial interaction framework underlying 
        the latter). It is in fact the patterns of interaction that maintain an 
        "evolutionary progression": individual organisms (and populations thereof) 
        may come and go, but such patterns must remain relatively constant or 
        it will not be possible for any given individual that is born to fit into 
        them. This brings us to a point of central importance to Bauplan-related 
        investigations, the fact that the spatial interaction structure at the 
        surface of the earth persists within a spatially-discrete domain, whereas 
        the domain of adaptation is for all practical purposes unbounded.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that high on the list of priorities 
        for biogeographical study should be a continuing search for normative 
        studies-promoting frameworks. In this respect, an emphasis on spatial 
        analytical concepts rather than character trait studies seems clearly 
        preferable (speaking conceptually now, rather than methodologically, as 
        will become clearer from later comment). The reason for this is fairly 
        straightforward: spatial structure is more conducive to internally consistent 
        forms of numerical measurement than are tree structures. I have already 
        introduced the idea that it is possible to generalise on the meaning of 
        pattern, on the basis of the understanding that organisms tend to change 
        range in common directions. Beyond this, there is something even more 
        fundamental: range change takes place within a domain that is absolutely 
        delimited. That is, the logical complement to knowing where a population 
        is found (in the sense of range) is knowing where it is not found, and 
        vice versa. Presence/absence is a determinate and complementary condition 
        spatially, and can be assigned relative probabilities on this basis. This 
        is not true, of course, in the instance of character traits.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I grant that it is possible to understand 
        characters as reflecting either an ongoing process of probabilistic interaction 
        with environment or a causally determinate, historically-generated, sequence 
        of relation to other groups of organisms (i.e., through patterns of common 
        divergence). In the former instance, however, they are conceived as <em>part 
        of the environment</em>; i.e., they function as loci through which information 
        is exchanged, not stored. (Of course, storage does eventually take place 
        via differential reproductive success/selection, etc., but this, as I 
        am arguing, is a derivative, correlative process.) This primary function 
        of adaptations is ignored when the populations they "reside within" are 
        mapped onto a conceptually separate space and then treated as related 
        to one another deterministically through some historical series of divergence. 
        This is a classic example of application of an understanding that geographers 
        have been fighting for many years: the "absolute space" notion of causality. 
        Restricting "geography" and the "pattern of divergence" to conceptually 
        different spaces leads us directly to the brink of environmental determinism; 
        whenever we create artificially distinct spaces to sponsor single process 
        understandings we are looking for trouble. Relaxing the constraints of 
        reality in this fashion makes it all too easy to find what one wishes 
        to find; although historical biology is not prone to the kinds of ethical 
        lapses in application of theory the social sciences are in this regard, 
        there is still the problem of thinking that the deterministic sequences 
        of relation established, reflect an overall process of change reducible 
        to such terms. Moreover, there is the difficulty that such formulations 
        represent narratives often not amenable to test.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, on the other hand, we allow our mappings 
        of related populations to conceptually represent adaptive suites that 
        mediate an environmental function, contexts for normative forms of study 
        can be established. First, a <em>single</em> space is conceived, not distinct 
        entities. Second, as spatial interaction can be interpreted: (1) as rates 
        of change/process independent of the mediating structures, and (2) as 
        a process that is fundamentally probabilistic in its enaction; it provides 
        an internally consistent framework within which statistics-based methods 
        can be used to isolate significant patterns of interaction. Further, the 
        properties of interaction can be related to known sampling distributions, 
        as the domain of interaction has explicit boundaries.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another work (Smith 1984b) I have shown how 
        deterministic pattern analysis methods can expose statistically significant 
        trends of relation <font color="990000">[[p. 777]]</font> between range 
        change and a posed environmental driving mechanism (note the deliberate 
        use of the term "driving" rather than "determining"). Beyond such tests, 
        there is also the possibility of simulation. On the assumption that range 
        change events are probabilistically "driven" in preferred directions (as 
        earlier described) toward more optimal environmental conditions, a diffusion 
        process of range change (or pattern/rate of adaptive change) upon environment 
        can be imagined. Thus, the study of spatial interaction can be reduced 
        to purely spatial terms (involving prior assumptions/hypotheses about 
        common directions--but differing rates--of diffusion among populations, 
        the particular topological characteristics of the environmental "optimality 
        surface" operating, etc.).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the above spatial conceptualisation 
        of organic change does not directly characterise a "biogeography Bauplan", 
        it suggests directions for further study. First, as a result of the bounded 
        domain of the surface involved, the logical implication of operation of 
        the mechanism is increasingly ordered interrelations, both among populations 
        and between life and the inorganic sector of the environment. As I have 
        discussed elsewhere (Smith 1984b), it may be possible to understand larger 
        scale/longer term trends of biogeographic change on this basis.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the above, however, the fact that spatial 
        interaction frameworks are measurable and referable to normative contexts 
        can be exploited to provide methodological approaches that may be appropriate 
        in a manner independent of scale of application. Later I will address 
        this matter more directly; note, moreover, that it can be linked to arguments 
        (which I will not expand on here: see Smith 1986a, b) that there actually 
        may exist a controlling "biogeographical Bauplan" whose overt spatial 
        expression is regional organisation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the preceding aside, let us briefly consider 
        how the "speciation/organism" based schools of historical biogeography 
        fall short of promoting spatially realistic biogeography interpretations. 
        The oldest school, adhering to a regions-structured, dispersal-regulated 
        interpretation, was popularised by Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace considered 
        the six-region classification system he adopted a "natural" one to the 
        extent that it efficiently summarised what appeared to be a well-differentiated 
        and general distributional response to underlying causal mechanisms. Nonetheless, 
        in a number of respects it represents something less than the tag "natural" 
        ought to reflect. To begin with, he never produced better than a correlative--history-based--understanding 
        of these assumed mechanisms. Wallace adopted Sclater's (1858) original 
        plan, which dealt with the distribution of birds. Finding it a satisfactory 
        summary for the distribution patterns of mammals (which he considered 
        the "model" group zoogeographically) he also concluded, as a package, 
        that present distribution patterns were a function of dispersal and more 
        or less permanently-located continental masses (Wallace 1877; Fichman 
        1977). But speciation has occurred at different rates in various times 
        and places in various groups, and any attempt to create a general system 
        based on any individual group is illogical, even if one accepts the "permanence" 
        model (which itself, of course, turns out to be wrong). Moreover, the 
        choice of six regions is very arbitrary; why not five, or seven, or whatever? 
        Further, on what basis is each unit understood to be distinct? Unless 
        it can be shown that all regions as established are of equal (structural) 
        rank, of what use are they to comparative studies? From the point of view 
        of spatial analysis, all these problems are highly relevant, because the 
        use of probabilism-based methods assumes (as does, in effect, any kind 
        of statistical analysis) the general equivalence and "naturalness" of 
        the units under study.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the spatial systematics difficulties, 
        moreover, there is the significant problem that Wallace's system is based 
        on the concept that evolution proceeds principally through divergence 
        following episodes of dispersal, a point of view that is now disputed. 
        Further, world regional entities can only reasonably be recognised through 
        the study of taxonomic units above the level of species populations. As 
        should be apparent, I have no difficulty with the idea that evolution 
        is primarily a function of dispersal; diversification per se, on the other 
        hand, is quite another matter. Clearly, the ability of populations to 
        expand range geographically is the fundamental spatial aspect of evolutionary 
        change. Vicariance notwithstanding, we must initially get a population 
        to a given location before any succeeding processes can operate. To ignore 
        this idea is to ignore some rather fundamental things about the way a 
        divergence-based process can operate in an actual spatial context. On 
        the other hand, analysis of above-species-level patterns may obscure exactly 
        what <em>does</em> happen once a population "gets there". Certainly, at 
        the least the scale of inquiry is shifted from one in which immediate 
        affinities (spatially, temporally, and phyletically, in a common origins 
        sense) are emphasised to one in which more distant ones are.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 778]]</font> There 
        is finally the matter of the "natural" status of above-species level taxa 
        and the implications of such for spatial classification. It seems to be 
        just as difficult to argue that there is some set number of, for example, 
        families, as it is to provide parallel rationale for a set number of regions. 
        Implicit in this problem are the same kinds of effects on probabilism-based 
        forms of analysis as those associated with "unnaturally-defined" regional 
        units.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the work of Hennig (1950, 1966), Brundin 
        (1966), Nelson (1969), and others, the structuralist biogeography of Wallace 
        and followers was challenged and a new set of investigative methods introduced. 
        The underlying concept, cladistics, provides a closely reasoned basis 
        for the analytical retrieval of affinities (i.e., pattern of divergence) 
        within a group of closely related populations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rigor of the concept, however, makes it difficult 
        to apply to classification per se: any conditions of parallel evolution 
        of traits subsequent to divergence are viewed as historically idiosyncratic, 
        "unnatural", and no basis for grouping in a classificatory sense. This 
        reasoning is in effect extended to the spatial arena; as a result, the 
        biogeographical extrapolation of cladistics theory, vicariance analysis, 
        consists, as mentioned earlier, of a literal projection of the history 
        of the divergence patterns of the group under study onto a separately 
        conceived, "geographic", space.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the logical elegance of the cladistics 
        concept and the apparent straightforward and parallel way it can be applied 
        to historical studies, it represents a highly biased starting point for 
        biogeographic investigations in general. Vicariance philosophy is utterly 
        incapable of recognising the productive and functional role that spatial 
        expansion processes have, including the formation of range conditions 
        that make species divisions possible to begin with. Dispersal-based interactions 
        are implicitly treated as instances in which "evolution has not taken 
        place"; this, because it appears that many or most speciation episodes 
        can be linked to intervening climatological and/or geological events which 
        separate populations. But as I have suggested here and elsewhere (Smith 
        1984b, 1986c), evolution should not be considered a process synonymous 
        with species divergence. Limited-ranging, highly specialised forms are 
        (evolutionary) structure maintainers rather than structure innovators.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another work (Smith unpubl. data) I have extended 
        this argument to the point of showing how vicariant speciation can produce 
        <em>a return toward equilibrium</em> when considered in spatial terms. 
        In that study, which principally revolves around how to statistically 
        expose generalised track relations, I show that a continuation from simple 
        disjunct range patterns within a species to an outcome in which two new 
        species are formed, results in a <em>reduction</em> in the overall statistical 
        significance of the "track" connecting the locations involved. This finding 
        is consistent with the earlier discussed idea that adaptive change per 
        se is not evolutionary change; unless one argues that evolution can logically 
        be interpreted as leading to generally lower levels of organisation (negentropy), 
        it is difficult to view the spatial response indicated as falling within 
        the class of deviation-amplifying processes, per Maruyama (1963). Maruyama 
        (1963, p. 174) has also commented that when "the rules [of system evolution] 
        are unknown, the amounts of information needed to discover the rules is 
        much greater than the amount of information needed to describe the rules. 
        This means that there is much more waste, in terms of the amount of information, 
        in tracing the process backwards than in tracing it forward . . .", and 
        in the philosophy posed by vicariance biogeographers one can recognise 
        an instance in which this warning has gone unheeded.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panbiogeography as a concept emerged earlier 
        than did the vicariance biogeography school, originating with the studies 
        of Leon Croizat. Although Croizat's work has been cited as instrumental 
        in the development of the vicariance perspective (e.g., Nelson 1978), 
        Croizat himself was careful to point out (for example, Croizat 1981) that 
        the concepts were quite distinct. Panbiogeography has become popular as 
        a method of study only in recent years, quite possibly as a function of 
        an increasing recognition that he was quite right in this assessment. 
        Conceptually, panbiogeography is flexible enough to allow that both dispersal 
        and vicariance processes contribute to the production of distribution 
        patterns; the main unifying element is the notion of the "generalised 
        track", an observable trend of organismal affinities between geographically-separated 
        locations which might be a function of the operation of either. With this 
        core concept panbiogeography is distinctly more "geographic" in its approach 
        than vicariance biogeography is: in theory, at least, it permits the adoption 
        of relativistic analytical frameworks. Unfortunately, its practitioners 
        also reject structuralist ("regionalist") interpretations of organismal 
        geography, preferring the "absolute space" thinking of cladists as their 
        base for unraveling spatial affinities (i.e., tracks). Craw (1988) has 
        tried to associate geographers' "relative <font color="990000">[[p. 779]]</font> 
        space" concept with the approach employed by cladists, but makes the fundamental 
        error of failing to understand that the relative space concept is more 
        properly defined in terms of real world interactions, not logical relations 
        alone (as is the case in cladistics). This is a critical distinction; 
        the geographer's primary chore, in fact, consists of assessing the degree 
        to which the simplistic assumptions of closure implicit in aspatial logic 
        fail to meet the reality of spatial organisation. (It should be no surprise 
        that the fields of geography and psychology--which are, respectively, 
        the most and least oriented toward study of "real world" spatial relationships--are 
        afflicted, in turn, with the respective problems of having too little 
        and too much independently standing theory. The constraints on existing 
        as a three-dimensional reality are very strong). Cladistics (or panbiogeography, 
        if it follows the lead of cladistics) cannot, even in principle, describe 
        a geographically "relative space" until the objects of its analysis are 
        re-defined into natural spatial terms; i.e., as a framework of spatially-induced 
        probabilistic interactions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the above complaints, I believe 
        that the three major competing schools of historical biogeography feature 
        the following <em>positive</em> characteristics vital to the success of 
        any synthesis of systematics based on compatible (natural) deterministic 
        phylogenetic principles and (natural) probabilistic spatial interaction 
        principles. Regionalisation approach/es (i.e., not necessarily Wallace's 
        particular model) provide a basis for summarising in least biased fashion 
        the <em>overall</em> process of evolution (as viewed biogeographically), 
        and by virtue of their resting on interrelatable units are the best suited 
        for the study of the spatial interaction process underlying the structure 
        of these. The vicariance/cladistics-based approach rests on principles 
        ensuring a sound basis for phylogenetic reconstruction and, therefore, 
        classification (see later discussion); moreover, it provides one equally 
        sound basis for testing/verifying hypotheses erected through the assessment 
        of spatial interaction patterns (but not the reverse, as is now the way 
        the matter is treated). Panbiogeography contributes a generalisable spatial 
        focus for investigations of microprocess: situation-specific trends of 
        spatial affinity within and/or across taxa, relatable to a variety of 
        causal mechanisms.</p>
      <p><strong>Spatial-aspatial structuralism in biogeography</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though some might resist the notion a priori, 
        I believe it is possible to harmonise the three main schools of historical 
        biogeography in a fashion that respects the most desirable features of 
        each of them individually. The key innovation involves the establishment 
        of a <em>second-order</em> spatial analysis approach to distribution patterns 
        that: (1) rests on structures specific to each monophyletic grouping of 
        taxa, and (2) contributes to classification by producing feedback that 
        introduces spatial criteria into the systematic revision process.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way to explain the approach I have 
        in mind is to start with a description of the kind of interim results 
        it produces. Let us first imagine we are handed a "natural" reconstruction 
        of affinities within some monophyletic group. Our cladogram may actually 
        be at any level of taxonomic organisation (see later discussion); for 
        the present we will allow our base taxonomic unit to be the species. The 
        geographic ranges of all species involved are mapped and the sum spatial 
        domain of the group sampled; the "faunas" of each cell are then grouped 
        into a spatial classification (preferably through the use of a non-hierarchical 
        clustering algorithm, as these are better suited for this kind of partition 
        problem). The result will be a first-order structure consisting of some 
        limited number of spatial, "regional" units.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This descriptive device yields results that to 
        one extent or another inherently reflect both the historical and ecological 
        associations of the taxonomic units under study. Unless the underlying 
        data are poor, moreover, the product represents a set of spatial units 
        that are structurally very nearly (or absolutely) equivalent, rank-wise. 
        It is little understood that the "non-equivalence" of regional units problem 
        is, and has been all along, a pseudo-problem--a red herring. The criteria 
        for rank assessment are quite different in spatial and aspatial contexts. 
        Equivalence of rank in the spatial sense is a matter related to persisting 
        <em>balance</em> of function, not <em>equivalence</em> of function. Persisting, 
        "natural" structure may very well exist as a product of the sum of relations 
        among non-equally unique subsystems; under such conditions the system 
        is likely to be in a state of disequilibrium, but it seems pointless to 
        argue that this means any given subsystem within it is more or less necessary 
        to its overall coherence. First-order measures of relations between structural 
        units tell us relatively little about the latter's "naturalness" as a 
        group, because they are insensitive to the trade-off between structure 
        and function. Before any progress can be made regarding the question of 
        naturalness, the <em>assumption</em> of structural equality must be raised 
        as a null hypothesis through some kind of entropy maximisation operation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 780]]</font> Wilson 
        (1970) showed how it is possible to standardise the flows (specifically, 
        commuter trips) among a set of source locations (in his case, a regional 
        assemblage of towns and cities) in such a manner as to cancel out the 
        effects of first-order system description induced by varying <em>magnitude</em> 
        of flow (i.e., differing city populations). The operation involved, entropy 
        maximisation, establishes a most-probable-state reformulation of within-system 
        interaction. I have applied this approach to the study of biogeographical 
        units (Smith 1983a, b), in the second work suggesting one way to test 
        for functional rank equality (for another; see Smith 1986a, b; entropy 
        maximisation procedures make possible the erection of the null hypothesis 
        of structural/functional equality of units only--associated tests must 
        rely on the introduction of additional assumptions).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the reliability of the spatial structure 
        has been established (as discussed in Smith 1986a, unpubl. data), a second-order 
        approach to regional faunal characterisation can be applied. Second-order 
        statistics are probably best known for their contribution to nearest-neighbour 
        analysis methods; my innovation has been to extend the concept in a fashion 
        useful to the description of complex (overlapping) range patterns. These 
        descriptive statistics can be used to very efficiently reconstruct the 
        varying conditions of uniqueness exhibited by each fauna (Smith 1983b, 
        c, unpubl. data). In a five-region model of world mammal differentiation 
        patterns I have been working on, for example, the diversities of each 
        regional fauna can be predicted via multiple regression from the first 
        several vectors of second-order statistics (moments) describing each fauna 
        to a level of efficiency reading <em>r<sup>2</sup></em> = .996. By contrast, 
        my data for the Carnivora alone produced an analogous model yielding an 
        <em>r<sup>2</sup></em><sup></sup> value of only .952. Carnivores, on the 
        whole being adaptable generalists with large species ranges (Rapoport 
        1982), have not diversified in such a fashion as to produce well-defined 
        regional units.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next section I will show how the above 
        can be used as the basis for specific methodological approaches, but first 
        it is necessary to sketch the overall framework into which such work can 
        be placed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I feel I have satisfactorily disposed 
        of the "regional rank equivalence" problem, "organism-focused" biogeographers 
        will still complain that a resolution to the "unnaturalness" of regional 
        systemisation vis-a-vis organismal phylogeny and classification has not 
        been suggested, and perhaps cannot be. I believe, however, that it can.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of my adherence to a structuralist 
        regional approach, I fully support cladistics-based efforts at unraveling 
        phylogeny. For any effort at spatial classification to succeed, we must 
        know that the group is monophyletic. This makes it easier to argue that 
        there are logical limits to the group's spatial domain. The group need 
        not be restricted to species-level (taxonomic and spatial) units, however. 
        Recalling comments made earlier, I suggest that <em>classification</em> 
        should devolve as a function of a combined understanding of spatial patterns 
        <em>and</em> the aspatial reconstruction of phylogeny. As in the case 
        of regional rank assessments, taxonomic rank equivalence at the above-species 
        level must be viewed as a matter of function as well as affinities. There 
        is no compelling reason why family units, for example, need be "equivalent" 
        in terms of their first-order characteristics of uniqueness (including 
        their varying numbers of species). Further, it does not conflict with 
        the idea of <em>natural</em> classification to accept the existence of 
        paraphyletic family units. As I suggested in Smith (1986b), "naturalness" 
        of relation is a combined function of historical derivation and environmental 
        function. Organisms are, in the first instance, environmental units, not 
        historical ones. We are yet a long way from understanding to what degree 
        genetic differences are expressed as operationally different adaptive 
        strategies at the ecological level, and to rely on "degree of structural 
        difference" arguments as the basis for understanding the "natural" degree 
        of distinctness among populations is to subscribe to a very tenuous definition 
        of "natural". What are, relatively speaking, only minor genetic differences 
        can have profound ramifications in terms of function (consider the case 
        of <em>Pan</em> and <em>Homo</em>, for example). Not surprisingly, biochemistry- 
        and morphology-based analyses of "natural relations" often produce conflicting 
        results: spatial form can never be interpreted in wholly consistent fashion 
        in terms of selected one-to-one mappings of divergence on a prior space. 
        Taxonomic classification per se, I submit, should represent as rational 
        and accurate an accounting as possible of this trade-off between historical 
        inertia and current environmental function; as such, it should take into 
        account all kinds of information relevant to establishing systematic position.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biogeographic studies can play a major role in 
        such efforts. If one assumes a probabilistic model of the resolution of 
        genetic potential and environmental constraint/opportunity (as sketched 
        earlier, for example), the overall spatial pattern of differentiation 
        of a given group can be used as a working hypothesis</p>

      <blockquote><font size="-1"><strong>Fig. 1.</strong> A cycle of biogeographic 
        research suggested by the "natural system" concepts introduced in Smith 
        (1986a, b). The purpose of this cycle is to establish a unified kind of 
        approach to the study of the spatial and aspatial systematics of any taxon 
        under study. See text for discussion.</font></blockquote>
      <p>regarding the classification (i.e., taxonomic) status of each unit initially 
        assumed for purposes of organising range data. In Smith (1986b, unpubl. 
        data) I describe methods whereby a regionalisation of initial distribution 
        data that cannot be validated (i.e., in which the regional units determined 
        fail to meet the rank equivalence criteria making such decisions possible) 
        can be revised in such a manner as to provide feedback for taxonomic revision. 
        Lumping and splitting operations are initiated on those taxa whose status 
        is most debated until a spatial resolution of the resulting set of range 
        data is obtained that can be validated. The result is a hypothesis of 
        structure that can then be described via pattern analysis and subjected 
        to test in relation to process models. In Fig. 1, the essence of this 
        procedural cycle is represented.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cycle of analytical input described through 
        Fig. 1 has no specific beginning, but is continually self-refining. One 
        of the important implications of the philosophical framework underlying 
        it (as discussed in Smith, 1986a, b) is the concept that a "natural" taxonomic 
        resolution <em>must</em> have a parallel "natural" spatial resolution; 
        i.e., the former can always be linked to a "most-probable-state"-based 
        interpretation of <em>actual</em> spatially-extending structure. When 
        through an analysis of appropriate data this cannot be verified, both 
        aspects of the systematics model must be re-assessed and adjusted until 
        reciprocally valid. Tests of the resulting hypothesis are then constructed 
        through pattern analysis and relation to independently existing process 
        models. When the model as tested does not hold up, the implications are 
        reconsideration of its fundamental elements--especially the underlying 
        taxonomic resolution (e.g., is the group actually monophyletic?) and the 
        adequacy (generality) of the causal models that have been brought to bear 
        in its interpretation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the entire cycle described above can 
        be implemented strictly on the basis of null hypotheses revolving around 
        most-probable-state concepts. In the spatial sense, hypothesis tests are 
        grounded in <font color="990000">[[p. 782]] </font>the idea that once 
        the most-probable-state of the internal structure of the system has been 
        identified, measured deviations from this (its second-order structure) 
        can be interpreted as indicative of the presence of external (environmental/historical) 
        causal mechanisms. Otherwise put, once we have satisfactorily isolated 
        the structural components underlying first-order patterns of faunal differentiation, 
        tests may be applied on this basis to determine the extent to which the 
        second-order relations exposed fail to fall within statistically probable 
        assumptions (null hypotheses) about random patterns of interaction. Two 
        examples of such kinds of study can now be briefly described.</p>
      <p><strong>The methodological application of second-order concepts</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have described a method for the study of generalised 
        tracks in some detail in another work (Smith unpubl. data). In past years 
        the main criticism of the "generalised track" concept has been its apparent 
        resistance to statistical studies (McDowall 1978; Simberloff et al. 1981). 
        The essence of the criticism is that the non-random trends within a uniquely-defined 
        system are difficult to distinguish from conditions of randomly defined 
        association. Attempts have been made to apply randomisation methods (Simberloff 
        1978; Simberloff &amp; Connor 1979; Connor &amp; Simberloff 1983) and 
        graph theory (Craw &amp; Page 1988) to related ecological and historical 
        aspects, respectively, of the problem.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecological approaches are beyond the scope 
        of present discussion; the graph theory approach proposed by Page (1987) 
        and Craw &amp; Page (1988) seems to require a priori assumptions about 
        the relation of absolute distance to biological affinities that it would 
        be better to eliminate. It is more efficient to incorporate ideas concerning 
        these into investigative frameworks as hypotheses than as assumptions; 
        i.e., there are few such links that are of such generality as to constitute 
        laws of relation. There are, moreover, the problems of how to accommodate 
        large data sets through this approach and produce results convenient to 
        consensus studies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own treatment of the matter is based on the 
        earlier discussed strategy of determining the first-order structure (i.e., 
        regional units) of the group pattern of distribution of the taxon under 
        study, and using this as the basis for a second-order analysis through 
        which improbable conditions of spatial affinity between the faunas of 
        particular locations are identified. The method is complicated enough 
        that it cannot be described in detail here; the interested reader is referred 
        to the other work (Smith unpubl. data). The general approach involved 
        can, however, be sketched. (Note that what follows is associated largely 
        with the "model meets natural system criteria" box in Fig. 1).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a regionalisation model consistent with 
        the taxonomic data has been established, "first-order" (presence-absence) 
        similarity scores are calculated for the faunal relations between each 
        pairing of cells in the sampling grid (see Smith 1983b, unpubl. data, 
        for discussions of appropriate derivations). A pair of parallel sets of 
        second-order calculations are then performed. These scores are formulated 
        in such a manner as to represent entropy maximisations of the first-order 
        scores; i.e., a standardisation procedure is applied to the first-order 
        relations which explicitly takes into account the varying cosmopolitanism 
        of each taxonomic unit. For each cell's relations with all other cells, 
        regression models are then set up: the test hypothesis is that residuals 
        from a regression of the first-order scores on the second-order scores 
        should not be correlated with the dependent variable (i.e., if there is 
        no non-random component to the second-order influence on first-order structure). 
        Otherwise put, an attempt is made to determine whether we can reject the 
        assumption that the overall pattern of overlap of ranges can be interpreted 
        as deviating from a simple most-probable-state kind of spatial organisation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each cell is treated in this manner, and is thus 
        assigned; (1) an <em>r</em> value for each original regression, and (2) 
        a pair of <em>r</em> values for the correlations of the residuals produced 
        back on the first-order scores. Two sets of <em>r</em> values are obtained 
        in #2 above because two different sets of second-order scores are calculated 
        for each cell's affinities: one focusing on the pattern of "presences" 
        of all taxa, and an entirely complementary one focusing on "absences" 
        of same. (Recall that this is logically appropriate for binary characteristics 
        existing as part of an actual spatial domain, in contrast with the situation 
        in character analysis.) In effect, two "one-tailed" tests are thus obtained: 
        one focusing on improbable faunal relations in terms of widespread forms, 
        and one on same for forms whose ranges are more restricted. The greater 
        the violation of the assumption of independence of cases, the more substantial 
        the "preferred orientation" of other cells with respect to the base cell. 
        The complementary models may be interpreted, as a first approximation, 
        in vicariance and dispersal terms, respectively. It is often the case, 
        as might be expected, that only one of the two models exhibits significantly 
        non-random patterns of affinity. It is quite possible, <font color="990000">[[p. 
        783]]</font> however, for <em>both</em> (or neither, or course) to do 
        so. It should be emphasised that the <em>r</em> scores associated with 
        each cell's models are in every sense logically and numerically compatible 
        as measurements; this is ensured by the second-order approach employed 
        (see Smith 1983c, unpubl. data).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each set of residuals can then be assessed as 
        desired for its elements' properties of spatial autocorrelation. Regardless 
        of the overall degree of "preferred orientation", high residual values 
        will be indicative of improbable degrees of association (which may be 
        causally incidental, of course--further investigation is then necessary 
        to ensure a correct interpretation). At this point, as can be seen from 
        Fig. 1, causal hypotheses for the non-random patterns identified can be 
        entertained.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this approach, the characteristics of 
        spatial affinity between any pair of locations bearing on any given set 
        of data can be statistically investigated. Moreover, as suggested in Smith 
        (unpubl. data), new kinds of questions regarding biogeographic and evolutionary 
        dynamics can be posed and studied through it. For example, the extent 
        to which vicariance represents a general process of return toward system 
        equilibrium (i.e., the "devolution" concept commented on earlier) rather 
        than a deviation-amplifying process might be explored. (Again, it turns 
        out that vicariant events can actually <em>reduce</em> degree of violation 
        of the assumption of unconditional independence of cases). Another useful 
        feature is that trends involving very large groups are especially amenable 
        to this method; unlike phylogeny-based studies (note Simberloff 1987), 
        in fact, the more taxa, the better.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I see no reason why the same approach 
        cannot be applied to small groups, or even a single population, if the 
        focus is the geographic distribution of character traits rather than population 
        distribution per se. The concept behind the method is scale-independent; 
        there must, however, be sufficient spatial interaction implied among the 
        initial biological (i.e., taxonomic or character) units represented to 
        permit the establishment of a meaningful most-probable-state standard. 
        It should be possible to establish gene flow/variation studies within 
        a given population in directly analogous fashion to supra-species level 
        biogeographic investigations. Subspecies should partition out in a manner 
        paralleling the isolation of regional structures. "Track" investigations 
        would focus on possible causal mechanisms, whether these be climatic, 
        biological (e.g., a function of parallel evolution, commensalism/parasitism, 
        competition, etc.), environmental (protective coloration, climate, etc.), 
        or whatever. It even seems that geographic variation studies on, for example, 
        a single wide-ranging member of a large group might be used to confirm 
        parallel studies on the overall group--especially as distribution patterns 
        within the group, can be linked to varying ambient environmental influence 
        (e.g., clines).</p>
      <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding ideas might initially strike one 
        as deviating considerably from the subject of the symposium dealt with 
        in this issue, but the deviation may be more apparent than real. Panbiogeography, 
        as realised by Croizat, at heart, it seems to me, represented an effort 
        to draw attention to: (1) possible non-dispersal-based interpretations 
        of the evolutionary process, and (2) the importance of giving greater 
        attention to unique patterns defined in terms of organisms, not "prior" 
        (and untestable) structuralist concepts. Current practitioners appear 
        to have adopted an entirely organismal approach, not realising that a 
        general spatial framework for evolutionary distribution studies based 
        directly on an application of cladistic principles is, even in theory, 
        not possible. The "geography as handmaiden" approach to biogeography is 
        a contradiction in terms: the distribution of organisms is not <em>assignable</em> 
        to a (prior) geographical space, it <em>is</em> geographical space.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore confident that biogeography--whether 
        treated in historical or ecological terms--is to be more efficiently dealt 
        with through probabilism-based modelling approaches. I am also confident 
        that it will come to be recognised that dispersal, rather than vicariance, 
        represents the dominating process of "inventive" evolution (i.e., that 
        which leads as a progression to organisms and environmental associations 
        of higher structural complexity). The confusion on this issue arises from 
        the unfortunate oversimplication that adaptation per se, and thus divergence, 
        is synonymous with evolution. I submit instead that in the most part divergence 
        represents a return toward, rather than movement away from, equilibrium. 
        The main feedback produced by range change--and entrance into new conditions 
        of spatial interaction--is adaptation; the significance of divergence 
        is the way adaptive suites can be refocused to react to local conditions 
        of environmental constraint on efficiency of resource turnover. The more 
        efficient the turnover process, the less constraining the environment 
        becomes; thus is prepared an ever more stable base and the possibility 
        of very highly "improbable" organic structure. We do not <font color="990000">[[p. 
        784]]</font> need teleology to support a "Gaic hypothesis" interpretation 
        of world ecosystem change: probabilistic interaction (i.e., spatial interaction) 
        within a limited spatial domain naturally leads to both increasing order 
        and increasing diversity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments offered here may be viewed as criticisms 
        of present strategies of biogeographic investigation, but this is not 
        the whole story. The gap between the panbiogeography school and concepts 
        I have discussed here is actually rather small. I envision a regional 
        structural approach defined by the interaction patterns of logically-constituted 
        organismal taxonomic units, and peculiar to each such group. I cannot 
        accept the naive understanding that a historically-defined phylogeny--a 
        set of logical relations that in of itself carries no capacity for external 
        validation--is in some sense more "natural" than ecologically organised 
        reality. This does not mean, however, that the two understandings cannot 
        be integrated within a position recognising the contributions of both 
        to making the reality comprehensible. As discussed earlier and in Smith 
        (1986a, 1986b), it is quite possible to recognise a normative structural 
        basis for the interpretation of unique systems of organisation; Croizat's 
        objections to the structural interpretation of the regionalists are thereby 
        rendered irrelevant.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is no more than we should expect. Croizat's 
        attempt to bury Darwin and Wallace was, as is often the case when contradictory 
        discoveries are first made, an overreaction. The leading result of his 
        work, the generalised track, is itself a structuralist concept. Spatial 
        organisation is <em>all</em> structure. History is nothing beyond the 
        selective interpretation of changing structure. (Regional geography and 
        history have been closely associated as studies since ancient times, and 
        this can hardly be viewed as surprising in this light.) The idea that 
        a "complete" understanding of the nature of (any kind of) spatial organisation 
        can be obtained by partitioning the observable elements of the latter 
        into independently-defined entities is a conceptual dinosaur.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panbiogeography cannot live up to the "pan" part 
        of its name until its practitioners return the "geography" element of 
        their charge to an appropriate role.</p>

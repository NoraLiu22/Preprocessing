      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Few could argue that 
        one of the most spectacular lizards that can be part of one's herpetological 
        collection is the Green Basilisk (<i>Basiliscus plumifrons</i>). Its bright 
        green coloring, large dorsal fin and caudal fin (found in the male) brings 
        back a Jurassic nostalgia to the observer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Four known species 
        of basilisk exist and are distributed from tropical Mexico down through 
        Central America to northern South America. <i>Basiliscus vittatus</i>, 
        commonly known as the Brown or Striped Basilisk, is found throughout southern 
        Mexico, parts of Central America, and into Colombia. <i>Basiliscus basiliscu</i>s, 
        the Common Basilisk, is distributed throughout Central America and Colombia. 
        <i>Basiliscus galeri</i>tus, the Western (or Red-headed) Basilisk, inhabits 
        western Colombia and Ecuador up through Central America. Lastly, the Green 
        Basilisk, <i>Basiliscus plumifrons</i>, is resident to Central American 
        rain forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The reptile aficionado 
        who frequents the local pet shops is likely to encounter three of the 
        four mentioned above: <i>plumifrons</i>, <i>vittatus</i>, and <i>basiliscus</i>. 
        The males of these species grow to lengths of up to three feet--most of 
        which is tail. Upon maturity, raised dorsal and caudal fins appear and 
        give them an exotic and enchanting appearance. Males tend to be highly 
        territorial and keeping multiple males in small enclosures is inadvisable. 
        Fighting will almost always occur, resulting in dominance over weaker 
        males which will not thrive under such stress. Males tend to exhibit head 
        bobbing as both a threat gesture and a courtship behavior to attract potential 
        mates. Female basilisks are comparatively smaller and lack the ornamental 
        fins of their male counterparts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> These lizards are arboreal 
        and prefer locations near water. Being easily frightened, the lizard will 
        drop from a branch overhanging a pool of water and scurry off to seek 
        protection. Having specialized scales on the bottoms of the rear feet, 
        basilisks are able to run across the surface of water for some distance 
        before breaking the surface tension and swimming away hurriedly. They 
        have been thus dubbed the &quot;Jesus lizard&quot; in parts of their native 
        countries. In captivity, these lizards tend to maintain their somewhat 
        skittish nature and do not make the best pets for those who wish to handle 
        their pets frequently.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Housing &amp; Maintenance<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Basilisks 
        generally do well in captivity, provided their minimum requirements are 
        met. They can be kept in standard glass aquariums with locked screen covers. 
        The tank size corresponds to the number of animals one wishes to maintain. 
        The author maintains a small group (three females and one male) in a 55-gallon 
        aquarium and has been successful with this type of setup. As mentioned 
        earlier, only one male per enclosure should be housed with two or three 
        females.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Large, sturdy climbing 
        branches should be included as cage furniture to satisfy the arboreal 
        nature of these animals and to mimic their natural environment. Potted 
        plants such as pothos, dracena, or philodendron can also be added to enhance 
        the beauty of the enclosure and add to the lizards' sense of security.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Coming from the tropical 
        zones of the Americas, basilisks need temperatures in the mid-70s up through 
        the 80s. Relative humidity requirements vary among species and depend 
        on the keeper's goal. Humidity at about 60-70% is acceptable. This can 
        be accomplished by a daily misting, or setting up a system with a timer 
        to mist several times per day. As an example of changing humidity needs, 
        in Basiliscus basiliscus, relative humidity is increased to upwards of 
        80% to induce breeding.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> As with most captive 
        reptiles or amphibians, full-spectrum lighting is necessary for the synthesis 
        of vitamin D3 and utilization of calcium. Exposure to natural sunlight 
        is beneficial. Remember that the sun's ultraviolet light is filtered by 
        the glass sides of the aquarium; the keeper can utilize an outdoor screen 
        enclosure for brief periods of exposure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Also, basilisks enjoy 
        a basking site, and as with all cold blooded reptiles, these lizards regulate 
        their body temperatures by moving back and forth between heat sources 
        and shaded areas. Therefore, the keeper should provide open exposure to 
        heat as well as to shaded areas to aid in thermoregulation. A ceramic 
        heating element suspended above the cage does not emit light but is a 
        good source of heat.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Diet<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Basilisks 
        enjoy a variety of insects and readily accept crickets, mealworms, Zoophobia, 
        wax worms, grasshoppers, spiders, and an occasional pinkie mouse. Their 
        food should be dusted with a fine powder vitamin supplement and calcium 
        supplement with vitamin D3 about once per week.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> One may also give feeder 
        crickets a vitamin-enriched diet. Rather than using potatoes to sustain 
        large amounts of crickets, feed them oranges, shaved carrots, and rolled 
        oats to gut-load the prey items; when the lizards dine on these crickets, 
        the basilisks will enjoy the prey's vitamin-enriched diet as well. Gut 
        loading has been cited in much of the herpetocultural literature. As for 
        pinkie mice, these can be offered once a week or less, and can also be 
        dusted with a supplement.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Breeding<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Successful 
        breeding results from several factors: manipulation of humidity, temperature, 
        and photoperiod, health of specimens to be bred, and careful incubation 
        of eggs. For Basiliscus basiliscus, high relative humidity is necessary 
        to stimulate breeding ( about 80% seems to be what is needed). Increased 
        temperature following a cooler dry period is also warranted. Temperatures 
        in the mid- to upper 80s is optimal. A photoperiod of 12 hours light to 
        12 hours dark seems to be the best ratio. These guidelines can also be 
        used for Basiliscus plumifrons and vittatus; however, in the latter a 
        lower relative humidity will also be effective in inducing breeding behavior.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> One should only choose 
        healthy specimens with ample fat stores in the tails. They should not 
        appear emaciated, nor should their abdominal regions be flaccid to the 
        touch. Weak specimens should be given adequate time to gain strength and 
        weight before being subjected to breeding stresses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> After choosing healthy 
        specimens and following the conditioning procedures above, one can begin 
        to introduce females to the male. Separating females from males prior 
        to breeding increases likelihood of successful copulations. The male demonstrate 
        interest in his soon-to-be concubine by repeated head bobbing gestures 
        followed by inching closer and closer to their targeted female. The female 
        may respond positively by lowering her head and raising her tail. This 
        behavior further cues the male. After repeated head bobbing by the male 
        and subsequent acceptance by the female, the male proceeds to seize the 
        female by the flap of skin on the back of her head. Copulation may last 
        as long as 20 minutes, but averages 10 minutes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Multiple successful 
        copulations increase the likelihood of viable fertile eggs. Gravid females 
        plump up after a week or two, and by the third week begin looking for 
        a suitable site to deposit the eggs. Prior to this, a mixture of damp 
        peat moss, soil, and sand should be placed in the breeding tank as an 
        egg-laying medium for gravid females. Females use a receptor system in 
        their snouts to judge proper temperature and humidity of the deposit site; 
        while burrowing, females frequently point their snouts into the burrow 
        to check if these conditions are adequate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Clutch sizes vary between 
        the species. In Basiliscus basiliscus, clutches range from 8-18 eggs (averaging 
        12). In Basiliscus vittatus, maximums of 12 have been noted, but averages 
        are lower (around five to seven eggs). Basiliscus plumifrons may lay up 
        to 15-17 eggs per clutch. These lizards are known for their ability to 
        lay multiple clutches per season, sometimes up to four or five. In general, 
        clutch depends on the age, size, and health of the female.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Eggs should be removed 
        and marked on their tops with a pencil in order to preserve their original 
        orientation. The eggs are then transferred to a circulated air incubator 
        and placed in a mixture of water and vermiculite (1:1 by weight). Eggs 
        should be placed about two-thirds down, with their tops slightly visible. 
        A thin layer of damp sphagnum moss may be placed on top to increase humidity. 
        Incubation temperatures should be maintained at around 84&#176;F, with 
        a high relative humidity, especially during the first four weeks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Hatching occurs at 
        around eight to ten weeks and occurs over one to two days. Hatchlings 
        emerge from the leathery eggs by way of their egg tooth, which later drops 
        off. Young basilisks should be left in the incubator until the yolk sac 
        is absorbed. After this, they can be placed in a separate tank which is 
        set up similar to their parents enclosure, and reared on small one- to 
        two-week-old crickets and wax worms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> They reach sexual maturity 
        within 18-24 months. However, fighting among males may be observed as 
        early as five months, and males should be separated at this time. Hatchlings 
        have high calcium requirements and should be offered calcium- and vitamin-enriched 
        insects often. Providing clean water regularly is also a must.</font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Diseases &amp; Disorders<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In captivity, 
        basilisks are subject to a variety of diseases that are common to captive-raised 
        reptiles. Frequently, one may note that the tips of the snout is abraded 
        on certain specimens. This is caused by continual rubbing against the 
        tank's barrier. In general, basilisks are unaware of the glass or screen 
        that surrounds them and therefore try to move forward in a vain effort. 
        While it can be treated easily, advanced cases of rostral sores can result 
        in complications, including severe infection and subsequent death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Another commonly seen 
        disorder occurs in hatchlings and adults who do not have adequate ultraviolet 
        light, or who lack calcium or vitamin D3. Metabolic bone disease is characterized 
        by bone deformities and softening of bone tissue and eventual death if 
        untreated. Some deformities may not clear up after treatment so early 
        intervention is essential.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <a href="stomatitis.html">Stomatitis</a>, 
        or mouth rot, is seen in many reptiles. Caused by bacteria which forms 
        in and around the jaw line, it can be treated by a veterinarian with topical 
        antibiotics. Specimens who suffer from stomatitis often go off-feed and 
        become weak and lose weight. Regular checking of the oral cavity can curtail 
        advanced stages of the disease. The oral cavity should appear pink and 
        healthy. Any caseous matter or spongy masses could be a sign of stomatitis 
        and the animal should be taken to a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> External parasites 
        such as ticks or mites may plague some specimens, especially imports. 
        Ticks feed off a host be drawing blood and nutrients which would otherwise 
        go towards the growth and repair of the host's cells and body. Carefully 
        remove the ticks by using a pair of sterile tweezers or forceps to gently 
        pull the parasite from the basilisk's body. Betadine solution can be applied 
        to decrease risk of infection.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Some basilisks can 
        also harbor internal parasites such as protozoa and nematodes. Imports 
        tend to be at greater risk of parasite infestation, but captive specimens 
        exposed to parasites may also become infested. Characterized by loose, 
        runny stools and weight loss, parasitic infestation can be diagnosed via 
        fecal sample examination by a veterinarian and treated accordingly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> While basilisks are 
        susceptible to these problems, if treated early they can recover and be 
        enjoyed by the advanced hobbyist. Green and Brown Basilisks especially 
        make beautiful additions to a collection. Trends indicate that captive-bred 
        specimens will continue to be available through private breeders.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Although fairly plentiful 
        in the wild, encroachment on their habitat coupled with deforestation 
        may impact the future of this species. It is the author's hope that this 
        article will stimulate more interest in such wonderful and beautiful reptiles.</font></p>

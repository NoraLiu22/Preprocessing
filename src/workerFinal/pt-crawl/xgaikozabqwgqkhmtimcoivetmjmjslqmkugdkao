Neanderthals lived there from around 250 000 years ago until between 100 000 and 47 000 years ago - making it the earliest known the occupation of the Channel Islands by a hominin species, and also possibly one of the last Neanderthal sites in northwestern Europe. At that time, with sea levels below those at present, Jersey was part of Normandy, a peninsula jutting out from the coast. After the last Ice Age the sea rose again, separating Jersey from the mainland.

Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site,' said Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research.<br /><br /> The site has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together and holds the only known late caveman remains in Northwest Europe. When the archaeologists dated the sediments, they found that part of them are from between 100&nbsp;000 and 47&nbsp;000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth found there in 1910 were younger than previously thought.<br /><br />'We were sure from the outset that the deposits held some archaeological potential, but these dates indicate we have uncovered something exceptional,' explained Pope. 'We have a sequence of deposits which span the last 120&nbsp;000 years still preserved at the site. Crucially, this covers the period in which Neanderthal populations apparently went extinct.'<br /><br /> Photo Credit: UCL Institute of Archaeology  <br /> Text: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/18/new_sediment_dating_jersey/ </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />  <p><a href="images30/cottedigresearcher.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/cottedigresearchersm.jpg" alt = "Level 3" width="450" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Dr Jean-Luc Schwenninger retrieving dating samples from the rediscovered deposits at La Cotte de St Brelade.<br /><br />Dr Matt Pope continued:<br /><br />This was the period during which Neanderthals were kicked off the evolutionary ladder to be replaced by our own species, <i>Homo sapiens</i>.<br /><br />'Working with our partners to bring these rediscovered sediments under new analysis will allow us to bring the lives of the last Neanderthal groups to live in North West Europe into clearer focus,' Pope said.<br /><br />'We may be able to use this evidence to better understand when Neanderthal populations disappeared form the region and whether they ever shared the landscape with the species which ultimately replaced them, us.' <br /><br /> Photo Credit: UCL Institute of Archaeology  <br /> Text: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/18/new_sediment_dating_jersey/ </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images30/cotteflake.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/cotteflakesm.jpg" alt = "Neandertal flake" width="281" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />Striped flake from La Cotte de St Brelade.

Firstly, large parts remain untouched, perhaps as much as 60% of the original Pleistocene sediments still being in situ. Secondly, much of this rich site lies unprotected and at the mercy of the powerful Atlantic-driven elements, so long term management now needs to be considered. And thirdly, James's survey is indicating that the current appearance of La Cotte as a series of ravines is a recent state of affairs. <br /><br /> In the earliest phases of human habitation (over 250&nbsp;000 years ago) La Cotte would have looked very different, possibly comprising an entirely roofed cave system, the entrance to which is still sealed and has never been investigated. We can now see that this entrance, along with deposits thought lost which had contained the neanderthal human remains, are present and intact. La Cotte offers future research an unparalleled, clearly defined resource through which to study directly a long evolutionary arc of human activity.</i><br /><br />Photo:  http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/archaeologists-find-last-neanderthals-at-le-cotte-de-st-brelade-jersey/story-fnjwl1aw-1226743625496<br />Photo: Another source is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEWm9trkaRQ<br /><br /> Text: http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba117/feat3.shtml</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>The Problem of the Mammoth Drive</h2><center>Text and photos below mostly adapted from <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Scott et al.

New study of this Middle Palaeolithic coastal site, however, indicates a very different landscape to the featureless coastal plain that was previously envisaged.<br /><br />Reconsideration of the bone heaps themselves further undermines the 'mass kill' hypothesis, suggesting that these were simply the final accumulations of bone at the site, undisturbed and preserved in situ when the return to a cold climate blanketed them in wind-blown loess.</b><br /><br />Text above is the abstract of: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Scott et al.

(<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Scott, 1980, 1986b</span></a>).  <br /><br /> Scott concluded that the composition and arrangement of the bone heaps was most consistent with Neanderthal hunters driving mammoth herds over the headland into the deep granite ravines. The involvement of Neanderthals in premeditated and organised predation challenged assumptions concerning their cognitive capabilities as hunters.

Mammoths and rhinos comprise essentially the entire fauna of these two levels; a few bones of other species occur only at the base of each level. <br /><br />The site is the base of a deep ravine (about 30 m at the time of deposition of layers 3 and 6) and there are several indications that there were rapid accumulations: some bones were found to rest vertically against other bones, a few bones were found in articulation, several mammoth scapulas were stacked in direct contact with each other without intervening sediment, and there was no evidence of subaerial weathering. The age distribution indicates a predominance of sub-adults and prime age adults. It would have been impossible to kill a group of such dangerous animals without driving them off the cliff.

Here it will suffice to say that the source whence this clay was derived is not now possible to trace, for the district for a mile or more around is flat, heather-clad moorland, without clay, and consists simply of granite, with a thin layer of soil resulting from the decomposition of its scant vegetation. Further, both the gorge and the cave are in a spur of cliff between which, and the actual tableland, there is a depression some thirty feet (nine metres) in depth. <br /><br />The first intimation we have of this cave having been a human dwelling dates from about 1880, when Mr S. Dancaster and the late Mr T. Saunders, when studying the geology of the district, found a flint implement on the shore at the foot of the talus, and tracing its source, came upon a portion of the hearth which was exposed in section.

Owing to the threatening condition of the whole of the surroundings, it was found that a full exploration would entail an expenditure greater than could then be incurred, so the work was postponed. <br /><br />In September 1910, exploration was resumed, experienced quarrymen being engaged for the work. <br /><br />After a few weeks' labour, sufficient of the rubble filling had been removed to lay bare a portion of the floor 11 feet (3 metres) square, to form a platform so as to afford footing on the outside, and to give some idea as to the extent of the cave. <br /><br /><p><a href="images30/earlydigcotte.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/earlydigcottesm.jpg" alt = "Cotte now" width="378" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /> La Cotte de St Brelade. <br /><br /> This may be from the 1968 dig in which Charles, Prince of Wales, took part. <br /><br />  Photo: Société Jersiaise<br />  Source: Natural History Museum video <!--  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqHMznHE-a0&feature=player_embedded --></p><br clear="all"><br /><br />The entrance, which is in the form of an irregular half arch, is 25 feet in height and 20 feet in width (7.6 x 6 metres). <br /><br />Just within the entrance, the roof slopes upwards into a rough dome, some 30 to 32 feet (9 to 10 metres) high.

In the centre of the space thus cleared was a block of granite 8 x 5 feet (2.5 x 1.5 metres), weighing approximately 14 tons. This block was at first considered unnecessary to remove, but as the floor was being dug and examined, it was found that the hearth extended underneath it, whilst the presence of a layer of ashes, bone and flint chippings on the top, showed that this huge stone had fallen from the roof during the period that the cave was occupied. <br /><br />In fact, the lower, and original, hearth could be traced upwards in stages, showing that repeated falls of roof and rubble had taken place during the time of occupation. <br /><br /><p><a href="images30/plancotte.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/plancottesm.jpg" alt = "Cotte plan" width="560" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Plan of floor of 'La Cotte', St Brelade,   as explored up to Sept. 1911.<br /><br />(<i>note that I have relabelled some of the positions of the deposits which were almost illegible on the original&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />A.

At the spot where the nine human teeth had already been found, four others were now discovered, raising their total to thirteen. These, Dr Keith pronounces as all belonging to one individual. These teeth are the subject of a monograph by Drs Keith and Knowles, in which their similarity to those of Krapina and with those of the Heidelberg jaw is pointed out. <br /><br />How far the cave extends backwards was not ascertained, but judging from the slope of the roof, which at 30 feet (9 metres) from the entrance begins to lower, it is probable that some 50 feet (15 metres) is the full extent. <br /><br />About another hundred flint implements were discovered at this stage. <br /><br /><p><a href="images30/cottecharles.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/cottecharlessm.jpg" alt = "Charles at the dig" width="354" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />Prince Charles during the 1968 excavation.<br /><br />From another source, from left to right, the son of Charles  McBurney (Simon),  Anthony Legge and the student Charles, Prince of Wales. <br /><br />Photo: Jersey Evening Post<br />Source:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Finch (2008)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />On the opposite side of the gorge, facing the entrance of the cave and almost entirely concealed by the sloping talus which forms the termination of the gorge, was indication of another cave. This was investigated by Mr G. De Gruchy, the proprietor of the site, and Mr R. Marett, in 1912, and the result of their investigation communicated to the Société Jersiaise, of which Society both these men are members. It was then seen that this second cave was a branch of the first, that is, a  large cave must at one time have existed in the site of what is now the gorge, and of which the two caves which are now facing one another, were lateral branches. <br /><br />No hearth, or bones except in small fragments, occurred in this portion, but about a score of implements similar to those already described, were brought to light. <br /><br />The exploration of La Cotte then, whilst it may be considered still incomplete, has proved highly interesting, as beyond the discovery of the remains of a man of the Mousterian period, it has furnished the first evidences of a Pleistocene fauna in the Channel Islands. Apart from those found in these caves, unmistakable implements of Mousterian man occur in considerable numbers between the upper and lower boulder clays both in Jersey and Guernsey. <br /><br />The human teeth - all that was left of what must have been a skull - were found, not in the position in which their owner may have died or had been reverently laid, but against the wall rock of the cave, behind the hearth, and mingled with broken bones of ox and reindeer. <br /><br />The occupants took some thought for the morrow, and we found remains of wood, including large boughs, stacked near the hearth. <br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /> <h2>Résultats des fouilles récentes (1951-1956) à la grotte de la Cotte de Saint-Brelade à Jersey</h2><center>R.

To  the  somewhat schematic  stratification at that time in which I listed only the layers, I have today added a detailed longitudinal section  with a descriptive caption. <br /><br />None of the previous excavations from 1910 to 1917 and from 1936 to 1940, had penetrated below the head (layer 0 B), in the final metres of which were found all the Mousterian tools and fauna. They had stopped, without crossing, in a peaty soil (layer 2A), which was completely sterile in bone and lithic implements,  rich in plant materials but very poor in pollen. <br /><br />(<i>It should be noted that at this time one of the few ways of dating a site independently of tool styles was by pollen. The lack of pollen is puzzling here, because it is well preserved in most such deposits, and especially so in peat&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />My first surprise was to find under this layer, not a marine sand, which had been expected, but a white clay (3B) very pure and fine, that Prof. Deflandre, Director of the Laboratory of Micropaleontology of l'Ecole des Hautes-Etudes, identified without hesitation as a freshwater deposit with diatoms (<I>a major group of algae, and among the most common types of phytoplankton, found in oceans, freshwater, in soils and on damp surfaces</i>&nbsp;),  many siliceous cells of grasses and many crustaceans.  The average depth was one metre. The presence of fresh water deposits was soon confirmed by the discovery  of an underlying coarser and highly ferruginous sand.<br /><br /><p><a href="images30/tools1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/tools1sm.jpg" alt = "tool" width="515" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />Slightly rolled amygdaloid hand axe from the Burdo excavation. <br /><br />From Layer 3B (i.e. 8.3) 4.0 metres outside the entrance of the north ravine, 10 cm from the wall of the north pinnacle, at 27.3 metres below datum.   <br /><br /> Photo and text:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Callow and Cornford (1986)</span></a>  </p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/tools2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/tools2sm.jpg" alt = "tool" width="524" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />Slightly rolled amygdaloid hand axe from the Burdo excavation. <br /><br />From Burdo's 'Acheulean 1' (i.e. 8.1) at the entrance to the north ravine, 4.4   metres  from the west wall, at 26.5 metres below datum.   <br /><br /> Photo and text:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Callow and Cornford (1986)</span></a>  </p><br clear = "all"><br />Below this was another bed of old vegetation (6), less peaty than 2A, but  indisputably of vegetation because of the many  imprints of the  roots of herbaceous plants and, it seems, shrubs.<br /><br />Then there was another change at 5B, with fragments of a loam, which since they were separated from the more recent loess several metres above by the various deposits that I just mentioned, could only  be  older loess.<br /><br />Near the entrance to the cave, to the right of the section, this was absent, and I found a light reddish brown clay that reminded me immediately of the red clay cap in the valley of the Somme on the old loess there.

The flint bifaces are more numerous in the more recent layers; in the oldest, quartzite, dolerite and metamorphic schist dominate. All are remarkable for the care to ensure a good grip and not to hurt the hand. Even a dimple or depression is often provided for the thumb or index finger. This suggests, first they were made for direct use in the hand without a hole for a handle, and secondly that  the hand of the Acheuleans  did not differ appreciably  from that of a current average man. This is important.<br /><br /><p><a href="images30/doleritehandaxe.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/doleritehandaxesm.jpg" alt = "acheulian handaxe" width="419" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Biface in dolerite. Face and left profile. <br /><br />Photo and text:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Burdo (1956)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />2.  It is remarkable that several times, in the middle of waste piles, we found an abnormal density of quite small bifaces, 6 or 7 cm, made of diabase  (dolerite) or schist.  <!-- Cela semble indiquer une taille à la pierre moins dure et moins brisante que le silex. --><br /><br />3. As the depth increases, so also does the number of tools in granite found at the site. Most are choppers,  large hammers of a very constant type:  one face flat, the other with a central reinforcing ridge. One larger end with a bevelled facet for gripping, the other narrow end often crushed or broken through use. Dimensions were very variable,  between 30 cm and 5 cm. <br /><br />4. There were many cleavers, though a little fewer in numbers than choppers. The material is still either local granite, or grey quaurtzite, very hard and abrasive. Forms can be reduced to two types: one similar to that found by  Mlle Alimen in  Layer II of Kerzaz (Western Sahara) and published in  Bull. Soc. préhist. fr. , December 1955, p. 486 , Fig. 5, the other with a sort of elongated handle, analagous to an example from Ternifine (or Tighenif)  in Algeria, shown during a meeting by Professor Arambourg, and two others, found also in Northern Africa by our colleague B. Champault.<br /><br /><p><a href="images30/hachereau.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/hachereausm.jpg" alt = "acheulian cleaver" width="300" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Cleaver in light grey fine-grained quartzite.

Scrapers form the most numerous class of tools. Almost all known types are represented: retouches on one or both ends, one, two, three or four edges, convex, concave or straight. Retouches, often very steep, are  often made with delicacy and perfect regularity, but,  which is still typical of the period, the body of the tool is often overlooked, being shapeless and full of defects .<br /><br />  6. Knives, sharp blades. - These are of mediocre length, rarely exceeding 7 cm. They are rarely retouched, but are extremely sharp - the back always  showing the same concern for a convenient grip for the extended index finger,  or through the cortex not being removed over the entire length, or by the removal of irregularities and  bumps.<br /><br />It should be noted that, as with scrapers, many knives are obviously designed to be used with the left hand.<br /><br />7.  Knife and scraper pair  - We found last year, close to one another, two excellent tools, with striking similarities in size, material, technique and weight, and they were obviously made ​​from the same nucleus by the same skilled worker, but one was a knife, the other a scraper with abrupt retouch. The total weight of the two was: 83g + 85g = 168 grams. <br /><br />This find drew my attention to another set of tools, found slightly higher, and thus younger, of a tool with two edges parallel or convergent, one worked as a knife and the other as a scraper. There were thus savings in material, and a reduction in weight of almost half. One can not have everything, and the grip was less convenient, but it was ameliorated  by a greater thickness of the tool body. <br /><br />This is an interesting example of  the benefits that are provided by the fine perfection of technique by an inventive craftsman, and is another example of the imagination and resourcefulness of the Acheuleans compared with their more traditional and more hidebound  Mousterian successors. <br /><br />This type of tool, relatively common here (n = 274) seems to have been either neglected or rarely found elsewhere in such a remote period, the oldest of which I have knowledge is that  reported by Dr. Henri Martin in the Mousterian III of La Quina.<br /><br />8.  Under the heading 'Archaic Technique'  I have assigned a number of pieces. Some may be attributed to 'pebble culture', if they were not simply eoliths, not made by man but by nature. Others appeared to be related to the Clactonian type (<i>which seems to have coexisted with Early Acheulean&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />As for the Levallois technique, I was able, thanks to the delay in writing this note, to use the valuable article by Abbé Breuil and Harper Kelly which appeared in the Bulletin of March-April 1956: 'Les éclats Acheuléens à plan de frappe à facettes de Cagny-la-Garenne'. <br /><br />It shone light on a certain number of pieces  the facetting of which had intrigued me, but which I was strongly reluctant to classify as being of the true Levallois technique. <br /><br />I was instead of the opinion that I had the pleasure of seeing what  H. Kelley (loc. cit, p 178.) called 'The flexibility of mind and technique of the Acheuleans with respect to the  'best use of various raw materials.' I would add that, upon closer examination of my own pieces, there are many cases where faceting is due to a mistake of knapping, the worker having tried two or three times to strike off a flake of sufficient thickness.  <br /><br />9. The cores  are certainly not   from the Levallois technique. Often small, always irregular, they had almost all been 'softened',  or improved for working, by heat. A good number had been heated too much, fractures or crazing having made them unusable. <br /><br />10. I had the idea to study on my 1955 harvest of artefacts, the value sometimes accorded to older tools of the simultaneous presence of a smooth striking platform and a high angle of striking. For this I took the pieces from three superimposed layers, a total of one metre thick, and selected from them three groups of 100 pieces each: The proportion of a smooth striking platform with an obtuse striking angle was as follows:<br /><br />The lower portion, the oldest, had an average of 74.5%, with one batch having a maximum of 95%. <br /><br />The middle group had an average of 18.8%. <br /><br />The upper portion, the most recent, had an average of 8%, with one group having a minimum of 0. <br /><br />I started this experiment without prejudice. Although  a single observation cannot create  a general law, I admit that the result seemed too neat to be due to chance.<br /><br /><h2>Fauna</h2>Bones are abundant, almost at all levels. Unfortunately acid granitic deposits were their fatal and few are in a state of good preservation. Their comprehensive study and the specific determination is not completed. Here is what seems already assured. <br /><br /><i>Elephas</i> - Fragments of 12 or 14 molars, of which 4 are well preserved, as well as many more single lamellae. All seem to belong to <i>Elephas  Primigenius</i>, the Woolly Mammoth.  - 4 or 5 fragments of tusks are  too incomplete to allow estimation of the curvature.<br /><br /><i>Rhinoceros</i> - 15 molars  fairly complete, as well as  fragments of fifteen others.  There was one temporal, very well preserved.  All the teeth belong to<i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus </i>, the Woolly Rhinoceros. <br /><br /><i>Equus</i> -  11 teeth.   A sesamoid bone of the hind limb.  The difference in size suggests the likelihood of not only different  individuals but  different species.<br /><br /><i>Rangifer</i> -   One doubtful fragment of a  Reindeer jaw with four teeth. <br /><br /> <i>Cervus</i> - Some articular ends of <i>Cervus elaphus</i>. A phalanx of <i>Cervus Capreolus</i>.<br /><br />Ursus. - A phalange and a canine of <i>Ursus Spelaeus</i>.   An intact incisor of  <i>Ursus arctos</i>.<br /><br />The absence of Felines, and especially Hyenas is remarkable. <br /><br />In short, the fauna are poor in species, but indicate a  moderately cold climate, but without the proper arctic species that characterised the Mousterian fauna of 1910.<br /><br /><h2>Climate and Chronology</h2>1 - Between the  Acheulean and the  Mousterian : Coupe: Levels  2A  and 6 . Very moist, favourable to abundant vegetation of trees and shrubs. Considerable rainfall, causing a lake or large pond to be established on the plateau above, sometimes trickling, sometimes coursing in a  waterfall to the bottom, where water collects and drains away at the entrance of the cave  at clay 3B,  rich in  freshwater organisms which are very waterworn  and broken in the fall.<br /><br />This climate  is pretty much (<i>at 3B?</i>) that of an interglacial, obviously the last. The complete absence of remains of mammals can not be more affirmative.   Perhaps this lack is it due to the fact that the sea level has risen, and Jersey found itself once more separated from the Continent and without possible contribution of species and even new individuals . At the same time its greatly reduced area could not provide enough food for larger animals or for men who lived by hunting.<br /><br />2 - In the Acheulean, the climate was much drier, with strong winds accumulating a sandy loess  several metres  thick at the bottom of the cave.  These winds would be strong enough to give a beautiful lustre to a number of blocks of granite, and to obliterate the faceting and retouching of some flint. This took place irregularly and at intervals, at different levels of human occupation. At different levels, too, even in the ashes, are the impressions and remains of fine roots, due to a grassy steppe vegetation. It also fits well with the visible predominance of herbivorous wildlife.<br /><br />I barely completed the Pre-Mousterian levels in one quarter of the cave. And in the ravine where it opened I did not even scratch the surface of the  continuity of archaeological levels . We see the enormity of the work that remains to be done, and the importance of the results that can be expected. The most 'sensational' would certainly be human remains, plus some more features than what I have - perhaps - provided from  late 1955 and early 1956.<br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>Archaeological Report for 1953 at Cotte de St Brelade</h2><center>R.

The present section was drawn after a photograph and represents the boulders to scale in their correct outline and position. Besides, it should actually be folded at a right angle along its central thick line, the left-hand half being perpendicular, and the right-hand half parallel, to the West wall of the cave.<br /><br />(<i>note that, to me,  the right hand half of the diagram would therefore be of the East wall of the cave, not the West wall&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />A comparison between the 1952 and 1953 sections shows, besides a substantial increase in thickness of the Premousterian layers, - from 1.80 m to 4.50 - a new feature which has been the all important discovery of 1953. In 1952, we subdivided the layer, rather vaguely, in 7A and 7B, pointing out in the latter a small pocket of black ashes with a few unidentifiable pieces of bone. <br /><br />Since March 1953 we uncovered progressively, behind a frontage of fine yellow loess 7B, a continuous and complex layer of ashes, 7C, E, F, about 3.50 m thick, running all along the working face and sinking below our trench floor down to an unknown depth. There is a great variety in colour and structure among the different ash layers. It is therefore important to give a more detailed description, starting from the bottom upwards. <br /><br />Photo and text:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Burdo (1953)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="style1"><tr><td class="toprow" colspan="5" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><th class="bottomrow"> Description</th><th class="bottomrow" >Total<br />1953</th><th class="bottomrow" >%<br />1953</th><th class="bottomrow" >Total<br />1952</th><th class="bottomrow" >%<br />1952</th></tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Bifaces (Hand Axes)</td><td class="highlight">17</td> <td class="highlight">0.5</td> <td class="highlight">48</td> <td class="highlight">7.9</td> </tr>  <tr><td class="style1" >Flat flake implements</td><td class="style2">112</td> <td class="style2">3.3</td> <td class="style2">76</td> <td class="style2">12.4</td> </tr>  <tr><td class="style1" >Cutting blades and tools</td><td class="highlight2">866</td> <td class="highlight2">25.4</td> <td class="highlight2">32</td> <td class="highlight2">5.2</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Ribbed (or keeled) blades</td><td class="highlight2">663</td> <td class="highlight2">19.5</td> <td class="highlight2">73</td> <td class="highlight2">11.9</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Flattened blades</td><td class="style2">450</td> <td class="style2">13.2</td> <td class="style2">75</td> <td class="style2">12.2</td> </tr><tr><td class="style1" >Scrapers (all types)</td><td class="highlight2">723</td> <td class="highlight2">21.2</td> <td class="highlight2">52</td> <td class="highlight2">8.4</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Points</td><td class="highlight">55</td> <td class="highlight">1.6</td> <td class="highlight">47</td> <td class="highlight">7.7</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Granite choppers and cleavers</td><td class="style2">121</td> <td class="style2">3.6</td> <td class="style2">14</td> <td class="style2">2.3</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Quartz choppers</td><td class="style2">108</td> <td class="style2">[3.2]</td> <td class="style2">76</td> <td class="style2">12.4</td> </tr><tr><td class="style1" >Shale, Dolerite, etc. choppers</td><td class="style2">33</td> <td class="style2">1.0</td> <td class="style2">25</td> <td class="style2">4.3</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Quartzite cleavers</td><td class="highlight">63</td> <td class="highlight">1.9</td> <td class="highlight">25</td> <td class="highlight">4.3</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Implements of archaic technique</td><td class="style2">192</td> <td class="style2">5.6</td> <td class="style2">67</td> <td class="style2">11.0</td> </tr>  <tr><td class="bottomrow" >Total</td><td class="bottomrow2">3&nbsp;403</td><td class="bottomrow2">&nbsp;</td><td class="bottomrow2">610</td><td class="bottomrow2">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table><br /> <!--  (note that a typo was fixed quartz choppers were 3.6% correct figure is 3.2%) -->     <table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="style1"><tr><td class="toprow" colspan="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other artefacts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><th class="bottomrow"> Description</th><th class="bottomrow" >Total<br />1953</th><th class="bottomrow" >Total<br />1952</th></tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Nuclei (Flaked cores)</td><td class="style2">429</td><td class="style2">50</td> </tr>  <tr><td class="style1" >Utilized flakes</td><td class="style2">1&nbsp;318</td><td class="style2">377</td> </tr> <tr><td class="style1" >Chips and waste</td><td class="style2">over 10&nbsp;000</td><td class="style2">ca&nbsp;800</td> </tr></table><br /><br /><br /><br />1. Raw materials used are about the same as last year. Black flint of Mousterian quality is still more infrequent ; and the fine-grained brown quartzite is exceptional: its source of supply abroad had probably not yet been discovered. <br /><br />Quartz is abundant in the lowest layer 7F; but much of it could hardly be listed as 'implements' and had to be entered under 'utilized flakes' or even 'chips and waste'. We have been rather strict in our verdict in all similar cases.<br /><br />2. One must remember that we worked this year almost 3 metres (10 ft) deeper in the Premousterian layer. We shall not risk an estimation of the corresponding difference in antiquity; but it should probably be reckoned in tens of thousands of years.<br /><br />3. Consequently we had to expect some difference in the percentage of the most characteristic types. <br /><br />The biggest decreases are, in % : <br /><br />Biface hand-axes fell from 7.9% to 0.5%<br />Points  fell from 7.7% to 1.6%<br />Quartzite cleavers fell from 4.3% to 1.9%<br /><br />Increases are still more marked :<br /><br />Cutting tools increased from 5.2% to 25.4%<br />Ribbed blades increased from 11.9% to 19.5%<br />Scrapers increased from 8.4% to 21.2%<br /><br />These figures show that, when we go back to earlier times, the proportion of implements characteristic of late Acheulian and early Mousterian industry is smaller, while there is an increase in implements of a simpler and cruder make, - cutting tools and rough scrapers-or in those, like keeled blades, which are more remote from the Levallois technique.<br /><br />Still more remarkable is the rise in the proportion of tools and flakes which show at the same time a wide flaking angle (90&deg; - 125&deg;) and a plane unfacetted striking platform: they rise from 11.5% to 43.4% of the total. Such proportion denotes a strong influence of archaic technique - should we call it Tayacian ? - the same as we pointed out last year in the caves of Et Tab&ucirc;n (Layer E) and of Pech-de-l'Aze.<br /><br />4. Subject to these chronological differences, flints occur practically at all levels of the section. But it is noteworthy that in 7E (black ashes) there is a much greater quantity of chips. Palaeolithic man had observed that a moderate heat makes flint easier to split and flake. Sometimes however he could not control his fire; and we have been able to reconstruct several flint cores which burst to pieces through overheating.<br /><br />But flakes detached [<i>after</i> ] moderate fire action under embers and ashes are extremely thin and still as fresh and lustrous as new.III-Animal remains.-We deplored last year the almost complete absence of bones, especially of big animals. But no sooner had we burst into the ash layers than we were amply rewarded for our patience. Unfortunately more often than not we met with endless trouble in collecting and preserving these precious relics. Bones occurred in four different states:<br /><br />i - calcinated in an open fire, completely bleached and mineralized <br /><br />ii - black: probably used as slow burning fuel, giving not enough heat to bum up the whole of the organic substance.<br /><br />Bones of these two first classes are still tolerably hard, but usually too fragmentary for identification iii - Worst of all: fairly large bones, showing a definite outline ; but the whole mass is, when wet, as soft as butter, turning, when dry, into impalpable powder. These are practically irretrievable  and in most cases we were reduced to taking photographs, or occasionally plaster casts of the cavity left after scraping carefully off the whole osseous substance. <br /><br /> iv - Luckily, a fair number of interesting specimens.<br /><br />Bones of the two last-mentioned classes, even when occurring in the black ashes, had not been burned, neither in the mass nor even on the surface. This fact is proof that fire was not continually kept in the cave. On the other hand the absence of many parts of the skeleton shows that animals were not dying a natural death. In the long process of dismembering huge pieces of a carcass, bones were chucked away on cold ashes: no two have been found in anatomic connexion.<br /><br />We shall not venture into hasty conclusions before further material has been dug out next summer, and pending the result of a thorough examination very kindly undertaken for us at the London Institute of Archaeology. We mentioned last year the absence of 'such big animals as Elephants and Rhinoceroses'. This is no longer true since these two species formed the best part of our fmds of 1953. Of the former (a Mammoth?) we recovered ftve molar teeth, two of which perfectly preserved, and a 60 cm piece of tusk still rooted in the jaw; - of the latter, three intact molars and large fragments of another dozen of teeth. Many other bones are fragmentary and illpreserved, chiefly the cellular structure of elephant's osseous tissue.<br /><br />There is also a fair number of remains of smaller animals, even Rodents. Amongst the easiest to identify, we recognized a Deer's (Reindeer's?) jaw. But Horse and Ox, both abundant in the Mousterian layer, have not yet occurred at the lower level. Nor is there so far any trace of carnivores. But we have worked only a thin slice of the ossiferous layer; and when we have advanced four more metres inside the cave, 1954 may have in store many happy surprises.<br /><br />Many eminent Scientists and Archaeologists, both British and French, have already given us invaluable help and advice. The very fact that we have not mentioned any of their names is proof that we consider the present Report as incomplete and provisional; we will do them full justice later on. But I do not promise a complete, still less a <i>final&nbsp;</i> Report. I cannot hope to finish the excavations within my lifetime ; indeed, if I could, I would not. <br /><br />It is nowadays regarded almost as a crime to strip bare an important site. Our successors will have at their disposal new methods and new comparative data still unknown to us. We must trust them and hand down to them enough fresh and untouched material to enable them to make full use of their skill and knowledge. This is the best way to deserve their esteem and gratitude.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>Early Photographs</h2><p><a href="images30/cotte1905.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/cotte1905sm.jpg" alt = "site in 1905" width="284" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />This shows the level of deposits under the arch in 1905. <br /><br />Photo: Unknown<br />Source: Courtesy Dr Matt Pope</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images30/1910nicolle.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/1910nicollesm.jpg" alt = "site in 1905" width="314" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />E.T.

At the time of the excavations, it was something of a scramble to get down the path on the right of this image, and to the left, just out of shot, was the sea, which would make some attempts to dampen us at high tide.<br /><br />Photo and text: &copy; Rob McRorie</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images30/site31978.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/site31978sm.jpg" alt = "site in 1978" width="291" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br />Archaeology - La Cotte de St Brelade, 1978.<br /><br />Lunchtime for the diggers on a sunny day with the tide out.

Just after the last Ice Age this was a large plain, on which mammoths and other large wildlife roamed. Cliffs from a previous age ran around in a long semicircle, and it is likely that animals were rounded over the cliff edge, being butchered in the cave below. Certainly no shortage of stone tools and bones on site - I spent a happy week on a mammoth tooth, they were very fragile and needed to be dug with a needle and hardened as you went along.<br /><br />Photo and text: &copy; Rob McRorie</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><a name="reference"> </a> <!-- <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Glory (1961)</span></a> --><h3><span class="reference">References</span></h3><ol compact type="1" start="1"> <li><span class="reference"><b>Bates M.</b>, 2011:   The role of archaeologists in understanding and preventing the impacts of marine industries on the prehistoric environment, <i>UNESCO Scientific Colloquium on Factors Impacting the Underwater Cultural Heritage</i>, Royal Library of Belgium, Brussels, Belgium. 13th & 14th December, 2011.</span></li> <li><span class="reference"><b>Bates M., Pope M., Shaw A., Scott B., Schwenninger J.</b>, 2013:   Late Neanderthal occupation in North-West Europe: rediscovery, investigation and dating of a last glacial sediment sequence at the site of La Cotte de Saint Brelade, Jersey<i>Journal of Quaternary Science</i>,  (2013) 28(7) 647–652 ISSN 0267-8179.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 41 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/brelade.html responseCode 3 200

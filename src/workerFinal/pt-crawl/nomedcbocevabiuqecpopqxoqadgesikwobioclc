<H1>I'D SELL CANNABIS, SAYS BRANSON</H1>
<BR>

Virgin boss Richard Branson said last night that he would sell legalised
cannabis in his stores but not tobacco because it is too dangerous.
<P>
He said his company would not want to get involved in selling ordinary
cigarettes - but he would not rule out promoting cannabis if the law allowed
it because it was probably less harmful than tobacco.
<P>
The millionaire businessman said that to encourage youngsters to smoke would
be 'immoral'. &nbsp;But although he was not advocating the sale of cannabis if it
was legalised, he added: "If a cigarette company started selling it at too
high a price, I'm sure we'd be in there."
<P>
Last year Branson was among 100 prominent people who signed a public
declaration in favour of the decriminilisation of cannabis. &nbsp;They also
included former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, Body Shop founder Anita Roddick,
public relations guru Max Clifford, author Martin Amis and veteran
playwright Harold Pinter.
<P>
Branson, whose commercial activities range from air travel to condoms, was
speaking on the importance of product brands on 'The Money Programme' on
BBC2 last night.
<P>
Asked about cannabis, he said: "I personally think it should be legalised. &nbsp;I
think it's wrong that 100,000 young people have criminal records every year
for doing something which is no worse than their parents are doing every
night - drinking alcohol." <BR>

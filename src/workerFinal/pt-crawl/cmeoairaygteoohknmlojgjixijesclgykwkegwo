      <p><b>China has all along attached great importance to protecting disabled 
        children, making great efforts to create favorable conditions for their 
        survival and development. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Protection of Disabled Children's Rights and Interests 
        </font></b></p>
      <p><b>The Chinese Government has devoted much attention to guaranteeing 
        the rights and interests of disabled children. Among children aged 14 
        and under, there are over 9 million disabled, accounting for 2.66 percent 
        of children of the same age group in China. The Chinese Constitution and 
        relevant laws contain clear statements regarding the rights and interests 
        of the disabled, including disabled children. The Law on the Protection 
        of Disabled Persons contains all-inclusive, systematic provisions guaranteeing 
        the legitimate rights and interests of the disabled. It states clearly 
        that the disabled enjoy equal rights with other citizens in all spheres: 
        political, economic, cultural, social and family life; that discrimination, 
        insult and harassment against the disabled are prohibited; that the state 
        should develop disability prevention programs; and that the rights of 
        the disabled to rehabilitation, education, labor, entertainment and welfare 
        should be protected. While all these provisions also apply to disabled 
        children, the law includes specific statements on special protection of 
        disabled children. </b></p>
      <p><b>In order to protect rights and interests of the disabled and promote 
        their cause, the China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF), an organization 
        that represents the disabled, serves their interests and administrates 
        the work concerning the disabled, has been established with the approval 
        of the Chinese Government. One of its principal tasks is to protect the 
        lawful rights and interests of disabled children. Also, local disabled 
        persons' federations at the provincial (autonomous regional and municipal), 
        prefectural and county levels have been established to serve the disabled, 
        including disabled children in the region, and administrate their affairs. 
        </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation </font></b></p>
      <p><b>Following the policy of putting prevention rst, the Chinese Government 
        has adopted a series of measures to prevent children's congenital disability. 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>China has expended great eorts in strengthening the immunization program 
        and in planned, large-scale replenishment of iodine for children. In order 
        to further control endemic diseases and curb environmental pollution, 
        it has taken effective measures such as replenishing iodine, improving 
        soil and purifying water in regions where goiter, cretinism and Kaschin-Beck 
        disease are rampant. The Marriage Law, the Law on Health Protection of 
        Mothers and Infants and relevant regulations for preventing congenital 
        disability have been strictly implemented by governments and medical and 
        health institutions at all levels. In order to curb harmful heredity and 
        improve prenatal, birthing and postnatal education and administration, 
        services like premarital check-ups and education, prenatal examinations, 
        heredity consultancy, birthing-process care, mother-baby care and early 
        education have been strengthened. </b></p>
      <p><b>The Chinese Government has expended great efforts and attained remarkable 
        achievements in helping disabled children recover maximum health and in 
        enhancing their abilities to participate in social life. </b></p>
      <p><b>China has actively developed the ``Three Recoveries'' program (rectifying 
        polio sequelae, training deaf children in hearing and speech and performing 
        cataract operations). By the end of 1995, China had rectified 360,000 
        children of polio sequelae (a success rate of 98 percent), helped more 
        than 60,000 deaf children recover their hearing and speech abilities (10 
        percent of which had entered regular kindergartens and elementary schools 
        to receive regular education), had provided 30,000 poor-sighted children 
        with sight aids and helped 100,000 mentally retarded children enhance 
        their cognitive capacity and self-suciency. At present, China has established 
        the National Rehabilitation Research Center for Deaf Children, in addition 
        to 26 provincial-level rehabilitation centers for deaf children and over 
        1,000 rehabilitation stations, kindergartens and training classes for 
        disabled children. </b></p>
      <p><b>Community rehabilitation service systems for disabled children also 
        have been set up. China has fully used the urban-rural three-level network 
        of health services to develop community rehabilitation, helping most disabled 
        children in grassroots areas enjoy basic rehabilitation services. Moreover, 
        under the leadership of local governments at different levels, community 
        rehabilitation leading groups have been founded, consisting of public 
        health departments, civil administration departments, disabled persons' 
        federations and other relevant departments, which coordinate and cooperate 
        with each other to mutually formulate community rehabilitation plans and 
        manage their implementation. </b></p>
      <p><b>In 1982, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs started to cooperate 
        with the UNICEF in the Community Rehabilitation for Disabled Children 
        project. By the end of 1994, the rehabilitation network for disabled children 
        covered 32 cities and counties in 23 provinces of the country and systematically 
        trained disabled children's parents and rehabilitation instructors. These 
        efforts were successful in effectively improving the management of the 
        rehabilitation work for disabled children. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Education for Disabled Children </font></b></p>
      <p><b>Regarding disabled children's education, the Education Law, the Compulsory 
        Education Law, the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons and the Regulations 
        for Disabled Persons' Education clearly and completely state the duties, 
        characteristics, guiding principles of development, channels for running 
        schools and methods of instruction, etc. According to relevant laws and 
        regulations, the education of disabled children is compulsory. </b></p>
      <p><b>After years of efforts, China has formed a compulsory education set-up 
        for disabled children, which takes special-education schools as the backbone 
        and special-education classes attached to, and attendance of individual 
        disabled students in, ordinary schools as the main body. By the end of 
        1995, China had set up 1,379 special-education schools for the disabled, 
        an increase of 400 percent over 1980; there were also 6,510 special-education 
        classes attached to ordinary schools with 296,000 disabled students (including 
        those attending regular schools), an increase of 800 percent over 1980. 
        In 1995 the national average school enrollment rate of blind, deaf and 
        mentally retarded children reached 60 percent; in the economically developed 
        areas enrollment reached 80 percent. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Social Environment </font></b></p>
      <p><b>The Chinese Government has done a great deal of work to mobilize various 
        circles in society to care for, in various manners, the development of 
        disabled children, to greatly encourage the spirit of unceasing self-improvement 
        among disabled children and to advocate the social virtues of unity, friendship 
        and mutual aid. The Chinese media actively reports on the life conditions 
        of disabled children and the work concerning the disabled. Virtually all 
        radio and TV stations offer specific programs for disabled children, compounded 
        with sign language and captions. To create a favorable social environment 
        for disabled children's survival and development, China has worked out 
        and gradually implemented Standards for the Design of Urban Roads and 
        Buildings for the Disabled's Convenience, which require obstacle-free 
        structures when municipal works and various buildings are constructed. 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>Since 1991, the Chinese Government has legally established National 
        Helping-the-Disabled Day on the third Sunday in May every year. Children 
        actively take part in Young Pioneers Helping the Disabled activities while 
        young people enthusiastically participate in Volunteers Helping the Disabled 
        activities. Meantime, the broad masses of people all over the country 
        also widely participate in various activities to help the disabled. Closely 
        looked after by the government, disabled children have also been receiving 
        many types of help and services from various circles in society. </b></p>

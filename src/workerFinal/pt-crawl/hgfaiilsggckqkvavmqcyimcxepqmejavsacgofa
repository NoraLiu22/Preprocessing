        early as 1950, Concert Hall Society, Inc., advertised in Schwann Long 
        Playing Record Catalog, the new monthly publication for music listeners 
        and record collectors published by W. Schwann (William). Initially the 
        advertisements were on half pages but from December 1950 on these were 
        full page ads on the first page of the catalog. The ads say that Concert 
        Hall is located at 250 West 57th St, New York 19, NY. Concert Hall was 
        the record company of two brothers, Samuel and David Josefowitz, two well 
        educated people - David studied the violin.</font></p>

        The label was Rarities Collection and I purchased quite a few including 
        Handel's Israel in Egypt with Goehr (which I don't think was CHS), Shostakovich' 
        Preludes and Fugues performed by the composer, and La Boh&egrave;me with

        the June 1952 issue of Schwann Long Playing Record Catalog, a full page 
        advertisement of the Handel Society appeared instead of the Concert Hall 
        ad. The Handel Society was located at the same address and was a sister 
        label of Concert Hall and was of course maintained by the brothers Samuel 
        and David Josefowitz. <br>
        The Handel Society label had been introduced in the fall of 1951 and in 
        December of that year the first two releases with references HDL-1 and 
        HDL-2 were listed: Israel in Egypt and Acis and Galatea respectively, 
        conducted by Walter Goehr and with singers Margareth Ritchie (soprano), 
        William Herbert (tenor), Richard Lewis (tenor), and Trevor Anthony (bass). 
        Performances of various Handel Societies in the US, Great Britain and 
        the Netherlands were recorded.</font></p>

        third label was introduced, Chamber Music Society (Long Play True Sound 
        Transcription). The label was first listed in Schwann of June 1952. The 
        label stated 'licensed by Concert Hall Society for Noncommercial Use'. 
        Like the early Concert Hall Society pressings, the Chamber Music Society 
        disks were pressed on red vinyl. On CM-4 Beethoven's Quintet Op. 29 is 
        released with the <font color="#FF9900">Pascal Quartet and Walter Gerhard</font> 
        (2nd viola). But a few years later this same recording was issued on Concert 
        Hall CHS 1214 despite the fact that the Chamber Music Society label continued 
        to be listed in the record catalogs. </font></font></p>

        catalog, I found, is the recording of cellist Janos Starker performing 
        the Sonata for Violoncello and Piano No. 1 in E minor Op. 38 of Johannes 
        Brahms with, on Side One, Violin Sonata No. 1 Op. 78, performed by Louis 
        Kaufman. Kaufman is accompanied by pianist Helene Pignari. Starker's pianist 
        is Abba Bogin. Both The Long Player and Schwann Long Playing Record Catalog 
        do not mention this record. </font><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#CCCCCC"><IMG SRC="starker-bogin-kaufman_233.jpg" WIDTH="233" HEIGHT="233" ALIGN="RIGHT" VSPACE="3" HSPACE="3" ALT=" "title="Janos Starker and Louis Kaufman play Brahms "></FONT><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
        </FONT><font color="#CCCCCC" size="3">A Starker recording with Bogin is 
        first mentioned in the Spring of 1954, and that one is released on the 
        Period label, reference SPL 593. When Starker started recording for Period, 
        either the CMS recording was bought from the Chamber Music Society or 
        the Sonata No. 1 was recorded anew. <br>
        I still have to check if the recording of the First Sonata on Period is 
        that of the early Chamber Music Society disk. The Period recording of 
        the Cello Sonatas of Brahms were available in Great Britain on the Nixa 
        label (PLP 593). These same performances were eventually issued by Everest 
        on SDBR 3235 (in electronic simulated stereo) and on the Saga label (XID 
        5164).<br>
        Janos Starker also appeared on the Chamber Music Society 3 LP Set CMS-32, 
        with violinist Agi Jambor and altist Victor Aitay, performing the complete 
        Mozart Trios. Also this set is never listed as a Chamber Music Society 
        recording, but is already available in the Spring of 1951 as Period 521/2/3. 
        Could it be that the Chamber Music Society borrowed these recordings to 
        press a short run as a special offer for buyers of Chamber Music Society 
        LP's?</font></FONT></p>

        According to The Gramophone Shop Encyclopedia of Recorded Music (New York, 
        1948), the label did not make recordings with Walter Goehr or the Pascal 
        String Quartet in the early years. Goehr then recorded for <font color="#FF9900">Victor</font> 
        and <font color="#FF9900">Parlophone (Columbia in USA)</font>, the Pascal

        of course that shipment was less hazardous if compared to sending shellac

        Tonhalle Orchestra, Winterthur Symphony Orchestra, Utrecht Symphony and 
        Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra, and on occasion Haarlem Symphony Orchestra 
        (Haarlemse Orkest Vereniging). The fact that these records are being listed

        early as 1952 - Concert Hall Society issues were released in England on 
        the Nixa label by the company that also dealt with Vanguard recordings. 
        The prefix for 12 inch records was CLP, a prefix later used by HMV. Nixa 
        stopped pressing Concert Hall records in the second half of the 1950s, 
        probably around 1956. From then on Concert Hall was registered as a label. 
        The Concert Hall editions differed in style from the US issues. At right

        Ernest Bloch (Four Episodes for Chamber Orchestra), Sch&ouml;nberg (Begleitmusik),

        CM-LE-16 contained a program of relatively modern music. The liner notes

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">In 
        1951 and 1952 when David and Sam Josefowitz launched their Handel Society 
        and Chamber Music Society labels, they had the brilliant idea to start 
        the MMS subscription label in the US. Potential clients were lured into 
        buying a sampler disc at an affordable introductory price, or were offered 
        a selection of records at $ 1.00 a piece or even just one dollar.<font color="#FFCC33"><br>
        In the early advertisements the series is named <FONT COLOR="#CCFFFF">Musical 
        Masterworks Society</FONT>. Like Don Gabor with his Masterworks label, 
        obviously also the Josefowitz brothers were told by Columbia that the 
        word &quot;Masterwork&quot; could not be used in the name. &quot;Masterworks&quot; 
        had been in use by Columbia already since the nineteen thirties and was 
        registered. Gabor changed Masterworks into Masterseal. The Josefowitz 
        brothers changed Masterworks into Masterpiece and the undertaking is then 
        called Musical Masterpiece Society.</font><br>
        The success of MMS makes it necessary to find larger offices. Maintaining 
        a series with a growing number of subscribers asks for more administrative 
        office work and also for manual labor. And eventually more space for storing 
        records was needed. The move is effectuated a year later in the spring 
        of 1953. The new address is 507 West 56th St. The growth of the company 
        leads to another move two years later. Then the offices are relocated 
        to a building at 45 Columbus Ave. In 1957 the address did change again. 
        Now it was 71, 5th Avenue.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Famous 
        critic and writer Olin Downes began his introduction of Music in Your 
        Home as follows: <br>
        &quot;A boon to humanity has been the extraordinary development of the 
        recording of music which in the course of the first half of this our twentieth 
        century has incalculably changed and enriched the culture of the world. 
        These records by scientific process of catching and transfixing invisible 
        sound upon tapes and discs, have put virtually all the music that we know 
        today within the reach of everybody, And this establishes the democracy 
        of music as it never could have been attained by any other means. In the 
        past we had to assemble professionally skilled performers to evoke from 
        the pot-hooks on music paper the composer's short-hand, the exquisite 
        sounds that he had envisioned and created for us. (...) It is no longer 
        so.&quot; <br>
        The brochure contains one of the last writings of Olin Downes. It mentions 
        Copyright 1954. Olin Downes died the following year.</font></p>

        Italy. The biggest operation is in West Germany. There most of the records

        Concert Hall claims a memberships stateside of 300,000 and a European 
        membership of 250,000. <br>
        The article suggests that Musical Masterpiece Society was set up in Europe 
        in 1954 which is substantiated by the MMS listings in &quot;Discopedie 
        1955&quot; compiled by Dutch journalist and reviewer Ralph N. Degens who 
        gave the year of release of many recordings. The 1955 catalog contains 
        several MMS recordings released in 1954, yet Concert Hall Society recordings 
        were still listed in this first edition of &quot;Discopedie&quot;. However 
        in the 1956 supplementary edition no Concert Hall discs were listed and 
        obviously they were no longer available.</font></p>

        Jazz Sampler with material taken from 12&quot; LPs. The thinly pressed

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">The 
        name Musical Masterpiece Society could easily be used in many countries, 
        except in France, for the French are very culture conscious, and still 
        are, even if they like speaking &quot;franglais&quot; today. If MMS would 
        be translated into French, it would be called &quot;La soci&eacute;t&eacute; 
        musicale du chef-d'oeuvre&quot; or something similar. That sounds rather 
        haughty and is not very much inviting to join the club. However, the word 
        &quot;club&quot; could not be used as in France there existed &quot;Le 
        club fran&ccedil;ais du disque&quot; and &quot;Club national du disque&quot; 
        (CND). So a brilliant, yet somewhat similar label name was thought up 
        and in France the MMS recordings were released on &quot;Guilde internationale 
        du disque&quot;, a name which had a nice flavor that suggested importance 
        and quality. The license agreement with the Classic label was terminated. 
        Yet the original Concert Hall recordings released on the Classic label 
        were still listed in the French catalog &quot;Disques de longue dur&eacute;e&quot; 
        issued in the fall of 1955. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="6" color="#CCCCCC">Success</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">In 
        France the establishment of the subscription series started already in 
        1954, according to Jean-Pierre Mathieu from Paris who grew up with the 
        records bought by his parents and the gramophone offered by the &quot;Guilde 
        internationale du disque&quot; which they acquired in 1958. The French 
        subsidiary was opened in 1954. The records could also be bought directly 
        in shops. Every important city had one or more Guilde du Disque shops. 
        The most famous shop in Paris was at 222, rue de Rivoli, Paris 8&egrave;me. 
        The success of La Guilde Internationale du Disque resulted in 1967 in 
        opening a huge center in Evreux in Normandy. The Paris address was still 
        operating in the early 1980s and in 1986 La Guilde merged with Edition 
        Atlas, Mathieu told.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC"><br>
        The success of Guilde internationale du disque was immense and may have 
        inspired other entrepreneurs to start around 1958 La Guilde Europ&eacute;enne 
        du Microsillon which issued popular and classical music as well. The label 
        lasted into the 1960s. It is not sure if G.E.M. found its origin in &quot;Les 
        m&eacute;lomanes francais&quot; which had pianist Serge Petitgirard on 
        their rostrum.</font> </p>

        Josefowitz enterprise also landed in Spain where on the 5th floor of the 
        building at Calle Alcal No. 45, Madrid, &quot;Club Internacional del 
        Disco (Espaa)&quot; held office. The Spanish label did not have much 
        in common with the Concert Hall and Musical Masterpiece Society label 
        design. It looked as if somewhat inspired by RCA's French label design 
        as you can see below. At right the box of Beethoven's First Symphony, 
        Jena Symphony and Ninth Symphony - Novena Sinfonia con Coro - with Walter

        and singers Corry Bijster, Elisabeth Pritchard, David Garen, and Leonard 
        Wolovsky. The records were pressed by IBEROFON S.A.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">The 
        MMS discs had the small ten inch format and they were extremely thin if 
        compared to the heavy 12 inch Concert Hall pressings. So the MMS discs 
        were cheaper to manufacture as less plastic was involved. For the covers 
        a standard lay out was designed. Only the names of the composers, the 
        titles, and the performers had to be printed on this 'generic' sleeve. 
        Thus another vast saving was made as no additional well chosen art work 
        had to be commissioned - as illustrated by the Concert Hall cover of CHS 
        1155 with El Cid (Massenet) and Tzar Sultan Suite (Rimsky-Korsakov) conducted 
        by <font color="#FF9900">Henk Spruit</font> and the Saint-Sa&euml;ns program 
        on CHS 1178. Furthermore it was decided that no full color printing was 
        necessary as music lovers did not have to be persuaded through artistic 
        covers to buy this or that recording. The low price of the product and 
        the convenience of receiving the discs in the mail were the main incentives. 
        At right label and cover of MMS-30, the lightweight MMS release of the 
        original heavy Concert Hall Society disc of the Mendelssohn recordings 
        with Frank Pelleg. <br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Starting 
        the Handel Society label in 1951 was probably inspired by the existence 
        of the Haydn Society from Boston. The Handel Society was not a strict 
        American affair in that respect that only a few recordings were made with 
        conductors <font color="#FF9900">Robert Hull</font> and <font color="#FF9900">Maurice 
        Abravanel</font> as the advertisement at the beginning of this web page 
        tells. Judas Maccabaeus with Maurice Abravanel conducting the Utah University 
        Chorus and Orchestra was issued on Handel HDL-12. This recording was released 
        in France on the Classic label and in 1955 in the Netherlands on Concert 
        Hall HDL 12. Alexander's Feast was recorded with Prof. Robert Hull conducting 
        the Cornell University Chorus and the 'Handel Society Orchestra'. This 
        issue was also released in France on the Classic label. Harpsichordist 
        <font color="#FF9900">Frank Pelleg</font> performed the Handel concertos 
        for harpsichord on the label. Pelleg was accompanied by Walter Goehr conducting 
        the Orchestra of Radio Z&uuml;rich. <br>
        The Handel label did not flourish, probably because all the energy went 
        into the main activities of the MMS subscription series. And of course 
        the number of specific collectors who would consult a list of Handel's 
        music was too small, no doubt, to keep the label economically alive. As 
        a result, in Schwann Long Playing Record Catalog of June 1957, the Handel 
        Society listings were marked with a small diamond which meant that the 
        recordings were - as the catalog stated in the legend - &quot;to be discontinued 
        by mfr. as soon as supply is gone; will be dropped from future issues 
        of this catalog&quot;.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFCC"><b><br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Not 
        only all Handel Society recordings were deleted from Schwann, but also 
        a number of Concert Hall disks. At the same time new recordings were listed, 
        like CHS 1501 with pianist <font color="#FF9900">Philippe Entremont</font> 
        and conductor <font color="#FF9900">Carl Bamberger</font> performing Symphonic 
        Variations (C&eacute;sar Franck) and Piano Concerto No. 2 (Sergei Rachmaninoff) 
        with the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra. This one and other new recordings 
        were also listed in the small catalog accompanying the 12&quot; Sampler 
        from 1957. Such a sampler for the American market was quite a luxurious 
        item if compared to the light weight and flimsy Dutch sampler with music 
        of Bach, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Berlioz. A thin 10 inch 
        disc was already much more than the usual 7 inch disc named &quot;Klassiek 
        Kompas&quot; with Szymon Goldberg conducting the Nethelands Chamber Orchestra

        Several American Concert Hall disks were reissued later on the MMS label, 
        like the Beethoven Quartets and those of Mozart performed by the Pascal 
        String Quartet. <br>

        on the French Chant du Monde label. When checking the deletions in Schwann 
        June 1957 edition many familiar names and recordings came up. But also 
        a few lesser known musicians and works:</font></p>

        Nelson wrote to me that she had done research on the subject and had found 
        that the Concert Hall catalog was sold to Crowell-Collier Publishing Company 
        according to Billboard and New York Times. She writes that in July, 1956, 
        Concert Hall Society and its various American offshoots were purchased 
        by the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company (publisher of Colliers and 
        many other magazines as well as Colliers Encyclopedia) which had its 
        own record club division. The following year, New Yorks Record Hunter 
        advertised Concert Hall Society recordings at a reduced price ($1.97) 
        noting that &quot;These 12 singles and albums have been discontinued 
        by the manufacturer, and may never again be available from the manufacturer 
        at any price . . . (New York Times, 24 February 1957, p. 119).</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">I 
        found that the sale to Crowell-Collier was also mentioned in High Fidelity 
        Magazine of September, 1956, page 51. Billboard magazine had already reported 
        on the deal in their August 4, 1956 issue were it was stated that <font color="#FFFFFF">"Crowel 
        Collier purchased the American record interests of the Josefowitz family. 
        These included the Concert Hall Society label and five mail-order record 
        club operations: Musical Masterpieces Society, Opera Society, Jazztone 
        Society, Chamber Music Society and Handel Society. The deal (...) involved 
        an amount of seven figures (...)."</font> Spelling of Masterpieces with 
        's' is Billboard's.<br>
        The deal also included an immediate entry in the pre-recorded tape business 
        which had already been planned by the brothers. After Collier will release 
        12 tapes immediately, 6 new tapes will be issued each month. This deal 
        only effected the American market. In Canada the brothers continued as 
        usual and they will continue to be involved in the business in Europe. 
        There the Josefowitz brothers do not run the business directly but own 
        a substantial number of shares. They also will be involved in the American 
        Crowell Collier enterprise as advisors.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">In 
        High Fidelity Magazine of September, 1956, Roland Gelatt wrote on his 
        Music Makers page about the sale of the Concert Hall label and added that 
        Concert Hall's chief fall program centered on its new series of binaural 
        tape recordings. As several Concert Hall recordings appeared on the Musical 
        Masterpiece Society's label, it is clear that not all tapes and plates 
        were sold to Crowell-Collier. An example is the Mendelssohn-Pelleg recording. 
        The sale may have prompted the editors of Schwann Record Catalog to stop 
        listing the label, while the competitor The Longplayer continued listing 
        Concert Hall in the 1959 editions of their catalogs.</font></p>

        on a number of MMS disks was reviewed, at least in the Netherlands. An 
        example was <font color="#FF9900">Paul Tortelier</font>'s recording of 
        Dvorak's Cello Concerto on MMS 13. The reviewer complained about the technical 
        aspects of the recording (bad microphone placement and &quot;hard&quot; 
        sound), but in the end he praised Tortelier for his playing. When it was 
        clear that the records could only be obtained through membership of the 
        club, the MMS disks were no longer listed in record catalogs and magazines. 
        One exception is that they were listed in &quot;Discopedie&quot;, but 
        this was a publication by a Dutch reviewer, but not an official catalog 
        issued on a regular basis.<br>
        Dutch record monthly &quot;Luister...!&quot; refused to review the MMS 
        releases when they were only available to members of the &quot;Klassieke 
        Luisterkring&quot; (Classical Listening Circle) which issued a monthly 
        magazine &quot;De Kring&quot; which was in fact a small 8 page booklet. 
        It listed the records on offer accompanied by &quot;reviews&quot; written 
        by the MMS sales department. If the records would have been positively 
        reviewed in magazines, it would have been mere advertising for MMS by 
        urging the reader to subscribe to the club. That would give MMS an advantage 
        over regular record labels.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFCC"><b><br>

        month a list of records was sent to each and every member of the club 
        who could chose the recordings he or she was interested in. Then these 
        records were sent to the member's home and even then members were allowed 
        to return some or even all of the records offered. Only if over a longer 
        period of time no records had been bought, MMS would cancel a membership. 
        The small magazine featured also a few world music titles. Also jazz recordings 
        were offered from time to time, issued on the Jazztone label.<br>

        operas were performed in front of the MMS microphones. Of course, some 
        performances - like the earlier Russian recordings - were remastered from 
        tapes made available by other record companies or were obtained from radio

          In early advertisements Concert Hall Society promised that &quot;This 
          recording was issued in a LIMITED EDITION of only 3,000 copies, of which 
          this is number ....&quot; No more than 3000 copies will be pressed of 
          a specific record. They obviously mean that for every new batch of 3000 
          records a new plate will be used. The statement suggests that other 
          manufacturers press more than 3000 records using the same plate. There 
          are of course companies that did so. Remington Records is an example. 
          But the technicians and production managers of companies that produce 
          quality records of classical music and jazz know that in principle no 
          more than 1500 or 2000 records at the most should be pressed using the 
          same plate. Quality control is the only way to determine if a plate 
          can be used for another few hundred records. The rule is if more records 
          are pressed, the matrix will get dull and the records will sound adequately. 
          It is possible to compensate for the loss of high frequencies and detail 
          by applying equalization, by boosting the high frequency content and 
          cut a disc with restricted dynamics resulting in a lean bass. In that 
          way more music can be engraved per side and the high frequencies will 
          be more prominent. Choosing a vinyl compound with a specific hardness 
          can also give the suggestion of high fidelity when played on simple 
          gramophones. The measures taken are audible in the final product. Most

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Already 
          in the early Concert Hall LP days, when the discs were listed in catalogs 
          and were reviewed in magazines, the music critics had much to say about 
          the quality of the recorded sound, the orchestras and the final product 
          spinning on their turntables. Sometimes the quality of the work of the 
          recording technician, the pressings and the quality of the playing of 
          musicians were confounded. But in general most knew well what they were 
          writing about and were not always pleased with the Concert Hall discs. 
          However in those days amplifiers had tone controls for bass and treble 
          which often had to be used generously. An example. When reviewing The 
          Orchestral Suites of Tchaikovsky, well directed by Walter Goehr, High 
          Fidelity Magazine's J.F. Indcox wrote: &quot;Concert Hall's sound is 
          rather undernourished, lacking in resonance, and the balance is not 
          always ideal.&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="6" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Praise</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFCC">Walter 
          Goehr conducted Suites Nos. 1 (CHS 1121) and 2 (CHS 1122) with the Winterthur 
          Symphony. There existed already a Westminster recording of Suite No. 
          3, therefor the Winterthur SO was renamed Concert Hall Symphony Orchestra 
          for the Third Suite (CHS 1144). While the reviewer's description applied 
          to the recordings of the Suites, the same quality could be encountered 
          on several other Concert Hall discs with symphonic music and concertos. 
          Chamber music recordings often favor a better sound. In High Fidelity 
          magazine of December 1957 Harold C. Schonberg wrote about Schumann's 
          Piano Quintet on MMS 41: &quot;On a much cheaper 10 inch disc, Hannes 
          Kann and the Pascal Quartet offer a well recorded, spirited performance 
          that is without eccentricity. I would put this in a best-buy category.&quot;

          In the Netherlands - in the nineteen fifties - the offices of MMS (Muzikale 
          Meesterwerken Serie N.V.) are first located at Herengracht 536, Amsterdam, 
          but a year later at Paulus Potterstraat 12, Amsterdam. For the convenience 
          of the subscribers and for promoting the sales, there where four shops 
          where one could register for membership and where members could buy 
          records. In Amsterdam of course, at the aforementioned address, in Rotterdam 
          at Westblaak 26, in The Hague at Torenstraat 136, and in Utrecht at 
          Zadelstraat 17, to be precise. <br>
          When in September 1958 the stereo record was introduced more record 
          companies and record clubs found it too much of an investment to set 
          up a catalog with stereo recordings on short notice. One of them was 
          MMS.<br>
          <font color="#FFCC00">In the summer of 1959 the Concert Hall Society 
          label was also deleted from The Long Player, the competitor of Schwann. 
          The label name will reappear much later, in the nineteen seventies, 
          presenting the Synchro Stereo issues. </font></font></p>

        issued by Crowel Collier) are also mentioned and often get positive reviews 
        in case the sound quality is good and/or the performance is noteworthy. 
        An example, in the issue of July 1957, Symphony No. 2 of Brahms in the 
        performance of the Frankfurt Opera Orchestra conducted by Carl Bamberger, 
        receives praise and is more or less preferred over the RCA Charles Munch 
        recording. The Frankfurt Orchestra is less accurate, but Bamberger's performance 
        is more individual, provocative, and dramatic. The Concert Hall recording 
        gives &quot;a boldly sculptured delineation&quot; as the reviewer writes. 
        Philippe Entremont's recording of Piano Concerto No. 2 is another release 
        on tape. It was recorded before Entremont joint CBS (Columbia). There 
        were other issues on tape. A few will be added later. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFCC"><b><br>

          label of Sam and David Josefowitz, well before the trio started recording 
          for Phonogram (as the Philips record company was then named). One of 
          the first Philips recordings was the disk with the Complete (Two) Trios 
          of Mendelssohn, still with Daniel Guilet, issued on 802 802 LY (1967).</font></p>

          <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On November 
          17, 2011, Menahem Pressler gave a very enlightening masterclass in the 
          Small Auditorium (Kleine Zaal) of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Before 
          he began his instructions, his biography <i><b>&quot;Always Something 
          New to Discover - Menahem Pressler and the Beaux Arts Trio&quot;</b></i>, 
          was officially presented to him by Mrs. Cynthia Wilson. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">She 
          had compiled and written the history of the Beaux Arts Trio.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">When 
          the masterclass had ended, I was privileged to converse for a short 
          while with the eminent pianist while he was signing copies of his biography 
          for eager visitors, and one for me too of course. He was very friendly 
          and did not mind at all me asking him a few questions. I told him that 
          at home we always listen to the wonderful recordings of the Beaux Arts 
          Trio of the Trios of Joseph Haydn. I praised these recordings, not because 
          I wanted to flatter him, but because these recorded performancers are 
          exquisite and show not only the musicality of the Beaux Arts Trio but 
          also the very beauty of the Trios as no other group could perform them. 
          <br>
          I also asked the maestro about the Concert Hall Society label and also 
          if he knew David and Samuel Josefowitz. &quot;Knew!?&quot;, he said. 
          &quot;I <i>know</i> them!&quot; he said with emphasis.<br>
          He also told me that in the early years the trio, of which he was the 
          pianist of course, recorded a Mendelssohn Trio and Dvorak's Dumky Trio 
          for the <i>Concert Hall Society</i> label. I asked him: &quot;That was 
          the Guilet Trio?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot;, he said, &quot;with Daniel 
          Guilet, he came from the Calvet Quartet, you know. And with Bernard 
          Greenhouse. It was quite a hectic, three hour session in which we had 
          to complete the recording. But later we received a Grand Prix du Disque 
          for these performances!&quot; Quite unexpectedly.<br>
          Apparently the execution had the right drive and intensity. If they 
          had only known beforehand ... The recording was made in a church in 
          France. <br>
          Pressler also told me that he recorded Chopin's Concerto No. 1 with 
          David Josefowitz conducting. That too was a hectic affair. David conducted 
          at a rather high tempo which Menahem Pressler did not like too much. 
          He added as a sort of mitigating circumstance: &quot;He is very fond 
          of the Concerto, you know&quot;. The disc also contains Andante spianato 
          &amp; Grande polonaise. The reference number is SMS 2408.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Inspired 
          by the LP boxed sets of Reader's Digest and RCA, the Concert Hall record 
          label compiled their earlier released recordings and bought existing 
          recordings from other labels to be issued together in thick and heavy 
          albums. Dutch editions were: &quot;De wereld van de opera&quot; (The 
          World of the Opera, pressed in Germany and issued there as &quot;Zauberwelt 
          der Oper&quot;), and &quot;De mooiste muziek van alle tijden&quot; (The 
          Most Beautiful Music of All Time, pressed in France by EMI). The booklet 
          of the latter edition contained several pictures of artists.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>For 
          French subscribers, La Guilde Internationale du Disque produced special 
          historical documentaries. At left the linen album containing a book 
          and 3 x 12&quot; LPs of &quot;La r&eacute;volution fran&ccedil;aise&quot;, 
          the French Revolution. Reference M-2262. Actors read the commentary. 
          Andr&eacute; Charlin, the recording engineer who is famous for his use 
          of electrostatic microphones, made the sound recordings of musical excerpts 
          and pieces by B&eacute;court, Berlioz, Cambini, Catel, Cherubini, Dalayrac, 
          Gaveaux, G&eacute;bauer, Gossec, G&eacute;try, Lesueur, Mehul, and music 
          by a number of anonymous composers. The French Revolution received a 
          &quot;Grand Prix - Acad&eacute;mie du disque fran&ccedil;ais&quot;. 
          </b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Other 
          releases were about World War One (La grande guerre - M 2344), Napoleon 
          Bonaparte (M-2265), The Century of Louis XIV (Le si&egrave;cle de Louis 
          VIV). It is reported that no more than 5000 copies of each of these 
          editions were made. They were probably also bought by schools.</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
          happened to the Concert Hall Society label in the end? Jean-Pierre Mathieu 
          wrote: &quot;In France, <b>la Guilde Internationale du Disque</b> was 
          sold to Editions Atlas in 1987-88 who belong currently to the Italian 
          Group Agostini. From time to time they reissue some recordings on CD.&quot; 
          Does this mean that also original Concert Hall recordings are owned 
          by Agostini? That needs further investigation. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
          edition with collected recordings was The Jazz Story - from New Orleans 
          to modern Jazz with extensive notes in English and French (Le monde 
          du jazz de la Nouvelle-Orleans au Jazz moderne). It was a 10 LP Box 
          with historic recordings of many artists like Barny Bigard, Jack Teagarden, 
          Paul Barbarin, Fletcher Henderson, Benny Goodman, Dexter Gordon, Oscar 
          Pettiford, Rex Stewart, Art Tatum, and artists who also can be found 
          on Don Gabor's Continental label, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughn, Red 
          Norvo. And there are of course recordings of Charlie Parker made in 
          1946 and 1947 by Ross Russell for his Dial label catalog and the recordings 
          of Mezz Mezzrow's King Jazz record label which were also acquired by 
          Concert Hall Society.<BR>

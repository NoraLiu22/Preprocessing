/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        the following sketch of the characteristics of vegetable life in the equatorial 
        zone, it is not intended to enter into any scientific details or to treat 
        the subject in the slightest degree from a botanical point of view; but 
        merely to describe those general features of vegetation which are almost 
        or quite peculiar to this region of the globe, and which are so general 
        as to be characteristic of the greater part of it rather than of any particular 
        country or continent within its limits.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The 
        Equatorial Forest-Belt and its Causes.--</i>With but few and unimportant 
        exceptions a great forest band from a thousand to fifteen hundred miles 
        in width girdles the earth at the equator, clothing hill, plain, and mountain 
        with an evergreen mantle. Lofty peaks and precipitous ridges are sometimes 
        bare, but often the woody covering continues to a height of eight or ten 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 28]]</font> thousand feet, as in some of the 
        volcanic mountains of Java and on portions of the Eastern Andes. Beyond 
        the forests both to the north and south, we meet first with woody and 
        then open country, soon changing into arid plains or even deserts which 
        form an almost continuous band in the vicinity of the two tropics. On 
        the line of the tropic of Cancer we have, in America the deserts and dry 
        plains of New Mexico; in Africa the Sahara; and in Asia, the Arabian deserts, 
        those of Beloochistan and Western India, and further east the dry plains 
        of North China and Mongolia. On the tropic of Capricorn we have, in America 
        the Grand Chaco desert and the Pampas; in Africa the Kalahari desert and 
        the dry plains north of the Limpopo; while the deserts and waterless plains 
        of Central Australia complete the arid zone. These great contrasts of 
        verdure and barrenness occurring in parallel bands all round the globe, 
        must evidently depend on the general laws which determine the distribution 
        of moisture over the earth, more or less modified by local causes. Without 
        going into meteorological details, some of which have been given in the 
        preceding chapter, the main facts may be explained by the mode in which 
        the great aerial currents are distributed. The trade winds passing over 
        the ocean from north-east to south-west with an oblique tendency towards 
        the equator, become saturated with vapour, and are ready to give out moisture 
        whenever they are forced upwards or in any other way have their temperature 
        lowered. The entire equatorial zone becomes thus charged with vapour-laden 
        air which is the primary necessity of a luxuriant vegetation. The surplus 
        air (produced by the meeting of the two trade winds) which is ever rising 
        in the equatorial <font color="990000">[[p. 29]]</font> belt and giving 
        up its store of vapour, flows off north and south as dry, cool air, and 
        descends to the earth in the vicinity of the tropics. Here it sucks up 
        whatever moisture it meets with and thus tends to keep this zone in an 
        arid condition. The trades themselves are believed to be supplied by descending 
        currents from the temperate zones, and these are at first equally dry 
        and only become vapour-laden when they have passed over some extent of 
        moist surface. At the solstices the sun passes vertically over the vicinity 
        of the tropics for several weeks, and this further aggravates the aridity; 
        and wherever the soil is sandy and there are no lofty mountain-chains 
        to supply ample irrigation the result is a more or less perfect desert. 
        Analogous causes, which a study of aerial currents will render intelligible, 
        have produced other great forest-belts in the northern and southern parts 
        of the temperate zones; but owing to the paucity of land in the southern 
        hemisphere these are best seen in North America and Northern Euro-Asia, 
        where they form the great northern forests of deciduous trees and of Conifer&aelig;. 
        These being comparatively well-known to us, will form the standard by 
        a reference to which we shall endeavour to point out and render intelligible 
        the distinctive characteristics of the equatorial forest vegetation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>General 
        Features of the Equatorial Forests.--</i>It is not easy to fix upon the 
        most distinctive features of these virgin forests, which nevertheless 
        impress themselves upon the beholder as something quite unlike those of 
        temperate lands, and as possessing a grandeur and sublimity altogether 
        their own. Amid the countless modifications in detail which these forests 
        present, we shall endeavour <font color="990000">[[p. 30]]</font> to point 
        out the chief peculiarities as well as the more interesting phenomena 
        which generally characterise them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        observer new to the scene would perhaps be first struck by the varied 
        yet symmetrical trunks, which rise up with perfect straightness to a great 
        height without a branch, and which, being placed at a considerable average 
        distance apart, give an impression similar to that produced by the columns 
        of some enormous building. Overhead, at a height, perhaps, of a hundred 
        feet, is an almost unbroken canopy of foliage formed by the meeting together 
        of these great trees and their interlacing branches; and this canopy is 
        usually so dense that but an indistinct glimmer of the sky is to be seen, 
        and even the intense tropical sunlight only penetrates to the ground subdued 
        and broken up into scattered fragments. There is a weird gloom and a solemn 
        silence, which combine to produce a sense of the vast--the primeval--almost 
        of the infinite. It is a world in which man seems an intruder, and where 
        he feels overwhelmed by the contemplation of the ever-acting forces, which, 
        from the simple elements of the atmosphere, build up the great mass of 
        vegetation which overshadows, and almost seems to oppress the earth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Characteristics 
        of the Larger Forest-trees.--</i>Passing from the general impression to 
        the elements of which the scene is composed, the observer is struck by 
        the great diversity of the details amid the general uniformity. Instead 
        of endless repetitions of the same forms of trunk such as are to be seen 
        in our pine, or oak, or beech woods, the eye wanders from one tree to 
        another and rarely detects two of the same species. All are tall and upright 
        columns, but they differ from each other more <font color="990000">[[p. 
        31]]</font> than do the columns of Gothic, Greek, and Egyptian temples. 
        Some are almost cylindrical, rising up out of the ground as if their bases 
        were concealed by accumulations of the soil; others get much thicker near 
        the ground like our spreading oaks; others again, and these are very characteristic, 
        sending out towards the base flat and wing-like projections. These projections 
        are thin slabs radiating from the main trunk, from which they stand out 
        like the buttresses of a Gothic cathedral. They rise to various heights 
        on the tree, from five or six, to twenty or thirty feet; they often divide 
        as they approach the ground, and sometimes twist and curve along the surface 
        for a considerable distance, forming elevated and greatly compressed roots. 
        These buttresses are sometimes so large that the spaces between them if 
        roofed over would form huts capable of containing several persons. Their 
        use is evidently to give the tree an extended base, and so assist the 
        subterranean roots in maintaining in an erect position so lofty a column 
        crowned by a broad and massive head of branches and foliage. The buttressed 
        trees belong to a variety of distinct groups. Thus, many of the Bombace&aelig; 
        or silk-cotton trees, several of the Leguminos&aelig;, and perhaps many 
        trees belonging to other natural orders, possess these appendages.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        is another form of tree, hardly less curious, in which the trunk, though 
        generally straight and cylindrical, is deeply furrowed and indented, appearing 
        as if made up of a number of small trees grown together at the centre. 
        Sometimes the junction of what seem to be the component parts, is so imperfect, 
        that gaps or holes are left by which you can see through the trunk in 
        various places. At first one is disposed to think this is <font color="990000">[[p. 
        32]]</font> caused by accident or decay, but repeated examination shows 
        it be due to the natural growth of the tree. The accompanying outline 
        sections of one of these trees that was cut down, exhibits its character.

        more than 200 feet high, but rather slender in proportion, and it was 
        by no means an extreme example of its class. This peculiar form is probably 
        produced by the downward growth of aerial roots, like some New Zealand 
        trees whose growth has been traced, and of whose different stages drawings 
        may be seen at the Library of the Linnean Society. These commence their 
        existence as parasitical climbers which take root in the fork of some 
        forest-tree and send down aerial roots which clasp round the stem that 
        upholds them. As these roots increase in size and grow together laterally 
        they cause the death of their foster-parent. The climber then grows rapidly, 
        sending out large branches above and spreading roots below, and as the 
        supporting tree decays away the aerial roots grow together and form a 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 33]]</font> new trunk, more or less furrowed 
        and buttressed, but exhibiting no other marks of its exceptional origin. 
        Aerial-rooted forest-trees--like that figured in my <i>Malay Archipelago</i> 
        (vol. i. p. 131)--and the equally remarkable fig-trees of various species, 
        whose trunks are formed by a miniature forest of aerial roots, sometimes 
        separate, sometimes matted together, are characteristic of the Eastern 
        tropics, but appear to be rare or altogether unknown in America, and can 
        therefore hardly be included among the general characteristics of the 
        equatorial zone.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides 
        the varieties of form, however, the tree-trunks of these forests present 
        many peculiarities of colour and texture. The majority are rather smooth-barked, 
        and many are of peculiar whitish, green, yellowish, or brown colours, 
        or occasionally nearly black. Some are perfectly smooth, others deeply 
        cracked and furrowed, while in a considerable number the bark splits off 
        in flakes or hangs down in long fibrous ribands. Spined or prickly trunks 
        (except of palms) are rare in the damp equatorial forests. Turning our 
        gaze upwards from the stems to the foliage, we find two types of leaf 
        not common in the temperate zone, although the great mass of the trees 
        offer nothing very remarkable in this respect. First, we have many trees 
        with large, thick, and glossy leaves, like those of the cherry-laurel 
        or the magnolia, but even larger, smoother, and more symmetrical. The 
        leaves of the Asiatic caoutchouc-tree (<i>Ficus elastica</i>), so often 
        cultivated in houses, is a type of this class, which has a very fine effect 
        among the more ordinary-looking foliage. Contrasted with this is the fine 
        pinnate foliage of some of the largest forest-trees which, seen far aloft 
        against <font color="990000">[[p. 34]] </font>the sky, looks as delicate 
        as that of the sensitive mimosa.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forest-trees 
        of Low Growth.--</i>The great trees we have hitherto been describing form, 
        however, but a portion of the forest. Beneath their lofty canopy there 
        often exists a second forest of moderate-sized trees, whose crowns, perhaps 
        forty or fifty feet high, do not touch the lowermost branches of those 
        above them. These are of course shade-loving trees, and their presence 
        effectually prevents the growth of any young trees of the larger kinds, 
        until, overcome by age and storms, some monarch of the forest falls down, 
        and, carrying destruction in its fall, opens up a considerable space, 
        into which sun and air can penetrate. Then comes a race for existence 
        among the seedlings of the surrounding trees, in which a few ultimately 
        prevail and fill up the space vacated by their predecessor. Yet beneath 
        this second set of medium-sized forest-trees there is often a third undergrowth 
        of small trees, from six to ten feet high, of dwarf palms, of tree-ferns, 
        and of gigantic herbaceous ferns. Coming to the surface of the ground 
        itself we find much variety. Sometimes it is completely bare, a mass of 
        decaying leaves and twigs and fallen fruits. More frequently it is covered 
        with a dense carpet of selaginella or other lycopodiace&aelig;, and these 
        sometimes give place to a variety of herbaceous plants, sometimes with 
        pretty, but rarely with very conspicuous flowers.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Flowering 
        Trunks and their Probable Cause.</i>--Among the minor but not unimportant 
        peculiarities that characterise these lofty forests, is the curious way 
        in which many of the smaller trees have their flowers situated on the 
        main trunk or larger branches instead <font color="990000">[[p. 35]]</font> 
        of on the upper part of the tree. The cacao-tree is a well-known example 
        of this peculiarity, which is not uncommon in tropical forests; and some 
        of the smaller trunks are occasionally almost hidden by the quantity of 
        fruit produced on them. One of the most beautiful examples of this mode 
        of flowering is a small tree of the genus <i>Polyalthea</i>, belonging 
        to the family of the custard-apples, not uncommon in the forests of North-western 
        Borneo. Its slender trunk, about fifteen or twenty feet high, was completely 
        covered with star-shaped flowers, three inches across and of a rich orange-red 
        colour, making the trees look as if they had been artificially decorated 
        with brilliant garlands. The recent discoveries as to the important part 
        played by insects in the fertilization of flowers offers a very probable 
        explanation of this peculiarity. Bees and butterflies are the greatest 
        flower-haunters. The former love the sun and frequent open grounds or 
        the flowery tops of the lofty forest-trees fully exposed to the sun and 
        air. The forest shades are frequented by thousands of butterflies, but 
        these mostly keep near the ground, where they have a free passage among 
        the tree-trunks and visit the flowering shrubs and herbaceous plants. 
        To attract these it is necessary that flowers should be low down and conspicuous. 
        If they grew in the usual way on the tops of these smaller trees overshadowed 
        by the dense canopy above them they would be out of sight of both groups 
        of insects, but being placed openly on the stems, and in the greatest 
        profusion, they cannot fail to attract the attention of the wandering 
        butterflies.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses 
        of Equatorial Forest-trees.--</i>Amid this immense variety of trees, the 
        natives have found out such as are <font color="990000">[[p. 36]]</font><b> 
        </b>best adapted to certain purposes. The wood of some is light and soft, 
        and is used for floats or for carving out rude images, stools, and ornaments 
        for boats and houses. The flat slabs of the buttresses are often used 
        to make paddles. Some of the trees with furrowed stems are exceedingly 
        strong and durable, serving as posts for houses or as piles on which the 
        water-villages are built. Canoes, formed from a trunk hollowed out and 
        spread open under the action of heat, require one kind of wood, those 
        built up with planks another; and, as the species of trees in these forests 
        are so much more numerous than the wants of a semi-civilized population, 
        there are probably a large number of kinds of timber which will some day 
        be found to be well adapted to the special requirements of the arts and 
        sciences. The products of the trees of the equatorial forests, notwithstanding 
        our imperfect knowledge of them, are already more useful to civilized 
        man than to the indigenous inhabitants. To mention only a few of those 
        whose names are tolerably familiar to us, we have such valuable woods 
        as mahogany, teak, ebony, lignum-vit&aelig;, purple-heart, iron-wood, 
        sandal-wood, and satin-wood; such useful gums as india-rubber, gutta-percha, 
        tragacanth, copal, lac, and dammar; such dyes as are yielded by log-wood, 
        brazil-wood, and sappan-wood; such drugs as the balsams of Capivi and 
        Tolu, camphor, benzoin, catechu or terra-japonica, cajuput oil, gamboge, 
        quinine, Angostura bark, quassia, and the urari and upas poisons; of spices 
        we have cloves, cinnamon, and nutmegs; and of fruits, brazil-nuts, tamarinds, 
        guavas, and the valuable cacao; while residents in our tropical colonies 
        enjoy the bread-fruit, avocado-pear, custard-apple, durian, mango, mangosteen, 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 37]] </font>soursop, papaw, and many others. 
        This list of useful products from the exogenous trees alone of the equatorial 
        forests, excluding those from the palms, shrubs, herbs, and creepers, 
        might have been multiplied many times over by the introduction of articles 
        whose names would be known only to those interested in special arts or 
        sciences; but imperfect as it is, it will serve to afford a notion of 
        the value of this vast treasure-house which is as yet but very partially 
        explored.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        Climbing Plants of the Equatorial Forests. </i>Next to the trees themselves 
        the most conspicuous and remarkable feature of the tropical forests is 
        the profusion of woody creepers and climbers that everywhere meet the 
        eye. They twist around the slenderer stems, they drop down pendent from 
        the branches, they stretch tightly from tree to tree, they hang looped 
        in huge festoons from bough to bough, they twist in great serpentine coils 
        or lie in entangled masses on the ground. Some are slender, smooth, and 
        root-like; others are rugged or knotted; often they are twined together 
        into veritable cables; some are flat like ribands, others are curiously 
        waved and indented. Where they spring from or how they grow is at first 
        a complete puzzle. They pass overhead from tree to tree, they stretch 
        in tight cordage like the rigging of a ship from the top of one tree to 
        the base of another, and the upper regions of the forest often seem full 
        of them without our being able to detect any earth-growing stem from which 
        they arise. The conclusion is at length forced upon us that these woody 
        climbers must possess the two qualities of very long life and almost indefinite 
        longitudinal growth, for by these suppositions alone can we explain their 
        characteristic features. The growth of <font color="990000">[[p. 38]]</font> 
        climbers, even more than all other plants, is upward towards the light. 
        In the shade of the forest they rarely or never flower, and seldom even 
        produce foliage; but when they have reached the summit of the tree that 
        supports them, they expand under the genial influence of light and air, 
        and often cover their foster-parent with blossoms not its own. Here, as 
        a rule, the climber's growth would cease; but the time comes when the 
        supporting tree rots and falls, and the creeper comes with it in torn 
        and tangled masses to the ground. But though its foster-parent is dead 
        it has itself received no permanent injury, but shoots out again till 
        it finds a fresh support, mounts another tree, and again puts forth its 
        leaves and flowers. In time the old tree rots entirely away and the creeper 
        remains tangled on the ground. Sometimes branches only fall and carry 
        a portion of the creeper tightly stretched to an adjoining tree; at other 
        times the whole tree is arrested by a neighbour to which the creeper soon 
        transfers itself in order to reach the upper light. When by the fall of 
        a branch the creepers are left hanging in the air, they may be blown about 
        by the wind and catch hold of trees growing up beneath them, and thus 
        become festooned from one tree to another. When these accidents and changes 
        have been again and again repeated the climber may have travelled very 
        far from its parent stem, and may have mounted to the tree tops and descended 
        again to the earth several times over. Only in this way does it seem possible 
        to explain the wonderfully complex manner in which these climbing plants 
        wander up and down the forest as if guided by the strangest caprices, 
        or how they become so crossed and tangled together in the wildest confusion.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        39]]</font> The variety in the length, thickness, strength and toughness 
        of these climbers, enables the natives of tropical countries to put them 
        to various uses. Almost every kind of cordage is supplied by them. Some 
        will stand in water without rotting, and are used for cables, for lines 
        to which are attached fish-traps, and to bind and strengthen the wooden 
        anchors used generally in the East. Boats and even large sailing vessels 
        are built, whose planks are entirely fastened together by this kind of 
        cordage skilfully applied to internal ribs. For the better kinds of houses, 
        smooth and uniform varieties are chosen, so that the beams and rafters 
        can be bound together with neatness, strength and uniformity, as is especially 
        observable among the indigenes of the Amazonian forests. When baskets 
        of great strength are required special kinds of creepers are used; and 
        to serve almost every purpose for which we should need a rope or a chain, 
        the tropical savage adopts some one of the numerous forest-ropes which 
        long experience has shown to have qualities best adapted for it. Some 
        are smooth and supple; some are tough and will bear twisting or tying; 
        some will last longest in salt water, others in fresh; one is uninjured 
        by the heat and smoke of fires, while another is bitter or otherwise prejudicial 
        to insect enemies.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides 
        these various kinds of trees and climbers which form the great mass of 
        the equatorial forests and determine their general aspect, there are a 
        number of forms of plants which are always more or less present, though 
        in some parts scarce and in others in great profusion, and which largely 
        aid in giving a special character <font color="990000">[[p. 40]]</font> 
        to tropical as distinguished from temperate vegetation. Such are the various 
        groups of palms, ferns, ginger-worts, and wild plantains, arums, orchids, 
        and bamboos; and under these heads we shall give a short account of the 
        part they take in giving a distinctive aspect to the equatorial forests.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palms</i>.--Although these are found throughout the tropics and a few species even 
        extend into the warmer parts of the temperate regions, they are yet so 
        much more abundant and varied within the limits of the region we are discussing 
        that they may be considered as among the most characteristic forms of 
        vegetation of the equatorial zone. They are, however, by no means generally 
        present, and we may pass through miles of forest without even seeing a 
        palm. In other parts they abound; either forming a lower growth in the 
        lofty forest, or in swamps and on hill-sides sometimes rising up above 
        the other trees. On river-banks they are especially conspicuous and elegant, 
        bending gracefully over the stream, their fine foliage waving in the breeze, 
        and their stems often draped with hanging creepers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        chief feature of the palm tribe consists in the cylindrical trunk crowned 
        by a mass of large and somewhat rigid leaves. They vary in height from 
        a few feet to that of the loftiest forest-trees. Some are stemless, consisting 
        only of a spreading crown of large pinnate leaves; but the great majority 
        have a trunk slender in proportion to its height. Some of the smaller 
        species have stems no thicker than a lead pencil, and four or five feet 
        high; while the great Mauritia of the Amazon has a trunk full two feet 
        in diameter, and more than 100 feet high. Some species probably reach 
        a height <font color="990000">[[p. 41]]</font> of 200 feet, for Humboldt 
        states that in South America he measured a palm, which was 192 English 
        feet high. The leaves of palms are often of immense size. Those of the 
        <i>Manicaria saccifera</i> of Para are thirty feet long and four or five 
        feet wide, and are not pinnate but entire and very rigid. Some of the 
        pinnate leaves are much larger, those of the <i>Raphia t&aelig;digera</i> 
        and <i>Maximiliana regia</i> being both sometimes more than fifty feet 
        long. The fan-shaped leaves of other species are ten or twelve feet in 
        diameter. The trunks of palms are sometimes smooth and more or less regularly 
        ringed, but they are frequently armed with dense prickles which are sometimes 
        eight inches long. In some species, the leaves fall to the ground as they 
        decay leaving a clean scar, but in most cases they are persistent, rotting 
        slowly away, and leaving a mass of fibrous stumps attached to the upper 
        part of the stem. This rotting mass forms an excellent soil for ferns, 
        orchids, and other semi-parasitical plants, which form an attractive feature 
        on what would otherwise be an unsightly object. The sheathing margins 
        of the leaves often break up into a fibrous material, sometimes resembling 
        a coarse cloth, and in other cases more like horsehair. The flowers are 
        not individually large, but form large spikes or racemes, and the fruits 
        are often beautifully scaled and hang in huge bunches which are sometimes 
        more than a load for a strong man. The climbing palms are very remarkable, 
        their tough, slender, prickly stems mounting up by means of the hooked 
        midribs of the leaves to the tops of the loftiest forest-trees, above 
        which they send up an elegant spike of foliage and flowers. The most important 
        are the American <i>Desmoncus</i> and the Eastern <i>Calamus</i>, the 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 42]]</font> latter being the well-known rattan 
        or cane of which chair-seats are made, from the Malay name &quot;rotang.&quot; 
        The rattan-palms are the largest and most remarkable of the climbing group. 
        They are very abundant in the drier equatorial forests, and more than 
        sixty species are known from the Malay Archipelago. The stems (when cleaned 
        from the sheathing leaves and prickles) vary in size from the thickness 
        of a quill to that of the wrist; and where abundant they render the forest 
        almost impassable. They lie about the ground coiled and twisted and looped 
        in the most fantastic manner. They hang in festoons from trees and branches, 
        they rise suddenly through mid air up to the top of the forest, or coil 
        loosely over shrubs and in thickets like endless serpents. They must attain 
        an immense age, and apparently have almost unlimited powers of growth, 
        for some are said to have been found which were 600 or even 1000 feet 
        long, and if so, they are probably the longest of all vegetable growths. 
        The mode in which such great lengths and tangled convolutions have been 
        attained has already been explained in the general account of woody climbers. 
        From the immense strength of these canes and the facility with which they 
        can be split, they are universally used for cordage in the countries where 
        they grow in preference to any other climbers, and immense quantities 
        are annually exported to all parts of the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uses 
        of Palm-trees and their Products</i>--To the natives of the equatorial 
        zone the uses of palms are both great and various. The fruits of several 
        species--more especially the cocoa-nut of the East and the peach-nut (<i>Guilielma 
        speciosa</i>) of America--furnish <font color="990000">[[p. 43]] </font>abundance 
        of wholesome food, and the whole of the trunk of the sago-palm is converted 
        into an edible starch our sago. Many other palm-fruits yield a thin pulp, 
        too small in quantity to be directly eaten, but which when rubbed off 
        and mixed with a proper quantity of water forms an exceedingly nutritious 
        and agreeable article of food. The most celebrated of these is the assai 
        of the Amazon, made from the fruit of <i>Euterpe oleracea</i>, and which, 
        as a refreshing, nourishing, and slightly stimulating beverage for a tropical 
        country, takes the place of our chocolate and coffee. A number of other 
        palms yield a similar product, and many that are not eaten by man are 
        greedily devoured by a variety of animals, so that the amount of food 
        produced by this tribe of plants is much larger than is generally supposed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        sap which pours out of the cut flower-stalk of several species of palm 
        when slightly fermented forms palm-wine or toddy, a very agreeable drink; 
        and when mixed with various bitter herbs or roots which check fermentation, 
        a fair imitation of beer is produced. If the same fluid is at once boiled 
        and evaporated it produces a quantity of excellent sugar. The <i>Arenga 
        saccharifera</i>, or sugar-palm of the Malay countries, is perhaps the 
        most productive of sugar. A single tree will continue to pour out several 
        quarts of sap daily for weeks together, and where the trees are abundant 
        this forms the chief drink and most esteemed luxury of the natives. A 
        Dutch chemist, Mr. De Vry, who has studied the subject in Java, believes 
        that great advantages would accrue from the cultivation of this tree in 
        place of the sugar-cane. According to his experiments it would produce 
        an equal quantity of sugar of good <font color="990000">[[p. 44]] </font>quality 
        with far less labour and expense, because no manure and no cultivation 
        would be required, and the land will never be impoverished as it so rapidly 
        becomes by the growth of sugar-cane. The reason of this difference is, 
        that the whole produce of a cane-field is taken off the ground, the crushed 
        canes being burnt; and the soil thus becomes exhausted of the various 
        salts and minerals which form part of the woody fibre and foliage. These 
        must be restored by the application of manure, and this, together with 
        the planting, weeding, and necessary cultivation, is very expensive. With 
        the sugar-palm, however, nothing whatever is taken away but the juice 
        itself; the foliage falls on the ground and rots, giving back to it what 
        it had taken; and the water and sugar in the juice being almost wholly 
        derived from the carbonic acid and aqueous vapour of the atmosphere, there 
        is no impoverishment; and a plantation of these palms may be kept up on 
        the same ground for an indefinite period. Another most important consideration 
        is, that these trees will grow on poor rocky soil and on the steep slopes 
        of ravines and hill-sides where any ordinary cultivation is impossible, 
        and a great extent of fertile land would thus be set free for other purposes. 
        Yet further, the labour required for such sugar plantations as these would 
        be of a light and intermittent kind, exactly suited to a semi-civilized 
        people to whom severe and long-continued labour is never congenial. This 
        combination of advantages appears to be so great, that it seems possible 
        that the sugar of the world may in the future be produced from what would 
        otherwise be almost waste ground; and it is to be hoped that the experiment 
        will soon be tried in some of our <font color="990000">[[p. 45]] </font>tropical 
        colonies, more especially as an Indian palm, <i>Phoenix sylvestris</i>, 
        also produces abundance of sugar, and might be tried in its native country.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other 
        articles of food produced from palms are, cooking-oil from the cocoa-nut 
        and baccaba palm, salt from the fruit of a South American palm (<i>Leopoldinia 
        major</i>), while the terminal bud or &quot;cabbage&quot; of many species 
        is an excellent and nutritious vegetable; so that palms supply bread, 
        oil, sugar, salt, fruit, and vegetables. Oils for various other purposes 
        are made from several distinct palms, while wax is secreted from the leaves 
        of some South American species; the resin called dragon's-blood is the 
        product of one of the rattan palms; while the fruit of the Areca palm 
        is the &quot;betel-nut&quot; so universally chewed by the Malays as a 
        gentle stimulant, and which is their substitute for the opium of the Chinese, 
        the tobacco of Europeans, and the coca-leaf of South America.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        thatching, the leaves of palms are invaluable, and are universally used 
        wherever they are abundant; and the petioles or leaf-stalks, often fifteen 
        or twenty feet long, are used as rafters, or when fastened together with 
        pegs form doors, shutters, partitions, or even the walls of entire houses. 
        They are wonderfully light and strong, being formed of a dense pith covered 
        with a hard rind or bark, and when split up and pegged together serve 
        to make many kinds of boxes, which, when covered with the broad leaves 
        of a species of screw-pine and painted or stained of various colours, 
        are very strong and serviceable as well as very ornamental. Ropes and 
        cables are woven from the black fibrous matter that fringes the leaves 
        of the sugar-palm and some other <font color="990000">[[p. 46]]</font> 
        species, while fine string of excellent quality used even for bow-strings, 
        fishing-lines, and hammocks, is made of fibres obtained from the unopened 
        leaves of some American species. The fibrous sheath at the base of the 
        leaves of the cocoa-nut palm is so compact and cloth-like, that it is 
        used for a variety of purposes, as for strainers, for wrappers, and to 
        make very good hats. The great woody spathes of the larger palms serve 
        as natural baskets, as cradles, or even as cooking-vessels in which water 
        may be safely boiled. The trunks form excellent posts and fencing, and 
        when split make good flooring. Some species are used for bows, others 
        for blow-pipes; the smaller species are sometimes used as needles or to 
        make fish-hooks, and the larger as arrows. To describe in detail all the 
        uses to which palm-trees and their products are applied in various parts 
        of the world might occupy a volume; but the preceding sketch will serve 
        to give an idea of how important a part is filled by this noble family 
        of plants, whether we regard them as a portion of the beautiful vegetation 
        of the tropics, or in relation to the manners and customs, the lives and 
        the well-being of the indigenous inhabitants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ferns.--</i>The type of plants which, next to palms, most attracts attention in 
        the equatorial zone, is perhaps that of the ferns, which here display 
        themselves in vast profusion and variety. They grow abundantly on rocks 
        and on decaying trees; they clothe the sides of ravines and the margins 
        of streams; they climb up the trees and over bushes; they form tufts and 
        hanging festoons among the highest branches. Some are as small as mosses, 
        others have huge fronds eight or ten feet long, while in mountainous districts 
        the most elegant of the group, the <font color="990000">[[p. 47]]</font> 
        tree-ferns, bear their graceful crowns on slender stems twenty to thirty, 
        or even fifty feet high. It is this immense variety rather than any special 
        features that characterises the fern-vegetation of the tropics. We have 
        here almost every conceivable modification of size, form of fronds, position 
        of spores, and habit of growth, in plants that still remain unmistakably 
        ferns. Many climb over shrubs and bushes in a most elegant manner; others 
        cling closely to the bark of trees like ivy. The great birds'-nest fern 
        (<i>Platycerium</i>) attaches its shell-like fronds high up on the trunks 
        of lofty trees. Many small terrestrial species have digitate, or ovate, 
        or ivy-shaped, or even whorled fronds, resembling at first sight those 
        of some herbaceous flowering-plants. Their numbers may be judged from 
        the fact that in the vicinity of Tarrapoto, in Peru, Dr. Spruce gathered 
        250 species of ferns, while the single volcanic mountains of Pangerango 
        in Java (10,000 feet high) is said to have produced 300 species.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ginger-worts 
        and wild Bananas.--</i>These plants, forming the families Zingiberace&aelig; 
        and Musace&aelig; of botanists, are very conspicuous ornaments of the 
        equatorial forests, on account of their large size, fine foliage, and 
        handsome flowers. The bananas and plantains are well known as among the 
        most luxuriant and beautiful productions of the tropics. Many species 
        occur wild in the forests; all have majestic foliage and handsome flowers, 
        while some produce edible fruit. Of the ginger-worts (Zingiberace&aelig; 
        and Marantace&aelig;), the well known cannas of our tropical gardens may 
        be taken as representatives, but the equatorial species are very numerous 
        and varied, often forming dense thickets in damp places, and adorning 
        the <font color="990000">[[p. 48]]</font> forest shades with their elegant 
        and curious or showy flowers. The maranths produce &quot;arrow-root,&quot; 
        while the ginger-worts are highly aromatic, producing ginger, cardamums, 
        grains of paradise, turmeric and several medicinal drugs. The Musace&aelig; 
        produce the most valuable of tropical fruits and foods. The banana is 
        the variety which is always eaten as a fruit, having a delicate aromatic 
        flavour; the plantain is a larger variety which is best cooked. Roasted 
        in the green state it is an excellent vegetable resembling roasted chestnuts; 
        when ripe it is sometimes pulped and boiled with water, making a very 
        agreeable sweet soup; or it is roasted, or cut into slices and fried, 
        in either form being a delicious tropical substitute for fruit pudding. 
        These plants are annuals, producing one immense bunch of fruit. This bunch 
        is sometimes four or five feet long containing near 200 plantains, and 
        often weighs about a hundredweight. They grow very close together, and 
        Humboldt calculated that an acre of plantains would supply more food than 
        could be obtained from the same extent of ground by any other known plant. 
        Well may it be said that the plantain is the glory of the tropics, and 
        well was the species named by Linn&aelig;us-<i>Musa paradisiaca!</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Arums.</i>--Another very characteristic and remarkable group of tropical plants are 
        the epiphytal and climbing arums. These are known by their large, arrow-shaped, 
        dark green and glossy leaves, often curiously lobed or incised, and sometimes 
        reticulated with large open spaces, as if pieces had been regularly eaten 
        out of them by some voracious insects. Sometimes they form clusters of 
        foliage on living or dead trees to which they cling by their aerial roots. 
        Others climb up the smooth <font color="990000">[[p. 49]] </font>bark 
        of large trees, sending out roots as they ascend which clasp around the 
        trunk. Some mount straight up, others wind round the supporting trunks, 
        and their large, handsome, and often highly-remarkable leaves, which spread 
        out profusely all along the stem, render them one of the most striking 
        forms of vegetation which adorn the damper and more luxuriant parts of 
        the tropical forests of both hemispheres.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Screw-pines.--</i>These singular plants, constituting the family Pandanace&aelig; of 
        botanists, are very abundant in many parts of the Eastern tropics, while 
        they are comparatively scarce in America. They somewhat resemble Yuccas, 
        but have larger leaves which grow in a close spiral screw on the stem. 
        Some are large and palm-like, and it is a curious sight to stand under 
        these and look up at the huge vegetable screw formed by the bases of the 
        long drooping leaves. Some have slender-branched trunks, which send out 
        aerial roots; others are stemless, consisting of an immense spiral cluster 
        of stiff leaves ten or twelve feet long and only two or three inches wide. 
        They abound most in sandy islands, while the larger species grow in swampy 
        forests. Their large-clustered fruits, something like pineapples, are 
        often of a red colour; and their long stiff leaves are of great use for 
        covering boxes and for many other domestic uses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Orchids.--</i>These interesting plants, so well known from the ardour with which 
        they are cultivated on account of their beautiful and singular flowers, 
        are pre-eminently tropical, and are probably more abundant in the mountains 
        of the equatorial zone than in any other region. Here they are almost 
        omnipresent in some of their countless forms. They grow on the stems, 
        in the <font color="990000">[[p. 50]]</font> forks or on the branches 
        of trees; they abound on fallen trunks; they spread over rocks, or hang 
        down the face of precipices; while some, like our northern species, grow 
        on the ground among grass and herbage. Some trees whose bark is especially 
        well adapted for their support are crowded with them, and these form natural 
        orchid-gardens. Some orchids are particularly fond of the decaying leaf-stalks 
        of palms or of tree-ferns. Some grow best over water, others must be elevated 
        on lofty trees and well exposed to sun and air. The wonderful variety 
        in the form, structure, and colour of the flowers of orchids is well known; 
        but even our finest collections give an inadequate idea of the numbers 
        of these plants that exist in the tropics, because a large proportion 
        of them have quite inconspicuous flowers and are not worth cultivation. 
        More than thirty years ago the number of known orchids was estimated by 
        Dr. Lindley at 3,000 species, and it is not improbable that they may be 
        now nearly doubled. But whatever may be the numbers of the collected and 
        described orchids, those that still remain to be discovered must be enormous. 
        Unlike ferns, the species have a very limited range, and it would require 
        the systematic work of a good botanical collector during several years 
        to exhaust any productive district--say such an island as Java--of its orchids. 
        It is not therefore at all improbable that this remarkable group may ultimately 
        prove to be the most numerous in species of all the families of flowering 
        plants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although 
        there is a peculiarity of habit that enables one soon to detect an orchidaceous 
        plant even when not in flower, yet they vary greatly in size and aspect. 
        Some of the small creeping species are hardly larger <font color="990000">[[p. 
        51]]</font> than mosses, while the large Grammatophyllums of Borneo, which 
        grow in the forks of trees, form a mass of leafy stems ten feet long, 
        and some of the terrestrial species--as the American Sobralias--grow erect 
        to an equal height. The fleshy aerial roots of most species give them 
        a very peculiar aspect, as they often grow to a great length in the open 
        air, spread over the surface of rocks, or attach themselves loosely to 
        the bark of trees, extracting nourishment from the rain and from the aqueous 
        vapour of the atmosphere. Yet notwithstanding the abundance and variety 
        of orchids in the equatorial forests they seldom produce much effect by 
        their flowers. This is due partly to the very large proportion of the 
        species having quite inconspicuous flowers; and partly to the fact that 
        the flowering season for each kind lasts but a few weeks, while different 
        species flower almost every month in the year. It is also due to the manner 
        of growth of orchids, generally in single plants or clumps which are seldom 
        large or conspicuous as compared with the great mass of vegetation around 
        them. It is only at long intervals that the traveller meets with anything 
        which recalls the splendour of our orchid-houses and flower-shows. The 
        slender-stalked golden Oncidiums of the flooded forests of the Upper Amazon; 
        the grand Cattleyas of the drier forests; the C&aelig;logynes of the swamps, 
        and the remarkable <i>Vanda lowii</i> of the hill forests of Borneo, are 
        the chief examples of orchid-beauty that have impressed themselves on 
        the memory of the present writer during twelve years' wandering in tropical 
        forests. The last-named plant is unique among orchids, its comparatively 
        small cluster of leaves sending out numerous flower-stems, which hang 
        down <font color="990000">[[p. 52]]</font> like cords to a length of eight 
        feet, and are covered with numbers of large star-like crimson-spotted 
        flowers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bamboos.</i>--The gigantic grasses called bamboos can hardly be classed as typical 
        plants of the tropical zone, because they appear to be absent from the 
        entire African continent and are comparatively scarce in South America. 
        They also extend beyond the geographical tropics in China and Japan as 
        well as in Northern India. It is however within the tropics and towards 
        the equator that they attain their full size and beauty, and it is here 
        that the species are most numerous and offer that variety of form, size, 
        and quality, which renders them so admirable a boon to man. A fine clump 
        of large bamboos is perhaps the most graceful of all vegetable forms, 
        resembling the light and airy plumes of the bird-of-paradise copied on 
        a gigantic scale in living foliage. Such clumps are often eighty or a 
        hundred feet high, the glossy stems, perhaps six inches thick at the base, 
        springing up at first straight as an arrow, tapering gradually to a slender 
        point, and bending over in elegant curves with the weight of the slender 
        branches and grassy leaves. The various species differ greatly in size 
        and proportions; in the comparative length of the joints; in the thickness 
        and strength of the stem-walls; in their straightness, smoothness, hardness, 
        and durability. Some are spiny, others are unarmed; some have simple stems, 
        others are thickly set with branches; while some species even grow in 
        such an irregular, zig-zag, branched manner as to form veritable climbing 
        bamboos. They generally prefer dry and upland stations, though some grow 
        near the banks of rivers, and a few in the thick forests and, in South 
        America, in flooded tracts. They often form dense <font color="990000">[[p. 
        53]] </font>thickets where the forests have been cleared away; and, owing 
        to their great utility, they are cultivated or preserved near native houses 
        and villages, and in such situations often give a finishing charm to the 
        landscape.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uses 
        of the Bamboo.--</i>Perhaps more than any other single type of vegetation, 
        the bamboo seems specially adapted for the use of half-civilized man in 
        a wild tropical country; and the purposes to which it is applied are almost 
        endless. It is a natural column or cylinder, very straight, uniform in 
        thickness, of a compact and solid texture, and with a smooth flinty naturally-polished 
        external skin. It is divided into ringed joints at regular intervals which 
        correspond to <i>septa</i> or partitions within, so that each joint forms 
        a perfectly closed and air-tight vessel. Owing to its hollowness, the 
        hardness of the external skin, and the existence of the joints and partitions, 
        it is wonderfully strong in proportion to its weight. It can be found 
        of many distinct sizes and proportions; light or heavy, long or short-jointed, 
        and varying from the size of a reed to that of a tall and slender palm-tree. 
        It can be split with great facility and accuracy; and, owing to its being 
        hollow, it can be easily cut across or notched with a sharp knife or hatchet. 
        It is excessively strong and highly elastic, and whether green or dry 
        is almost entirely free from any peculiar taste or smell. The way in which 
        these various qualities of the bamboo render it so valuable, will be best 
        shown by giving a brief account of some of the uses to which it is applied 
        in the Malay Archipelago.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several 
        effective weapons are easily made from bamboo. By cutting off the end 
        very obliquely just beyond a joint, a very sharp cutting point is produced 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 54]]</font> suitable for a spear, dagger, or 
        arrow-head, and capable of penetrating an animal's body as readily as 
        iron. Such spears are constantly used by many of the Malay tribes. In 
        the eastern half of the Archipelago, where bows and arrows are used, these 
        weapons are often formed entirely of bamboo. The harder and thicker sorts, 
        split and formed with tapering ends, make a very strong and elastic bow, 
        while a narrow strip of the outer skin of the same is used for the string, 
        and the slender reed-like kinds make excellent arrows. One of the few 
        agricultural tools used by the Papuans--a spud or hoe for planting or weeding--is 
        made of a stout bamboo cut somewhat like the spear.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        various domestic purposes the uses of bamboo are endless. Ladders are 
        rapidly made from two bamboo poles of the required length, by cutting 
        small notches just above each ring, forming holes to receive the rungs 
        or steps formed of a slenderer bamboo. For climbing lofty trees to get 
        beeswax, a temporary ladder reaching to any height is ingeniously formed 
        of bamboo. One of the hardest and thickest sorts is chosen, and from this 
        a number of pegs about a foot long are made. These are sharpened at one 
        end and then driven into the tree in a vertical line about three feet 
        apart. A tall and slender bamboo is then placed upright on the ground 
        and securely tied with rattan or other cords to the heads of these pegs, 
        which thus, with the tree itself, form a ladder. A man mounts these steps 
        and builds up the ladder as he goes, driving in fresh pegs and splicing 
        on fresh bamboos till he reaches the lower branches of the tree, which 
        is sometimes eighty or a hundred feet from the ground. As the weight of 
        the climber is thrown on several of the <font color="990000">[[p. 55]]</font> 
        pegs, which are bound together and supported by the upright bamboo, this 
        ladder is much safer than it looks at first sight, and it is made with 
        wonderful rapidity. When a path goes up a steep hill over smooth ground, 
        bamboo steps are often laid down to prevent slipping while carrying heavy 
        loads. These are made with uniform lengths of stout bamboo in which opposite 
        notches are cut at each end just within a joint. These notches allow strong 
        bamboo pegs to be driven through into the ground, thus keeping the steps 
        securely in place. The masts and yards of native vessels are almost always 
        formed of bamboo, as it combines lightness, strength, and elasticity in 
        an unequalled degree. Two or three large bamboos also form the best outriggers 
        to canoes on account of their great buoyancy. They also serve to form 
        rafts; and in the city of Palembang in Sumatra there is a complete street 
        of floating houses supported on rafts formed of huge bundles of bamboos. 
        Bridges across streams or to carry footpaths along the face of precipices 
        are constructed by the Dyaks of Borneo wholly of bamboos, and some of 
        these are very ingeniously hung from overhanging trees by diagonal rods 
        of bamboo, so as to form true suspension bridges. The flooring of Malay 
        houses is almost always of bamboo, but is constructed in a variety of 
        ways. Generally large bamboos are used, split lengthways twice and the 
        pieces tied down with rattan. This forms a grated floor, slightly elastic, 
        and very pleasant to the barefooted natives. A superior floor is sometimes 
        formed of slabs, which are made from very stout bamboos cut into lengths 
        of about three or four feet and split down one side. The joints are then 
        deeply and closely notched all <font color="990000">[[p. 56]]</font> round 
        with a sharp chopping-knife, so that the piece can be unrolled as it were 
        and pressed flat, when it forms a hard board with a natural surface which, 
        with a little wear, becomes beautifully smooth and polished. Blinds, screens, 
        and mats, are formed of bamboos in a variety of ways,--sometimes of thin 
        kinds crushed flat and plaited, but more frequently of narrow strips connected 
        together with cords of bamboo-bark or rattan. Strips of bamboo supported 
        on cross-pieces form an excellent bed, which from its elasticity supplies 
        the purpose of a mattress as well, and only requires a mat laid over it 
        to insure a comfortable night's repose. Every kind of basket, too, is 
        made of bamboo, from the coarsest heavy kinds to such as are fine and 
        ornamental. In such countries as Lombock and Macassar, where the land 
        is much cultivated and timber scarce, entire houses are built of bamboo,--posts, 
        walls, floors, and roofs all being constructed of this one material; and 
        perhaps in no other way can so elegant and well-finished a house be built 
        so quickly and so cheaply. Almost every kind of furniture is also made 
        of the same material, excellent bamboo chairs, sofas, and bedsteads being 
        made in the Moluccas, which, for appearance combined with cheapness, are 
        probably unsurpassed in the world. A chair costs sixpence, and a sofa 
        two shillings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among 
        simpler uses, bamboos are admirably adapted for water-vessels. Some of 
        the lighter sorts are cut into lengths of about five feet, a small hole 
        being knocked through the septa of the joints. This prevents the water 
        from running out too quickly, and facilitates its being poured out in 
        a regulated stream to the last drop. Three or four of these water-vessels 
        are tied <font color="990000">[[p. 57]]</font> together and carried on 
        the back, and they stand very conveniently in a corner of the hut. Water 
        pipes and aqueducts are also readily made from bamboo tubes supported 
        at intervals on two smaller pieces tied crosswise. In this way a stream 
        of water is often conveyed from some distance to the middle of a village. 
        Measures for rice or palm-wine, drinking-vessels, and water-dippers, are 
        to be found almost ready-made in a joint of bamboo; and when fitted with 
        a cap or lid they form tobacco or tinder-boxes. Perches for parrots with 
        food and water vessels are easily made out of a single piece of bamboo, 
        while with a little more labour elegant bird-cages are constructed. In 
        Timor a musical instrument is formed from a single joint of a large bamboo, 
        by carefully raising seven strips of the hard skin to form strings, which 
        remain attached at both ends and are elevated by small pegs wedged underneath, 
        the strings being prevented from splitting off by a strongly-plaited ring 
        of a similar material bound round each end. An opening cut on one side 
        allows the bamboo to vibrate in musical notes when the harp-like strings 
        are sharply pulled with the fingers. In Java strips of bamboo supported 
        on stretched strings and struck with a small stick produce the higher 
        notes in the &quot;gamelung&quot; or native band, which consists mainly 
        of sets of gongs and metallic plates of various sizes. Almost all the 
        common Chinese paper is made from the foliage and stems of some species 
        of bamboo, while the young shoots, as they first spring out of the ground, 
        are an excellent vegetable, quite equal to artichokes. Single joints of 
        bamboo make excellent cooking-vessels while on a journey. Rice can be 
        boiled in them to perfection, as well as fish and <font color="990000">[[p. 
        58]]</font> vegetables. They serve too for jars in which to preserve sugar, 
        salt, fruit, molasses, and cooked provisions; and for the smoker, excellent 
        pipes and hookahs can be formed in a few minutes out of properly chosen 
        joints of bamboo.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
        are only a sample of the endless purposes to which the bamboo is applied 
        in the countries of which it is a native, its chief characteristic being 
        that in a few minutes it can be put to uses which, if ordinary wood were 
        used, would require hours or even days of labour. There is also a regularity 
        and a finish about it which is found in hardly any other woody plant; 
        and its smooth and symmetrically ringed surface gives an appearance of 
        fitness and beauty to its varied applications. On the whole, we may perhaps 
        consider it as the greatest boon which nature gives to the natives of 
        the Eastern tropics.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mangroves.--</i>Among the forms of plants which are sure to attract attention in the 
        tropics are the mangroves, which grow between tide-marks on coasts and 
        estuaries. These are low trees with widely-spreading branches and a network 
        of aerial roots a few feet above the ground; but their most remarkable 
        peculiarity is, that their fruits germinate on the tree, sending out roots 
        and branches before falling into the muddy soil--a completely formed plant. 
        In some cases the root reaches the ground before the seed above falls 
        off. These trees greatly aid the formation of new land, as the mass of 
        aerial roots which arch out from the stem to a considerable distance collects 
        mud and floating refuse, and so raises and consolidates the shore; while 
        the young plants often dropping from the farthest extremity of the branches, 
        rapidly extend <font color="990000">[[p. 59]] </font>the domain of vegetation 
        to the farthest possible limits. The branches, too, send down slender 
        roots like those of the banyan, and become independent trees. Thus a complete 
        woody labyrinth is formed; and the network of tough roots and stems resists 
        the action of the tides, and enables the mud brought down by great tropical 
        rivers to be converted into solid land far more rapidly than it could 
        be without this aid.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sensitive-plants.--</i>Among the more humble forms of vegetation that attract the traveller's 
        notice none are more interesting than the sensitive species of Mimosa. 
        These are all natives of South America, but one species, <i>Mimosa pudica</i>, 
        has spread to Africa and Asia, so that sensitive-plants now abound as 
        wayside weeds in many parts both of the eastern and western tropics, sometimes 
        completely carpeting the ground with their delicate foliage. Where a large 
        surface of ground is thus covered the effect of walking over it is most 
        peculiar. At each step the plants for some distance round suddenly droop, 
        as if struck with paralysis, and a broad track of prostrate herbage, several 
        feet wide, is distinctly marked out by the different colour of the closed 
        leaflets. The explanation of this phenomenon, given by botanists, is not 
        very satisfactory;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> while the purpose or use 
        of the peculiarity is still more mysterious, seeing that out of about 
        two hundred species belonging to this same genus Mimosa, only some three 
        or four are sensitive, and in the whole vegetable kingdom there are no 
        other plants which possess more than the rudiments of a similar property. 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 60]]</font> It is true that, as they are all 
        low-growing herbs or shrubs with delicate foliage, they might possibly 
        be liable to destruction by herbivorous animals, and might escape by their 
        singular power of suddenly collapsing before the jaws opened to devour 
        them. The fact that one species has been naturalized as a weed over so 
        wide an area in the tropics, seems to show that it possesses some advantage 
        over the generality of tropical weeds. It is however curious that, as 
        most of the species are somewhat prickly, so easy and common a mode of 
        protection as the development of stronger spines should here have failed; 
        and that its place should be supplied by so singular a power as that of 
        simulating death, in a manner which suggests the possession of both sensation 
        and voluntary motion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Comparative 
        Scarcity of Flowers.--</i>It is a very general opinion among inhabitants 
        of our temperate climes, that amid the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics 
        there must be a grand display of floral beauty; and this idea is supported 
        by the number of large and showy flowers cultivated in our hot-houses. 
        The fact is, however, that in proportion as the general vegetation becomes 
        more luxuriant, flowers form a less and less prominent feature; and this 
        rule applies not only to the tropics but to the temperate and frigid zones. 
        It is amid the scanty vegetation of the higher mountains and towards the 
        limits of perpetual snow, that the alpine flowers are most brilliant and 
        conspicuous. Our own meadows and pastures and hill-sides produce more 
        gay flowers than our woods and forests; and, in the tropics, it is in 
        the parts where vegetation is less dense and luxuriant that flowers most 
        abound. In the damp and <font color="990000">[[p. 61]] </font>uniform 
        climate of the equatorial zone the mass of vegetation is greater and more 
        varied than in any other part of the globe, but in the great virgin forests 
        themselves flowers are rarely seen. After describing the forests of the 
        Lower Amazon, Mr. Bates asks: &quot;But where were the flowers? To our 
        great disappointment we saw none, or only such as were insignificant in 
        appearance. Orchids are rare in the dense forests of the lowlands, and 
        I believe it is now tolerably well ascertained that the majority of the 
        forest-trees in equatorial Brazil have small and inconspicuous flowers.&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup><a href="#2"> 
        </a>My friend Dr. Richard Spruce assured me that by far the greater part 
        of the plants gathered by him in equatorial America had inconspicuous 
        green or white flowers. My own observations in the Aru Islands for six 
        months, and in Borneo for more than a year, while living almost wholly 
        in the forests, are quite in accordance with this view. Conspicuous masses 
        of showy flowers are so rare, that weeks and months may be passed without 
        observing a single flowering plant worthy of special admiration. Occasionally 
        some tree or shrub will be seen covered with magnificent yellow, or crimson, 
        or purple flowers, but it is usually an oasis of colour in a desert of 
        verdure, and therefore hardly affects the general aspect of the vegetation. 
        The equatorial forest is too gloomy for flowers, or generally even for 
        much foliage, except of ferns and other shade-loving plants; and were 
        it not that the forests are broken up by rivers and streams, by mountain 
        ranges, by precipitous rocks and by deep ravines, there would be far fewer 
        flowers than there are. Some of the great forest-trees have showy blossoms,<font color="990000"> 
        [[p. 62]]</font> and when these are seen from an elevated point looking 
        over an expanse of tree-tops the effect is very grand; but nothing is 
        more erroneous than the statement sometimes made that tropical forest-trees 
        <i>generally</i> have showy flowers, for it is doubtful whether the proportion 
        is at all greater in tropical than in temperate zones. On such natural 
        exposures as steep mountain sides, the banks of rivers, or ledges of precipices, 
        and on the margins of such artificial openings as roads and forest clearings, 
        whatever floral beauty is to be found in the more luxuriant parts of the 
        tropics is exhibited. But even in such favourable situations it is not 
        the abundance and beauty of the flowers but the luxuriance and the freshness 
        of the foliage, and the grace and infinite variety of the forms of vegetation, 
        that will most attract the attention and extort the admiration of the 
        traveller. Occasionally indeed you will come upon shrubs gay with blossoms 
        or trees festooned with flowering creepers; but, on the other hand, you 
        may travel for a hundred miles and see nothing but the varied greens of 
        the forest foliage and the deep gloom of its tangled recesses. In Mr. 
        Belt's <i>Naturalist in Nicaragua</i>, he thus describes the great virgin 
        forests of that country which, being in a mountainous region and on the 
        margin of the equatorial zone, are among the most favourable examples. 
        &quot;On each side of the road great trees towered up, carrying their 
        crowns out of sight amongst a canopy of foliage, and with lianas hanging 
        from nearly every bough, and passing from tree to tree, entangling the 
        giants in a great network of coiling cables. Sometimes a tree appears 
        covered with beautiful flowers which do not belong to it, but to one of 
        the lianas <font color="990000">[[p. 63]]</font> that twines through its 
        branches and sends down great rope-like stems to the ground. Climbing 
        ferns and vanilla cling to the trunks, and a thousand epiphytes perch 
        themselves on the branches. Amongst these are large arums that send down 
        long aerial roots, tough and strong, and universally used instead of cordage 
        by the natives. Amongst the undergrowth several small species of palms, 
        varying in height from two to fifteen feet, are common; and now and then 
        magnificent tree ferns sending off their feathery crowns twenty feet from 
        the ground delight the sight by their graceful elegance. Great broad-leaved 
        heliconias, leathery melastom&aelig;, and succulent-stemmed, lop-sided 
        leaved and flesh-coloured begonias are abundant, and typical of tropical 
        American forests; but not less so are the cecropia trees, with their white 
        stems and large palmated leaves standing up like great candelabra. Sometimes 
        the ground is carpeted with large flowers, yellow, pink, or white, that 
        have fallen from some invisible tree-top above; or the air is filled with 
        a delicious perfume, the source of which one seeks around in vain, for 
        the flowers that cause it are far overhead out of sight, lost in the great 
        overshadowing crown of verdure.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, 
        as has been shown elsewhere, it may be doubted whether light directly 
        produces floral colour, there can be no doubt that it is essential to 
        the growth of vegetation and to the full development of foliage and of 
        flowers. In the forests all trees, and shrubs, and creepers struggle upwards 
        to the light, there to expand their blossoms and ripen their fruit. Hence, 
        perhaps, the abundance of climbers which make use of their more sturdy 
        companions to reach this necessary of vegetable <font color="990000">[[p. 
        64]]</font> life. Yet even on the upper surface of the forest, fully exposed 
        to the light and heat of the tropical sun, there is no special development 
        of coloured flowers. When from some elevated point you can gaze down upon 
        an unbroken expanse of woody vegetation, it often happens that not a single 
        patch of bright colour can be discerned. At other times, and especially 
        at the beginning of the dry season, you may behold scattered at wide intervals 
        over the mottled-green surface a few masses of yellow, white, pink, or 
        more rarely of blue colour, indicating the position of handsome flowering 
        trees.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        well-established relation between coloured flowers and the need of insects 
        to fertilize them, may perhaps be connected with the comparative scarcity 
        of the former in the equatorial forests. The various forms of life are 
        linked together in such mutual dependence that no one can inordinately 
        increase without bringing about a corresponding increase or diminution 
        of other forms. The insects which are best adapted to fertilize flowers 
        cannot probably increase much beyond definite limits, because in doing 
        so they would lead to a corresponding increase of insectivorous birds 
        and other animals which would keep them down. The chief fertilizers--bees 
        and butterflies--have enemies at every stage of their growth, from the 
        egg to the perfect insect, and their numbers are, therefore, limited by 
        causes quite independent of the supply of vegetable food. It may, therefore, 
        be the case that the numbers of suitable insects are totally inadequate 
        to the fertilization of the countless millions of forest-trees over such 
        vast areas as the equatorial zone presents, and that, in consequence, 
        a large proportion of <font color="990000">[[p. 65]]</font> the species 
        have become adapted either for self-fertilization or for cross-fertilization 
        by the agency of the wind. Were there not some such limitation as this, 
        we should expect that the continued struggle for existence among the plants 
        of the tropical forests would have led to the acquisition, by a much larger 
        proportion of them, of so valuable a character as bright-coloured flowers, 
        this being almost a necessary preliminary to a participation in the benefits 
        which have been proved to arise from cross-fertilization by insect agency.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Concluding 
        Remarks on Tropical Vegetation.</i>--In concluding this general sketch 
        of the aspect of tropical vegetation we will attempt briefly to summarize 
        its main features. The primeval forests of the equatorial zone are grand 
        and overwhelming by their vastness, and by the display of a force of development 
        and vigour of growth rarely or never witnessed in temperate climates. 
        Among their best distinguishing features are the variety of forms and 
        species which everywhere meet and grow side by side, and the extent to 
        which parasites, epiphytes, and creepers fill up every available station 
        with peculiar modes of life. If the traveller notices a particular species 
        and wishes to find more like it, he may often turn his eyes in vain in 
        every direction. Trees of varied forms, dimensions, and colours are around 
        him, but he rarely sees any one of them repeated. Time after time he goes 
        towards a tree which looks like the one he seeks, but a closer examination 
        proves it to be distinct. He may at length, perhaps, meet with a second 
        specimen half a mile off, or may fail altogether, till on another occasion 
        he stumbles on one by accident.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        absence of the gregarious or social habit, so<font color="990000"> [[p. 
        66]]</font> general in the forests of extra-tropical countries, is probably 
        dependent on the extreme equability and permanence of the climate. Atmospheric 
        conditions are much more important to the growth of plants than any others. 
        Their severest struggle for existence is against climate. As we approach 
        towards regions of polar cold or desert aridity the variety of groups 
        and species regularly diminishes; more and more are unable to sustain 
        the extreme climatal conditions, till at last we find only a few specially 
        organized forms which are able to maintain their existence. In the extreme 
        north, pine or birch trees; in the desert, a few palms and prickly shrubs 
        or aromatic herbs alone survive. In the equable equatorial zone there 
        is no such struggle against climate. Every form of vegetation has become 
        alike adapted to its genial heat and ample moisture, which has probably 
        changed little even throughout geological periods; and the never-ceasing 
        struggle for existence between the various species in the same area has 
        resulted in a nice balance of organic forces, which gives the advantage, 
        now to one, now to another, species, and prevents any one type of vegetation 
        from monopolising territory to the exclusion of the rest. The same general 
        causes have led to the filling up of every place in nature with some specially 
        adapted form. Thus we find a forest of smaller trees adapted to grow in 
        the shade of greater trees. Thus we find every tree supporting numerous 
        other forms of vegetation, and some so crowded with epiphytes of various 
        kinds that their forks and horizontal branches are veritable gardens. 
        Creeping ferns and arums run up the smoothest trunks; an immense variety 
        of climbers hang in tangled masses from the branches and mount over <font color="990000">[[p. 
        67]]</font> the highest tree-tops. Orchids, bromelias, arums, and ferns 
        grow from every boss and crevice, and cover the fallen and decaying trunks 
        with a graceful drapery. Even these parasites have their own parasitical 
        growth, their leaves often supporting an abundance of minute creeping 
        mosses and hepatic&aelig;. But the uniformity of climate which has led 
        to this rich luxuriance and endless variety of vegetation is also the 
        cause of a monotony that in time becomes oppressive. To quote the words 
        of Mr. Belt: &quot;Unknown are the autumn tints, the bright browns and 
        yellows of English woods; much less the crimsons, purples, and yellows 
        of Canada, where the dying foliage rivals, nay, excels, the expiring dolphin 
        in splendour. Unknown the cold sleep of winter; unknown the lovely awakening 
        of vegetation at the first gentle touch of spring. A ceaseless round of 
        ever-active life weaves the fairest scenery of the tropics into one monotonous 
        whole, of which the component parts exhibit in detail untold variety and 
        beauty.&quot;<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
        the student of nature the vegetation of the tropics will ever be of surpassing 
        interest, whether for the variety of forms and structures which it presents, 
        for the boundless energy with which the life of plants is therein manifested, 
        or for the help which it gives us in our search after the laws which have 
        determined the production of such infinitely varied organisms. When, for 
        the first time, the traveller wanders in these primeval forests, he can 
        scarcely fail to experience sensations of awe, akin to those excited by 
        the trackless ocean or the alpine snowfields. There is a vastness, a solemnity, 
        a gloom, a sense of solitude and of human insignificance<font color="990000"> 
        [[p. 68]]</font> which for a time overwhelm him; and it is only when the 
        novelty of these feelings have passed away that he is able to turn his 
        attention to the separate constituents that combine to produce these emotions, 
        and examine the varied and beautiful forms of life which, in inexhaustible 
        profusion, are spread around him.</font></p>

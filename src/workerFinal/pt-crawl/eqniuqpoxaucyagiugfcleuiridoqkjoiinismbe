first successful treatment for tetanus (a dangerous infectious disease caused by bacteria that enters through a wound or opening in the skin), and came to be known as the "Children's Savior" for his success in conquering diphtheria. Behring was born in Hansdorf, Germany, into a family of 12 children. </p>
		
			<h2><a href="Bourgeois-Louyse.html">Bourgeois, Louyse</a></h2>
			<p>Louyse Bourgeois (1563-1636) was the most famous midwife (a person, historically female, who helps other women give birth) of her time. As one of the first educated and medically trained midwives, she raised her profession to a new level of competence and promoted the spread of that competence through her widely read books recounting her observations and experiences.</p>

			<h2><a href="Fleming-Sir-Alexander.html">Fleming, Sir Alexander</a></h2>
			<p>Alexander Fleming (1881-1955) was one of three men who discovered and developed the first antibiotic, penicillin. Fleming was born on a farm in Scotland and worked in a shipping company as a youth. </p>
		
			<h2><a href="Florey-Sir-Howard-Walter.html">Florey, Sir Howard Walter</a></h2>
			<p>Howard Walter Florey (1898-1968) was one of two men who developed penicillin, the first antibiotic. Florey was born in Australia and attended the University of Adelaide before winning a Rhodes Scholarship to study

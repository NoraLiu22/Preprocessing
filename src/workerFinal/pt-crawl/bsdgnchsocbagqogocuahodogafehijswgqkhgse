It was excavated between 1954 and 1958 by Deffarge who described two main sedimentary complexes, covered by a superficial level containing several pottery shards and other post-glacial remains. The site has yielded a large quantity of lithic and faunal remains attributed to the  Magdalenian.  Le Morin also yielded an abundant antler industry, with numerous decorated harpoons, a diversity of decorated objects  and a rich fauna." ><META Name="keywords" Content="Le Morin"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="window-target" content="_top" ><meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> </HEAD><BODY><br><br><center><h2><b><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A></b></h2></center><center><br /><!-- CSS file for site and menu --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/layout.css" /><link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" href="https://www.donsmaps.com/favicon.ico"></center><center><script type="text/javascript"><!--//--></script></center><!-- Menu down Left Hand Side --><div class="left_menu">Navigation<ul ><li><a class="normal" href="abeltasmantrack.html">Abel Tasman Track in New Zealand</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="kimberleyart.html">Aboriginal Art of the Kimberleys</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginalrockart.html">Aboriginal art on the Northern Tablelands of NSW</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginals.html">Aborigines of Australia</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="pataudtools.html">Abri Pataud Tools</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="raymonden.html">Abri de Raymonden</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="mihisalisburyaccess.html">Access to Mihi Gorge and to Salisbury Waters below the junction with  Mihi Creek </a></li><li><a class="normal" href="loess.html">Achenheim -

Many works of art have been unearthed there during the excavations of R. Deffarge, who with J. Elzière made the first interpretations, accompanied by relevant photos and drawings.  D. de Sonneville-Bordes and P. Lawrence have recorded further descriptions, using the drawings by P. Lawrence.   Determinations of the substrates (e.g. bone, sandstone and so on) and the species depicted were carried out by  F. Prat and F. Delpech. The descriptions are based on published works of anatomy and palaeontology.<br /><br /><b>Descriptive Analysis</b><br /><br />74 objects of bone or antler, as well as one of sandstone,  were selected for study. These were organised into identifiable animals, plants, human body parts, barbed arrows and, exceptionally, a very elaborate design, as well as antlers carved in a phallic shape. To this is added two engraved bones lacking a known stratigraphic origin. These objects come from all levels of the site: B I, 2; A IV, 18; A III, 23.<br /><br />There are, in addition,  bones with engraved lines where it is not possible to recognise shapes: BI, 2; A IV, 18; A III, 23. With regard to the illustrations, they have been oriented to make interpretation of the carvings easier. Where it exists, the spongy part of the bone is considered the underside.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /> <center><b>Layer B II </b><br /><br /></center><p><a href="images33/lemorinfig1b11no1horse.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images33/lemorinfig1b11no1horsesm.jpg" alt = "magdalenian  engraving" width="343" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br />Abri Morin Layer B II,  Fig. 1, No. 1. - Distal part of a spear straightener of reindeer antler,   3 fragments.<br />Length 134 mm, width 73 mm. <br /><br />Engravings on both sides of the piece.

The flat,  long, and spatula shaped thumb is shown as not connected to the other fingers. <br /><br />The little finger overlaps the ring finger.

According to H. Breuil and R. Saint-Perier, these 'hands' would be flukes five-spoke, found on another chisel La Madeleine.-->The hands of l'abri Morin are thus very exceptional, both in their technical realisation, by very deep incisions,  and their arrangement and dimensions. This is a pair, one right and one left hand, one below the other, with five fingers, the thumb separated and lines indicating fingernails.<br /><br />Compared with the hands known from  parietal contexts, they differ in proportions from the elongated hands with fingers close together of la Madeleine, and differ from the hands of Laussel, Isturitz and Laugerie Basse, all of which have only four fingers except for the 'Femme au Renne'. <br /><br />A unique example in portable art, the hands of le Morin will probably not have the same meaning as the parietal hands, which have been interpreted as magic signs taking possession of game,  or the land,  or as female sexual symbols. The hand is often interpreted as  the symbol of invocation and supplication. However there is no reason to try to give a precise meaning to those from le Morin. <br /><br />Text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Deffarge et al.

On one side, there is an irregular surface with some engraved lines, and on the other, the surface is flat, and bears an etching whose sharpness has been  attenuated by the texture of the rock.<br /><br />The figure is a front view: the head is rounded, it has asymmetrical shoulders, square, raised and extended, with a broad chest. On the front, two  lines in a V represent a nose or a beak and two oval tracks, barely legible, denote eyes.<br /><br />There is no neck, only a small narrowing of the head, so the figure is a 'head placed on shoulders.' Some lines, outside the figure, extend beyond it but intersect at the location of the neck and chest, where they are clearly marked. The significance of their relationship with the figure is not obvious.<br /><br />The hypothesis of an anthropomorphic figure is plausible, but studies devoted to human representations on parietal locations show that they are rarely shown from the front.  In these cases, they have rounded heads and round or oval eyes, and when the torso is shown, they are depicted without shoulders.<br /><br />Photo and text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Deffarge et al.

The hypothesis of a bird identity is perhaps more likely, because of the large size of the head and the raised shoulders, which suggest the folded wings of a bird of prey, probably a snowy owl, well represented in the bones of bird life discovered at the site.  The shape of the head, the eye, and especially the  'chevron reversed' beak closely matches the snowy owl from les Trois-Frères.<br /><br />Photo and text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Deffarge et al.

Length 51 mm. Two deer antler carvings lie opposite each other. One is located towards the sawn end, and is limited by two horizontal lines, while the other is interrupted by breakage of the bone.  <br />  <br />   Both are depicted in real perspective,  with the antler in the foreground superimposed on the other, which is thus partly hidden.  Only the palm patches of the antlers remain  for the branches at the top. If the lower antler  is complete, it is an antler of the second head (3rd year). <br />  <br />  In the carving at top, the rod of the antler in the foreground, includes the 'palm patch' and the points, while in the background, partly obscured,  the drawing shows the rod and the palm patch of the other antler.   <br />  <br />  Several explanations for these branches of figurations can be advanced. It could  be the classical tendency to use the part to represent  the whole, the antlers in this case in lieu  of the full deer. More likely, the branches are represented for themselves because of the attraction they exert, perhaps as scrap antler for tools, or as hunting trophies.  <br />  <br />  Nevertheless, there is a  magical feeling to the work, such  as is evidenced by the sorcerer of the Three Brothers, the precursor to Indian or Siberian shamans. <br /><br />Photo (left) and text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Deffarge et al.

Length 88 mm. The distal portion has been  scraped  to the shape of a  phallus, with normal peripheral narrowing and an incision of the penis at the glans shown, which has since deteriorated to some extent.  <br /> <br />The shaping of the phallus was relatively easy because of the natural shape of the antler. The object is similar to other carved antlers, in the sense that it is simple and undecorated, as for, notably,  number 7 of layer A II from the same site, and the phallus from la Madeleine, or the very ornamented one from Bruniquel and that from Abzac, which is a double version.  <br /> <br />When discussing a wooden phallus from the Aurignacian, coming from l'abri Blanchard des Roches, much earlier than the examples cited above, which are all from the upper Magdalenian, L. Didon proposed the existence of a very ancient cult of the male genital organ.  <br /> <br />R.

A lack of detail  is common.  When the animal is repeated in a line, the characteristics of the model are mechanically reproduced. <br /><br />Although closely contemporary, the horses differ wildly from one to the other in roundness and length of tail and sex. The style is varied, with some being schematic or mechanical representations, while one of the horses is an example of realism with elegant and firm outlines, despite the surprising deformation of the hindquarters. <br /><br />One of the reindeers is a full engraving, with movement and life which allow it to take its place among the famous works of the upper Magdalenian. <br /><br />The depictions of deer antlers and the phallic antler may reflect the natural  tendency to include the part for the whole, but it is also possible that they reflect practices or rites that escape us. Some identifications of engravings as reptiles and fish remain of questionable validity.<br /><br />A common technique with these pieces is light engravings and true champlevé technique.  As is common, lines of horse are created on spears and a  phallus is made from an antler, because of its innate form. With the exception of a bird, scapulas carry engravings which are difficult to interpret, or more often, a meaningless jumble of lines. Bird bones are relatively common. Their smooth hard surface is ideal for creating good engravings,  the most realistic animals, and the most elaborate decoration, achievements that required great manual dexterity given the small size of the media.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /> <center><b>Layer A III </b><br /><br /></center> <p><a href="images33/morinfig20no1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images33/morinfig20no1sm.jpg" alt = "morin fig20 no1" width="561" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br /><!-- fig20 no 1 --><!-- 88.47.40 -->Horse  <br /> <br />Flat piece of bone  in two pieces, length 59 mm, width 13 mm, thickness 10 mm.

The first adult is only partially visible, hidden as it is by the small animal and by the head of the second adult which overlaps the hindquarters of the first. A break has destroyed the body of the second bison. These bison were created by a process of lines and shadings.  The lines are reserved for the parts of the body which are more or less hairless, including the ears, horns, muzzles, nostrils, as well as the upright tail of the first and left foreleg of the second. <br /><br />Photo and text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Deffarge et al.

The identification of this small animal remains problematic.

Examples of such coexistence  are exceptional and uncertain:<br /><br />• The cow and her calf (<i>now thought to be a young bison, see below&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp; </i>) from Mas-d'Azil <br />• The  mare and foal from  Laugerie Basse and Lespugue<br />  • The female bison and young  from  Brassempouy<br />• The bone rondelles from  Laugerie Basse, a cow and  calf and a chamois and its young.

The methods used to evoke this characteristic attitude are always the same, but, apparently, more easily for isolated individuals, and as in the deer of l'abri Morin, with a more vibrant realism. <br /><br />The choice of this classic theme may be related to hunting magic or simply to familiar hunting events. The rut, the time of the stags bellowing,  lasts from mid-September to late October. During this period, the approach to game is easier  because the deer can be heard and followed,   and  it may be possible to encourage them to respond using a decoy, and because  they are less suspicious and less cautious than usual. <br /><br />It is also the case that at the time of the rut,  the antlers, raw material for weapons and tools including hammers, are of the highest quality, more compact and hard, which is directly related to the secretion of hormones at this time. The use of antlers for tools ends at the end of summer. Shed antlers, from moulting deer in February, are demineralised and not as strong, they break easily. <br /><br /><p><a href="images33/morinfig34.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images33/morinfig34sm.jpg" alt = "magdalenian  engraving reindeer" width="700" height="225" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Two fragments of the same piece of bone.

In addition to simple sketches, partial or even questionable, there are some success stories: a well proportioned horse, a small horse full of movement, and a beautifully drawn stallion.<br /><br />The traditional reindeer themes,  and the bellowing deer, are treated according to conventional methods, with life and realism. The haggy bison with young, are by contrast against  original, both by  subject and by style. With isolated legs whose identification is not possible, the level has delivered exceptional representations because of the multiple representations of claws and vulvas. <br /><br />The plant motifs are as always problematical to identify. The media used are exceptional: the skull bone with vulvas,  and harpoons with realistic engravings of bovids and fish. Pendants or lissoirs are relatively common.<br /><br />As in level A IV,  it is a bird bone which bears one of the best engravings of this layer, a bellowing deer. Except for the little horse and the stallion, the shoulder blades are engraved with incomplete figures  or ones difficult to interpret, often in a   tangle of lines.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 41 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/lemorin.html responseCode 3 200

<p><b><font size=+1>Karl King joined <i>Robinson's Famous Circus</i> at
the age of 19 as a baritone player.&nbsp; He joined the circus world at
a time when the acts were in great need of special music since the standard
music did not fit. Karl King was a master at writing music to match the
rhythm of the acts and quickly rose to leadership positions in some of
the most famous circus bands in the country, including the <i>Buffalo Bill</i>
and the <i>Barnum and Bailey</i>. He contributed more circus marches than
any other composer, and aerial waltzes and circus galops were his specialty.</font></b>

<p>Digital libraries research is a new discipline that draws together people
from many backgrounds.  A challenge that we all face is how to communicate
with our colleagues.  Our discipline should be a leader in using electronic
publishing and digital libraries to promulgate our research and to
communicate with each other.  But how is this best achieved? </p> 

<p>This question is particularly perplexing, since all of academic publishing is going
through a period of rapid change.  Traditional journals are providing
parallel versions in print or available on-line; researchers are first
reporting their results on the Web, strengthening the long-standing
tradition of informal distribution of scientific information; new forms of
publication are emerging -- <i><b>D-Lib Magazine</b></i> is an example -- with attributes
of conventional publications, but based on Web technology.  As members of
an inter-disciplinary field, researchers in digital libraries do not know
where to publish their results so that they will be available to the
broadest community.</p>

<p>The first article in this issue of <i><b>D-Lib Magazine</b></i> describes a project, the
Computing Research Repository (CoRR), that can help to bridge this gap.  This
initiative, led by Joe Halpern of Cornell University, provides an organized
framework for authors to disseminate their research papers and reports about computing;
some may be published later as journal articles or conference papers, but
certainly not all will be.  Joe is a colleague of mine on the ACM
Publications Board, and the ACM is an enthusiastic supporter of CoRR.  The
strong team of moderators that has been assembled provides an indicator
that many leading computer scientists welcome this initiative.  The
collections in CoRR are classified by subject areas and digital libraries
is one.  CoRR is housed at the eprint archives at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, which provides a search service and email notification when
papers are posted. In addition, CoRR is part of the <a href =
"http://www.NCSTRL.org/">NCSTRL</a> library (to which <i><b>D-Lib Magazine</b></i> also
belongs).</p>  

<p>Digital libraries is a very broad field of which computer science is only
part, but this provides an opportunity for research results to be
distributed quickly and maintained for the long term.  There are no costs
to either authors or readers.  By making our research promptly available,
through widely accessible channels, we can all help to advance the field.</p>

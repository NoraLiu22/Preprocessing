<title>What was the first opera?</title>
</head><body>

<h2>What was the first opera?</h2>

<p>The standard textbook answer is easy.  The first opera was
<i>Daphne</i>, first performed in 1598 during Carnival at the home
of Jacopo Corsi (d.1604) in Florence, music by Corsi and Jacopo
Peri (1561-1633), libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini (1562-1621).  It
is recognized as the first because it was the first of a series of
<a href="../cds/arz24132.htm">similar pieces</a> which established
the form of early 17th century Italian opera, and all subsequent
developments were based on that tradition.  The score does not
survive.</p>

<p>There were many precursors of opera, and you can define it to
include or exclude any of them.  Corsi, Peri, and Rinuccini were
members of a group who believed that the dramas of
<a href="../cds/k617069.htm">Classical Greek Antiquity</a> were
sung rather than spoken.  Medieval liturgical dramas started in
about the 10th century.  Hildegard von Bingen's 12th century
<i><a href="../cds/dhm77394.htm">Ordo virtutum</a></i> can be
staged, although we don't know whether it was.  The same is true
of the anonymous <i><a href="../cds/dhm77395.htm">Play of
Daniel</a></i>, <i>Play of Herod</i>, and other liturgical plays
from the early 13th century.  Adam de la Halle's later 13th century
<i><a href="../cds/arn68162.htm">Play of Robin &amp; Marion</a></i>
has been called &quot;suitable for staging,&quot; but whether it
was intended for staging or ever actually staged we don't know.
The early 14th century <i><a href="../cds/era96392.htm">Roman de
Fauvel</a></i> is also considered by some to be suitable for staging,
and a performance of the entire thing would be approximately as
long as Wagner's entire <i>Ring</i> cycle!  More immediate precursors
were the 16th century Italian
<i><a href="../cds/sny63362.htm">Intermedio</a></i>, a madrigal
entertainment given between the acts of a dramatic play, and the
<a href="../cds/hmu1461.htm">madrigal-comedy</a>.</p>

<p>But if pride of place goes to a work that is first in a series
that establishes an enduring tradition, then <i>Daphne</i> of 1598
is that work and leads in a straight line (well, actually pretty
crooked) to <i>Aida</i>, <i>La Boheme</i> and <i>Nixon in China</i>.</p>

<H3><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Abstract</FONT></H3>

<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><I>The author became involved
with the theory that AIDS originated from contaminated polio
vaccines, by arranging for publication of a key paper, interacting
with key partisans and writing articles himself. These experiences
suggest some of the advantages and disadvantages of partisan
intervention in the scientific reception system by a social analyst.
Open partisanship should be added to the repertoire of social
analysts of science.</I></FONT></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><B>In studying a scientific
controversy</B>, should the analyst ever intentionally intervene as a
partisan? What are the advantages of partisan intervention by a
social scientist in learning about the dynamics of science? These
questions are asked too infrequently in the science studies field,
where intentional, planned intervention seems rare <A HREF="#fn1">&#91;1&#93;</A>.
The following case study is presented to illustrate some of the
possibilities and problems opened by partisan intervention. It will
be followed by comments about the approach adopted and an attempt to
position the approach among various alternatives.</FONT></P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Polio vaccines and the origin of
AIDS</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1990, Richard Sylvan, an
Australian philosopher, sent me a package of materials he had
received from Louis Pascal. Sylvan knew of my interest in the
suppression of intellectual dissent, and indeed his own case has
featured in my publications <A HREF="#fn2">&#91;2&#93;</A>.
Pascal, an 'independent scholar' living in New York City, had written
articles arguing that AIDS originated from contaminated polio
vaccines used in Africa in the 1950s, but had been unable to get them
published. I wrote to him, thus beginning an involvement in the
controversy over the origin of AIDS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A brief overview of theories of
the origin of AIDS is in order. The standard theory of the origin of
AIDS is that a virus called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV),
found in monkeys or chimpanzees, was transmitted to humans where it
became or mutated to become the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
The method of transmission is unknown. The usual explanations are
that a hunter received a cut while butchering a monkey and got monkey
blood in the cut, that a human ate undercooked monkey meat, that a
monkey bit a human, or that monkey blood was injected into humans
during certain sexual rites <A HREF="#fn3">&#91;3&#93;</A>.
There are two main types of HIV, called HIV-1 and HIV-2, of which
HIV-1 is the most prevalent worldwide. Based on the divergence of
strains of HIV-1, it is generally thought to have originated in
Africa just before 1960, though some scientists argue for a much
earlier origin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Given that humans have been
butchering monkeys and being bitten by them for hundreds or thousands
of years, why would AIDS have developed in the 1950s? One explanation
is that urbanisation and the turmoil of war led to the spread of the
disease out of a calm rural setting. Another is coincidence
<A HREF="#fn4">&#91;4&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pascal accepted the standard
theory except for one key component: the method of transmission of
SIV to humans. On the basis of his study of evidence from the medical
literature, plus some careful thinking, he argued that at least one
type of SIV was introduced into humans--becoming HIV-1--during the
world's earliest mass polio vaccination campaigns, carried out in
central and west Africa from 1957-59. At least 325,000 people had
this early vaccine sprayed into their mouths. The vaccine was
produced by Hilary Koprowski, who is less well known than two other
polio vaccine pioneers, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, whose vaccines
became widely used elsewhere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pascal provided a series of
reasons why this early vaccination campaign could have led to the
entry of SIV into humans. Koprowski's vaccine was cultured on monkey
kidneys, which meant that monkey viruses could contaminate the
vaccine. Many monkeys with viruses are not affected by them or do not
show symptoms, and so would not have been excluded from vaccine
production. The vaccine used live polio virus <A HREF="#fn5">&#91;5&#93;</A>,
so it was certainly possible for monkey viruses to contaminate the
vaccine. It is known that one monkey virus, SV40, was inadvertently
given to hundreds of millions of people around the world via polio
vaccine <A HREF="#fn6">&#91;6&#93;</A>.
AIDS could have been produced via SIV contamination of just one batch
of vaccine. There was no screening for SIVs, which were not
discovered until 1985.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pascal also discovered that the
vaccine had been given to thousands of children, including infants
less than a month old. Furthermore, the infants received 15 times the
normal dose. Since the immune systems of infants are undeveloped,
they provide an ideal way of transmitting a virus from one species to
another. The locations of Koprowski's main campaigns are not only in
Africa, where HIV is thought to have originated, but also in
precisely the regions of Africa now thought to have among the highest
rates of AIDS in the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If this theory is correct, it has
enormous significance. First, the use of monkey kidneys for producing
polio vaccines should be stopped immediately, since there remains the
possibility of introducing additional new viruses into humans.
Second, much more scrutiny should be given to other transfers of
animal tissue into humans, such as transplants of baboon livers into
humans or the use of bovine haemoglobin. Third, the theory gives some
suggestions for seeking ways to respond to AIDS, for example by
searching for monkeys or chimpanzees with SIVs similar to HIV-1 and
HIV-2 and seeing how they are able to survive with the
virus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1987, Pascal wrote a paper
describing this theory. He sent it to numerous biologists, but
obtained only one acknowledgement and no comments. The paper was
rejected by <I>Nature</I>, <I>New Scientist</I> and <I>Lancet</I>.
Encouraged by the editor, Pascal wrote a longer and different account
for the <I>Journal of Medical Ethics</I>, but this was eventually
rejected for being too long.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After corresponding with Pascal,
during which time the <I>Journal of Medical Ethics</I> rejected his
paper, I arranged publication of the paper in a working paper series
at my university <A HREF="#fn7">&#91;7&#93;</A>.
There were several justifications for this. First, from his writings
and responses to challenges and from his letters to me, I judged
Pascal to be a highly intelligent, rigorous and meticulous
researcher. Second, he had pretty much exhausted orthodox channels
for publication. Third, his theory has important social implications,
as noted above. Fourth, Pascal's paper included a forceful argument
about the responsibility of scientists and editors. Fifth, Pascal's
paper included some intriguing comments on HIV as an actor,
outwitting human resistance (including peer review systems), which
would be of special interest to science studies scholars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Publication of Pascal's paper also
provided an opportunity for a social science experiment: to see how
his ideas spread as a result of this intervention into the
'scientific reception system.' In other words, the publication was,
among other things, a probe designed to test the response of the
scientific community <A HREF="#fn8">&#91;8&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although I was trained and worked
as a scientist, no branch of biology was ever an area of my
expertise. My position in championing Pascal's work was to argue that
it deserved a hearing. But why pick out the polio-vaccine theory?
After all, there are untold unorthodox theories that might be
promoted. One reason for promoting this theory was the opportunity to
do so. Another was the need. For example, another unorthodox
theory--namely, that HIV is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause
AIDS--has been energetically promoted by Peter Duesberg, a prominent
scientist <A HREF="#fn9">&#91;9&#93;</A>.
There was no such prominent scientist pushing the polio-vaccine
theory. I also used my own judgement, assessing the theory on both
scientific and social scientific grounds. Pascal argues that even a
schoolchild can understand his arguments. This may be an
exaggeration, but it is certainly the case that advanced study,
whether in mathematics or molecular biology, is not required to
decide whether the theory is worthy of further investigation. The
potential of the theory was supported by a few specialists, notably
Gerasimos Lecatsas, Professor of Virology at the Medical University
of Southern Africa, Pretoria, and Jennifer J. Alexander, Professor of
Microbiology at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg
<A HREF="#fn10">&#91;10&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the social science point of
view, there are several reasons why Pascal's submissions to journals
would have been rejected. He had no name in the field and indeed had
no formal position as a scientist. Writing from a private address,
his contributions were likely to be dismissed. Also, perhaps due to
working outside the scientific establishment, his writing was not
quite in the standard style. Finally, and most importantly, linking
polio vaccines and AIDS is highly threatening to immunologists. It is
likely that even a prominent scientist would have encountered
hostility trying to promote this theory <A HREF="#fn11">&#91;11&#93;</A>.
Sociologically, then, there was every reason to believe that the
response of the scientific reception system (primarily editors and
referees) to Pascal's submissions was much more hostile than it would
have been to an orthodox, unthreatening theory presented by a
recognised scientist working at an established institution
<A HREF="#fn12">&#91;12&#93;</A>.
Thus, I used a sociological assessment of the issues to help draw a
conclusion about the scientific merits of the theory--namely that it
deserved more examination than had so far occurred <A HREF="#fn13">&#91;13&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The view that a scientific
hypothesis deserves more examination is hardly a daring one
<A HREF="#fn14">&#91;14&#93;</A>;
for a social scientist who claims no special expertise in the field,
it is a suitably modest one. Although my formal stance has been
indifference to the correctness of the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory, but
simply concern that it be given a fair hearing, it would be
disingenuous to pretend that I have no personal view on the matter.
Two important reasons why I chose this theory to study and promote,
out of many rejected by the scientific establishment, were that, in
my judgement, it has significant social implications and a reasonable
chance of eventually being judged by the scientific community to be
correct. Furthermore, studying the arguments and becoming aware of
efforts to deny and squash the theory meant building up some degree
of commitment to it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pascal's paper, 'What Happens When
Science Goes Bad,' was published in December 1991 in the working
paper series of a research programme at the University of Wollongong
<A HREF="#fn15">&#91;15&#93;</A>.
Pascal gave me a list of some 25 names, including some well-known
scientists and philosophers, to whom I sent copies <A HREF="#fn16">&#91;16&#93;</A>.
I also sent copies to my contacts on the suppression of intellectual
dissent, and to some of the people with whom I was corresponding
anyway. For the most part, though, I simply sent copies to anyone who
requested them, and to any people to whom anyone recommended I send
copies. The paper was provided free of charge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some recipients wrote to Pascal
(whose address was included in the working paper, though not in a
conspicuous place) and some to me, and Pascal and I exchanged copies
of much correspondence sent and received <A HREF="#fn17">&#91;17&#93;</A>.
In this way I developed a feeling for the impact of the paper as it
was disseminated. Three significant early responses were from W. D.
Hamilton, Professor of Zoology at Oxford University and an acclaimed
evolutionary biologist <A HREF="#fn18">&#91;18&#93;</A>,
who was largely supportive of Pascal's ideas; Robert M. May, also a
Professor of Zoology at Oxford University and a prominent
mathematical biologist <A HREF="#fn19">&#91;19&#93;</A>,
who was critical both of Pascal's style and ideas; and microbiologist
Jennifer Alexander <A HREF="#fn20">&#91;20&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">After receiving a number of these
responses, in February 1992 I took another step in promoting Pascal's
paper, sending it to science journalists at major Australian print
media (all six of them!) <A HREF="#fn21">&#91;21&#93;</A>.
At first this appeared not to produce any response, but a month later
I received a call from Julian Cribb of <I>The Australian</I>, a
national daily newspaper. He had spent weeks in medical libraries
tracking down references cited by Pascal and finding others, and was
horrified by what he had found. On the basis of his investigation,
Cribb wrote a major story <A HREF="#fn22">&#91;22&#93;</A>.
He later told me that he was contacted by numerous readers about the
story but that the Australian medical establishment remained silent
<A HREF="#fn23">&#91;23&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pascal asked me to send a copy of
his Wollongong working paper to the <I>Journal of Medical Ethics</I>,
which earlier had rejected it. The editor of the journal, Raanon
Gillon, wrote an editorial announcing that the paper had been
published at the University of Wollongong and explaining why the
<I>Journal of Medical Ethics</I> had refused to publish it. He
provided quite a favourable account, saying that Pascal's thesis 'is
an important and thoroughly argued one and ought to be taken
seriously by workers in the AIDS field' <A HREF="#fn24">&#91;24&#93;</A>.
The editorial also gave full details on how to obtain Pascal's paper.
This had a significant long-term effect, leading to dozens of
requests for copies of Pascal's paper over the following years, many
from doctors and medical ethics centres.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There were also requests from
people outside the mainstream. On the request of a friend, I sent a
copy to the Australian magazine <I>Nexus</I>, which features
sensational stories about unorthodox views and fringe science. The
editor wrote a brief notice about the paper (saying 'I recommend you
obtain this paper--IT'S INCREDIBLE!') and as a result numerous
requests for the working paper were received, most typically from
small Australian towns <A HREF="#fn25">&#91;25&#93;</A>.
A year later, after giving a talk about the theory to a meeting of a
homoeopathic society which was reported in the society's journal, I
received quite a number of requests for copies of Pascal's paper from
readers of the journal. As well as the hundreds of copies that I
distributed, many recipients made photocopies and circulated them.
Judging from the correspondence and the amount of interest in further
circulating the paper, it was quite a hit. Certainly it generated
vastly more interest than any other working paper in the
series.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My social science experiment in
following the distribution and impact of Pascal's paper was soon
interrupted by another development: independent discovery and
publication of the same theory. Blaine Elswood, an AIDS activist in
San Francisco, developed the same ideas as Pascal. Elswood then fed
information to freelance journalist Tom Curtis, who investigated
further, interviewed Koprowski, Salk, Sabin and others, and wrote a
comprehensive story on the theory published in <I>Rolling Stone</I>
in February 1992 <A HREF="#fn26">&#91;26&#93;</A>,
as well as a series of articles for the <I>Houston Post</I>.
<I>Rolling Stone</I> is hardly a scientific publication, but it has a
circulation of one million. Curtis's story led to follow-up stories
in numerous media outlets and journals, including the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I>, <I>Washington Post</I>, <I>Science</I>, <I>Nature</I> and
<I>New Scientist</I>. There is a nice irony here. Pascal could not
get his sober treatments of the theory published in scientific
journals, but they were willing to publish stories following an
account in <I>Rolling Stone</I>!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The <I>Rolling Stone</I> article
was quickly brought to my attention by various contacts. I despatched
two copies of Pascal's paper to Elswood, who in turn sent a copy to
Curtis as I requested, and thus I began communication with each of
them. From Elswood I learned, among many other things, about the
difficulties that he and co-author Raphael Stricker had in publishing
a scientific paper in Luc Montagnier's journal <I>Research in
Virology</I> <A HREF="#fn27">&#91;27&#93;</A>.
From Curtis, I learned that he sent several versions of a letter,
along with copies of references, to <I>Science</I> taking issue,
point by point, with a long letter by Koprowski that had been
published in <I>Science</I>. Curtis told me that <I>Science</I>
refused to print his letter <A HREF="#fn28">&#91;28&#93;</A>.
The independent publication of the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory by
Curtis and by Elswood and Stricker provided me with more insights
into the response of the scientific community to this particular
threatening idea.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By being the central distribution
point for Pascal's paper, I was also the recipient of much
information. For example, when English journalist Andrew Tyler wrote
a story about the theory in <I>The Independent Magazine</I>, I soon
received copies of the story and, later, a copy of correspondence
between Tyler and Pascal <A HREF="#fn29">&#91;29&#93;</A>.
The simple explanation is that people are more likely to provide
information to someone who is sympathetic and who is providing them
with something.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In spite of all this activity, in
August 1992 I decided that a further intervention into the debate was
in order. I wrote an article about peer review aspects of the theory,
recounting experiences of Pascal, Lecatsas and Alexander, Elswood and
Stricker, and others. Pascal, Curtis and Elswood provided comments
which corrected mistakes and sharpened the arguments. My paper was
rejected by <I>British Medical Journal</I> and then accepted by
<I>BioScience</I> <A HREF="#fn30">&#91;30&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In response to the intense
publicity following publication of Curtis's article in <I>Rolling
Stone</I>, the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia--the manufacturer of
Koprowski's polio vaccines, and where Koprowski still worked--set up
an independent inquiry into the polio-vaccine-AIDS hypothesis. In
September 1992, the committee of scientists reported that the chance
that the hypothesis was true was 'extremely low' but nevertheless
recommended that serious efforts be made to switch away from monkey
kidneys for culturing polio vaccines <A HREF="#fn31">&#91;31&#93;</A>.
This conclusion was favourably reported by <I>Science</I> which did,
however, publish a reply by Curtis <A HREF="#fn32">&#91;32&#93;</A>.
Through my correspondence I obtained Pascal's detailed critique of
the committee's report and also confirmed what was fairly obvious
from the report--namely that the committee had not contacted Curtis,
Elswood or Pascal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Meanwhile, a new development
occurred: in December 1992, Koprowski sued Curtis and <I>Rolling
Stone</I> for defamation. Whatever the motivation behind this legal
action, I was not the only one to note that a prime effect was to
shut down most media discussion of the theory. As part of the
'discovery' phase of the case, each side had to provide copies of
relevant documents. Initially, Koprowski provided some 40 pages, but
Curtis had to provide hundreds if not thousands, including copies of
all his notes made preparing the <I>Rolling Stone</I> article--he had
not promised confidentiality to people he interviewed and with whom
he corresponded <A HREF="#fn33">&#91;33&#93;</A>.
Curtis was also inhibited in doing further investigation of the
theory, since he would have to tell any informant that 'Anything you
say to me might end up in the hands of Koprowski's lawyers' or words
to that effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 25 February 1993, I posted a
notice on the Sci-Tech-Studies electronic mailing list
<A HREF="#fn34">&#91;34&#93;</A>,
telling about the theory and Koprowski's defamation case, and asking
for examples of the use of legal action to stop discussion of
scientific theories. This led to a number of suggestions and quite a
few requests for Pascal's paper. I sent a note to <I>Nature</I> about
the dangers of legal action squashing scientific discussion
<A HREF="#fn35">&#91;35&#93;</A>
and incorporated information about the legal action in my paper for
<I>BioScience</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In November 1993, just before
Koprowski had to undergo deposition, his lawyers settled out of
court. <I>Rolling Stone </I>paid Koprowski a grand total of $1, and
published a statement <A HREF="#fn36">&#91;36&#93;</A>.
Of course, a statement made under financial duress--<I>Rolling
Stone</I>'s legal expenses were some $500,000--should have little
credibility. Curtis believes that my correspondence in <I>Nature</I>
and my article in <I>BioScience</I> may have influenced Koprowski to
settle, by showing that his legal action might have stimulated rather
than discouraged interest in the theory <A HREF="#fn37">&#91;37&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ironically, my <I>BioScience</I>
article, published in October 1993 <A HREF="#fn38">&#91;38&#93;</A>,
did not produce many requests for Pascal's paper. Instead, I received
several letters from scientists with strong interests in peer review.
However, the article has been distributed widely and was a useful
source for an article in a high-circulation Dutch magazine
<A HREF="#fn39">&#91;39&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1993, I was visited by a worker
in the AIDS field who is well known due to studies circulated
worldwide, who had received a copy of Pascal's paper from a colleague
and had then put considerable effort into further investigation of
the arguments <A HREF="#fn40">&#91;40&#93;</A>.
This scientist, whom I will call Dr A, prefers to keep a low profile
on this issue because it can undermine one's credibility to get
involved with it. In any case, Dr A took the opportunity of meeting
me to learn more about what I knew about the theory and its social
context and to inform me of the progress of a personal
investigation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As mentioned earlier, eminent
biologist W. D. Hamilton was favourable towards the
polio-vaccine-AIDS theory. In January 1994 he sent a letter to
<I>Science</I> responding to Koprowski's 1992 letter in
<I>Science</I>, which remained the only substantive published
criticism of the theory. <I>Science</I> earlier had refused to
publish Curtis's reply to Koprowski's letter; it now refused to
publish Hamilton's. Hamilton then wrote a personal letter to the
editor of <I>Science</I>, Daniel E. Koshland, Jr, asking for a
reconsideration of the decision in the light of the enormous
significance of the issues involved. This was one of the most
eloquent letters I had read in quite some time. In response, Koshland
reiterated <I>Science</I>'s rejection of the letter. This development
confirmed my earlier assessment that the rejection of Pascal's
submissions owed as much to the threat posed by his ideas as it did
to his status as an outsider and the style of his writing
<A HREF="#fn41">&#91;41&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In February 1994 I received a call
from John Roberts, who said he was working for a foundation in San
Francisco that had been working on blood and blood-product-related
legal aspects of AIDS for nine years <A HREF="#fn42">&#91;42&#93;</A>.
He said he was supporting a massive lawsuit against the Federal Drug
Administration and others for giving children AIDS via polio
vaccines, and claimed to have informants in the Wistar Institute and
elsewhere. He told me much else, called again a week later, sent me a
letter and a videotape of US television programmes. I gave him names
and addresses of Pascal, Elswood, Curtis, Lecatasas, Alexander and
Hamilton, and Roberts later contacted them. Elswood and Curtis each
became suspicious about Roberts. There was independent evidence, such
as numerous news stories, about a legal case in which parents of a
young girl who contracted AIDS alleged that polio vaccine was
responsible <A HREF="#fn43">&#91;43&#93;</A>.
But confirmation of Roberts' involvement was not easy. For example,
Curtis obtained from Roberts the year he claimed to have graduated
from Harvard Medical School but found that Harvard had no record of
any graduate that year named John Roberts. Who 'John Roberts' is and
who (if anyone) he is working for remains somewhat of a mystery. My
role in the issue actually provided the means for Roberts to contact
others <A HREF="#fn44">&#91;44&#93;</A>.
But since early 1994 he has dropped from sight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In October 1994 I visited the US
to attend the annual meeting of the Society for Social Studies of
Science (4S), held in New Orleans. It was an ideal opportunity to
meet Curtis, who lives in Galveston. Elswood came down from Utah and
Malcolm Davidson, an engineer from New York who has followed the
theory, also joined our discussions. John Douard organised a
successful symposium at the 4S meeting about the polio-vaccine-AIDS
theory, in which Curtis and I spoke as well as Michael Curtis, a
lawyer and Tom Curtis's brother. Though not a formal speaker, Elswood
participated in a major way. We also gave a seminar at the University
of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. However, the most important
part of my visit was a two-day meeting at Curtis's house with Elswood
and Malcolm Davidson, before going to New Orleans. As well as ongoing
discussion about the theory and its reception, I took the lead in
collating options for action and focussing discussion on how to
proceed. We discussed angles for pursuing further work, including
SV-40, dangers from animal viruses, legal threats to discussion of
scientific theories and the social responsibility of scientists. We
also discussed the interests and atittudes of various individuals who
might investigate the theory, and possible publication outlets. A
major outcome of the meeting is that I agreed to compile a package of
information about the theory <A HREF="#fn45">&#91;45&#93;</A>
and to send it to a range of scientists and journalists. In December
1994 and January 1995 I sent more than a dozen packages. This
generated a further round of correspondence, for example with Mirko
D. Grmek, author of the highly regarded <I>History of AIDS</I>
<A HREF="#fn46">&#91;46&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 24 March 1995 issue of the
British newspaper <I>The Independent</I> had a dramatic front-page
headline story entitled 'World's First Aids Case was False'
<A HREF="#fn47">&#91;47&#93;</A>.
A Manchester man who died in 1959 had previously been recognised by
most scientists as the first victim of AIDS for which verification
had been obtained using sophisticated tests for HIV <A HREF="#fn48">&#91;48&#93;</A>.
This case, which received enormous attention when these tests were
published in 1990, was used by the Wistar Committee as the most
telling evidence against the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory
<A HREF="#fn49">&#91;49&#93;</A>.
The story in <I>The Independent</I> broke the news about further
investigations led by David Ho--director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York--which concluded that the Manchester
man's remains contained no evidence of HIV and that someone else's
tissues, which revealed HIV in 1990, were mixed in. It appeared to
the investigators that earlier positive results could only be
explained by a mix-up or fraud <A HREF="#fn50">&#91;50&#93;</A>.
There are a number of intriguing aspects to this development
<A HREF="#fn51">&#91;51&#93;</A>,
but for present purposes the important point is that elimination of
this case removes a key objection to the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory,
as was recognised by one of the original stories in <I>The
Independent</I> <A HREF="#fn52">&#91;52&#93;</A>.
However, there seems to be no sign of a reconsideration of the theory
in the light of the new developments <A HREF="#fn53">&#91;53&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is much else that could be
said about the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory and its reception, including
new evidence and arguments, the involvement or noninvolvement of
other scientists and activists, correspondence and conflicts. Here I
have emphasised my own role in order to throw light on the strategy
of partisan intervention by an analyst of science.</FONT></P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some Advantages and Disadvantages
of Intervention</FONT></H2>

<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Access to large quantities of
correspondence</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In my case, this includes
correspondence directly to me plus copies of other correspondence
given to me. The value of this material is immense: it includes
questions, tentative ideas, confidential material, drafts of letters
and much else that provides insight into the issue. Much of it would
be unavailable to someone who was not seen as a partisan. Even more
significantly, there is enormous value in the correspondence to me
personally, often sent in response to documents, letters or articles
that I have sent. By being involved as a participant, I can make
queries, raise issues and provoke responses in a way impossible to
someone viewing the issue as an outsider.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Being involved in the debate also
introduces limitations in regard to some correspondence and
documents. In a few instances, I have received material whose content
I have been asked not to reveal. Nevertheless, such material provides
valuable background insights into the issue. Also, insider documents
from the other side are unlikely to be available. (Exceptions include
responses from <I>Nature</I>, <I>Science</I>, <I>Research in Virology
</I>and other journals to submissions from Pascal, Curtis, Elswood
and Hamilton.)</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Contact with leading
participants</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In many cases, this would involve
face-to-face discussions and telephone conversations. In my case, due
to the distances involved, I have had few face-to-face meetings even
with interested parties in Australia (such as Julian Cribb). My
contact with leading participants has included a voluminous postal
correspondence with Pascal (his letters to me alone total more than
50,000 words), extensive electronic mail with Elswood (hundreds of
messages), both post and occasional telephone conversations with
Curtis, conversations with John Roberts, meetings with Dr A, Curtis
and Elswood, plus correspondence with a number of others. This is not
to mention face-to-face and telephone discussions with many people
who had read or heard about the theory. Another feature of this
contact is that it is in the midst of the issue as it develops and
takes the form of discussions, comment and consultation rather than
interviews. Formal interviews with participants at a later stage
typically involve reconstructions of events that give a different
slant <A HREF="#fn54">&#91;54&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A degree of control over the
issues</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By publishing Pascal's paper and
writing papers myself, I have played some role in shaping the course
of the debate. For example, my introduction to Pascal's paper, as
well as my article in <I>BioScience</I>, make a connection between
the response to this theory and suppression of intellectual dissent.
In meeting with Curtis and Elswood in 1994, I helped set the agenda
for future promotion of the theory. The more prominent a person's
role in a debate, typically the more influence they can have over the
issues debated. But, of course, there are severe limits to this
influence, since many others have their own ideas about what issues
are important.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Understanding of communication
networks</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By being a key node in the network
of people discussing and promoting the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory, I
have been in an ideal situation to understand how the network itself
operates. For example, there have been 'high-density' channels--such
as between Elswood and me--that would be unsuspected from anyone
examining published documents only. Another example is the strong
interest and support of W. D. Hamilton, known to me via
correspondence with Pascal <A HREF="#fn55">&#91;55&#93;</A>.
The 'network' as a whole has been more coherent than it would have
been without my own involvement. Insights from participation in the
communication network include a keen appreciation of contributions of
key players, knowledge that there is no central control over the
agenda, and awareness of heated disagreements between key figures
concerning theory and tactics. Perhaps the greatest value gained by
being involved in the communications network is the ability to
evaluate hypotheses about the social dynamics of ideas on this issue.
An outsider trying to understand a controversy may assume or conclude
that certain arguments are important or certain interests play a
role. An insider can quickly assess many such assumptions and
conclusions. Another aspect of understanding the communications
network is a more acute sense of the course of developments over
time. Bursts of activity and slack periods are experienced
personally, rather than just noted via dates on documents.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some disadvantages of
intervention</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The pitfalls and problems of
partisan involvement are many; here I mention a few obvious ones. The
'other side' is likely to be less than helpful, and many of their
documents are likely to be 'unavailable.' Then there is the shaping
of the analyst's understanding due to partisanship, which, to use
positivist language, can simply be called bias or distortion. The
analyst's involvement may so perturb the issue that it is impossible
to guess how it would have proceeded otherwise. Also, the intervening
analyst may spoil the issue for others who want to study it, by
setting agendas, causing participants to be wary of other analysts,
and so on. By being perceived to be a partisan, a social analyst's
credibility can be reduced, which can affect further investigation or
future studies on other topics <A HREF="#fn56">&#91;56&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Intervention can be a form of
cultural imperialism if and when the analyst behaves in a way that is
oppressive for the community being studied. This is unlikely to be a
problem when social scientists intervene in the scientific
enterprise, which itself is the dominant culture of knowledge in
western societies, at least when social scientists tackle stronger
rather than weaker elements in the scientific community.</FONT></P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Insights from the Case
Study</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although the main aim of this
paper is to illustrate an intervention approach in science studies,
not to document results, it is worth noting some of the things I have
learned about the dynamics of this issue. (Some of these were
mentioned in the description of the case.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Louis Pascal is undoubtedly a key
figure in the development of the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory. Yet he
has had only one significant publication in the field, the working
paper at the University of Wollongong whose publication I arranged.
By contrast, Elswood, Stricker, Curtis, Lecatsas and Alexander have
published in the scientific literature and Curtis (in <I>Rolling
Stone</I>) has achieved a much wider circulation of the ideas. It is
only by looking behind the scenes that Pascal's contribution becomes
apparent. He is an incredibly meticulous and prolific correspondent.
In his letters he has provided long and detailed analyses of
arguments and evidence and has offered intense scrutiny to writings
by Curtis, Hamilton and Elswood, as well as responding to many
others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While there has been intense
discussion of the theory within the network of supporters, there has
been very little direct dialogue with critics who are scientists.
There are exceptions: Curtis interviewed Koprowski, Sabin and Salk,
among others, although these scientists dismissed the theory out of
hand; Robert M. May and I exchanged a few letters; a few scientists
offered comments after receiving a copy of Pascal's paper. But the
main pattern has been lack of direct dialogue <A HREF="#fn57">&#91;57&#93;</A>.
This replicates the published record <A HREF="#fn58">&#91;58&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pascal's paper generated enormous
interest. Most of the copies distributed have been provided or
requested on the recommendation of others who have read it. For
example, one recipient made 200 photocopies for further circulation.
The article in <I>Nexus</I> led to numerous requests from within
Australia, the article in <I>Journal of Medical Ethics</I> led to
many from around the world. By being the publisher and distributor of
Pascal's paper, I have kept a record and obtained a good idea of the
sort of people--from geographical locations, institutional
affiliations, and comments made--interested in the issue. There is no
equivalent data for readers of Tom Curtis's article in <I>Rolling
Stone</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The fact that many hundreds of
copies of Pascal's paper have been circulated, and that dozens of
people have responded with comments, suggests a greater impact than
most scientific papers enjoy. There was relatively little direct
response to my articles in <I>BioScience</I> and <I>Townsend Letter
for Doctors</I> <A HREF="#fn59">&#91;59&#93;</A>.
Julian Cribb's article in <I>The Weekend Australian</I> generated
relatively little correspondence, and none from the medical
establishment <A HREF="#fn60">&#91;60&#93;</A>.
In early 1992 I circulated copies of Pascal's paper to a wide range
of magazines of social criticism, such as <I>Earth First!</I>,
<I>Mother Jones</I> and <I>New Internationalist</I>, with a covering
letter suggesting the potential importance of the issues covered.
There were only a few acknowledgements and, to my knowledge, only one
short article published as a result <A HREF="#fn61">&#91;61&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The above observations give an
idea of some of the insights gained by my participation in the issue.
There are many other observations that I could make, especially about
the theory itself, although some of these would have been available
to a nonparticipant reading the published literature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Could a nonintervening analyst
gain the same perspective on this case that I have? Even if, somehow,
an analyst could obtain all the documents about the case, this could
not possibly provide the same perspective because it would miss the
way that my own involvement has shaped the evolution of the issue
<A HREF="#fn62">&#91;62&#93;</A>.
I arranged for the publication of Pascal's paper, which in turn
influenced the development of the network of people examining the
theory. I interacted with Pascal and, for example, saw his responses
to my suggestions for revising his paper. I helped to shape the
direction of the debate over the theory and the distribution of
material about it and, in doing so, gained insight into the positions
and responsiveness of various individuals, both supporters and
critics. Intervention perturbs the issue being studied, and so the
insights are bound to be different from those available to a
nonintervening analyst. In other words, probing the social system of
science can trigger responses that reveal aspects of science not
accessible to a nonintervening observer, just as carrying out
scientific experiments can lead to understandings of nature not
available through observation alone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As stated earlier, understanding
more about the dynamics of the polio-vaccine-AIDS issue and about the
operation of the scientific reception system was only one aim of my
involvement. Another aim was to help change the way with which
unorthodox theories are dealt. Certainly my involvement has led to
greater visibility of the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory, through my own
articles and through helping maintain the network of the theory's
supporters. It is less easy to observe any impact on the scientific
reception system generally.</FONT></P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Positioning the Case
Study</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are many different ways to
categorise case studies in the analysis of science. Here, three
different areas are examined: the purpose and effect of the study,
the involvement of the analyst in the issue being studied, and the
type or degree of partisanship of the analyst. These categories are
neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, but are convenient here
for showing how the polio-vaccine-AIDS study relates to other
approaches.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Purpose and effect</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are several possibilities
here, among them understanding of the operation of science, effecting
change in science and society, and advancing the analyst's career
<A HREF="#fn63">&#91;63&#93;</A>.
Each of these possibilities, among others, may be the intent of the
analyst (the purpose), the effect of the analysis, neither or both
(see Table 1). Understanding of the operation of science is a
standard purpose in academic science studies, effecting change is a
standard purpose in much science policy, and career advancement is a
common but seldom acknowledged purpose <A HREF="#fn64">&#91;64&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just to say that the intent and/or
effect of a study is understanding or change is not the end of the
matter. More specifically, what sort of understanding or change is
intended or caused? In this case study, my intent was to learn about
how the scientific community responds to an unorthodox and
threatening theory by being an insider in the promotion of the
theory. I also intended to help change the operation of science by
giving the polio-vaccine-AIDS theory added support. Specifically, my
aim has been to help promote serious examination and testing of the
theory, followed by serious action if it seems to have a reasonable
chance of being correct--including stopping using monkey kidneys for
making polio vaccines and stopping other practices that may allow
cross-species transfers of viruses. More generally, my purpose has
been to alert some people to the obstacles facing such
theories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My assessment is that my
involvement has certainly helped to promote the theory. My activities
have given much greater visibility to the work of Pascal, have
directly or indirectly encouraged the participation of others such as
Hamilton, and indirectly may have contributed to the resolution of
Koprowski's defamation case against <I>Rolling Stone</I> and Curtis.
Whether it has contributed to understanding or other effects is
difficult to say <A HREF="#fn65">&#91;65&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Table 1. Possible purposes and

...</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Involvement</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A second category is the
involvement or participation of the analyst in the issue being
studied. The usual conceptualisation distinguishes between complete
observation at the one extreme and complete participation at the
other. At the observation extreme, the social scientist uses
'nonobtrusive measures' to study the phenomenon in question, such as
reading documents or watching from a concealed location. At the
participation extreme, the social scientist joins in as a member, as
in Leon Festinger et al.'s classic study <I>When Prophecy Fails</I>,
in which social analysts joined an end-of-the-world cult, pretending
to be believers, in order to find out how belief systems could be
maintained in the face of disconfirming evidence <A HREF="#fn66">&#91;66&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another framework for
conceptualising participation has been proposed by Harry Collins:
'participant comprehension' <A HREF="#fn67">&#91;67&#93;</A>.
In this mode of participation, the social scientist learns about the
area by trying, however temporarily, to pass as a competent member or
native--parapsychologists in the case of Collins and Pinch
<A HREF="#fn68">&#91;68&#93;</A>.
This provides the social scientist with an insight into what
constitutes the native 'form of life.'</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another way for participatory
fieldwork to occur is for a native to become a social scientist. The
native has complete participation and comprehension, but often lacks
the conceptual tools of the social scientist. There are quite a few
cases in which scientists have written accounts that in some sense
count as social science <A HREF="#fn69">&#91;69&#93;</A>.
Whether these should ever be categorised as participatory fieldwork
cannot be addressed here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My study of the polio-vaccine-AIDS
theory is certainly a type of participatory fieldwork. It is
partially captured by the usual conceptualisation as much closer to
complete participation than complete observation. In terms of
Collins's ideal-type model, my study goes part of the way towards
participant comprehension, though not so far as Collins's involvement
in parapsychology research, since I have not myself undertaken any
investigations into the scientific aspects of polio vaccines and
AIDS. Since I have retained my role as a social scientist and have
been openly involved as a social scientist, it may be necessary to
set up another participation-related conceptualisation, with the
extremes being nondisturbance and major change (see Table 2).
Festinger et al. did not aim to change the psychosocial dynamics of
the group they joined (though their participation certainly had an
effect). Similarly, Collins and Pinch do not say that they intended
to change the way the scientific community dealt with psychic
phenomena, though their work certainly had a considerable impact. In
my case, my participation <I>was</I> intended to change the way the
polio-vaccine-AIDS theory was dealt with; it has had an impact on the
circulation of the ideas and the coordination of the work of leading
proponents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These alternative
conceptualisations of participation are linked to the stated purpose
of the research. In the cases of Festinger and his colleagues and of
Collins and Pinch, their stated primary purpose was understanding,
though their participation also led to considerable impacts on the
subjects and fields of the studies. My purpose, by contrast, was at
least as much change as understanding.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Partisanship</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In terms of the stated intention
of the analyst, the issue of partisanship seems relatively
straightforward (see Table 3). On the one hand are studies in which
the analyst intends to remain neutral with respect to the issues
under study. On the other hand are numerous studies with the aim of
improving society, often going by the name of 'action research,' in
which partisanship is open and usually acknowledged. Generally
speaking, action researchers see the process of gaining knowledge and
changing society as interlinked, even inseparable. Intervention to
change society provides understanding--including new perspectives of
fundamental theoretical significance--which in turn can be used to
develop more effective intervention. In many cases, a key goal is
involvement by members of the 'community': those who are commonly the
objects of the research instead become the subjects. Studies of this
sort are often called 'participatory action research'
<A HREF="#fn70">&#91;70&#93;</A>.
Examples include interventions in schools <A HREF="#fn71">&#91;71&#93;</A>,
studies of industrial democracy <A HREF="#fn72">&#91;72&#93;</A>,
investigations and support for social movements by Alain Touraine and
colleagues <A HREF="#fn73">&#91;73&#93;</A>,
and action anthropology <A HREF="#fn74">&#91;74&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are a number of examples
where science studies researchers have been open partisans. For
example, Sharon Beder, in her study of the Sydney sewerage issue, was
a silent member of a group challenging the Sydney Water Board and fed
crucial information from her investigations to journalists, whose
stories she then had dutifully to cite in her own writing
<A HREF="#fn75">&#91;75&#93;</A>.
My own study of the views of two leading supporters of nuclear
technology in Australia falls into this category, as it was intended
to be (and was used as) a partisan intervention into the nuclear
power debate <A HREF="#fn76">&#91;76&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Whatever the intention of the
analyst, there are several possible ways in which the research may
end up being partisan in effect. One can be called '<I>de facto</I>
partisanship,' a process by which choices about research topics and
methods partially shape both the conclusions reached and the social
use of the study <A HREF="#fn77">&#91;77&#93;</A>.
In undertaking the study of an issue, a social scientist makes a
number of decisions: what issue to study; which particular time
periods, locations or facets of the issue on which to concentrate;
and what theoretical frameworks to adopt. A researcher may choose to
study repetition strain injury (RSI) rather than automobile
accidents; may choose to study RSI in Australia in the 1980s rather
than RSI in the US in the 1980s or in Australia in the 1960s; and may
choose a framework based on one or more of positivism, relativism,
social psychology, political economy and many other theories. These
choices inevitably shape conclusions reached. This meta-level
partisanship, due to choices of methods and research topics, is
appropriately called '<I>de facto</I> partisanship' because it is
built into assumptions underlying the enquiry, without any
requirement that the researcher be overtly or consciously
partisan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another way in which the effect of
a study may be partisan, sometimes in spite of the intent of the
analyst, is through 'capturing' of the analyst's work by participants
in the controversy <A HREF="#fn78">&#91;78&#93;</A>.
Namely, certain partisans in the controversy find the social analysis
useful for their own purposes and attempt to deploy it for partisan
purposes.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

Overt partisanship</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The involvement of the analyst in
  the issue being studied introduces a new dimension to the phenomenon
  of capturing. Relativist analysts of scientific controversies are
  susceptible to being captured by one set of partisans, typically but
  not always the side with lesser cognitive authority <A HREF="#fn79">&#91;79&#93;</A>.
  Hess extended this notion to multiple processes of capture and
  attempted capture, in which various partisans may attempt to capture
  both the analyst and other participants or observers <A HREF="#fn80">&#91;80&#93;</A>.
  The social analyst's intervention can be conceived of as an attempt
  to capture selected participants for the purpose of the analyst: the
  capturing is <I>by</I> rather than <I>of</I> the analyst. The
  analyst's pupose will, in general, both overlap with and diverge from
the purposes of the participants in question <A HREF="#fn81">&#91;81&#93;</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the case of polio vaccines and
the origin of AIDS, the proponents of this theory--especially Pascal,
Elswood and Curtis--can be interpreted as capturing me, a social
analyst, to help promote the theory. But it makes just as much sense
to see me as capturing them to mount a more effective and unified
campaign not only to promote the theory but also to probe the
scientific reception system and to expose bias against theories
threatening to the scientific establishment. In both cases, the term
'capture' is perhaps the wrong word since it connotes unwillingness
on the part of the captured. 'Mutual enrolment' or 'joining forces'
are more appropriate descriptions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The polio-vaccine-AIDS example
also illustrates another type of enrolment or capture process:
attempts to take over or shift entire areas of discourse
<A HREF="#fn82">&#91;82&#93;</A>.
The foundation of the struggle concerns what is considered legitimate
and authoritative discourse about scientific aspects of AIDS. Control
over this discourse is normally exercised by scientific elites, such
as editors of scientific journals; proponents of the
polio-vaccine-AIDS theory found the greatest difficulty gaining
access to this arena. Consequently, they used alternative, more
accessible media and writing styles more accesssible to
nonscientists, most obviously in the cases of independent publication
of Pascal's paper and of Curtis's article in <I>Rolling Stone</I>.
Supporters of the orthodox theory of the origin of AIDS reacted in
various ways: by ignoring the challenge, by Koprowski's reply in the
letters column of <I>Science</I> and by the Wistar Institute's
appointment of a scientific advisory committee to comment on the
challenging theory. Each of these responses can be seen as an
implicit assertion of the primacy of the arena of peer-reviewed
scientific publication and mainstream scientific authority.
Koprowski's action for defamation against Curtis and <I>Rolling
Stone</I>, on the other hand, challenged the arena of the mass media
and placed the issue into another arena, namely the law, with its own
characteristic discourse <A HREF="#fn83">&#91;83&#93;</A>.
The law has certain similarities to science, in that it is ostensibly
neutral but has built-in biases in favour of certain interests, such
as parties that have more money. An assessment of the media and the
law as platforms for adjudicating scientific disputes is outside the
ambit of this paper; it is sufficient to point out that shifting the
struggle to the legal domain can be conceived of as a means of
enrolling an entire institutional structure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It should be obvious from the
above account that types of partisanship as the effect of a study are
far from distinct. Partisanship can be unintended or intended; it can
be associated with the methods used, the topics chosen, the
conclusions reached, the style in which findings are couched and the
audiences to which they are imparted, among other factors. Nor does
partisanship associated with these different facets of research
always serve the same cause: conflicts and contradictions are to be
expected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some science studies scholars may
believe that partisanship is incompatible with impartiality and
symmetry, two of the four tenets of the Strong Programme (SP) in the
sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) <A HREF="#fn84">&#91;84&#93;</A>.
It is worth quoting David Bloor's original formulation of these
tenets. According to Bloor, SSK should 'be impartial with respect to
truth and falsity, rationality or irrationality, success or failure.
Both sides of these dichotomies will require explanation.' Also, it
should 'be symmetrical in its style of explanation. The same types of
cause would explain, say, true and false beliefs' <A HREF="#fn85">&#91;85&#93;</A>.
It is obvious from these statements and from Bloor's discussion that
impartiality and symmetry apply to explanations of beliefs. The
method of the SP analyst should be to use the same sorts of
explanations to explain different sorts of beliefs. These tenets say
nothing about the personal beliefs or engagement of the analyst. Some
social analysts may interpret the SP as implying a need for
neutrality--namely not supporting one belief over another. But this
does not follow from the tenets of impartiality and symmetry
themselves, which can also be interpreted as compatible with
partisanship. One can both explain a belief <I>and</I> support
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is a certain irony in the
situation here. Bloor modelled the SP on science itself: 'it will
embody the same values which are taken for granted in other
scientific disciplines' <A HREF="#fn86">&#91;86&#93;</A>.
In practice, scientists are highly partisan; it can even be argued
that partisanship is necessary for science to operate
<A HREF="#fn87">&#91;87&#93;</A>.
If SSK is to model itself on scientific practice rather than
idealisations of science, then partisanship should be expected rather
than avoided. Furthermore, if SSK is to be reflexive, it should be
acknowledged that sociologists of scientific knowledge have often
been partisans concerning their views about SSK itself.</FONT></P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Conclusion</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although potentially there are
many insights and social benefits to be gained by intervention in
science studies, my aim is certainly not to argue for intervention as
an inherently superior approach. Rather, it is to say that it should
be recognised as an approach that is useful for certain purposes. It
can provide insights unavailable through other methods, but, at the
same time, it can preclude certain insights. Intervention should be
recognised and used as part of the repertoire of social scientists
studying science. Different types and degrees of involvement and
intervention by the social analyst each have characteristic
advantages and disadvantages. The implication is that the science
studies community should support a variety of noninvolvements and
involvements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When should intervention be used?
Among other criteria, decisions about science studies methods can be
made on the basis of value to social science, to science and to
society <A HREF="#fn88">&#91;88&#93;</A>.
Judgements in each case are likely to be contested. In the case of
the polio-vaccines-AIDS theory, I decided to intervene for several
reasons: because intervention has so seldom been used in social
studies of science and therefore there were insights to be gained;
because I believe challenges need to be made to the scientific
establishment's frequent rejection of theories threatening to
powerful interests; and, not least, because this particular theory
has serious and wide-ranging social implications that deserve
attention. This is clearly a position based on values: social
scientists, by using their own insights and commitments, can use
intervention to seek to change science and society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some analysts may protest that it
is inappropriate to impose their values: their social analyses should
be kept separate from their social commitments. I believe that this
stance is misleading. Even a stance of detachment involves a value
choice, namely not to intervene.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Throughout much of this paper I
have emphasised the contributions of intervention to social science
understanding. But social science understanding cannot be separated
entirely from benefits and costs to different groups in society.
Knowledge is never socially neutral, either in its origins or in its
possible and likely applications. It is possible to argue that a
judgement about intervention should always be made, ultimately, on
the criterion of benefit to society, just as doctors' surgical
interventions should be judged by their benefit to patients, present
and future. In both cases, needless to say, there are difficult
ethical issues. These issues are not peculiar to interventionist
social science, where they are more obvious, but to all social
science.</FONT></P>

to Pascal's paper (Brian Martin, 'Introduction to Louis Pascal's
article,' in Pascal, op. cit. note 7, 1-2, at 2) includes the
following:<BR>
'Perhaps it is time for social analysts of science, rather than just
studying the way things are, to contribute to a changed communication
pattern. Since social analysts routinely make judgements about
interests associated with a position or about whether a particular
perspective is worth studying--and hence make de facto judgements
about claims about scientific knowledge--it is a short step to the
open promotion of the consideration of particular scientific
ideas.<BR>
'Another way to justify this working paper is to argue that
interventions into the scientific communication system provide a
fruitful way to study the system. For this reason, I look forward to
your response to this publication.'</FONT></P>

treatment is given by Steven Epstein, <I>Impure Science: AIDS,
Activism, and the Politics of Knowledge</I> (unpublished doctoral
dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, 1993). There are a
large number of unorthodox theories concerning AIDS. A useful survey
is given by Robert Lederer, 'Origin and Spread of AIDS: Is the West
Responsible?', <I>CovertAction Information Bulletin</I>, Vol. 28
(1987), 43-54 and Vol. 29 (1988), 52-65. Steve Epstein has pointed
out to me (personal communication, 11 December 1993) an aspect of my
own partisanship, namely not mentioning theories of AIDS originating
from other vaccines such as smallpox and malaria.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A NAME=fn10></A>10. The work and
experiences of Lecatsas and Alexander could have provided an
alternative entry point into the controversy. The main differences
are that they were established professionals in the field and that
their treatments of the theory are much briefer. Their first
published discussion of the theory was in one paragraph out of a
six-paragraph letter to the editor: G. Lecatsas and J. J. Alexander,
'Safe Testing of Poliovirus Vaccine and the Origin of HIV Infection
in Man,' <I>South African Medical Journal</I>, Vol. 76 (21 October
1989), 451. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A NAME=fn11></A>11. Like Pascal,
Lecatsas and Alexander had difficulty in publishing their views.
According to Pascal, Lecatsas tried over a period of three years to
publish in <I>Nature</I>, the <I>British Medical Journal</I>, and
<I>New Scientist</I>. Lecatsas wrote to Pascal to say: 'All were
rejected with negative and often nonsensical comments.' (Pascal, op.
cit. note 7, 43). See also the response to W. D. Hamilton's
submission to <I>Science</I>, discussed later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A NAME=fn12></A>12. An excellent
discussion, with examples, is given by David F. Horrobin, 'The
Philosophical Basis of Peer Review and the Suppression of
Innovation,' <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>, Vol.
263 (9 March 1990), 1438-1441. More generally, see Roy Wallis (ed.),

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A NAME=fn13></A>13. Malcolm
Ashmore, as referee of this paper, commented in relation to this
statement that <I>scientific</I> merit is 'an honorific status
granted or withheld by relevant members of the scientific community'
and that a social analyst should not endorse or refuse to endorse
claims on this basis, but rather to socially analyse them. To this I
would respond in two ways. First, it is impossible to fully separate
'scientific' and 'nonscientific' issues. Whenever they make any
judgements at all about an issue, social analysts are involved in
making judgements, at some level and to some degree, about
'scientific merits.' This is certainly the case in the present
example, in which social factors are obviously involved in the
choice, justification and endorsement of evidence and theories.
Second, there is never a complete disjuncture between the craft
skills of those who are acknowledged as scientists and as specialists
in particular fields and those who are outside what is called the
'scientific community.' For example, although my expertise in biology
is limited, I have worked with probability theory and exponential
growth and therefore am able to judge (even if only at a basic level)
claims by Pascal and others about probabilities of transmitting SIV
to humans, growth in AIDS cases, and the like, which are an important
part of the argument. All social scientists have <I>some</I>
understanding of science, and this is deployed routinely--although
not always acknowledged--in selecting topics for study. Among typical
modern understandings are notions such as the irreversibility of
death, the rotation of the earth and the conversion of electrical
energy into light and heat. Such common understandings provide a
likely partial explanation for why there have been few science
studies treatments, symmetrical or otherwise, of claims that seem
ludicrous in terms of understandings of science that most children
receive, such as that Elvis has appeared in various parts of the
world in recent years, that the moon landings were elaborate frauds,
or that the world will end on 27 May 1997. This is not to say that
these ideas are right or wrong, merely that social scientists
commonly make their own judgements about their scientific merit in
helping to decide whether they are worthy areas for science studies
and whether they deserve more examination than has so far occurred.

Therefore, it can be stated with almost complete certainty that the
large poliovaccine trial begun late in 1957 in Congo was not the
origin of AIDS.'</FONT></P>

one of the co-authors of the original study (op. cit.

reported as admitting that he knew in 1992 that the Manchester man
could not have died of AIDS but saw no reason to publish this finding

possible to imagine <I>another</I> social analyst collecting all my
materials, and others, and proceeding to undertake a
(noninterventionist) examination of the issue. This rather begs the
question of the insights made available by my own
intervention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A NAME=fn63></A>63. Some other
purposes and effects are conforming to peer expectations, forging
collaborations, attacking opponents, and having fun. Needless to say,
few of these are mutually exclusive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A NAME=fn64></A>64. It is
relatively easy to determine the stated intent of the analyst.
Attempting to determine the 'real' or subjective intent of the
analyst raises difficult issues of psychology, attributing interests
and so forth. Career advancement of the analyst is almost never the
stated intent of a study, although arguably it is a common effect.
Informal conversations attest to the important role of career
interests in most academic work, and career advancement is widely
recognised as an effect of scholarly work. That this issue has so
seldom been studied or even mentioned in the science studies
literature points to a major gap in the application of reflexivity in
the sociology of scientific knowledge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A NAME=fn65></A>65. I believe
that my own understanding has been increased, but whether my writings

data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><em>The Republican Party on Monday <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/RNCreport03182013.pdf">released a 100-page autopsy of how its 2012 presidential campaign was conducted</a>. I've picked out the key sections you need to read from the analytic recommendations and critiques made by the party in this "<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/623664/republican-national-committees-growth-and.pdf">Growth and Opportunity Project</a>" report. The project report also has a long section of recommendations for GOP friends and allies -- read, PACs and Super PACS -- which I've not excerpted from below.</em></p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The GOP today is a tale of two parties. One of them, the gubernatorial wing, is growing and successful. The other, the federal wing, is increasingly marginalizing itself, and unless changes are made, it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. States in which our presidential candidates used to win, such as New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Florida, are increasingly voting Democratic. We are losing in too many places.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It has reached the point where in the past six presidential elections, four have gone to the Democratic nominee, at an average yield of 327 electoral votes to 211 for the Republican. During the preceding two decades, from 1968 to 1988, Republicans won five out of six elections, averaging 417 electoral votes to Democrats' 113.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Public perception of the Party is at record lows. Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country. When someone rolls their eyes at us, they are not likely to open their ears to us.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At the federal level, much of what Republicans are doing is not working beyond the core constituencies that make up the Party. On the state level, however, it is a different story. Republicans hold governorships in 30 states with 315 electoral votes, the most governors either party has had in 12 years, and four short of the all-time GOP high of 34 governors who served in the 1920s.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Republican governors are America's reformers in chief. They continue to deliver on conservative promises of reducing the size of government while making people's lives better. They routinely win a much larger share of the minority vote than GOP presidential candidates, demonstrating an appeal that goes beyond the base of the Party.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It is time for Republicans on the federal level to learn from successful Republicans on the state level. It is time to smartly change course, modernize the Party, and learn once again how to appeal to more people, including those who share some but not all of our conservative principles.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At our core, Republicans have comfortably remained the Party of Reagan without figuring out what comes next. Ronald Reagan is a Republican hero and role model who was first elected 33 years ago -- meaning no one under the age of 51 today was old enough to vote for Reagan when he first ran for President. Our Party knows how to appeal to older voters, but we have lost our way with younger ones. We sound increasingly out of touch.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The perception, revealed in polling, that the GOP does not care about people is doing great harm to the Party and its candidates on the federal level, especially in presidential years. It is a major deficiency that must be addressed.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">One of the contributors to this problem is that while Democrats tend to talk about people, Republicans tend to talk about policy. Our ideas can sound distant and removed from people's lives. Instead of connecting with voters' concerns, we too often sound like bookkeepers. We need to do a better job connecting people to our policies.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If we believe our policies are the best ones to improve the lives of the American people, all the American people, our candidates and office holders need to do a better job talking in normal, people-oriented terms and we need to go to communities where Republicans do not normally go to listen and make our case. We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them, too. We must recruit more candidates who come from minority communities.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We have to blow the whistle at corporate malfeasance and attack corporate welfare. We should speak out when a company liquidates itself and its executives receive bonuses but rank-and-file workers are left unemployed. We should speak out when CEOs receive tens of millions of dollars in retirement packages but middle-class workers have not had a meaningful raise in years.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States (i.e. self-deportation), they will not pay attention to our next sentence. It does not matter what we say about education, jobs or the economy; if Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies. In the last election, Governor Romney received just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote. Other minority communities, including Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, also view the Party as unwelcoming. President Bush got 44 percent of the Asian vote in 2004; our presidential nominee received only 26 percent in 2012.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As one conservative, Tea-Party leader, Dick Armey, told us, "You can't call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you. We've chased the Hispanic voter out of his natural home."</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only. We also believe that comprehensive immigration reform is consistent with Republican economic policies that promote job growth and opportunity for all.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When it comes to social issues, the Party must in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If we are not, we will limit our ability to attract young people and others, including many women, who agree with us on some but not all issues.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The pervasive mentality of writing off blocks of states or demographic votes for the Republican Party must be completely forgotten. The Republican Party must compete on every playing field.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If Hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States, they won't pay attention to our next sentence. It doesn't matter what we say about education, jobs or the economy; if Hispanics think that we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies. In essence, Hispanic voters tell us our Party's position on immigration has become a litmus test, measuring whether we are meeting them with a welcome mat or a closed door.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Throughout our discussions with various Hispanic groups, they told us this: Message matters.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Too often Republican elected officials spoke about issues important to the Hispanic community using a tone that undermined the GOP brand within Hispanic communities. Repairing that relationship will require both a tone that "welcomes in" as well as substantial time spent in the community demonstrating a commitment to addressing its unique concerns. As one participant in a regional listening session noted, "The key problem is that the Republican Party's message offends too many people unnecessarily. We win the economic message, which is the most important to voters, but we then lose them when we discuss other issues."</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It is also a fair criticism that Republicans do not do enough to elevate Hispanic leaders within the Party infrastructure. This includes not just candidates running for office, but also senior decision-makers in the RNC's infrastructure. These personnel should not be pigeonholed into demographic outreach, but should be promoted to positions to develop political strategy and provide input on all budgeting decisions. The RNC must rebuild a nationwide database of Hispanic leaders and donors that can be a resource to the Republican community at large.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The RNC must invest financial resources in Hispanic media. In a $1 billion campaign, much less than 1 percent of the total budget was spent on Hispanic or other demographic group oriented media. At one point during the 2012 campaign, OFA was outspending us 8 to 1 in these media markets.

The RNC should strive to establish working relationships and open lines of communication with thought leaders in Silicon Valley to ensure the Party is at the forefront of new developments and trends in digital technology. The Party can and should play an important role in building bridges between its digital operatives and the best minds in the Valley and elsewhere.

These tests should be the first order of business of the analytics team and should incorporate pollsters, data managers, and messaging professionals at the table developing a variety of approaches that would be subject to measurement.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The number of early and absentee voters continued to increase this cycle, and Election Day voting continued to fall. In 2004, 76 percent of the electorate voted on Election Day; in 2012, 65 percent voted on Election Day, a decrease of 12 percent in eight years. The Democrats successfully front-loaded many of their votes this cycle, expanding their early vote and absentee reach and giving them a much better picture going into Election Day of who had already voted and who remained a target for their efforts. They continued to expand their advantage in early voting, and this cycle they ran a much more focused effort on absentee voting, which helped them close their margins.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This trend in early, absentee, and online voting is here to stay. Republicans must alter their strategy and acknowledge the trend as future reality, utilizing new tactics to gain victory on Election Day; it is imperative to note that this will be a critical cultural shift within the Party. Additionally, early voting should be factored into all aspects of political strategy, messaging and budgeting so that we understand that we are no longer working in an environment where 72-hour GOTV efforts will determine an election outcome.

In the 2012 cycle, the RSLC committed to spend $3 million to identify and support new GOP candidates of Hispanic descent and women for state office. Ultimately the RSLC identified 125 new Republican Hispanic candidates and 185 new women candidates. More than $5 million was used to successfully elect 84 new women and grow the state-level Republican Hispanic caucus. The RSLC has now established a Future Majority Caucus led by new Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval along with a board of 10 rising stars from state legislatures across the country.

When asked to choose the single most important issue or problem facing pollsters when it comes to telephone polling accuracy, four problems (cell phones, demographics, refusals, and turnout) bubbled to the top in a close grouping, each mentioned by 18 to 21 percent as most important.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Concerns expressed by pollsters include the increasing use of cell phones, making contact on land-lines more difficult and accurate polling more expensive and expansive. Another issue of concern is the need to include more young voters and Hispanics in polling samples given the growth in the electorate in these groups. An additional challenge facing pollsters was a nonresponse bias that occurred as various groups reached different levels of fatigue in the elections process. 24 percent describe higher refusal and no-answer rates as a "very important" factor. For example, following Governor Romney's first debate performance, both public and private polling firms reported a drop-off in the number of Obama supporters who would agree to participate in surveys. Understanding this bias and correcting for it is a major challenge facing pollsters in the future. And finally, 36 percent of pollsters believe that "flawed turnout models" are a "very important" factor in poll inaccuracy. The concerns expressed in our survey mirror the concerns raised in specific conversations with pollsters during the course of our task force work.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Responses to open-ended questions in the pollsters' survey suggest that many pollsters would welcome regular meetings with other researchers to share best practices and pitfalls. It is important that GOP pollsters share information on a regular basis about sampling and weighting of samples, as well as assumptions made in interpretation of survey research, to ensure more accurate data that can be used in allocating campaign and Party resources.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The significant challenge of reaching the right mix of people on the phone may sometimes require that we dedicate more resources to ensuring that our samples accurately reflect the electorate that will actually vote. This could mean enlisting bilingual interviewers in districts and states with large Hispanic populations. As mentioned earlier, it also means that a significant portion of polling samples must be dedicated to cell phones (while recognizing that auto-dialed calls cannot legally be made to cell phones). And it could mean that polls need to be fielded over longer periods and with larger samples. In addition, more spending may be required for research into special populations (e.g., youth, Hispanics) by Party organizations for private learning that could be shared with campaigns and other Party committees when appropriate.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi" style="text-align:center">***</div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Recent election cycles have seen a troubling diminishment of the role of political parties and even candidates themselves in our democracy.

In contrast, the first Republican primary debate of the 1980 election took place on January 5, 16 days prior to the Iowa caucuses.

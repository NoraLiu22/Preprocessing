<Font Size="5" Color="Red">Callsign 2MT & New Street</Font>
<BR>

CARS members were privileged to be able to use the Radiocommunications Agency (now Ofcom)  Special
Event Callsign 2MT (Marconi Telegraph) for use on the 12 December 2001 to celebrate the transmission of a
Wireless Telegraphy signal across the Atlantic by Marconi.
<P>
<!--
The "2" prefix was allocated Internationally to the United Kingdom following an ITU Conference.
<P>
-->
To put the Callsign in context this page describes the brief history of the period around
the time when 2MT was used originally in Chelmsford.  It also prepares the ground for an
application to Ofcom to release a cherished Call-Sign for a Special Event Station(s) to celebrate the
closing of the New Street factory after 96 years when it passes to the ownership of Ashwell
Properties of Cambridge on 1st July 2008 for redevelopment.
<P>
The front of the New Street factory is Listed - it would be nice to have part of it as a Museum in
memory of Marconi and to record for visitors the history of the site with one room which could
house a radio transmitter for occasional use.
<P>

<Font Size="5" Color="Red">History - Hall Street - The First Wireless Factory</Font>
<BR>

Marconi came to England in 1896 and was invited by Sir William Preece, Chief of Engineer to the
General Post Office to demonstrate his "Wire-less" invention.  After a few years Marconi had
been awarded sufficient contracts for him to require a permanent factory and took
over an abandoned Silk Mill in Hall Street, Chelmsford in December 1898.

By 1911 the Hall Street factory was just not big enough and so the cricket ground
alongside the railway station in New Street was acquired and London Architects
Dunn & Watson were commissioned to draw up plans for the first purpose built radio
factory.  The new factory was started in February 1912 and quickly completed
in just 17 or so weeks later using 500 bricklayers.
<P>

As the building was nearing completion the Titanic sank and this gave further impetus to
the fitting of "Marconi Wireless" to large ships - great timing. &nbsp; The New Street factory
was complete by June 1912 and delegates of the first International Radiotelegraphic
Conference (nowadays the ITU) in London were brought to Chelmsford and shown around.

<P>
At the same time the factory was being built two 750ft high steel masts were built to
support the large aerial required at that time for the Long Wave frequencies used.
<P>
The outbreak of WWI in 1914 provided more contracts.  Competing transmitters & receivers
meant that sometime about 1919 Marconi purchased a number of ex-Army wooden huts and
located them at Writtle.  These were used for mainly for development, including airborne wireless sets.
<P>

To test the transmitters made at New Street it was common practice to power them up
to the aerial and to engage people to read railway timetables or similar mundane material. 
Letters were received by Marconi from people living quite a way from Chelmsford
saying they could hear this inane information and some suggested reading more enlightened
material. Local people were then informally invited to tell stories or even sing from
a makeshift studio, this was documented in February & March 1920.

<P>
<FONT color="#FF0000"><B>Dame Nellie Melba and New Street MZX</B></FONT><BR>
The national newspapers picked up on this before Marconi had cottoned on to the possibility of making
money using this activity.  The Daily Mail paid Dame Nellie Melba to travel to Chelmsford
by train. She was picked up in a chauffeur driven car, taken a long way around Chelmsford
on a route advertised beforehand to waving crowds before arriving at the studio in New Street,
just a few hundred of metres away. 
<P>
Her historic performance was very well received although she realised that possibly future (paid) public
performances may suffer if she was often "on the radio" - she never made a radio broadcast again.
<P>

After 1913 all G & M Callsigns were allocated to the UK, the M prefix being
associated with Marconi.

In December 1919 New Street was issued with a "General License allowing experimental transmissions", Call-Sign
MZX (yes, a "Z", not a 2) and initially started with a 6kW telephony transmitter.
By the time of the Dame Nellie Melba broadcast in 1920 it had been upgraded to a 15kW design
<P>
The Postmaster-General was not amused by such trivial use and withdrew the licence in
November, 1920 on "interference grounds", in particular with Croydon airfield.  The public
clamour for re-instatement was substantial and due to pressure from the Wireless Society of
London (later to become the RSGB) and the House of Commons - the Post Office eventually relented.
<P>


<FONT color="#FF0000"><B>2MT and the Writtle Broadcasts</B></FONT><BR>
Writtle had been previously used by the Marconi company for WW1 Aircraft radio development,
but did not have the power (only 1kWatt) or tall aerials (only 450 ft) that New Street had.
Its normal site callsign was 2BO.

<P>
It is known that Marconi was very commercial and treated "Amateurs as people who were
not making money and therefore should not be encouraged", however the media saw it
differently and "wanted more broadcasting".
<P>
Peter Eckersley and Noel Ashbridge were dispatched (eight in total) from New Street to
Writtle with a new company name of Marconi Scientific Instrument Company Ltd, (maybe
in case it was not successful?) to start broadcasting from the Ex-Army huts.
In order to formalise this, the Post Office issued a specific Amateur Transmitting Licence
 2MT (2 Emma Toc) on 15, August, 1921 and first
used at Writtle on St Valentines Day, 14th February 1922, when Marconi
opened with a few words.   Telegraphic (Morse) transmissions to satisfy the GPO and the License conditions
were first broadcast and then local people were invited to perform as was originally done
at New Street.

<P> They had a lonely hearts club, competitions and songs from
a West End singer named Nora Scott. &nbsp; It is documented that a tremendous audience was built up in a
short time and it is considered Marconi could then see "he was onto
something big". It is also thought that these transmissions were on higher
frequencies than those being used at New Street.


<P>
<FONT color="#FF0000"><B>2LO and the BBC</B></FONT><BR>
In May 1922 "2LO" was granted by the GPO for broadcasts from the top of Marconi
House in London - public transmissions began July of that year. &nbsp; They received
200 letters asking them not to broadcast from 8pm to 8.30pm on a Tuesday since the station was interfering with Writtle!
<P>
The media led the call to increase the service and many meetings were held in which Marconi
took the lead and resulted in them being granted the main provider of studio equipment.
&nbsp; It was called the British Broadcasting Company Ltd which was changed by Royal Charter
to a Corporation five years later.  Peter Eckersley of 2MT fame was the first Chief Engineer.


<P>
<FONT color="#FF0000"><B>Epilogue</B></FONT><BR>
Transmissions were stopped (with a letter from Marconi, London) from Writtle in
February 1923 - perhaps because it was thought it would dilute interest from
(Marconi's) BBC from London.  The Licence was never actually withdrawn, the remaining
member of Staff, Ed Trump continued occasionally to broadcast from time to time.
Many of the original eight joined the BBC. It was considered 2MT had over 100,000 listeners at this time.
<P>
In 1960 the "Hut" was re-sited and used as a Sports Pavilion for Kings Road County Junior School.
<!--
famous footballer Geoff Hurst used to change in it!
-->
 &nbsp; Later it was acquired by Chelmsford Borough Council and since 1992 resides at the Science & Industry
Museum at Sandford Mill.
<P>
The original site at Writtle is now a housing estate.

<BR>
100 years after Marconi transmitted across the Atlantic, Marconi's & Chelmsford
Borough Council suggested that "the event should be celebrated". &nbsp; New Street
was the nearest Marconi building and so the front office rooms were decorated up
and transmitters & receivers installed.  A Marconi Director obtained permission from the Radio
Communications Agency to use the cherished Call-Sign 2MT.

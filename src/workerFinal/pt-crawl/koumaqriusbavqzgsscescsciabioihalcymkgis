        of music on the Voyager</FONT></B></A></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Geneva">Azerbaijani music is on its
        way to the stars encased in a gold-coated, copper phonograph
        record attached to the sides of two NASA spacecrafts, Voyagers
        I and II, which were launched on August 20th and September 5th,
        1977. For the past thirteen years, these two spacecrafts have
        been sending back photos from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
        and beyond on their lonely voyages that will eventually, if all
        goes as scheduled, take them beyond the earth's solar system.<BR>
<BR>
        NASA scientists who organized this project were intrigued by
        the possibility that extraterrestrial life might exist. If it
        did and if it could be contacted, then they wanted to try to
        send a token from human life on earth of &quot;our sounds, our
        science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
        Along with 90 minutes of some of the world's best music, the
        record which is identical in both spacecrafts, includes three
        other major sections: greetings in 55 different languages, a
        sound essay, (Sounds of Earth), and a digitized photo essay of
        118 photographs showing what man looks like and some of the things
        he has achieved.<BR>
<BR>
        On the one hand, the Voyager's record is like a 20th century
        time capsule which potentially could survive a billion years
        into the future. On the other, it's something like a bottle cast
        into the ocean, hoping that someone, somewhere, will eventually
        find and read its message. Except that this time, the ocean is
        a galaxy so large it's beyond imagination and the chances are
        extremely slim that any extraterrestrial, if there is such form
        of life, could, or ever would, find it.<BR>
<BR>
        But the possibility of contacting intelligent extraterrestrial
        civilization always stirs our imagination so, perhaps, the value
        of such an experiment is much more beneficial to us human beings
        on earth than to extraterrestrials. <BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Geneva">As B. M. Oliver, Vice-President
        for Research and development at Hewlett-Packard Corporation said
        at the time, &quot;There is only an infinitesimal chance that
        the plaque will ever be seen by a single extraterrestrial, but
        it will certainly be seen by billions of terrestrials. Its real
        function, therefore, is to appeal to and expand the human spirit,
        and to make contact with extraterrestrial intelligence a welcome
        expectation of mankind.&quot; (Murmurs, 11). <BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Geneva">The short selection of Azerbaijani
        music (2:20 minutes long) is an exquisite piece, brilliantly
        performed by two balaban players in the tradition of mugam, which
        is a type of modal music with historical roots in Azerbaijan's
        antiquity. The piece is one of 27 pieces, including selections
        such as Bach, Beethoven, Peruvian pan pipes and Navajo night
        chants that was selected to represent the wide range of emotional
        life expressive of human beings on earth. <BR>
<BR>
        The mugam was recorded by Radio Moscow (probably in the early
        1950s), brought to the US by American composer, Henry Cowell,
        and produced in 1960 by Smithsonian Folkways Records, &quot;Folk
        Music of the USSR&quot;. Timothy Ferris, wrote that the mugam
        piece is &quot;a haunting series of variations played over a
        drone rich with subdominants (which) holds something recognizable
        for listeners from Spain to Afghanistan&quot; (Murmurs, 185).
<BR>
<BR>
        As the world's music is extremely rich and much of it unfamiliar
        even to the most-knowledgeable professional musicians, it was
        not easy for Scientist Carl Sagan, who headed the Record project,
        and his music experts to choose the pieces for Voyager.<BR>
<BR>
        The team wanted to be as fair and representative as possible
        in terms of geographical, ethnic and cultural distribution, style
        of music and relation to other pieces chosen. Of course, there
        were constraints of time, budget and bureaucracy.<BR>
<BR>
        But still the possibilities were limitless. The team coped with
        questions such as the comprehensibility of the music if the words
        were unknown, whether the music performed by alleged Nazi sympathizers
        should be included, and whether great music performed on poor
        quality recordings should be included. <BR>
<BR>
        There was considerable discussion about limiting the disk to
        Western music. The greatest influence for expanding the horizons
        for other types of music seems to have come from American folklorist,
        Alan Lomax, who had spent a life time studying and classifying
        the world's broad expressions in music. <BR>
<BR>
        According to Sagan, it was Lomax &quot;who was a persistent and
        vigorous advocate for including ethnic music even at the expense
        of Western classical music. He brought pieces so compelling and
        beautiful that we gave in to his suggestions more often than
        I would have thought possible. There was, for example, no room
        for Debussy among our selections, because Azerbaijanis play bagpipe-sounding
        instruments and Peruvians play panpipes and such exquisite pieces
        had been recorded by ethnomusicologists known to Lomax&quot;
        (Murmurs, 16). <BR>
<BR>
        Even careful thought was given to the sequencing of the music
        (See box). The team wanted to avoid grouping all the Western
        European music together and so they purposely juxtaposed music
        from many cultures. In some cases, pieces are coupled because
        of the emotion and tone contrast, because of a common solo virtuosity
        on quite different instruments, or because of a similarity of
        instruments or rhythmic and melodic styles between seemingly
        disparate cultures.<BR>
<BR>
        Perhaps, it was because of the great constraints of time and
        budget and because Azerbaijan under the Soviet regime was so
        inaccessible to the Western world that very serious errors in
        the description of the music are included in the, otherwise,
        very excellent book, Murmurs of Earth: The Voyager Interstellar
        Record, by Carl Sagan and others (New York: Random House, 1978).<BR>
<BR>
        For example, the Azerbaijani music is described as &quot;bagpipe&quot;
        music played by a &quot;soloist&quot; in the tradition of &quot;ugam&quot;.
        But the music is not performed on a solo bagpipe, but on two
        balabans which are reed-like instruments producing a bagpipe-like
        sound. Of course, there is no such tradition in Azerbaijan as
        &quot;ugam.&quot; It is clearly &quot;mugam.&quot; The player's
        use of a circular breathing technique does produce a bagpipe
        effect. In this piece there are two players, one playing a sustainined
        drone and the other improvisations on the melody. Despite the
        misnomers in written description, the music is exhilarating and
        truly deserves to be part of this great collection.<BR>

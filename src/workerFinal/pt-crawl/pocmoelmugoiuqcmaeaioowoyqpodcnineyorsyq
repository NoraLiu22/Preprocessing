        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2" >I just thought I'd take 
          a moment to remind old timers of some things they may have forgotten, 
          and to share some information with new reptile keepers about things 
          they may not know about or may not have thought of yet.</font></p>

      <div align="left"> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="3" >Temperatures<br>
        </font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">During the colder 
        winter months, the colder outside temperatures will result in a drop in 
        the temperatures inside your house or apartment, which in turn will make 
        it more difficult for your reptile's heating equipment to attain and maintain 
        the required temperatures for the species throughout the day and night. 
        The only way to find this out is to monitor the temps in the enclosure, 
        in three spots (the basking, warm and cool areas), several times during 
        the day and night to see what's going on. If you also record the room 
        air temperature and outside temps, you can begin to see the correlation 
        between the three, and in the future you will know, just by listening 
        to the weather forecasts, when it's time to add the additional lights 
        or reset the enclosures' thermostats for the increased heat needed. You 
        can buy thermometers that will record the daily high and low, and thermometers 
        that will measure temperatures inside and outside of the house, by use 
        of a probe placed outside; the probe is attached to a thin wire that connects 
        with its dual thermometer base in the house.</font> 
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">If you have a thermostat 
          that regulates your central heating, then maintain that schedule on 
          a day off so you can monitor room and enclosure temps to find out what 
          happens to them when you are at work...just doing it on your day off 
          when you have the heat blasting is not going to give you an accurate 
          picture of what's going on when you are not home... ;)</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Watch 
          your power demands...if you are using more heating equipment, 
          you may overload your outlet, power strip or fuse box. 
          Check the equipment ratings, and be safe. Check out 
          the article on </font><a href="emergency/firesafe.html"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">fire

          </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2"> 
          to get some ideas on how to avoid being a grim statistic 
          this holiday season.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Check temperatures throughout 
          your house to see what the warmest room is, and where the warmest part 
          of a room is...and locate your herp enclosures there for the winter.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="3" ><b>Power Failures</b></font><br>
          <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">There is only one thing 
          to say: be prepared. If you live where power outages are common due 
          to snow or ice storm, floods or high winds, lay in back up before you 
          need it. Generators are the best way (assuming you have kept it primed 
          and know how to work it! See vet Susan Donoghue's article on her fun 
          time during the winter of 1993-94 in the <a href="maincaptive.html">Emergency 
          Preparedness</a> cluster at my site). People with wood stoves that are 
          not reliant on electrical starters are also okay....assuming someone 
          can be home to keep the fire going and the reptiles can be moved into 
          the well-insulated room to benefit from the heat. Small reusable and 
          disposable heat packs can be purchased from camping/outdoor stores which 
          in a well insulated tank will be useful for small reptiles. White gas 
          or kerosene heaters can also be used but be very careful using them 
          with animals and kids...and be sure the room is well ventilated. Propane 
          heat fixtures can also be used - you can even rent them from party suppliers 
          (they are often used to heat outdoor dining areas). Follow all the manufacturers 
          safety recommendations with these types of heaters.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">You can insulate tanks 
          by constructing them with double walls; otherwise, lay in a supply of 
          extra thick towels and blankets to swathe tanks with...obviously, you 
          need to be *very* careful if you do this with the tank lights on! The 
          inside may overheat, and externally mounted lights may set the fabric 
          on fire, so be very, very careful and smart about how you do this. Swathing 
          is especially good at night.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Speaking of power, are 
          your electrical/gas bills killing you? Talk to the power company to 
          see about alternative pricing structures for which you may be eligible.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="3" ><b>Food and Water<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">For non-hibernating 
          herps, you still have to feed and water them. If you live where you 
          may be socked in for days, or longer, not only do you need to lay in 
          a supply of food and water and medications for yourself and your human 
          family, but you must do the same for your animal family, as well. Figure 
          out what their water needs are - drinking and soaking water, water for 
          cleaning enclosures, and food and water bowls - per day or week, and 
          lay in at least a weeks supply. Ditto with food. For snakes and many 
          carnivorous, omnivorous and insectivorous reptiles, they can probably 
          do fine for a week or so without food, even when being maintained at 
          their proper environmental temperatures, so long as they are in good 
          health and well fleshed to begin with. For herbivores and some insectivores 
          and omnivores, they may need to eat during that time, especially if 
          you are nursing any sick ones, so be prepared with a supply of food 
          for them. As with meat-eaters, however, a healthy herbivore can go several 
          days or week or more with little food.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">If any of your herps 
          are on medication, make sure you have enough on hand, with any necessary 
          supplies, to get you through periods of being homebound. Assuming you 
          still have power but just can't get out easily or at all, also make 
          sure to have an adequate stock of cleaning supplies and garbage bags, 
          substrates, etc...</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="3" ><b>Hypothermia<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">If, despite 
          all your preparations and contingency plans, your herps get hypothermic, 
          do not just ram their heat up to 100 F or put them in a hot bath to 
          warm them up quickly. Doing so may literally kill them. Instead, warm 
          them up gradually, such as by wrapping in a couple of towels and putting 
          in a warm, not hot, enclosure, on a heating pad, and gradually over 
          the next several hours, remove the towel, layer by layer, and boost 
          the temps to normal range. Or, start with a tepid (70-75 F / 22-24 C) 
          bath and slowly replace the cooler water with warmer water, until the 
          water is in the normal bath range for that species (80 F / 27 C for 
          temperate species to 90 F / 32 C for tropical ones).</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="3" ><b>Humidity<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">The air in 
          our homes tends to dry out during the winters...especially if you are 
          using your heating system most or all of the time. Consider running 
          a humidifier at least during the day. You may find that the increased 
          humidity helps the humans and other animals, too.</font></p>

          Supply Can Prolong Power and Protect Equipment During Outages<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Herper </font><a href="mailto:gusg@uswest.net"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Gus 
          Gywnn</font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2"> wrote

      </div>
      <div align="left"> 
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Have your Vitalite&reg; 
          or other expensive lighting and electrical equipment for your iguana 
          or other lizard on at least a surge protection circuit, and at best 
          an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS).&nbsp; In the case of power surges, 
          the lights can be blown out - but with a surge protector, they can be 
          safeguarded.&nbsp; If you invest $100+ in UVB and heat lights, spending 
          an additional $10 to safeguard them against power surges is probably 
          worth it.&nbsp; With an UPS, in the case of a short blackout, your heat 
          lights can be kept on for at least a short while (some systems are really 
          only good for 5 minutes, but others can last several hours) - which 
          can end up important in such things as a major blizzard or ice-storm 
          (where temperatures can drop incredibly rapidly and even an hour of 
          extra heat can make a HUGE difference).&nbsp; You can even turn a UPS 
          battery on and off, so that you can conserve the power over a period 
          of a day or more, running a heat lamp or two just enough to keep the 
          temperature from dropping radically in a well-insulated lizard enclosure.</font></p>

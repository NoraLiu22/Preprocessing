        This was the last king gizz album I&#39;ve had to listen to, westerns aren&#39;t quite my thing, so I kept putting it off for a WHILE, but damn it&#39;s worth listening to. It&#39;s a unique and fun little adventure separate from the rest of their discog.

        The colonization of the West being an uncomfortable place to start... The protagonist is survivor and a warrior, but he doesn&#39;t feel like a character.<br>
The story also feels unfinished, with ELTS having rescued a companion and heading into a new territory before abruptly ending.<br>
The instrumentals also don&#39;t add enough to make it compelling for me.<br>
For something better and remarkably similar, I recommend the album/game Bastion by Supergiant with music by Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett.

        I fuckin&#39; love Eyes man (Who doesn&#39;t? They allow us to read books and reviews and things {like you right now! :D}). Unlike a good dealio of books though, this one gets read to you by its author with his son and his mates providing the blaring garage rock soundtrack to it. I can understand why it&#39;s a skip for some, but Broderick&#39;s pentameter and tone of narration is just too damn captivating for me, especially at a short and sweet 28 minutes.

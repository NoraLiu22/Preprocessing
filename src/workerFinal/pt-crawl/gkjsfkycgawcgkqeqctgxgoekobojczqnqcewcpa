        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Place crumpled 
        paper (preferably NOT newspaper) into a foam-lined box such as those used 
        to ship live fish - check with your local fresh and saltwater fish store 
        to see if you can get one that they are otherwise throwing out. Or you 
        can line a regular cardboard box with panels of foam cut to fit the bottom, 
        top and sides of the INSIDE of the cardboard box. Poke a couple of holes 
        through the top of the box, both through the cardboard and the foam liner.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Mark the 
        box on all sides with the following:</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">LIVE HARMLESS REPTILE</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">KEEP AT ROOM TEMPERATURE 
        - 70-75 F (22-24 C)</font></p>

        FRAGILE </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Place 
        the reptile in a cloth bag which allows some movement. Tie the top of 
        the bag closed with strong twine or rubberbands (use more than one in 
        case of one breaks). Then, fold over the tied-off section and overwrap 
        the twine or rubberbands with masking or duct tape. This will ensure that 
        no one will escape from the top of the bag. The receiver can cut through 
        the tape and underlying ties, or just cut off the top of the bag, to free 
        the reptile.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Place 
        the bagged animal on the cushion of crumpled paper or foam 'peanuts' packaging 
        material. Place some more crumpled paper on top of the bagged reptile. 
        You want to cushion the reptile, provide air space, and allow some room 
        for the reptile to move around while still keeping the reptile supported 
        enough so that it doesn't get banged around too much if the shippers are 
        less gentle than they should be despite your signage.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If you 
        are shipping during cooler weather (please do not ship during winter or 
        hot summer conditions), you can get one or two heat packs for gloves and 
        pockets from sporting goods stores or wilderness outfitters (Eddie Bauer, 
        Big 5, Oshman's, REI, etc.) that are activated by mushing them up (squeezing 
        and manipulating them with your hands). Tape this to the inside of the 
        top panel of foam.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Alternative 
        method suitable for larger lizards</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Use a Vari-Kennel type 
        dog/cat carrier. Unscrew the top and bottom and line the inside of the 
        carrier with fabric to block the holes and the inside of the gate/door. 
        Affix padding of several towels or layers of cloth to the bottom and sides 
        and gate. Reassemble carrier. When the animal is placed inside, duct tape 
        the carrier around the join of the top and bottom and around the gate/door. 
        Label similar to the box as described above. This is suitable for shipping 
        by air.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If shipping 
        by USPS pack the carrier inside a cardboard box, with the proper signage 
        and ventilation holes.</font></p>

        </font></b><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Reptiles can 
        be shipped by overnight (express) mail. Not all post offices have the 
        same shipping times. Check with the branch you intend to ship from and 
        see if they have overnight express to the zip code you are shipping to. 
        If not, check with some of the other post office locations in your area 
        to find out if there is any difference. Smaller outlying post offices 
        are more likely to have to add an extra day as their packages have to 
        first be routed to the larger facilities. Be sure, too, to check with 
        the post office for their cut-off time; if you are late getting your package 
        to the post office and getting it processed, your reptile will end up 
        sitting in a back room at the postal facility until collected for the 
        following day's shipment. This will be a major problem if you were shipping 
        on Friday for Saturday delivery.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The Post 
        Office does not guarantee live delivery. You can insure the shipment so 
        that if the animal dies because the box got crushed you will get paid 
        for the amount of insurance. But if the animal bakes or freezes to death, 
        you won't. All that being said, I have never had a problem with reptiles 
        I have shipped via overnight Express Mail, nor with reptiles shipped to 
        me this way. While not all post offices may do this, ours calls us (a 
        good reason to have the recipient's early morning phone number on the 
        shipping documents as well as one they will be at later in the day) at 
        the time they are sorting out the morning delivery and find our boxes. 
        It's worth being dressed and ready to go pick up the box when they call 
        at 6:00-6:30 AM to pick up the box so the reptiles don't have to spend 
        another half day or so on the truck while the rest of the mail is being 
        delivered.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Note that 
        the US Post Office will not accept snakes for shipment. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Airlines</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many airlines now leery 
        of accepting live animals due to the public reaction to their not handling 
        them appropriately which led to some highly publicized deaths and suits 
        files against them. When it comes to shipping animals that aren't cats 
        and dogs, you will run into personnel who are ill-informed or otherwise 
        confused about how the animals are to be crated for shipment, some seeming 
        to believe that pet owners shipping one or two exotic pets are to meet 
        guidelines established for commercial sellers shipping dozens or hundreds 
        of animals per shipment. Things haven't been made any easier in the aftermath 
        of September 11 as packages are checked more closely and delays occur.</font> 
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Reptiles 
        used to be accepted by Delta Dash (Delta Airline's priority cargo service) 
        and American Airline's Priority Parcel service. Over the several years 
        it has been increasingly difficult to find airlines who will take live 
        reptiles from private parties in air cargo. This could be due to an increase 
        in the number of herpers who behaved stupidly, cruelly and illegally in 
        the way they shipped and smuggled reptiles into cargo and passenger compartments.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Due to 
        these mishaps and behavior that reflects badly on all who keep herps, 
        even before September 11, it was difficult, if not impossible, to find 
        an airline or air cargo company to accept shipments from those who had 
        not previously established a commercial or individual account with them. 
        The U.S. Postal Service's Express Mail service does involve air shipments, 
        but the person or company doing the shipping is dealing directly with 
        the post office, not the air cargo company with whom the USPS has such 
        contracts.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As with 
        any type of shipping, mark the shipping contain CLEARLY with the sender's 
        name, address and telephone number, and the recipient's name, address 
        and telephone numbers. To prevent smearing due to anything getting spilled 
        on the box or it being carried through the rain, place a layer of wide 
        clear tape over the sender and recipient's addresses. Once you, the sender, 
        gets the package shipped off, contact the recipient and tell them the 
        flight the animal is on, and the airbill number so that they can track 
        it as necessary.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">General 
        Suggestions<br>
        </font></b>Always ship a healthy animal - the stress on a sick one can 
        be fatal. Never feed the animal within 12 hours of shipping, and try to 
        avoid fluids during that time to help prevent their soiling their bag 
        and substrate en route.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When shipped 
        within the U.S., most animals are in transit for only about 18 hours, 
        from the time the sender leaves home till the time the animal is picked 
        up from the cargo office. USPS Express Mail delivers to your door, but 
        may call you so that you can pick up the box early in the morning.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Technically, 
        carriers such as United Parcel and Airborne will not knowingly carry live 
        animals. If you have obtained some through these carriers, it was because 
        the carriers did not know what they were shipping. Shipping this way means 
        that there is no way you can hope to get controlled temperature environment, 
        that the box won't get dropped or jostled, and there obviously there is 
        no recourse should the animal arrive dead or injured...</font></p>

        permits from the Canadian Management Authority to take your iguana across 
        the international line from Canada to the US. The USFWS recognizes iguanas 
        are household pets and so you do not need permits to take them with you 
        out of the US. The problem is that Canada will not let Canadian citizens

      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Canadian citizens/residents

      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. citizens/residents 
        should probably play it safe and not take their iguana with them if they

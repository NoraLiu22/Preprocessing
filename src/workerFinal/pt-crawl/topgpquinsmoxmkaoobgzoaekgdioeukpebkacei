					<h3 class="line">Howâ€™s Life?</h3>
					<p align="left">France performs well across a number &nbsp;of well-being dimensions relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. France outperforms the average in work-life balance, safety, social connections and civic engagement. These assessments are based on available selected data.</p>
<p align="left">Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In France,<strong>&nbsp;the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;34 375 a year</strong>, more than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490 a year.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of employment,&nbsp;<strong>about 65% of people aged 15 to 64 in France have a paid job</strong>, below the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 68% of men are in paid work, compared with 62% of women.<strong>&nbsp;In France, 8% of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, below the OECD average of 10%, with 10% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 5% of women.</p>
<p align="left">Good education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In France,&nbsp;<strong>81% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 79%. However, completion varies between men and women, as 81% of men have successfully completed high school compared with 82% of women. In terms of the quality of the education system,<strong>&nbsp;the average student scored 494 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)</strong>. This score is higher than the OECD average of 488. On average in France,&nbsp;<strong>girls outperformed boys by 6 points</strong>, slightly above the average OECD gap of 5 points.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of health,&nbsp;<strong>life expectancy at birth in France is around 83 years</strong>, two years higher than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 86 years, compared with 80 for men.&nbsp;<strong>The level of atmospheric PM2.5</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>is 11.4 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, below the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In France, <strong>78% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 84%.</p>
<p align="left">Concerning the public sphere, there is a strong sense of community and high levels of civic participation in France, where<strong>&nbsp;94% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need</strong>, more than the OECD average of 91%. <strong>Voter turnout,</strong>&nbsp;a measure of citizens' participation in the political process,&nbsp;<strong>was 75% during recent elections</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 69%. Social and economic status can affect voting rates; voter turnout for the top 20% of the population is an estimated 83% and for the bottom 20% it is an estimated 67%.</p>
<p align="left">When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, French people gave it&nbsp;<strong>the same grade on average as the OECD average of 6.7.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
</div>
<p align="left">Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people's lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. All of these elements help make a house a home. And of course there is the question whether people can afford adequate housing.</p>
<p align="left">Housing costs take up a large share of the household budget and represent the largest single expenditure for many individuals and families, by the time you add up elements such as rent, gas, electricity, water, furniture or repairs. In France, households on average spend&nbsp;<strong>21% of their gross adjusted disposable income on keeping a roof over their heads</strong>, slightly above the OECD average of 20%.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">In addition to housing costs it is also important to examine living conditions, such as the average number of rooms shared per person and whether households have access to basic facilities. The number of rooms in a dwelling, divided by the number of persons living there, indicates whether residents are living in crowded conditions. Overcrowded housing may have a negative impact on physical and mental health, relations with others and children's development. In addition, dense living conditions are often a sign of inadequate water and sewage supply. In France,&nbsp;<strong>the average home contains 1.8 rooms per person</strong>, broadly in line with the OECD average of 1.7 rooms per person. In terms of basic facilities,&nbsp;<strong>99.5% of dwellings in France contain private access to an indoor flushing toilet</strong>, more than the OECD average of 97%.</p>

<p align="left">While money may not buy happiness, it is an important means to achieving higher living standards and thus greater well-being. Higher economic wealth may also improve access to quality education, health care and housing.</p>
<p align="left">Household net adjusted disposable income is the amount of money that a household earns each year after taxes and transfers. It represents the money available to a household for spending on goods or services. In France,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;34 375</strong>&nbsp;a year, higher than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">Household net wealth is the total value of a household's financial and non-financial worth, such as money or shares held in bank accounts, the principal residence, other real estate properties, vehicles, valuables and other non-financial assets (e.g other consumer durables). In France,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net wealth is estimated at USD&nbsp;298 639</strong>, lower than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;323 960.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Having a job brings many important benefits, including: providing a source of income, improving social inclusion, fulfilling one&rsquo;s own aspirations, building self-esteem and developing skills and competencies. In France,&nbsp;<strong>about 65% of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 has a paid job</strong>. This figure is slightly lower than the OECD employment average of 66%.</p>
<p align="left">Unemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In France,&nbsp;<strong>the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at 2.9%</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 1.3%.</p>
<p align="left">The wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality.&nbsp;<strong>French people earn&nbsp;USD 45 581 per year on average</strong>, below the OECD average of USD 49 165.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">Another essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In France,&nbsp;<strong>workers face an expected 3.1% loss of earnings if they become unemployed</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 5.1%.</p>

<p align="left">Humans are social creatures. The frequency of our contact with others and the quality of our personal relationships are thus crucial determinants of our well-being.</p>
<p align="left">A strong social network, or community, can provide emotional support during both good and bad times as well as provide access to jobs, services and other material opportunities. In France,&nbsp;<strong>94%&nbsp;of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in a time of need</strong>, more than the OECD average of 91%.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">A weak social network can result in limited economic opportunities, a lack of contact with others, and eventually, feelings of isolation. Socially isolated individuals face difficulties integrating into society as a contributing member and fulfilling personal aspirations.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. The French can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>16.6 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, less than the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In France,&nbsp;<strong>81%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, above the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in France scored 494 in reading literacy, maths and sciences,&nbsp;</strong>above the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

<p align="left"><em>Preparing youth for employment</em></p>
<p align="left">French Second Chance Schools help young adults between 18 and 25 improve their skills to get a job. These schools target youth who have been out of school for over a year and do not have a diploma or qualifications. Students are offered individual education plans to boost their literacy, numeracy and ICT skills. This is complemented by a work placement to gain labour market skills and strong links with employers.</p>
<p align="left">Second Chance Schools were established in 107 local areas and reached 15 115 students by 2015. Evaluations show that the potential long-term effects of these schools on youth employability are promising. Over a three year period, 58% of students in the metropolitan area exited these schools with a labour market option in training (20%), jobs (17%), apprenticeships (12%), and subsidised employment (9%).</p>
<p align="left"><em>Developing employment through apprenticeships</em></p>
<p align="left">The Education Act 2013 aims to double number of students combining education with employment by 2020. Students in France can begin an apprenticeship at a variety of levels, including upper secondary, two-year post-secondary, bachelor and masters level qualifications. Enterprises offering apprenticeships receive tax credits and social security exemptions.</p>
<p align="left">Apprenticeships have grown in popularity, particularly at the tertiary or upper secondary level. For example, 75% of apprentices hired on the&nbsp;<em>contrat de professionalisation</em>, an apprenticeship-type contract for older workers and jobseekers, had at least an upper secondary qualification. By contrast, apprenticeships are much more difficult to access for young students and workers with lower qualifications. Apprenticeships account for only about a third of all vocational students in secondary education. Evidence shows that employment rates are higher for apprentices that have combined training in a company with study in an apprentice training centre compared to other graduates from vocational schools. The government plans to expand the access to apprenticeships at vocational secondary schools, notably at the lower-secondary level, strengthen links with enterprises and develop better guidance for students. This is the right approach to make apprenticeships more accessible for those who are most likely to benefit.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions,&nbsp;<strong>the health impacts of urban air pollution&nbsp;continue to worsen</strong>, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p align="left">PM2.5 &ndash; tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung &ndash; is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In France,&nbsp;<strong>PM2.5 levels are 11.4 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, less than&nbsp;the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter but higher than&nbsp;the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter&nbsp;set by the&nbsp;World Health Organization.</p>
<p align="left">Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In France,&nbsp;<strong>78% of people say they are satisfied with water quality</strong>,&nbsp;lower than the OECD average of 84%</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

<p align="left">Broader public engagement in the decision-making process is also important for holding the government to account and maintaining confidence in public institutions. The formal process for public engagement in developing laws and regulations is one way to measure the extent to which people can become involved in government decisions on key issues that affect their lives. In France, the level of stakeholder engagement in developing regulations is 2.1 (on a scale between 0 and 4); in line with the OECD average.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

<p align="left">Source codes for software written by public authorities are considred administrative documents and publicly available in France. Free access was first granted after the administrative court in Paris reviewed a denied request for the source code of the fiscal caluculator used for the income taxes for some 37 million citizens.</p>
<p align="left">In 2016, a vote was put by the French National Assembly for a new bill on digital rights, including algorithmic transparency. Later that year, Etalab and the&nbsp;<em>Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Finances Publiques&nbsp;</em>(DGFIP) organised a &ldquo;hackathon&rdquo; called #CodeImpot. This event promoted the use of code to develop services that build trust between citizens and the government in relation to the taxation process. Over 150 students, scientists, developers, national authorities, start-ups and entrepreneurs attended creating 9 projects. Among the new projects was a new tool to make income tax more understandable and help people compare their fiscal situation to that of others.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care.&nbsp;<strong>Life</strong>&nbsp;<strong>expectancy at birth in France stands at&nbsp; 83 years</strong>, two years above the OECD average of 81 years. Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher health care spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors).&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">When asked, "How is your health in general?"&nbsp;<strong>67% of people in France reported to be in good health</strong>, slightly lower than the OECD average of 68%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, answers have been found to be a good predictor of people's future health care use.

<p align="left"><em>Lean hospitals for better service delivery</em></p>
<p align="left">France launched a number of performance projects in 2009 to improve the quality of service, global efficiency and working conditions in hospitals. These projects promote participative management and are results-oriented. Following the success of a pilot conducted in a training hospital in Nancy performance projects have been rolled out in hospitals across France.</p>
<p align="left">The increased involvement of medical and paramedical staff and reduced number of tasks has lowered the average emergency room waiting time by 28%. Operating room occupancy rates have also increased by 20% thanks to the optimisation of technical equipment and better monitoring. Staff have also reviewed their processes to remove inefficiencies and improve the functioning of daily services. The introduction of participative management has also encouraged communication and collaboration between staff. Together these changes have improved the quality of patient experiences.<br /> <em><br /> Helping people with chronic illness</em></p>
<p align="left">The Sophia programme offers support for people suffering from chronic illnesses. The services are completely free of charge and provide access to nurses who answer questions, inform patients and help them find concrete solutions to living with their illness, as well as information via a website, e-mails, brochures and newsletter.</p>
<p align="left">Some 820 000 people have joined the programme.</p>
<p align="left">An independent evaluation of the pilot showed net savings, with the cost of the programme more than offset by a decrease of hospital spending. Patients appreciated the advice given by the nurses and said the service helped them change their behaviour.</p>

<span class="acs_name">amanda / usa (california)</span><br><span class="acs_text">I'm in a play, "Our Country's Good", and I play Dabby, who has a Devon accent. We have a dialect coach and she knows her stuff but she never told me that Devonians drop H. She also said that Devonians have a "lilt" like the Irish and that I need to be ending my sentences with upward inflections, but I was listening to some Devonian recordings and it doesn't sound like that to me. It seems to me like Cornwall and Devonshire peoples have almost the same accent....basically i'm just wondering if anyone could give me some help on these few points. I love the accent and I really want to represent it proporly on stage.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Pad from Kingsbridge</span><br><span class="acs_text">Us Devonians pronounce our R's but drop our H's. Some would have you believe that this is incorrect. Oddly enough the criticism usually comes from people who pronounce their H's but drop their R's. I find that very strange. It must be true that the dialect is in decline, but the accent remains very strong in most people of my acquaintance.One thing that I do regret is the adoption of the estuarine glottal stop by the young. But then, change is inevitable so I'll just have to lump it.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Martin - Dublin</span><br><span class="acs_text">I'm Irish but my father is from Plymouth.  For what it's worth, I've always seen a few similarities between Southern Irish accents and West Country accents -- pronounced trailing r's, dropped trailing g's and glottal or missing double-t's (shared Celtic heritage???).  We pronounce our leading h's though (even at the start of the letter itself -- 'haitch').My grandfather had a marked Plymouth accent which I loved and which my father would adopt when on the phone to him.  My father's own accent is more like what you call 'received pronunciation' which he picked up when he left for Oxford in the 1950s.  I notice a lot these days (whenever I hear a local on TV) that the accent seems to be rapidly disappearing and becoming much more of a generic South-of-England sound.  I find that a pity because I love regional accents and, although most are still very much in evidence, some, including the Plymouth one (perhaps even Devon/Cornwall in general?), seem to be giving up the ghost more readily than others.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Don from Plympton</span><br><span class="acs_text">My accent was quite strong in the 1970's as everyone elses was.  Then I travelled the world in the Army and mixed my accent with other accents from around the UK.  I seemed to be able to pick up an accent wherever I was posted to. Now I am retired I have returned to Devon.  I never actually thought about this until I read your report.  I guess Plymouth being a port always had different accents from all over the UK.  However the really deep Devon accents of my youth do seem to be fading.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Nick, originally Stoke Gabriel</span><br><span class="acs_text">A Devon accent is something to savour and, as suggested by others her, becoming something of a rarity as the county becomes more cosmopolitan. The dialect even more so. An accent reflects your background and gives you an identity and the Devon one sounds  so warm and friendly.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Ian from Sticklepath Okehampton</span><br><span class="acs_text">The Devonian accent is one that everybody who has it should be proud of unfortunately there are now too few of us left,I was born in Totnes Hospital in 1963 and when I went to school in King's Teignton (correct spelling) in the late 1960's and through the 70's if you heard an accent from outside the area it was normally somebody on holiday now they've all moved here.And the accent is starting to die which is quite sad,I Never change the way I speak just to sound posh or correctly spoken I don't see why anyone should the Devonian accent is warm and friendly and should be kept alive. In a nutshell the Debonshire accent is the propper job.(Whatever happened to the road signs that used to say welcome to Devonsire instead of Devon?? cost cutting by the County Council?)</span>

I get laughed at for saying "tuth" instead of tooth, I think I always say Ez, rather than he is, and for a long time didn't realise that we put "to" at the end of a sentence, wheres E going to?  sounds normal to me....

<span class="acs_name">Ryan  from Missouri USA</span><br><span class="acs_text">I was born in Exeter and came to the US with my family in 1991 at the age of 11. I have noticed that my accent seems to almost be gone and I've picked up the Southern twng of Missouri which makes the accent seem really weird. I haven't been to Devon in a long time and I miss it terribly. I almost feel as if Americans want us to not only lose our unique culture but our accents too. I was told in High School to go to speech therapy to get rid of my Devonian accent because my teachers couldn't understand me. The accent may be fading but I am still proud to be from Devon!

'Up the line', I finally found out a while ago means 'up the train line'. (anywhere up the A38 then). 'Alright me luver' is just great and then there is of course 'chew'oo' to say goodbye which becomes 'choe' if you say it more than once. Then there is coop, pronounced 'kwop'I love my accent and I hope it never goes.PSIf anyone can tell me where the saying 'you can see that with half an eye' comes from I would appreciate it very much.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Damian from Torquay</span><br><span class="acs_text">Despite being born and bred down here I often wonder just what exactly IS a  Devonian accent. It seems to me that despite being lumped together under a single lable, people's accent change depending on where in Devon you are. For example the people of Torquay are so mixed with non-Devonians that there doesn't appear to be any discernable accent at all, but go down to Plymouth or some of the more rural areas and things are very different as each seems to have their own distinct style often using words or phrases common only to their own specific locale.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Clare from Devon</span><br><span class="acs_text">Yes, I am from Devon...but I question whether I have a Devonshire accent.  I think everyone born in Devon or who have lived there for a certain ammount of time does have a Devonshire accent, but doesn't realize it.  For example, I just think I'm talking normally, but others from London or other places in the UK think I have a slight Devonshire tint to the way I talk.  When other people talk Devonshire strongly, I know they have an accent, but I don't know whether I have one or not.  If I do have one, I am proud, because in my point of veiw a Devonshire accent sounds warm and welcoming, not to mention friendly!   </span>

<span class="acs_name">Ted from Surrey, British Columbia</span><br><span class="acs_text">It is too bad that it seems rare to hear a Devon accent, let alone Devon dialect when one visits there.  I understand the advantage of Standard English, but as a Canadian who had a Devon grandmother, it would be nice to hear the accent more, and I wish I dared ask people to speak the dialect, but realize that social stigma would probably make that an embarrassing request unless it came from someone known to the speaker.</span>

Other people say I have an accent. My son get's corrected, as I do not think he sounds right, perhaps because he's proper Devonshire. Not quite the like the Queens English.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Jenny in Stonehouse, Plymouth</span><br><span class="acs_text">I'm afraid I'm a Scouser, but don't sound like it anymore. I did have an East Midlands accent, after living in Derby for a number of my formative years, which was soft and gentle, so I was told. I've never picked up any accent from my years down here though. I don't mind the accent, but I can't say I've ever thought about it. My friends have various Devon, Cornish and even a Bristol accent, and they all sound the same to me; understandable. I speak accent free now, and that doesn't bother me either. Accents just acknowledge where you are from or where you live, nothing more.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Richard  Kingsteignton</span><br><span class="acs_text">It's a shame that our accent which is a direct descendant of the Standard English used in literature(ie West Saxon)at the time of the Conquest is now disappearing. It was good enough for Sir "Wadder" Raleigh and it's good enough for me. As Owen remarked our tradition of the pronouncing the letter "R" properly(instead of saying "ah") and replacing "T" with "D" (bedder as opposed to bettah)not to mention reversing "R" when used with vowels ('underds of 'em) will be maintained across the pond.The estuarine twangs (aagghh!) of Radio Devon presenters surely sums up the way things are going.

<span class="acs_name">Owen from USA</span><br><span class="acs_text">Most of my English ancestors came from Devon, Somerset and Cornwall... Obviously the "Standard American" and West Country accents are now quite different to each other. Yet there is no denying the influence Devon and other West Country accents have had on the way Americans speak... the long "drawl" and the "r-ful-ness" of the speech...  Simply take a look at placenames in New England and you will see the Devon influence there. </span>

I left Devon in 1967 and came back in 1995, my accent is not strong but I love it.  It is lovely to have so many different accents in the UK.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Sue from Newton Abbot</span><br><span class="acs_text">I moved to Devon from Kent when I was 8 years old. In my primary school I was teased for sounding "posh" because I said words like "bath" and "grass" with a rich vowel sound whereas they pronounced them with a rawer sounding vowel. The accent has rubbed off on me over the years and I think it's a very colourful and interesting accent. My dad still teases me though! He and his friends from Kent were nicknamed Marmites when they first moved to Devon because they would say "I'm going to the pub with my mate(marmite)"!!</span>

<span class="acs_name">Darren Crediton</span><br><span class="acs_text">A regional accent is a good thing.It can be a bit of a pain when you visit places out of the area from which you were brought up in, though.Accents and dialects are what make people from different parts of the UK unique. One thing I have yet to fathom out, though, is how quickly a person can cause their accent to be changed.If you are proud of your heritage, and your voice, then why should the accent matter?Some people have "nice" voices; others "harsh". So, what? Does that mean that you are any the less of a person? I think not.Live and let be...and live and let live. </span>

<span class="acs_name">frank/lyme regis</span><br><span class="acs_text">I think the real distinction is thought to be between town and country accents. The latter are more likely to be considered pleasant, because they make you think of trees and birds and rippling streams, while the former call up thoughts of factories and grimy tenements.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Gypsy - Devon.</span><br><span class="acs_text">I think everyone should feel proud of there accent, it is a part of them and where they come from. I admit a regional accent can cause problems in certain circumstances. When I was first married my Lancashire accent threatened my husbands career. I was told in no uncertain terms to tone it down if I wanted him to get on. I didn't, I just stayed out of everyones way. 79% of people in the poll say they change their accent depending on who they're speaking to....what a shame that people can't be taken at face value however they speak, it's not the accent, it's the person who is important.   </span>

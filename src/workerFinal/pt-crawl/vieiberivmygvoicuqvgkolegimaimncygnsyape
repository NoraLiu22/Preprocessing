<h2></b>Who says proteas cannot be transplanted?</h2>

<hr>

<p>A few years ago I was on top of Table Mountain just west of Maclears Beacon when I came
across a &#145;funny&#146; conebush. It didn&#146;t look like either the Cape Peninsula
endemic Ld strobilinum or the more widely spread <a href="conebu2.htm#ldxantf">Sickle-leaf
Conebush - <i>Leucadendron&nbsp;xanthoconus</i></a>. I took an ecoscrap of the strange
plant and - just in case it was a hybrid - I took ecoscraps of the potential parents. Tony
soon identified the conebush for me as a <i>Ld strobilinum x xanthoconus</i> hybrid which
is known from Table Mountain and documented in Ion Williams&#146; revision of <i>Leucadendron</i>.</p>

<p>I casually left one <i>Ld strobilinum</i> cone on my window sill in my study and it
wasn&#146;t too long before the seeds dropped out, perhaps encouraged by a shake or two of
the cone. I rather glibly took the seed and scattered them in a sandy corner of my garden
and a few months later I had a whole lot of <i>Ld strobilinum</i> seedlings. Not being
satisfied with this location I uprooted one of the now 3cm high plants and moved it to my
protea bed. I became rather attached and proud of my conebush and thought that they were
really easy to grow. The next summer lots of new growth appeared and the plant was very
happy indeed.</p>

<p>Then came a problem. I sold my house. Oh no, but what about my <i>Ld strobilinum?</i>
Well, on the day I moved out of the house I couldn&#146;t bear to leave it behind so I
carelessly uprooted my <i>Ld strobilinum</i> along with the still attached 150&nbsp;mm tap
root and proteoid roots as well. It was placed on my car mat for a 5km journey where the
plant was replanted and well watered for the rest of that summer.</p>

<p>Today, which is now 3 years later, the plant is a strapping young lad or lass (for I
know not which yet), pushing over half a metre high!</p>

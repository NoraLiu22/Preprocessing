      Things First</font></b><br>
      </font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The most common 
      reason for failure to feed is because the reptile isn't set up with the 
      proper environment. &quot;Environment&quot; is the specifics of lighting, 
      temperatures, humidity, furnishings, size, design and layout, and photoperiods. 
      If any of these things are wrong for the species, it can cause reduction 
      in appetite or a complete failure to feed.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The most common environmental 
        problem is wrong temperatures, either too hot or too cold. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> If you don't use a 
        thermometer, use one. If you have a thermometer and it says that the temperatures 
        are where they are supposed to be, get another thermometer and double 
        check. Sometimes thermometers fail, or are less than accurate to begin 
        with. If you have the self-adhesive type of thermometer commonly sold 
        for reptiles, and have peeled it off and re-glued it to another place, 
        that can destroy its accuracy. Heat-sensing &quot;guns&quot; can be used 
        to check the heat at places difficult to place a thermometer, such as 
        on a branch used for basking by an arboreal reptile, or rocky perch used 
        by a desert lizard.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> All of this assumes 
        that you already know what the proper temperature gradients, and basking 
        temperatures, are for your reptile. If you don't, find it out! Every species 
        has different requirements. While they can be loosely grouped by habitat 
        type (woodland, desert, wet tropical forest, temperate riparian, etc.), 
        where they live in that habitat can affect temperature requirements, as 
        can their lifestyle (nocturnal or diurnal). If you can't find species-specific 
        information for that rare swift you have, research the requirements known 
        for other species of swift and other lizards that live in the same places 
        as they do, and compare what is known about yours (habitat type, lifestyle, 
        habits, etc.) to what the known species require. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> You need to provide 
        heat in a way that is similar to how the reptile obtains and uses heat 
        in its environment. Very few reptiles actually bask on hot rocks in the 
        wild, so, despite the advertising of such products, <a href="hotrock.html">hot 
        rocks</a> are appropriate for very few species of snakes and lizards, 
        and not at all for chelonians. There is more information on the various 
        products used for lighting and heating in the <a href="liteheat.html">Lighting 
        and Heating</a> article.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Humidity is an important 
        environmental - and health - factor. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> If the environment 
        is too dry, based on the species requirements, it will cause dehydration 
        in the reptile. Dehydrated animals will reduce their food intake until 
        they simply stop feeding. Forcing them to eat will only worsen the dehydration 
        as the gut pulls fluids out of cells to try to get the food digested. 
        Serious, even fatal, hypovolemic shock thus can be induced. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Information on rehydrating 
        reptile can be found in the <a href="fluids.html">Fluid and Fluid Therapy</a> 
        article. Ways to increase the humidity levels in the enclosure or environment 
        itself can be found in the <a href="microclimates.html">Microclimate</a> 
        article.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Lizards and most chelonians 
        require ultraviolet B (UVB) wavelengths in order to manufacture their 
        own vitamin D3, which is a critical part of the calcium metabolization 
        process. This is especially critical for herbivores or largely herbivorous 
        reptiles, as well as diurnal insectivores.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The only safe ways 
        to provide UVB for your reptiles is by giving them access to direct sunlight 
        (not filtered through regular window glass or reptile/aquarium tank glass, 
        or plastic) or by using a UVB-producing fluorescent light made for this 
        purpose for reptiles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Plant and aquarium 
        lights do not produce the UV wavelengths reptiles need to produce D3.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Full-spectrum&quot; 
        lights may emit the full visible spectrum (many don't as they are &quot;color 
        corrected&quot; to affect the colors you see, which affect the way your 
        reptile's colors appears to you and your reptile's environment appears 
        to the reptile), but they do not - cannot - produce UV.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> UVB-producing fluorescents 
        must be properly installed (no more than 18&quot; from the reptile) and 
        replaced at least annually. While there are several lights made for this 
        purpose, not all produce enough UVB. See the articles on UV lighting at 
        the <a href="maincaptive.html">Captivity</a> page for more information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Metal halide and mercury 
        vapor lights are sometimes recommended for use with reptiles, promoted 
        by the fact that they provide both heat and UV. Unfortunately, they provide 
        such high levels of UV that they pose a health threat to both the reptiles 
        and the humans who keep them. Some of these issues are discussed in the 
        article on <a href="mercuryvapor.html">Mercury Vapor products </a>. Another 
        thing to keep in mind is that, in the past, many of the people who use 
        these types of lights kept them on for only a few minutes, or up to half 
        an hour or so, a day. This may reduce the level of harmful radiation the 
        reptile and keeper are exposed to, but it creates health problems and 
        stress in the reptiles if they are not provided with other forms of heating 
        and lighting for the rest of the day light hours to provide the thermal 
        gradients and photoperiods they require..and at that point, you haven't 
        saved any space, time, or money by using such a combination heat/UV product 
        because you still have to use other heating and lighting sources.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The reptile's habits 
        need to be provided for in an enclosure large enough to provide for all 
        their needs (basking, lounging, feeding, sleeping, places for food and 
        water, furnishings, and open space for moving around). For example, arboreal 
        reptiles furnished with climbing apparatus, burrowing reptiles with something 
        to burrow in, all reptiles provided with places to hide. More information 
        on this can be found in <a href="enclsize.html">Reptile Housing: Size, 
        Dimension and Lifestyle</a>.</font></p>

        identifying problems related to improper environment - physical and social 
        - can be found in the <a href="signs.html">Signs of Illness &amp; Stress</a>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Food</b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">All prey is not 
        created equal. At the very least, there is the difference between vertebrate 
        and invertebrate prey. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Fish, amphibians, reptiles, 
        birds, and mammals are all included in the diets of the many carnivorous 
        and omnivorous reptilian species. Some are generalists, feeding on many 
        different types of prey, while others are specialists, feeding on a limited 
        number of species of prey. Most reptiles feed in the wild only on living 
        prey, though a few species are carrion eaters. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Research into the nutrient 
        content of different prey animals indicates that there is little difference 
        between them nutritionally when considering healthy, properly fed prey 
        species. Thus, from a nutritional standpoint, converting a reptile from 
        feeding upon one type of prey should be acceptable. Unfortunately, the 
        reptile in question may not be so logical about these things, preferring 
        instead to feed on its usual lizards, frogs, or snakes rather than switching 
        to furry mice. Suggestions for scenting one prey with another are discussed 
        in the <a href="hatchlin.html">Hatchling Snakes</a> article; they should 
        work equally well for carnivorous lizards</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The size of prey fed 
        to a reptile bears directly on the reptile's ability to catch, swallow 
        and digest the prey. A rule of thumb for lizards is that the prey should 
        be no larger than 2/3 the length of the reptile's head. For snakes, the 
        rule is that prey be no wider at its widest point than the widest part 
        of the snake's body. Feeding prey that is too large may result in regurgitation, 
        injuries from swallowing and regurgitation, seizures, partial paralysis, 
        gut impactions, even death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> One way to attempt 
        to convert a non-rodent eater to feed on rodents is to scent the rodent 
        with the reptile's preferred prey. A living or defrosted frozen lizard 
        or frog (or other preferred food item) may be kept on hand to rub against 
        the killed rodent just before offering it for feeding. This will transfer 
        the scent of the preferred prey to the fur or skin of the rodent. Dangling 
        the rodent from a pair of tongs or hemostats will create the illusion 
        of movement. Combined with the scent, this may entice and trick the reptile 
        into feeding. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The reasons for feeding 
        prekilled rodent prey are discussed at length in the <a href="prekill.html">Feeding 
        Prekilled Prey</a> article, as are tips for converting live feeders to 
        prekilled. Many reptiles become frightened of live prey, especially if 
        they have been bitten before. With young snakes or lizards, the live prey 
        may just be too active for them. Feeding prekilled eliminates both the 
        fear and the risk of injury.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Do not leave invertebrate 
        prey, especially mealworms, kingworms, or crickets, in the enclosure with 
        a reptile without also leaving food for the prey. If the reptile does 
        not eat the invertebrates right away, they will soon get hungry and start 
        feeding on whatever is available, which is usually the reptile. Many reptiles 
        become so severely chewed up and stressed out by their prey that they 
        require veterinary care; such reptiles, like snakes who have been attacked 
        by rodents, can be very difficult to get self-feeding again. Another scenting 
        trick is pithing. This involves piercing the braincase of the killed prey 
        with a pin or nail before offering it to the reptile. Never leave live 
        rodents in an enclosure with the reptile. Too many big boids have died 
        or been permanently disfigured by <a href="ratbites.html">rodent attacks</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Something to try before 
        pithing, however, is dipping the prekilled prey into some warm chicken 
        broth. This is especially effective in species whose wild diet includes 
        birds. Canned chicken broth may be poured into ice cube trays and frozen, 
        defrosting cubes as needed. Depending on the size and number of prey you 
        need to dip at each feeding, you can use the trays for regular sized cubes 
        or trays for miniature cubes. (Prominent snake breeders Dave and Tracy 
        Barker discovered the efficacy of chicken broth.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Some reptiles are sensitive 
        to color, and have definite preferences for prey of certain colors. With 
        rodents, this may mean brown or parti-colored mice rather than white mice 
        (after all, there aren't a lot of white or albino mice in the wild, as 
        they tend to not survive long enough to pass on their color genes). This 
        color preference may extend to insect-eaters as well. Adding powdered 
        spirulina or alfalfa to the food-and-vitamin mix fed to crickets will 
        turn them green, making them more acceptable to reptiles who typically 
        eat green insects in the wild. (Chameleon keeper Alon Coppens discovered 
        this when he ran out of naturally green insects for his picky Nosy Be<i> 
        C. pardalis</i>.)</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Serving Food</b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Care must be taken 
        not only in the type and size of food selected for feeding, but in the 
        presentation of the food as well. Proper presentation not only makes food 
        attractive to the reptile, which will help stimulate feeding, but will 
        ensure that the food can be safely consumed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> A plate of some sort 
        must be used when the reptile is kept on a substrate of soil, shavings 
        or other particulate matter. This will prevent the unnecessary uptake 
        and accidental ingestion of the substrate itself. While there is nothing 
        to prevent this from occurring in the wild, captivity is not the wild. 
        We are still ignorant about what factors or organisms that may prevent 
        impactions in the wild that are missing in the captive environment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> An alternative is to 
        remove the reptile from its enclosure and place it in a special enclosure 
        reserved for feeding. Separate feeding enclosures will be required when 
        two or more snakes are housed together. Keeping and feeding them in the 
        same enclosure may well result in fewer snakes as one snake eats the other 
        merely because it smells like prey, or when both have tried to eat the 
        same prey animal. Separation may also be required when housing two or 
        more lizards or chelonians together when one of them is unable to compete 
        successfully with the others for access to enough food.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Plant foods should 
        be thoroughly mixed together to prevent the reptile from picking out only 
        certain plants and leaving the rest. Captive diets consisting of just 
        one or two plants is not nutritious and will result in nutritional deficiency 
        disorders.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Carnivores<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Rodents/Birds/Reptiles/Amphibians: 
        Using a forceps (hemostats) or kitchen tongs, grasp the prey by the base 
        of the tail and dangle it for the reptile. You may find that &quot;walking&quot; 
        it around a bit will better simulate the movement of a live prey animal 
        and thus better trigger a feeding strike.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>Fish:</i></b> 
        Let the fish swim in the water bowl or special feeding bowl, large enough 
        for the aquatic turtle, or semi-aquatic lizard, snake or turtle to get 
        into and swim to catch its prey.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>Worms/Larvae: 
        </i></b>Individual worms or larva may be held in forceps to introduce 
        the prey to the reptile. A meal's worth of worms or larvae may be placed 
        in a shallow bowl or saucer, enabling the reptile to get in but preventing 
        the worms from escaping. Leave some of the food being fed to the worms 
        in the bowl so that they have something to feed on if they are themselves 
        not eaten right away.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>Crickets:</i></b> 
        Crickets may be set loose in the enclosure for most reptiles. For turtles, 
        they may need to be held with forceps. On a daily basis, check under furnishings, 
        branches, and potted plants to get the crickets who have hidden back out 
        into the open again. Put some of the food being fed to the crickets in 
        their own enclosure into the reptile's enclosure so that the crickets 
        have something to feed on if they themselves are not eaten right away. 
        A piece of fruit placed in a jar lid will provide the crickets with an 
        easily accessible source of moisture. A rock should be placed in the reptile's 
        water bowl so that if crickets jump into the water they will be able to 
        climb out onto the rock and jump free and thus escape drowning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Omnivores<br>
        </b></font><b><i><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Terrestrial 
        feeders:</font></i></b><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        The plant food may be placed in a shallow bowl, jar lid, or saucer. Offer 
        vertebrate prey as indicated above. Worms, larvae, and killed vertebrate 
        prey may be placed on top of the plant food, mixed into it, or offered 
        separately.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <i><b>Aquatic feeders:</b></i> 
        The leafy greens may be floated on the water. If turtle food sticks or 
        pellets are being offered to aquatic turtles, they may be floated on the 
        water as well.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Feeding Time<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When the food 
        is offered will also affect feeding and metabolism. Failure to proffer 
        the right food at the right time, and in the right way, may well result 
        in malnutrition or starvation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Some species feed at 
        night. Others will easily take food around sunset but will not feed during 
        daylight hours. Still others will only eat during the day. Offering food 
        outside the optimal feeding times for the species may result in reduced 
        intake or failure to feed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Some reptiles may be 
        unwilling to feed when they are being watched by other animals, including 
        humans. Still others will compete so fiercely with other cagemates for 
        food that injuries may occur or the cagemates may themselves become reluctant 
        to feed and so slowly starve to death. Thus, observation of captive species 
        must be done carefully so as not to stress, or alter the behavior of, 
        the animals being watched.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Feeding frequency may 
        also lead to nutritional problems. Some hatchling lizards and small adult 
        lizards need to feed several times a day. Other lizards may feed comfortably 
        once a day or once every other day. The feeding frequency may change throughout 
        the year due to breeding season or coinciding with natural cycles found 
        in the animal's native habitat, such as the dry or wet seasons, cool winters, 
        hot summers, or breeding season.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Wash your hands with 
        hot, soapy water, rinse thoroughly, and finish off with cold water. This 
        will remove the scent of other animals - predator and prey - from your 
        hands and give your hands a cooler thermal signature than the prey you 
        are offering (by tongs or forceps, please) to reptiles who use heat sensing 
        to locate prey.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Feeding Frequency<br>

        are no cut-and-dried rules on feeding reptiles. Each species will have 
        its own requirements. Feeding amounts and frequency are based as much 
        on the reptile's evolved dietary needs and metabolic size as it is on 
        its being maintained in a proper environment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Generally speaking, 
        smaller reptiles need to eat more frequently than larger reptiles; younger 
        reptiles more often than older ones; insectivores more frequently than 
        vertebrate eaters; and herbivores more frequently than omnivores or carnivores. 
        Most young lizards and herbivorous reptiles will need to eat every day, 
        whereas young snakes may eat twice a week. Sick reptiles, or those preparing 
        for breeding, may need to eat more or more often than healthy adult reptiles 
        not in breeding season. Reptiles tend to eat more during the seasons that 
        coincide with the highest food availability in their native habitat (generally 
        corresponding to our spring and summer months) than during the cold or 
        dry seasons.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> A reptile who acts 
        hungry probably is. &quot;Acting hungry&quot; may include such behaviors 
        as instantly coming alert, head raised, and, in snakes and some lizards, 
        active tongue flicking, when the caretaker approaches the enclosure. Caretakers 
        being struck or bitten by an otherwise tame and calm snake or lizard when 
        they put their hands in or near the enclosure is another sure sign. Except 
        for certain gorge feeders (such as savannah monitors and Burmese pythons), 
        a reptile maintained in a proper environment, who gets plenty of exercise, 
        and is fed a healthy diet, is difficult to overfeed. If they are not hungry, 
        they will not eat.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Commercial Foods<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Commercial 
        reptile foods (dried, broth-flavored insects, &quot;sausages&quot;, frozen, 
        canned and dried foods) sound like the perfect answer to what to feed 
        your lizard, snake or chelonian. The only problem is that, despite packaging, 
        advertising, and pet store claims, except for some of the aquatic turtle 
        foods, these food products were not longitudinally tested and many are 
        proving to be less nutritionally &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;balanced&quot; 
        as claimed. Reptile keepers and veterinarians are finding that animals 
        maintained on many of these foods exhibit developmental abnormalities 
        (growing too fast or too slow) and nutritional deficiencies such as metabolic 
        bone disease. It is best to not consider these as suitable substitutes 
        for whole prey or fresh plant diets. For more information, see the <a href="evalcomm.html">Evaluating 
        Commercial Diets</a> and related articles in the <a href="mainfood.html">Food 
        &amp; Feeding</a> page..</font></p>

        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Snakes<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Feeding baby 
        snakes may present some unique problems. Captive bred snakes remain genetically 
        programmed to recognize certain scents and shapes as being &quot;food.&quot; 
        When those shapes and smells don't materialize, they may be reluctant 
        to feed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Most baby snakes do 
        not feed for the first several weeks after hatching as they are still 
        living off the remains of their yolk which is retained inside their bodies; 
        this takes about 10-20 days. In the wild this time would be spent finding 
        water, basking, sleeping, and hiding spots, and generally learning about 
        its environment. Only after the first shed or two, anywhere from 2-4 weeks 
        after hatching/birth, will they start looking for food.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> In captivity, they 
        may often be started on rodent prey, specifically pinky mice, causing 
        them to imprint on the prey and so become willing feeders on at least 
        that species of rodent for the duration of its life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Methods to help them 
        start feeding on proffered food items, besides ensuring they have a properly 
        set up and furnished environment, are discussed above and in the articles 
        referenced below.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Chelonians<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Aquatic turtle 
        hatchlings will often begin to feed in small containers, with water deep 
        enough for them to swim and dive and equipped with a haul-out place. Wriggling 
        insects, such as pinhead crickets, moving on the surface of the water 
        will attract the hatchlings' attention and stimulate the feeding response. 
        Once they are feeding easily and heartily, they can be fed in their regular 
        enclosure. If feeding many hatchlings, care must be taken to not overcrowd 
        the feeding enclosures. If they are being fed in their regular enclosure, 
        some should be removed to one or more separate feeding enclosures. Care 
        must be taken to watch them carefully to see if any are not able to compete 
        successfully for the food.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Terrestrial turtles 
        are omnivorous. A selection of finely chopped or shredded plant food can 
        be placed in a feeding container or in a substrate-free area of their 
        enclosure. The prey arthropods may be mixed in with the plant matter or 
        placed on top of it. Mixing the prey with the plant matter is a good way 
        to get them started eating the plant matter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Tortoises are grazers 
        and should be offered a variety of vegetables and leafy greens as well 
        as drier roughage for foraging. The chopped vegetable and leafy greens 
        should be set out on a jar lid or other flat surface, enabling the small 
        tortoises to easily climb on and forage in the midst of the food. They 
        may be kept on a mixed bedding of alfalfa and timothy hays. This will 
        give them traction to walk on (unlike alfalfa pellets), and is easily 
        moved about so that it may be burrowed under. Since tortoises will try 
        to eat everything, no wood, paper, gravel, or other substrates should 
        be used, nor should Styrofoam-type plates be used to as a feeding plate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Lizards<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Carnivorous 
        lizards should be separated at meal time to reduce aggressive competition 
        for food. Depending upon the individual lizard's prowess, some may need 
        to be placed in smaller containers to restrict the movement of their prey. 
        Insectivores should be offered a variety of prey items to maximize nutrient 
        intake. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Herbivorous lizards 
        may also need to be separated to reduce feeding competition. As with neonate 
        tortoises, shallow serving platters should be used to enable easy access 
        and foraging in the food.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Omnivorous lizards 
        may need to be separated for feeding if they are not able to compete successfully 
        with cagemates. They may be fed in a manner similar to omnivorous box 
        turtles, with their animal prey mixed into their plant matter. In addition, 
        crickets should be offered to them either in their enclosure or in smaller 
        feeding containers to ensure they are able to catch them. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>When All Else Fails<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If 
        your reptile has non-feeding long enough so that it starts to visibly 
        lose weight/mass, you need to get your reptile checked by a <a href="vets/index.html">reptile 
        veterinarian</a>. Just because they can go a long time without feeding 
        doesn't meant they should. While there is nothing to worry about if your 
        hatchling doesn't feed until after its first or second shed, or your adult 
        isn't eating during breeding season, or your carnivore of any age isn't 
        interested in food during pre-shed and <a href="shedding.html">shedding</a>, 
        an apparently healthy reptile whose environmental needs are being met 
        and who is being offered appropriate prey in the appropriate way but who 
        still won't eat has a problem. Systemic infections, heavy loads of internal 
        parasites, <a href="ibd.html">boid inclusion body disease</a>, congenital 
        deformities, gut obstructions, and more can cause inappetance or inability 
        to feed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> If force-feeding is 
        necessary, don't shove a whole prey down its throat. That is highly stressful 
        (for you and the reptile) and may end up burning more calories than you 
        are shoving in. More information on force-feeding can be found in the 
        <a href="emaciation.html">Emaciation (Starvation) Protocol</a> article.</font></p>

Encouraged by Jean Renoir, whom he assisted during the filming of The River (1951), Ray set to work on an adaptation of a 1929 novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay about a young boy growing up in an impoverished rural community.</p>

<p>Distinct from the more commercial Hindi films of the time, Pather Panchali announced the arrival of a humanistic, Calcutta-centred Indian art cinema, ultimately paving the way for the emergence of the Parallel Cinema movement of the 1960s. Among the film’s intensely memorable moments is a scene in which Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his sister run through a paddy field to catch a glimpse of a passing train.</p>

<p>“Here is a cinema of awakenings.” <strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong></p>

<p>“A tour de force of humanist cinema, looking at a rural family which faces tragedies as well as stolen moments of happiness and togetherness. The influence of Jean Renoir, coupled with a fierce originality in its black-and-white visuals, still mark it out as the best Indian film ever made – and all achieved at a negligible budget.” <strong>Khalid Mohamed</strong></p>

<p>“Ray’s classic was hailed internationally as a realist masterpiece but dismissed in India by some eminent citizens (who should have known better) as a film that did nothing but highlight Indian poverty for Western eyes. Looking at it today, you marvel at what Ray pulled off. He had a great sense of design and space, but to have created a film whose every frame captures time and place with such elegance and depth still takes you aback. To me, it is Indian cinema’s first truly modern film, at home in the world.” <strong>Shubhra Gupta</strong></p>

Encouraged by Jean Renoir, whom he assisted during the filming of The River (1951), Ray set to work on an adaptation of a 1929 novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay about a young boy growing up in an impoverished rural community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distinct from the more commercial Hindi films of the time, Pather Panchali announced the arrival of a humanistic, Calcutta-centred Indian art cinema, ultimately paving the way for the emergence of the Parallel Cinema movement of the 1960s. Among the film’s intensely memorable moments is a scene in which Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his sister run through a paddy field to catch a glimpse of a passing train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Here is a cinema of awakenings.” <strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A tour de force of humanist cinema, looking at a rural family which faces tragedies as well as stolen moments of happiness and togetherness. The influence of Jean Renoir, coupled with a fierce originality in its black-and-white visuals, still mark it out as the best Indian film ever made – and all achieved at a negligible budget.” <strong>Khalid Mohamed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ray’s classic was hailed internationally as a realist masterpiece but dismissed in India by some eminent citizens (who should have known better) as a film that did nothing but highlight Indian poverty for Western eyes. Looking at it today, you marvel at what Ray pulled off. He had a great sense of design and space, but to have created a film whose every frame captures time and place with such elegance and depth still takes you aback. To me, it is Indian cinema’s first truly modern film, at home in the world.” <strong>Shubhra Gupta</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Satyajit Ray","producer":"","writer":"Satyajit Ray","featuring":"Kanu Banerjee, Karuna Banerjee, Subir Banerjee"},"year":"1955","nameAndYear":"Pather Panchali (1955)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"India","runningTime":121,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":35,"tied":false,"category":"critics"},{"position":22,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":{"critics":[{"firstname":"Sharofat","surname":"Arabova","slug":"sharofat-arabova","name":"Sharofat Arabova","sortName":"Arabova, Sharofat","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Film scholar","country":"Tajikistan","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/sharofat-arabova"},{"firstname":"Ranjita","surname":"Biswas","slug":"ranjita-biswas","name":"Ranjita Biswas","sortName":"Biswas, Ranjita","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Independent journalist","country":"India","remarks":[{"type":"p","key":"In the context of world cinema it is hard to hone down on the Best Ten.

Later, films that experiment with language and employ an innovative narrative structure became my favourites. It is no surprise that films like Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Run Lola Run are included in my list. However, I did not stop loving films in the first category, and for that reason Bicycle Thieves, Tokyo Story and Pather Panchali are also on the list. And how can I ignore filmmakers' amazing journeys through human minds with suspense, mystery and unexplained exertion? In this respect, Vertigo, Blue Velvet and In the Mood for Love were obvious choices. Europe and the United States have produced a lot of great films focusing on cities suffering from anomie and city dwellers enduring loneliness. Taxi Driver is on the list because it is one of the best representations of a post-war urban West.

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: An anonymous

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three miles of lonesome road, cut through a pine 
        forest, separates the home of Dr. Wallace, at Parkstone, from fashionable 
        Bournemouth. The house itself, standing on a slight elevation, commands 
        a fine view across the sea to Swanage and the Purbeck Hills. &quot;Look at 
        our lovely view,&quot; were almost the first words which Dr. Wallace said to 
        me upon entering his house. And so for a few minutes I stood in the spacious 
        drawing room window, beside the tall, erect figure with silver hair and 
        beard, drinking in the beauty of the scene, until the rosy tints of sunset 
        had faded away, leaving the hills and the water dull and grey. &quot;Let us 
        go down to the study now,&quot; said the doctor, and following him I entered 
        a cosy retreat, in the lower part of the house, ranged around with books 
        and pictures, the chairs suggestive of comfort and the well-littered tables 
        of much study and research. &quot;Your study lies in a wood, Dr. Wallace,&quot; 
        I involuntarily exclaimed, as I looked through the stretch of windows 
        flanking the outer side of the room to the garden beyond, rising gradually 
        upwards until it joined the distant wood. Then the lamp was lighted, the 
        blinds drawn down, and the great scientist seated himself in his special 
        armchair, drawn up close to the blazing fire, and proceeded to discourse 
        upon the subject of natural selection, in which, as an original thinker, 
        he stands unequalled save by Darwin.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I should like to ask your opinion, Dr. Wallace, upon 
        the rapid change, amounting almost to a social revolution, which is taking 
        place in the education and general development of women; what effect will 
        it have upon human progress?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I reply without hesitation that the effect will be 
        entirely beneficial to the race. Women at the present time, in all civilised 
        countries, are showing a determination to secure their personal, social, 
        and political freedom. The great part which they are destined to play 
        in the future of humanity has begun to force itself upon their attention. 
        They have within the last twenty years proceeded by leaps and bounds towards 
        the attainment of that perfect freedom without which no human being can 
        arrive at his or her highest development. When men and women are alike 
        free to follow their best impulses, when both receive the best and most 
        thorough education that the knowledge at the time will admit; when there 
        are no false restrictions placed upon any human being because of the accident 
        of sex, and when the standard of public opinion is set by the wisest and 
        the best, and that standard is systematically inculcated upon the young, 
        then we shall find that a system of human selection will come spontaneously 
        into action which will bring about a reformed humanity.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And are women to be the chief factors in bringing 
        about this great reformation?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes; the hope of the future lies with women. When 
        such social changes have been effected, that no woman will be compelled, 
        either by hunger, isolation, or social compulsion, to sell herself either 
        in prostitution or uncongenial wedlock; when all women alike shall feel 
        the refining influence of a true humanising education, of beautiful and 
        elevating surroundings, and when there is an educated public opinion--note 
        that specially,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, leaning forward in his chair with a 
        flushed and eager face--&quot;we must have an educated public opinion which 
        shall be founded on the highest aspirations of the age and country; then 
        the result will be a form of human selection which will bring about a 
        continuous advance in the average status of the race. I believe that this 
        improvement will be effected through the agency of female choice in marriage. 
        As things are, women are constantly forced into marriage for a bare living 
        or a comfortable home. They have practically no choice in the selection 
        of their partners and the fathers of their children, and so long as this 
        economic necessity for marriage presses upon the great bulk of women, 
        men who are vicious, degraded, of feeble intellect and unsound bodies, 
        will secure wives, and thus often perpetuate their infirmities and evil 
        habits. But in a reformed society the vicious man, the man of degraded 
        taste or of feeble intellect, will have little chance of finding a wife, 
        and his bad qualities will die out with himself. On the other hand, the 
        most perfect and beautiful in body and mind, the men of spotless character 
        and reputation, will secure wives first, the less commendable later, and 
        the least commendable latest of all. As a natural consequence, the best 
        men and women will marry the earliest, and probably have the largest families. 
        The result will be a more rapid increase of the good than of the bad, 
        and this state of things continuing to work for successive generations, 
        will at length bring the average man up to the level of those who are 
        now the more advanced of the race. I hope I make it clear that women must 
        be free to marry or not marry before there can be true natural selection 
        in the most important relationship of life. Although many women now remain 
        unmarried from necessity rather than from choice, there are always a considerable 
        number who have no special inclination to marriage, but who accept husbands 
        to secure a subsistence or a home. If all women were pecuniarily independent, 
        and all occupied with congenial public duties or intellectual enjoyments, 
        I believe that a large number would choose to remain unmarried. In a regenerated 
        society it would come to be considered a degradation for any woman to 
        marry a man she did not both love and esteem; in consequence, many women 
        would abstain from marriage altogether, or delay it until a worthy and 
        sympathetic husband was encountered.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There are upwards of a million more women than men 
        in this country, Dr. Wallace, and it seems to me that it is this feminine 
        superfluity which has, as it were, demoralised marriage?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Undoubtedly it has tended to weaken the selective 
        agency of women. Still, although females are largely in excess of males 
        in our existing population, there is good reason to believe that it will 
        not remain a permanent feature.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do you mean to imply that the wear and tear of competitive 
        industry and the physical demands of the higher education will act injuriously 
        upon women and reduce their numbers?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Certainly not,&quot; replied Dr. Wallace with a laugh; 
        &quot;we are not going to kill off the superfluous women, but preserve the 
        lives of men. As a matter of fact, there are more boys born into the world 
        than girls, but boys die so much more rapidly than girls that when we 
        include all under the age of five the numbers are nearly equal; for the 
        next five years the mortality is nearly the same in both sexes; then that 
        of females preponderates up to thirty years of age; then up to sixty that 
        of men is the larger; while for the rest of life female mortality is again 
        greatest. The general result is that at the ages of most frequent marriage--from 
        twenty to thirty-five--females are between eight and nine per cent. in 
        excess of males. But during the ages from five to thirty-five we find 
        a wonderful excess of male deaths from two preventible causes--'accident' 
        and 'violence.' The great excess of male over female deaths, amounting 
        in one year to over 3,000, all between the ages of five and thirty-five, 
        is no doubt due to the greater risks run by men and boys in various industrial 
        occupations. We are looking forward to a society in the future which will 
        guard the lives of the workers against the effects of unhealthy employments 
        and all preventible risks. This will further reduce the mortality of men 
        as compared with women. It seems highly probable that in the society of 
        the future the superior number of males at birth will be maintained throughout 
        life, or at least through the marriageable period.&quot;<sup></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And you would maintain, I suppose, Dr. Wallace, that 
        the large number of women, who, in consequence of being economically independent, 
        would elect not to marry would further decrease the present overplus of 
        marriageable women?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Certainly; when no woman is compelled to marry for 
        a bare living or a comfortable home, there will, I believe, be a large 
        number of women who will remain single from choice. Few women will marry 
        then except from the highest motive--pure and disinterested love. Now, 
        with man the passion of love is stronger and more general, and, as in 
        a reformed society women will not be driven to lives of shame for the 
        sake of bread, but will have remunerative occupation, men will have no 
        means of gratifying their stronger passions except through marriage. In 
        consequence, almost every woman will receive offers, and thus a powerful 
        selective agency will rest with the female sex. On the whole, then, it 
        is probable that in the society of the future the mortality of males will 
        be less, owing to preventive measures in connection with dangerous and 
        injurious occupations, so that the number of marriageable men will be 
        equal to that of women; add to this that there will be an increasing proportion 
        of women who will prefer not to marry, and it is clear that men desiring 
        wives will be in excess of women wanting husbands. This will greatly increase 
        the influence of women in the improvement of the race. Being in the minority, 
        they will be more sought after, and will have a real choice in marriage, 
        which is rarely the case now.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You think, then, Dr. Wallace, that the women who 
        marry will choose wisely?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Broadly speaking, I think we may trust the cultivated 
        minds and pure instincts of the women of the future in the choice of partners. 
        The idle and the selfish would be almost universally rejected. The coarse 
        and sensual man, the diseased or the weak in intellect, those having a 
        tendency to insanity or to hereditary disease, or who possess any congenital 
        deformity, would rarely find partners, because the enlightened woman would 
        know that she was committing an offence against society, against humanity 
        at large, in choosing a husband who might be the means of transmitting 
        disease of body or of mind to his offspring. Thus it will come about that 
        the lower types of men, morally, and the physically diseased, will remain 
        permanently unmarried, and will leave no descendants; and the advance 
        of the race in every good quality will be ensured. This method of improvement 
        by the gradual elimination of the worst is the most direct method, for 
        it is of much greater importance to get rid of the lowest types of humanity 
        than to raise the highest a little higher. We do not need so much to have 
        more of the great and the good as we need to have less of the weak and 
        the bad. The method by which the animal and vegetable worlds have been 
        improved and developed has been through weeding out. The survival of the 
        fittest is really the extinction of the unfit. Natural selection in the 
        world of nature is achieving this on an enormous scale, because owing 
        to the rapid increase of most organisms a large proportion of the unfit 
        are destroyed. In order to cleanse society of the unfit we must give to 
        woman the power of selection in marriage, and the means by which this 
        most important and desirable end can be attained will be brought about 
        by giving her such training and education as shall render her economically 
        independent.&quot;</p>

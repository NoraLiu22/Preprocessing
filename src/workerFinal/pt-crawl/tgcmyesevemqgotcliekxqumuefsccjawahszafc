        I started to play the cello at the age of eleven at my local secondary

school in Edinburgh.  It was not a very succesful venture at first, as I

did not make any real progress until my fifth year of study.  At this time

a new music teacher (Margaret Tod) arrived at the school in 1975.  She was

a pianist by training and had had some success as a soloist in her early

career.  Her experience of the cello was fairly limited but she certainly

knew her stuff about music in general; what she was able to explain about

phrasing and musicality more than made up for her limitations in cello technique.

 She always fascinated me with her stories of when she was page turner for

Tovey and Casals when Casals made visits to Edinburgh in the 1930's.  Apparantly

the two communicated in German.  By 1975 I was about Grade 5 standard and

was making fairly good progress and I realised that I really enjoyed making

music on this instrument.  She asked me to go to her studio for lessons

instead of the half hour a week at school - she had a full sized grand piano

there.  We started to work on the first movement of the Brahms E minor sonata

which I fell in love with.  She had obviously given a recital of this piece

as pianist at some point in her career as she knew it off by heart.  At

first I was overwhelmed by the sound of her grand piano but over the next

few months my playing got stronger and I was able to complete the movement

without stopping.  Of course, since I was not being taught technique at

the same time, I picked up some horrible bad habits and fingering which

I later had to shake off when I studied the piece properly.  Nevertheless,

I used to wait in excitement for my weekly lesson when I would sit in this

grand music studio in Edinburgh's newtown and prepare to start that haunting

low E minor melody with such a superb piano accompaniment.  <br/>

<br/>

        It was electric to me - even in those days.  One day in 1975 she

commanded me to buy a ticket for "Rostakovitch" - she could never

pronounce his name and insisted that it had a "k".  I was none

the wiser, and as good students do, I took the advice and bought the ticket.

 Rostropovich was making his first appearance at the Edinburgh festival

for some years and was going to play 3 of the Bach suites.  I did not know

what to expect when I got to the concert hall - but I know that that first

ever cello recital which I attended made a huge impact on me.  I was mesmerized

by Rostropovich and was near to tears during the sixth suite - I could not

believe that one single instrument could make such beautiful music and that

an individual could be so much in command of that instrument.  I was from

that moment a devout Rostropovich fan - but little did I know then that

I would have the opportunity later in life to meet him over dinner and discuss

the cello and its repertoire and have the offer of a lesson from him! <br/>

<br/>

        As luck would have it the following year (1976) Rostropovich came

back to the Edinburgh festival this time to play the Prokofiev Simphonia

Concertante.  I was again electrified by this music although I found it

difficult to understand at that point - I was only 17.  I later became very

keen on the music of Prokofiev.  My first public recital, the prize giving

ceremony of my secondary school, was a total disaster.  I played Beethoven's

Sonatina in D minor - a very simple piece, but unaware to me, my cello which

had been under the grand piano during the ceremony was in the direct heat

and light of the sun which was beating down on the glass windows - 1976

was unusually a very hot summer in Scotland!.  When I went up to the podium

to play, the cello was hopelessly out of tune.  I got so flustered trying

to tune it in front of over two hundred people and when I started I was

hit by my first attack of stage fright.  It was truly a nightmare for me

and I wanted the earth to swallow me up.  This incident really knocked back

my confidence for a few years.<br/>

<br/>

        After a few years study with Margaret Tod, she insisted that she

hand me over to a more experienced cello teacher to concentrate on technique.

 I then went to study with Kitty Gregorson - a wonderful lady who taught

Moray Welsh (now principal cellist of the London Symphony Orchestra) in

his early years.  She had a difficult time with me at first trying to correct

all the bad habits, but she succeeded as two years later under her supervision

I passed the Associated Board grade 8 with distinction.  No-one was more

surprised than I!  During the late seventies and eighties I took every opportunity

to hear live cello recitals.  I heard most of the Greats of that time including

Fournier, Tortelier, Starker, and many of the "newcomers" like

Lloyd Weber, Bailey, May, Kirshbaum, Harrell etc.  I managed to hear Rostropovich

again on many occasions - the most memorable being after the Armenian Earthquake

where he played the last movement of Britten's Third Cello Suite (prayer

to the dead) to a packed Barbican Hall at around 2:00 am in the morning.

 The complete silence after he played moved me to tears.  I am disappointed

that my cellistic interest did not develop earlier because I would have

been able to hear Du Pre in concert, but unfortunately she had retired two

years earlier.<br/>

<br/>

        I joined the Edinburgh Symphony Orchestra, an amateur orchestra

and played with them for almost ten years prior to my relocation to London.

 In London I played briefly with the Chiswick Symphony Orchestra and in

1990 I was posted to Hong Kong.  There I joined the Hong Kong chamber orchestra

and played in a few concerts as well as in quartets etc.  I built up a vast

CD collection of cello music including most of the contemporary compositions

which Slava has been instrumental in creating.  To me the jury is still

out on some of these works although I do find some of them incredible (Penderecki's

second cello concerto for example - a fantastic work).  While I was working

in Hong Kong I got the opportunity of a life time.<br/>

<br/>

        I was with a well known branded spirits company which as part of

its brand development program had established a "World Master Musician"

series of concerts annually.  It was well known in the company that I was

a keen amateur cellist - I had given a small concert in Shanghai to my colleagues

at one of our management conferences earlier that year.  I was thrilled

and delighted when I heard that the plan for 1992 was to invite Rostropovich

to play in Taipei, Taiwan and that I would be given tickets for the concert.

 I was even more thrilled when the General Manager of the local company

invited me to join a small group which was hosting a dinner for Rostropovich

and his accompanist (Lambert Orkis) the evening before the concert.  I could

not believe my luck!  <br/>

<br/>

At the pre-concert dinner there were 12 people invited to a typical Chinese

style banquet in a Taipei restaurant.  I was seated two away from Rostropovich

at the early part of the dinner but as the evening went on we all moved

seats.  I was asked to sit next to him as we "had something in common".

 We spoke for a while about the cello and the repertoire - he seemed interested

in the fact that I was tackling the first Britten Suite - he later autographed

my copy of the suites which I now have framed.  He was extremely entertaining

during dinner telling many stories of his life and experiences - including

the one mentioned in an earlier edition of ICS Tutti Celli  regarding the

"contract" between himself and Britten over the suites.  <br/>

<br/>

After dinner, it was arranged that several of the group take Mr. Rostropovich

out to a night club in Taipei.  We went to an up-market nightclub which

served some excellent cognac while we listened to the entertainment provided.

 I was sitting next to Mr. Rostropovich and again we were talking about

the cello literature.  He told me there that in his opinion Schnittke is

the greatest living composer and that his Cello Concerto no 2 was the most

difficult piece he had ever tackled!  I had both concertos in my collection

of CD's and was able to give my comments on the works.  I told him my favorite

piece was the Prokofiev sonata in C and that I was having a few difficulties

with the last page of the first movement.  He asked me to play for him the

next day, but I (stupidly) declined as I know I would have been too nervous

- I will never get that chance again! <br/>

<br/>

At that point, a young Taiwanese violinist started to play "The Swan"

fairly close to our table.  He played it beautifully - although Slava pointed

out to me he took 5 bows for the high B eight bars from the end! We all

suggested that we invite the violinist to our table for a drink after he

finished playing.  I went up to him and asked him to come to our table where

there was a very "special guest" who wanted to meet him.  As he

approached our table I saw his lower jaw drop about 3 inches when he recognized

who was sitting there.  He had heard Rostropovich in concert two years earlier

in Taiwan and recognized him immediately.  Imagine the feeling of knowing

you had just played the Swan to Rostropovich!  Slava was very interested

in listening to the violinist (who spoke excellent English) in relation

to his studies and his work.  The young violinist explained that he traveled

from one nightclub to another on his motorbike each night giving small recitals

- sometimes up to seven nightclubs each night.  Slava responded with - "maestro,

you are seven times greater musician than I am, I can only manage one concert

hall each night!!  "The young violinist was completely bowled over

by the comment.  It certainly made his night a memorable one.<br/>

<br/>

        The following evening Slava walked on stage and gave a fantastic

recital incorporating the Beethoven Magic Flute Variations  (one of the

works I had studied for my grade 8 examination), the Bach Suite No.  2,

Debussy and the Myaskovsky Sonata No 2.  For one of his encores he played

my favorite slow movement from a sonata - the Rachmaninoff.  I do not think

there was a dry eye in the house! All in all it was a perfect weekend and

one which I shall never forget.  He truly is a remarkable man and I feel

privileged to have spent time (albeit very short) in his company.  He seems

to touch the heart of everyone he meets.<br/>

<br/>

        In 1993 the company invited Yo Yo Ma to play in Taiwan and I was

again invited.  Unfortunately the pre-concert dinner was canceled as Mr.

Ma was suffering a bad bout of flu, but I did meet him after the concert.

 He too is a very charming man and easy to talk to.  He signed my copy of

the Bach cello suites "Keep going, Yo Yo".<br/>

<br/>

        After six years of living in Hong Kong, my company posted me here

to Miami, Florida.  I have not yet found an outlet for my cello playing

but will continue to search.<br/>

<br/>

        My ambition remains to be able to retire at a relatively early age

and go to music college as a mature student.  I then want to live in a marble

floored house overlooking the Mediterranean (Italy or Spain) and play the

Bach suites each morning (somehow I do not think I will ever master Nos.

 4 &amp; 6).  I want to give a public recital one day including the following

works; Brahms E minor sonata, Rachmaninov Sonata and the Prokofiev Sonata

the latter of which still beats me in the third movement!!.  I would also

like to give cello lessons.  Its my dream - and I will do it..........<br/>

PS.  Does any reader know where I can get a copy of the Myaskovsky Sonata

No.  2 music (A minor).  I love this piece and would like to work at it

but to date have been unable to locate a copy.<br/>

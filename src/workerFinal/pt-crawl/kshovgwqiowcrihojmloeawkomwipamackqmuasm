            already conducted the Palestine Orchestra (Eretz Israeli Orchestra) 
            before it became the Israel Philharmonic in Tel Aviv. When rehearsing, 
            he would keep much of the energy of the players for the actual performance 
            which would often have great intensity. He was a great conductor which 
            is obvious from his recordings. Daniel Barenboim said in an interview 
            in the April 2000 issue of Gramophone: &quot;He was an undisciplined, 
            fiery personality, but a wonderful musician&quot;. Yet an entry in 
            an encyclopedia on George Singer was rarely found. That explains why 
            critic and reviewer Irving Kolodin initially thought that the name 
            George Singer was a pseudonym.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4" color="#333333">Not 
            all artists who appeared on Remington records were really known. Many 
            times record buyers suggested that a name was a fake. One of those 
            &quot;unknown&quot; Remington artists was conductor George Singer 
            who - as research shows - was born in Prague on August 6th, 1908. 
            Singer studied at the Prague Conservatory under Alexander von Zemlinsky 
            (1872-1942), brother in law and teacher of Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg, 
            and under Fidelio Finke (1891-1968). While Zemlinsky fled to the US 
            in 1934, Singer migrated to Palestine in 1939 and on December 5th 
            of that same year he conducted Borodin (Symphony No. 2), Dvorak (Serenade 
            for Strings), and Mussorgski (Pictures at an Exhibition). Singer traveled 
            to many European countries to perform. Israel was the country where 
            he died on October 1st, 1980.</font></p>

                  was Czech - like my mother. He was a fiend at playing scores 
                  on the piano - he could read anything. A conductor of great 
                  inspiration. The orchestra that I played in for a year when 
                  I was 19 - the Israeli Radio Orchestra in Jerusalem - liked 
                  only two conductors - George Singer and Carlo Zecchi. Singer 
                  because he never had patience for thorough rehearsal. He would 
                  always say: &quot;In the evening&quot;, meaning that things 
                  will work out in the concert. The orchestra played really well 
                  for him if compared to the abysmal playing for others. I knew 
                  of two people in Israel who were able to put an orchestral score 
                  in front of them and play anything and everything on the piano. 
                  The composer Yosef Tal (...) was one, and George Singer was 
                  the other. Singer's love for Czech composers was legendary, 
                  and he would include a Dvorak work in each program, if possible.&quot;

<h1>A Yellow Perennial Garden - Front
<small><small>- <a href="yellow1.html">Rear</a> - <a href="splant.html">Succulents</a>
- <a href="yellow0.html">Details</a></small></small></h1>

Many years ago, I was asked as a horticultural student to design gardens for three adjacent homes
in Niagara (zone 7a): one red one white and one blue, the colours then of the Canadian flag. All
of course used appropriate spring bulbs, then the red relied on a blast of annuals, the white on
flowering shrubs and white stonework, the blue on blue evergreens and delphiniums. They looked
OK, and garnered lots of attention for the patriotic theme and pride from their new-Canadian
owners. But when I was done, I decided that perennial yellow was my personal colour - small scale,
quiet but sunny, informal, steady.
<p>
I moved winter 2005 to be near to grandchildren (Ottawa, zone 5a Canadian, 4b&nbsp;USDA) and
decided that now, given the time freedom of retirement and the incredible information and
purchasing resources of the web, was the time to make all my gardens my colour. The
<a href="yellow0.html#layouts">house</a> faces south-east. Half the front used to be heavily shaded by
an 11&nbsp;m Prunus virginiana but it died due to black-knot fungus in 2021. Much of the rear garden
is partly shaded by my house,
a neighbour's house, and a row of 15&nbsp;m Tilia americana to the north-west.
<p>
My ideal for a garden is a natural <a href="scyear.html">meadow</a>: the only bare earth is where
animals walk and dig - the only plants found are those that grow happily together without overt
attention - there is always something in bloom somewhere - you are surrounded by nature. I
especially value shallow-rooted ground covers that allow other flowering plants to grow unimpeded
through them. In a natural meadow, plants intermingle and grade into each other - a suitable
ground cover gives a similar effect for separated specimen plants. Such a ground cover also
eliminates any need for artificial mulch, reduces weeding to a minimum, discourages squirrels
from digging up bulbs, and softens the appearance of plants that are out of bloom.
<p>
This is the garden I share with passers-by. The focal view is from the sidewalk, moderately formal
with a touch of drama, with at least one floral focus of interest throughout the year. There is a focal
group of small plants in pots at the entrance of the walkway to the front door.
<p>
All plants on these pages have survived at least one winter here and have then bloomed. Plants that
have proven themselves here for at least 3 years, and that I can recommend to other
Ottawa gardeners, are in bold. Notes and photos will grow and disappear as the plants do.
(Sadly, I've never found a remotely-yellow hyacinth that is hardy here;
City of Haarlem starts off yellow but is almost white by year three.)

<table>
<tr><td>Allium moly from southern Europe was planted here a decade ago, and none appeared after
the first winter. One popped up and bloomed June 2016! It's back up May 2017 & 2018.

<tr><td><b>Anemone ranunculoides</b> is from woodland Europe. Although it's supposed to prefer
acid soils, it's spreading here nicely via underground rhizomes. It vanishes mid-summer so needs
marking. 20% sun.

<tr><td><b>Chelidonium majus</b>, originally from the Mediterranean, is naturalized locally in mid
to deep shade. It stays green under the snow and starts growing as soon as days are above freezing.
It puts on a great show in spring, but has a lot of seed heads to pick off if you want it to keep
blooming through the summer; if you do, it blooms until hard frost. Unlike most woodland plants,
it's happy in dryish soil. The orange sap that's exuded when the seed heads are removed is
supposed to remove warts; flower diameter 27&nbsp;mm; 15% sun.

<tr><td>Chrysanthemum 'Yellow Quill', planted spring 2014, is the first yellow chrysanthemum I've
found that survives winters here. Its rays could be fuller but in Ottawa you take what you can
get! Its spent blooms need to be trimmed to keep it looking good. The 'insect' image here is
contrast-enhanced UV only, the balanced image in UV is totally black; composite diameter
70&nbsp;mm.

<tr><td><b>Crocus ancyrensis</b> is native to calcareous mountain soils of Asian Turkey. In myth,
the return of Persephone was signalled by the yellow crocus, this is one of the
earliest here. The flowers are almost entirely black in ultraviolet; 60-80% sun.

<tr><td>Crocus chrysanthus, native to calcareous open pine forests of the Balkans, was added fall
2010 to the front of the just-removed lawn; it's not doing as well as the C.ancyrensis.
Some varieties (pallidus) are cream yellow in and out.
In contrast to C.ancyrensis its stamens are bright white to insects; 60-80% sun.

<tr><td><b>Epimedium &#215;versicolor</b> (grandiflorum &#215; pinnatum colchicum) needs mid to
full shade, has leaves that stay green under the snow and delicate panicles of small sulphur-yellow
flowers early spring. Low growing, it spreads slowly by rhizomes, and is doing well. Some say to
cut back leaves in spring for best foliage, but I leave them - they make a good mulch for it;
15% sun.

several years now and are starting to produce offsets, but I rarely get more than one bloom per
year; 75% sun.

<tr><td><b>Hemerocallis 'Stella d'Oro'</b> is a solid performer, blooms early and late summer,
spreads, divides and transplants well, and blooms better in shade than any other I have. It's
really orange, not yellow, so is slowly being replaced in the sunnier sections by offshoots from
my favourite pure yellows; flower diameter 75&nbsp;mm;  15-40% sun.

<tr><td><b>Lysimachia nummularia</b> (L.zawadzkii) cultivar 'Aurea' from Europe needs mid to full
shade. It's a 5&nbsp;cm high golden-green ground cover with a few yellow flowers in mid summer
where it gets 2&nbsp;hours sun or more. It's spreading very well, looks great, allows established
plants to grow through them unimpeded, is easily pulled up and trimmed where not wanted, and
doesn't mind occasional gardeners' footsteps. My ground cover of choice for most of the garden; flower diameter 20&nbsp;mm; 15-60% sun.

<tr><td><b>Lysimachia punctata</b>, a North American native, grows best in mid-shade. It forms
a tight slow-spreading clump with tall spikes that divides only with a sharp spade. A popular
garden perennial a century ago, mine originally came from an overgrown old homestead site and has
accompanied me for half a century now. One of my favourite plants; flower diameter
20&nbsp;mm; 30% sun.

<tr><td>Narcissus are spread the width of the garden half way back in 40-60% sun. The bulbs are
sufficiently toxic that squirrels don't touch them; the name comes from narce, narcotic. (The Greek
god Narcissus was named after the trance he fell into while watching his reflection; the genus
wasn't named after him.)
<tr><td><b>Narcissus 7Y-Y</b> are multiflowered yellows - they bloom later
than the 1Y-Y's I have; typical flower diameter 40&nbsp;mm;.

<tr><td><b>Narcissus 'Sunny Side Up'</b> 11aW-Y was moved from the back lawn fall 2009. I got
one bulb in a mixture and tried to get some more, it looks so dramatic, but have never found it in
Canada since, so I'm guarding its offsets - several dozen 2014. Photos on the web show perianth
colours from white to yellow and varying degrees of corona ruffling, so it's probably a seed strain.

<tr><td><b>Oenothera tetragona</b> (O.fruiticosa...), a variable North American native originally
described under at least 6 names now considered subspecies or synonyms, has lots of brilliant
yellow terminal flowers. It spreads fairly fast by stolons, so is best contained by edging. It
flopped in 20% sun, was moved to 60% sun late 2008 and has put on a superb show since.

<tr><td><b>Sedum kamtschaticum</b> (Phedimus kamtschaticus) from northern Asia begins blooming
late May and keeps blooming until completely covered by snow. Most sedum prefer dry full sun, but
this one grows well with as little as 20% sun and is happy with damp soil. It suppresses seed-borne
weeds well but stolon-grasses have to be removed promptly to avoid infestation; flower diameter 14&nbsp;mm; 40-80% sun.

<tr><td><b>Sedum rupestre</b> (S.reflexum, Petrosedum rupestre), native to central and western
Europe, covers the bright corner at the front as a ground cover for small bulbs. It blooms only
briefly and the blooms are almost invisible against the leaves, but it provides a yellow
background throughout the year with a texture that contrasts nicely with the Lysimachia, which

Tulipa species are along the front of the raised portion. Their commercial cultivation began in
the Ottoman Empire, they were introduced to Europe from Turkey in 1554; squirrels and chipmunks
love them so they last only if protected by ground covers or cocoa bean mulch; 60% sun.

                  from 544 to 245 million years ago, and is divided into six
                  periods. These 300 million years of the Paleozoic era realized
                  many critical events in evolution, including the development
                  of most invertebrate groups, life's conquest of land, the evolution
                  of fish, reptiles, insects, and vascular plants, the formation
                  of the supercontinent of Pangea. Fish and fish-like vertebrates
                  arose in the early Paleoozoic and comprise more than half of
                  the diversity of vertebrates that inhabit the world today.
                  Also importantly, there were also no less than two ice ages
                  in the Paleozoic. The Paleozoic was ended by the greatest mass
                  extinction event in geologic history, the Permian/Triassic
                extinction, when some 95% of all marine species met extincttion.</FONT></P>

                rapidly, but that this actually occurred is not a consensus among 
                scientists. Darwin and others once believed that the Cambrian

                that these occur in the earlier Vendian strata.</FONT></P>

                occur well after the earliest complex trace fossils. This suggests

                The lycophytes (Phylum Lycopodiophyta) are the oldest extant lineage 
                of vascular plants e.g., club moss) and gave rise to all descending 
                vascular plants in a major phylogenetic split. The Lycopods that 
                reproduced by way of spores went on to form vast swamp forests 
                during the Carboniferous period with the Lepidodendrales (e.g., 
                Lepidodendron) reaching heights more than 100 feet. Sigillaria 
                is another example of a lycopod tree. The seed-bearing Gymnosperms 
                appeared near the end of the Devonian, an adaptation ultimately 
                leading to propagation to dryer habitats.</FONT></P>

                and bryozoans and single-celled Eukaryotes fusulinids known as 
                fusulinids became abundant. The ray finned fishes radiate enormously. 
                However, the age of the trilobite was drawing to a close. After

                on land really took root in the Carboniferous, setting the stage 
                for huge coal deposits to be formed in low-laying swamps. Common 
                in the coal producing swamps spore bearing Lycopod trees that 
                grew to more than 100 feet tall, Sigillaria and both spore-bearing

                in the Devonian acquire wings, and continue their radiation filling 
                ever-expanding environmental niches. The burial of organically 
                produced carbon is believed to have caused atmosphereic oxygen 
                to increase to concentrations 80% higher than today, and may have, 
                in turn, led to gigantism in some insects and amphibians whose

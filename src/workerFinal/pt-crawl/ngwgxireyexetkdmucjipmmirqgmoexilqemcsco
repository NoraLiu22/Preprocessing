<p>Welcome to Brisbane Insects and Spiders home page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are the Chew's family&nbsp; in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Our interest is to study
the nature. We go to the bush on weekends to watch insects and spiders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not professionals. We recorded and commented on what we found. On the
following pages, we are NOT going to tell you insects and spiders are different
because they have six or eight legs, NOR the butterflies and moths are different
because they have different antennae etc.. Instead, by <a href="../brisbane_insects/index.html">discussions</a>, we try to find out why there are
differences. We try to find out more about <a href="../brisbane_insects/Evolution.htm">Evolution</a>.</p>
<p>Please proceed and look at our works.
Don't forget to give us <a href="http://www.geocities.com/pchew_brisbane/blog.html">comments</a>.
If you have any question about insects or spiders, please <font size="3"> <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">
<a href="mailto:pchew_brisbane@yahoo.com.au">email</a> </span></font>to us and
we will try to find the answer. You may want to check our <a href="FAQ.htm"><b>FAQ</b></a>

  - Mayflies are a group of quite uncommon insects. We did not found many of
  them in Brisbane. They are considered to be
 one of the most primitive insect order. They have large forewing and small to
 absent hind wings. They have large eyes and very short antenna. They can be distinguished
 by their three long abdominal appendages.&nbsp;Their larvae live in fresh
  water. Adults usually live only a few hours, or some species maximum one day
  or two.</dt>

    Damselflies</a>  -<span lang="EN-US"> Damselflies are usually smaller than
    Dragonflies and with slender body. They spend more time to rest and not
    flying in air than the dragonflies. When they are at rest, damselflies
    usually fold up and hold their wings vertically. Damselflies lay their eggs
    in flash water where the larva grow.&nbsp;Larvae need fairly precise habitat
    and sensitive to water pollution. Adult is a predator in the sky and preying
    on flying insects. Larva may spend one to three years in water, depend on
    species, while adults live only a few weeks.</span></dt>

  hind wings and forewings are more or less similar size and shape. When they
  are at rest, dragonflies held out theirs wings horizontally. Dragonflies are
    strong flyer and spend most of the time in air. </span>Their larvae live in
    fresh water. They have very small antennae but very large compound eyes.
    Their mouths are very good at biting.</dt>

    - Not all cockroaches are ugly. Most of them are beautiful insects although

    they have, the wings are membranous with toughened forewings which overlap
    left over right. The head is small and pointing downwards, concealed under
    the pronotum. So sometime their thorax are miss-considered as their big

    Mantids</a>  - Mantids are predators to other insects, with strong forelegs which have
    spines. They have strong mouthparts for chewing. Their eyes are large and
    well apart on each side of their mobile head, so that they can locate precisely
    their prey at close distance. Most mantids sit and wait among the vegetation
    ready to grasp unsuspecting prey by their powerful forelegs. They wait
    motionless with their forelegs together and this gave them their name of

  Flies and mosquitoes are classified in order Diptera, which mean two wings.
  The insects in this order have only one pair of membranous flying wings. The
  second pair of wings are reduced to small knobs, called halteres , for the
  purpose of balancing. Their body is relatively soft and hairy. They have a
  pair of large compound eyes, a pair of very short antennae and a sucking
  mouth. </span>Members in suborder Nematocera are generally primitive flies,
  all with filamentous antenna of 6-14 segment. Usually their bodies and legs
  are elongated, with a relatively long abdomen. Larvae are mostly aquatic.</dt>

    small to large in size. They are usually grey to brown in colours, a few are
    colourful. They have large eyes with reflective iridescent colour. The
    antenna are segmented flagellum. Their mouth is the strong straight

They are active predators on flying insects, unselective in prey species. They even prey on web weaving spiders. Their mouthparts are the triangular proboscis  which insert into prey and suck the juice.
    Most Robust flies are with noticeable "beard" of setae around the face. It is believed that they serve as protection to their face from damage by their prey.</dt>

  Wasps</a>
  <dt>Members in this family are usually small in size. Their larvae are
    parasitic. The host will usually survive when the larvae is still living.
    Until the larvae fully grown, the larvae either pupates inside the dead host
    or form a cocoon outside. Many aphid parasites are braconid and their life
    cycles are similar.</dt>

    All ants are in family Formicidae and all of them have a waist. Their waist
    is composed of one or two knobs which are the first one or two segments of
    their abdomen. Their antennae have a distinct elbow. Ants live in colonies
    made up of several castes. These included the winged male, winged female and
    wingless workers. Ant colonies usually contain: an egg-laying queen and many
    workers together with their brood i.e., eggs, larvae and pupae. Worker ants
    carry out different jobs including nest construction, foraging, looking
    after the brood and queen, and nest defense.</dt>

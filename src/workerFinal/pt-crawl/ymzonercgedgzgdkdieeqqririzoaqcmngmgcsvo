<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The framework acts as a road map for the GBIF Secretariat, Participant nodes, and the wider GBIF community, directing capacity development efforts throughout the strategic period spanning from 2023 to 2027. GBIF aims for—and anticipates—a scaling up of capacity development work within this period. The tools and approaches presented here are adaptable to enable the implementation of this framework in line with the opportunities arising during this period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</a> includes <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targets for 2030</a> that directly address the need to make data, information and knowledge for decision-making available (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target 21</a>), as well as the need for strengthened capacity-building and development, technology transfer, and technical and scientific cooperation (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target 20</a>). In addition, the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a> provides an international framework for open science policy and practice, aiming to “reduce technological and knowledge divides between and within countries.” The recommendation asks UNESCO Member States to invest in infrastructure for open science, as well as training, education, digital literacy and capacity building to support open science. These two instruments provide an important global policy context for expanding capacity development actions through GBIF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF’s capacity development work is framed under two core objectives:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>developing the capacity to mobilize biodiversity data through GBIF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing the capacity to use GBIF-mediated biodiversity data</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF seeks to embed capacity on nested levels from individual, to institutional, national and  regional scales, helping to strengthen the network as a whole. Defined goals and indicators will help GBIF to monitor progress on each level, guiding further implementation. This monitoring, together with ongoing needs assessment processes, periodic evaluation of capacity development programmes and actions, forms the basis of reporting to the community on progress made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wide array of capacity development tools and approaches in use across the GBIF community are broadly categorized as: support for node development through collaboration; capacity development programmes; further development of the community of practice; and training and learning resources. Together, these empower a broad community of experts to contribute to capacity development goals and enable the flow of expertise between the capacity development levels, supporting the necessary scaling up of capacity development work and community growth over the current strategic period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF’s capacity development activities embody its agreed <a href="https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">values</a>, contributing to trust and transparency, collaboration and collective benefit, diversity and inclusiveness, innovation, and integrity.  Embedding these values in capacity development activities ensures that growth in the community engaged through this work builds on the community’s existing strengths that have proven a solid foundation for capacity development to date.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="capacity-development-objectives">
<a class="anchor" href="#capacity-development-objectives"></a>1. Capacity development objectives</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Capacity is broadly defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as “the ability of individuals, institutions, and societies to perform functions, solve problems and set and achieve objectives in a sustainable manner.” Capacity development refers to “the processes whereby people, organizations, and society as a whole unleash, strengthen, create, adapt and maintain capacity over time.” These definitions, widely used in the field of international cooperation, are applicable to GBIF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBIF Strategic Framework 2023-2027</a> sets out the global vision and mission, together with four strategic priority areas to achieve these (see <a href="#box-1">§1.1</a>). Capacity development, while emphasized especially in Priority Area 3,  will contribute to GBIF’s success across all areas of the strategic framework.</p>

<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ability to manage, standardize and publish biodiversity data</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is essential to reducing knowledge gaps and ensuring a stable foundation for data mobilization through the network (Priority Areas 1 and 3). As GBIF evolves and adapts data standards and models (Priority Area 4), further capacity development will be needed to support the uptake of new data publishing methods by its current network, as well as to integrate new data publishing communities. Growing awareness at the policy level of the importance of enhanced access to primary biodiversity data, for example, to support implementation and monitoring of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Priority Area 2), strengthens the justification for developing capacity to mobilize data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Progress towards this objective will be demonstrated in the growth and continued activity of the community of data publishing institutions. Enriching GBIF’s data model will increase the diversity among institutions in the data publishing community. Ultimately, progress will be reflected in the completeness and richness of the data being published.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Institutional capacity for data management varies widely among the different institutions that produce and hold biodiversity data. Capacity varies between different regions of the world and also between different types and sizes of biodiversity-related institutions. Supportive international policy frameworks can strengthen the enabling environment for institutions within and beyond GBIF’s current network to provide open access to their biodiversity data. While data publishing in GBIF is on the institutional level, it depends on the skills and engagement of individuals within the institutions, as well as capacity at the level of the Participant nodes that assist with engagement, provide endorsement, and often offer technical support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a network of networks, Participant-led efforts to promote data mobilization and support the development of institutional capacity within their countries and networks remain essential to allow capacity support to scale towards a truly global network. This necessitates continued support for capacity development within an expanding network of Participant nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Efforts to design and implement capacity development actions that target the levelling-up of institutional capacity in currently under-represented regions and among under-represented data publishing communities should continue to be a priority for the GBIF network. Such efforts should reinforce the capacity of existing Participant nodes—and encourage the development of new nodes—to ensure sustainable capacity support to the growing data publishing network. Regional support teams extend support beyond the nodes network to enable new institutions from non-Participant countries to engage in data mobilization and use, growing the community of practice that forms the foundation for formal Participation in the future.</p>

<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ability to analyse and use biodiversity data accessible through GBIF in scientific research and decision-making</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the current strategic period, GBIF focuses on increasing the relevance and diversifying the uptake of GBIF-mediated data for scientific research (Priority Area 1). This requires capacity development through partnerships with academia and higher education, including thematic research communities with limited previous knowledge of GBIF. In addition, GBIF seeks to develop the capacity to use data to support policy responses addressing societal challenges around planetary change. This includes contributing to local, national, regional and global biodiversity-related goals and indicators, and partnering to support the application of data in policy-relevant information tools and products (Priority Area 2).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Progress towards this objective will be seen in the breadth and representativeness of the growing body of scientific literature that cites the use of GBIF-mediated data. GBIF maintains an ongoing literature tracking programme, which identifies research uses and citations, and groups these into thematic research areas. Literature tracking can highlight geographic gaps and targets for development in GBIF’s research user communities. These research uses ultimately depend on capacity at the level of individual scientists and students involved, but are greatly facilitated by the development of methodologies and norms for using open biodiversity data within a research field and the academic institutions involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Progress in capacity to use GBIF-mediated data for policy objectives may be tracked through examples of uptake in national policy reports, regulations and indicators, including those provided for implementation of global biodiversity-related conventions, although this is likely to be less quantitative than metrics from research citations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on thematic priorities, as GBIF works more closely with research communities to develop areas of scientific relevance for open biodiversity data (such as in human health, freshwater ecology, and soil biodiversity, among others), capacity development actions should target the development of necessary skills at the level of students and researchers. Such actions should also address the known geographic gaps in the user community, and serve to promote more global engagement of users in line with GBIF’s global scope and vision. While guidance and training materials on accessing GBIF mediated data for a variety of use cases are available, it is beyond GBIF’s scope to provide training in all the underlying data literacy skills needed for research use of open biodiversity data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Participant nodes support user communities through a variety of capacity development actions, often in direct partnership with academic institutions that use GBIF within teaching at various levels. Nodes also play a role in supporting data flows into biodiversity-related reporting processes and other decisions. Capacity development actions to support the nodes in their role in coordinating national networks and engaging with user communities both at the research and policy levels will continue to help with the scalability of approaches.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-levels">
<a class="anchor" href="#implementation-levels"></a>2. Implementation levels and progress monitoring</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Capacity development actions are implemented on multiple levels in the GBIF network and involve a broad community of individuals. <a href="https://www.wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Communities of practice</a> have been defined by sociologists Wegner and Trayner as “groups of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.” This document will refer to the GBIF community of practice as an inclusive term for the many practitioners engaged in activities contributing to GBIF’s mission who collaborate and learn from each other, often through activities such as mentoring, training, translation, and promoting open biodiversity data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Capacity development actions can be led by volunteers in the community of practice, participating institutions, the Participant nodes, and  GBIF Secretariat, and are often implemented through partnerships bridging these groups. Capacity development is frequently combined with outreach and engagement work, contributing to expanding the GBIF network. This framework is, therefore, an essential component of GBIF’s evolving participation and engagement strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Evaluation is integral to capacity development, and should involve and inform all stakeholders in a transparent way to enable them to guide future action and fully benefit from progress. In addition to ongoing monitoring, all the capacity development approaches that GBIF employs will include plans for periodic evaluation, as well as their own set of delivery indicators to track progress towards achieving specific outcomes, enabling the results to inform planning of future implementation. These evaluation processes will be necessarily specific to the programmes or actions they target, their goals, and the stakeholders involved, and are therefore not described in detail in this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This framework describes overarching goals for capacity development on the main implementation levels that GBIF targets: the individual, institutional, national, and regional levels. It further outlines monitoring indicators associated with each capacity development level that can help track overall progress and guide further implementation.</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to strengthen and grow GBIF’s community of practice: individuals with the skills, knowledge, and motivation to share and reuse biodiversity data for research, conservation and sustainable development, and to support others participating in the community.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF community of practice has emerged from the global network of biodiversity practitioners driven by their willingness to collaborate, share knowledge, tools, and standards, and support each other in progressing towards the common goal of open biodiversity data contributing to research, nature conservation, and sustainable development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat and Participant nodes have a role in supporting interactions within the community of practice and encouraging its development and growth. Key components of  this are ensuring that there are open opportunities and transparent processes for members of the community to contribute to GBIF’s capacity development actions on all scales; that collaboration is central in these approaches; and that contributions are made visible for appropriate recognition and attribution.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring progress</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The community, comprising all individuals globally active in sharing and reusing data through GBIF and sharing their skills with others, is much larger than GBIF can feasibly track. The following metrics can help to demonstrate growth in the community in specific areas:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tracking <strong>participation in GBIF’s volunteer community</strong>, comprising mentors, trainers, translators, reviewers and biodiversity open data ambassadors, will help track strong involvement from individuals in helping to expand our community of practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF tracks <strong>participation in training courses</strong>. This can include skills certification in the form of digital badges for some courses. Tracking the growth in individuals having participated in courses as well as those having attained formal certification are useful metrics to show skills development across the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the literature tracking process, GBIF tracks the number and country affiliation of <strong>authors involved in articles citing the use of GBIF-mediated data</strong>. This metric is helpful in demonstrating the growth of individual and institutional capacity within the use of GBIF-mediated data in research, including the geographic distribution of the user community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These metrics will be regularly reviewed in terms of overall growth, as well as geographic spread, to help guide capacity development into under-represented communities and areas.</p>

<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to build partnerships that drive the institutionalization of biodiversity data mobilization and the appropriate use of GBIF-mediated data within a global network of institutions, including academia, natural history collections, research institutions, national government departments and agencies, non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations, among others.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data is published to GBIF through registered institutions, not directly from individuals. Individual researchers may publish datasets through the institutions with which they are affiliated, or via journals to which they contribute. Observations from individuals are submitted through networks registered as GBIF data publishers. An important focus of capacity development must therefore be at the institutional level, ensuring that organizations have the means and motivation to mobilize data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Focusing on the institutional level is important, not only for scalability, but also in order to build persistent engagement and practices that span across multiple departments and individuals within the organization or agency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A growing number of formal academic higher education programmes now encourage the mobilization and use of GBIF-mediated data: see, for example, <a href="https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/projects/biodata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioData</a>, <a href="https://www.gbif.org/article/6Oaud6tpLOAm8wQMGqkkSi/ecoed-cohesive-training-and-skill-development-for-ecosciences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecoEd</a> and <a href="https://www.gbif.org/article/aA0MjVddRiRFOX2SEs7mT/promoting-gbif-data-use-through-a-graduate-degree-programme-in-biodiversity-informatics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benin international Masters in Biodiversity Informatics</a>. These and other examples demonstrate how capacity at the institutional level can cascade to developing the capacity of students to use and publish biodiversity data in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Monitoring progress</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tracking growth in the number of institutions that are registered and endorsed as data publishers is relatively easy and can give an indication of growth in institutional capacity to mobilize data through GBIF.  It is much harder to track the institutionalization of data use. GBIF documents guiding examples of the use of GBIF-mediated data in academic teaching but could consider developing new mechanisms to track and evaluate this type of capacity, such as tracking the development of curricula that include content on data mobilization and use through GBIF. Better engagement with capacity development within academic institutions would be greatly valuable for achieving the goals of this framework, but is beyond the scope of what can be tracked at present.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following metrics can help to demonstrate development of institutional capacity:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of <strong>data publishing institutions with at least one dataset</strong> is easily tracked in GBIF and helps show where there is capacity at the institutional level for data publishing, noting that in many cases, nodes are supporting this capacity, for example by hosting datasets on national platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring the number of <strong>institutions with affiliated authors of literature citing the use of GBIF-mediated data</strong> will give some indication of where there is institutional capacity to use GBIF-mediated data.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#national-level"></a>2.3. National-level capacity development</h3>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to develop national biodiversity information facilities that provide the coordination and enabling environment for data publishing and use at the national level, and are the core of GBIF’s governance and participation model.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF supports the development of national biodiversity information facilities as collaborative networks of people and institutions that collectively form infrastructure for delivering biodiversity information to relevant stakeholders. This work often begins with engagement and capacity development at the institutional level, with a view to working with institutional partners to encourage formal national Participation in GBIF and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-z79c-sa53" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishment of a Participant node</a> through a participatory approach as a means to ensure government level awareness and support for biodiversity data mobilization and use through GBIF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When formally joining GBIF through signature of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.15468/doc.ajz7-qt28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBIF Memorandum of Understanding</a> (MOU), countries agree to establish a Participant node—that is, a team designated to coordinate a network of people and institutions that produces, manages and uses biodiversity data and collectively builds a national infrastructure for delivering biodiversity information. The allocation of resources to the node is the responsibility of the participating country and is independent of GBIF’s core budget. Nodes are supported by organizational arrangements and informatics solutions and work to improve the availability and usefulness of biodiversity data for research, policy and decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nodes vary greatly across the network, with a range of different hosting institutions and contacts, scales of operation and available budgets. Developing capacity at the node level, and continuing to lower the technical threshold for active participation in GBIF as global infrastructure, is critical for GBIF’s scalability. Nodes need to provide a stable foundation for data mobilization and use within the expanding network and for the benefit of GBIF as a whole. To achieve this, nodes themselves need to have the capacity to perform the functions expected of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Monitoring progress</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monitoring the fluctuation in the number of formal Participants in GBIF, as well as the establishment of new Participant nodes, helps inform the development of national capacity in the network. Maintaining active nodes and Participants is also a key focus for this framework. GBIF also provides a <a href="https://www.gbif.org/tool/6Y2SqK8XokHUqIFUn6TLxX/online-capacity-self-assessment-tool-for-national-biodiversity-information-facilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacity self assessment tool</a> to support nodes in monitoring their own capacity development over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF monitors the <strong>density of active data publishing institutions</strong> across all countries/economies, regardless of their Participation status, which can help demonstrate where capacity development is contributing to greater engagement of institutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tracking <strong>demonstrated activity from national nodes</strong> (monitored on an annual basis) in the following areas also helps to identify countries that may be at risk of disengagement due to low capacity or engagement:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participation of the node (or node staff) in key GBIF-related events and activities</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#regional-level"></a>2.4. Regional-level capacity development</h3>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to develop the capacity to coordinate and raise the visibility of the GBIF community of practice and network on the regional level so that it can expand engagement on all other levels, and ultimately support GBIF in engaging in the regional-level biodiversity agenda.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF’s nodes committee established <a href="https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six regional sub-committees</a> recognizing the importance of strengthening collaboration and exchange between nodes on the regional level. These regional groupings can reflect alignment in priorities and languages, and, in some cases, regional biodiversity policies or agendas and working culture and norms. On the practical level, regional meetings simplify engagement by reducing travel distances and time zone differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to recognize that the regions vary greatly in terms of the density of data available and published through GBIF, the level of use of GBIF-mediated data, and the number of GBIF Participants. GBIF implements capacity programmes targeting under-represented regions that contribute to developing the capacity at all levels and engaging new GBIF Participants via a regional approach. It is also important to note that capacity varies greatly within regions, such that capacity development actions on the regional level can enable stronger nodes to support less experienced ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Distributed GBIF regional support teams provide capacity support on the regional level, working in close alignment with the Participant nodes and volunteers. These teams are made up of part-time contractors based in the regions they serve. They focus their efforts on providing support in countries where GBIF does not yet have Participant nodes. Their work covers engaging data holding institutions, supporting data publishing, developing skills and engagement within the community of practice and providing feedback to GBIF on regional capacity needs. They can also provide training and support to nodes within the region upon request. Their work is aligned with GBIF’s work programmes and recommendations provided by the GBIF regional representatives.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF has run various capacity development programmes since its inception, with the scale and scope of these programmes expanding over time. These programmes are centred around open calls for proposals and combine other capacity development activities, such as training workshops and webinars. Implementation is supported by the GBIF community of practice and Participant nodes that assist in promoting the calls, reviewing applications, providing mentoring and training support, and often partnering in projects. The role and types of programmes currently in use are described in table 2.</p>

<p>This framework updates the 2015 <a href="https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-qpxw-n868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBIF Capacity Enhancement Framework</a> and serves as an inclusive guide for GBIF’s capacity development action over the five years of the Strategic Framework 2023-2027. Capacity development plays an essential role in GBIF, and this framework sets out adaptable tools, approaches and indicators to enable us to scale our activities to meet emerging opportunities and keep track of their impact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat will apply this framework in its continuing efforts to support node development through collaboration, to design and implement capacity development programmes, to support the community of practice, and to roll out the training strategy and associated learning resources. Participant nodes and other partners are encouraged to use this framework when designing capacity enhancement activities, both within their own context and when defining collaborations with external partners. Potential partners are encouraged to evaluate how the approach described in this framework could align with their priorities and principles, when considering potential capacity enhancement collaboration with the GBIF network. The Community and Capacity team at the GBIF Secretariat is available to provide further information on this framework, how to put it into practice and potential avenues for collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This framework is shared as a living digital document open for comment and suggested revisions from the GBIF community at any time. This framework will be reviewed for the next strategic planning period starting 2027.</p>

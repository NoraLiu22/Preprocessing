        </font> </b> Chuckawalla <i>(Sauromalus obesus</i>). Desert regions ranging 
        from southwestern Utah, southern Nevada, western Arizona, Mojave and Sonoran 
        deserts, and Baja California. The chuckawalla prefers the rockier elevations 
        (up to 4500 ft) though they are also common in lower elevations. As with 
        other diurnal lizards, they may be found sunning on exposed boulders or 
        rocks; several of them may be found basking together.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The name chuckawalla 
        (or chuckwalla) is derived from the Shoshone word &quot;tcaxxwal&quot; 
        or &quot;caxwal,&quot; the form used by the Cahuilla Indians of southeastern 
        California and originally written in Spanish as &quot;chacahuala.&quot;

        dorsalis</i>). Desert regions ranging from southern Nevada, western Arizona, 
        east-central California, down into Baja California, and Sonora and Sinaloa 
        in Mexico. In the Mojave and Sonoran deserts, this lizard is found in 
        the sandy flats and hummocks typical of the creosote woodlands. The desert 
        iguana is often found in the vicinity of creosote bushes, which provide 
        food and shelter and the burrows of kangaroo rates, used by the iguanas 
        to hide from predators. The burrow are also used to avoid the the hottest 
        part of the hot desert days.</font></p>

        U.S. lizard (the <a href="http://biopark.org/lizards.html">gila monster</a>, 
        <i>Heloderma horridum</i>, being the largest). Their chunky body (its 
        former species name was aptly obesus = obese) is about equal in SVL to 
        their tail length. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The desert iguanas reaches 
        about 16 inches (40 cm) STL, with their SVL at about 4-5 inches (10-12.7 
        cm). While it has the same overall body and head shape as the chuckawalla, 
        desert iguanas are less massy overall, with a finer head.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Cage Setup</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As these are desert lizards, 
        they require a desert environment. A large enclosure (100 gallon or larger) 
        is ideal. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Clean playground sand 
        (available in 50 lb bags at hardware stores) makes an appropriate substrate 
        when poured to a depth of 3 inches. The sand can be mixed with larger 
        rock particles, such as clean gravel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Flat rock for climbing 
        basking; cholla cactus skeleton or other structure for climbing on or 
        hiding under help vary the habitat and create microenvironments. At least 
        one hiding area should be placed in the cool end of the enclose, and one 
        in the warm. It is not unusual to find diurnal desert species hunkered 
        down in a cooler burrow, cave or deep rocky crevice during the hottest 
        part of the day. Provide such areas for your lizards to enable them to 
        behaviorally thermoregulate as they would in the wild, which will ultimately 
        reduce the total load of stress related to being in captivity. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When using rocks or 
        other heavy objects, place them directly on the enclosure floor, building 
        the sandy/gravelly substrate up around them. Use aquarium silicone cement 
        to glue the different rocks used to create mounds or caves together. Securing 
        them in these ways will help ensure your lizard does not become mush if 
        any of the structures collapse on them when the lizards burrow under the 
        sand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Place a small dish of 
        water in the coolest corner. Desert animals are adept at finding and exploiting 
        water resources, so the chuckawalla and desert iguana will soon learn 
        what that bowl of water is for. Since they cannot tell you when they are 
        thirsty, keep the bowl in there all the time. Placing the bowl on the 
        cool side of the enclosure will help keep the overall humidity down.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/cgi_bin/topics.cgi?earl=plant_profile.cgi&symbol=LATR2&photoID=latr2_1h.jpg">creosote 
        bush</a> (also known as chaparral, and greasewood) plays an important 
        roe in the desert iguana life. They eat the leaves and flowers, and burrow 
        around the roots and rocks around the base of the plant for shelter and 
        to avoid predators. You may be able to find seedlings for sale at plant 
        nurseries, especially ones specializing in native flora. Since they require 
        a rather damp rooting medium, it would be best to set the potted creosotes 
        into the sand and cover with a layer of gravel or rock both to keep the 
        damp in the pot and providing some support when the lizards come to eat.

        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Coming from 
        similar environments and exploiting the same microhabitats, they both 
        require a thermal gradient ranging from the low 80s F(26 C) on cool side 
        up to 100 F (37 C) on the warm side. In addition, they require a basking 
        area of up to 110 F (46 C) to enable them to reach their preferred body 
        temperature.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">At night, the basking 
        area is shut off, and the thermal gradient is allowed to drop to the 60-high 
        70s F (15.6-25 C). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">At night, you will probably 
        need to use an appropriate nonwhite light producing heat source to be 
        able to provide the nighttime thermal gradient they require. Options include 
        a nocturnal reptile light or a ceramic heating element.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Note that herbivorous 
        lizards' digestive systems start optimum working at 88-90 F, so having 
        the proper thermal gradient established will enable them to thermoregulate 
        to attain and maintain the temperatures they need day and night.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Do not guess at the 
        temperatures - use thermometers or other temperature reading devices to 
        regularly monitor the warm and cool end day and night, and the basking 
        area temperatures during the day.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Lighting<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">High 
        need for UV lighting. Use two UVB-producing fluorescents, 
        such as the Durotest Vita-Lite (the Powertwists provide 
        more UV than their regular smooth tubes) or Zoo Med Reptile 
        light (5.0+). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The UV-producing lights, 
        as well as the daytime white light/basking lamps should be placed on a 
        timer with a 12-14 hours on, 10-12 hours off schedule.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">UVB disperses quite 
        rapidly requiring that these fixtures - with their lights not filtered 
        through glass, plastic or dense mesh - be installed no farther than 12&quot; 
        from the lizard. The UVB-tube should extend across the enclosure, with 
        the basking lamp mounted close enough to it in the warm end so that basking 
        lizards get both the heat and UVB exposure.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Diet<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Various sources 
        disagree. Many of the ones that point towards any omnivory are, for the 
        most part, based on the personal accounts by those who keep these species 
        in captivity. Since I first developed this article in 1996, wherein I 
        wrote:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chuckwallas: </b><br>
        &nbsp;Slightly omnivorous. Leafy dark greens (collards, mustards, dandelions, 
        escarole, parsley, grasses (pesticide free!), shredded green and orange 
        vegetables, soft fruits, flowers such as hibiscus, roses, dandelions, 
        nasturtium, geranium (leaves and flower heads). Cactus pads (trimmed) 
        and prickly pear. Insects (worms, crickets) and, for larger lizards, mouse 
        pinks, provide occasional animal-based protein.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Desert Iguanas:<br>
        </b>Herbivorous. Leafy dark greens (collards, mustards, dandelions, escarole, 
        parsley, grasses (pesticide free!), shredded green and orange vegetables, 
        soft fruits, flowers such as hibiscus, roses, dandelions, nasturtium, 
        geranium (leaves and flower heads). Cactus pads (trimmed) and prickly 
        pear. Supplement with multivitamin and calcium supplement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">I have come to another 
        conclusion, based in large part upon what I have learned about the misinformation 
        that self-perpetuated itself through the years about <a href="iguana/index.html">green 
        iguanas</a>, and the research of <a href="iverson.html">John Iverson</a> 
        and others who have spent years studying iguanines. Trained observations 
        of wild desert iguanas and chuckawallas, as well as analysis of gut contents 
        and structure of their colon, all point to these lizards being completely 
        herbivorous at all life stages. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">However, it has been 
        reported by some desert iguana keepers that, when coming out of hibernation, 
        their lizards seem to require some crickets to get them interested again 
        in eating their plant food. This doesn't necessarily make them omnivores 
        as stress-induced behavior (and make no mistake about it: captivity is 
        stressful, no matter how good the conditions of captivity) does not make 
        that behavior &quot;normal&quot;. It may mean that, in order to get a 
        quick burst of energy, these most northern of the desert/tropical iguanids 
        consume small amounts of animal matter, moving back to a strictly herbivorous 
        diet a week or so out of hibernation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If anyone has research 
        which documents omnivory, or any ontologenetic shift from carnivory or 
        omnivory to herbivory, in wild populations (which does not include lizards 
        lounging around tourist spots), I would be very interested in a copy of 
        the article(s) or its citation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the problems 
        associated with captive herbivorous reptiles getting sufficient calcium 
        and manufacturing enough D3, the importance of properly installed UVB-producing 
        lights in conjunction with feeding a healthy diet, and supplementing with 
        multivitamin and calcium (especially females who may become gravid), cannot 
        be stressed enough.</font></p>

        </font></b><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The chests, 
        heads and limbs of the common chuckawalla males are generally black, flecked 
        or spotted with gray. The rest of their body is red or light gray, depending 
        on age and local, and the tail, yellow. Females tend to retain their juvenile 
        banding. Young chucks are crossbanded around the body and tail, with the 
        bands on the tail being most conspicuous. In Utah, all adults are banded. 
        The male western chuckawallas have more uniformly colored crossbands and 
        adult male body color is often suffused with red. Breeding is in April-May, 
        with clutches of 5-16 eggs laid in June-July.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Desert Iguanas:</b><br>
        There is little in the way of sexual dimorphism in desert iguanas. Both 
        get pinkish to buff patches on their sides when in breeding season. Sexually 
        mature males will have the enlarged hemipenal bulge at the base of the 
        tail. Breeding is in April-June, with clutches of 2-8 eggs laid a month 
        or so later, hatchlings emerging in July-August. Desert iguanas may double 
        clutch.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Both:</b><br>
        Generally speaking, the lizards dig tunnels in which they lay their eggs. 
        Hatchlings are 3-4 inches (7.-10 cm).</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Hibernation<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As winter 
        sets in and temperatures become too low and food sources are greatly reduced 
        in availability, desert reptiles head into a hibernaculum to hibernate 
        (or brumate) through the coldest winter months. Just as being too hot 
        can ultimately be lethal, so can being too cold, so care must be taken 
        when altering the reptile's environment to promote a period of hibernation 
        or brumation</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In general, desert lizards 
        can withstand enclosure temperatures down to 50-55 F (10-12.8 C). If the 
        ambient room air temperature in which the enclosure is kept falls below 
        this temperature, supplemental heating to must be provided to ensure that 
        temperatures do not fall below this level. Hibernation starts somewhere 
        in November and may extend through February/March.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">To ensure that the lizard 
        does not enter the period of low temperatures with food still in its digestive 
        system, the lizards should not be allowed to enter into hibernation/brumation 
        after eating their usual amount of food. While wild chucks and desert 
        iguanas have been found with some digesta still in their proximal colon, 
        care must be taken that the gut isn't full as, during the prolonged period 
        of cold temperatures, the gut activity slows to a stop, but decomposition 
        of the food may occur. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The change in season 
        can be artificially provided by the gradual lowering of the hot temperatures 
        of &quot;summer&quot;, in combination with increasing the length of the 
        night period and decreasing the day length, during the fall and early 
        winter. Make sure they have water available during this time. Begin increasing 
        day length and increasing temperatures as day length and temperatures 
        begin to rise in the late winter/early spring. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">It is not known how 
        biologically important it is for chuckawallas and desert iguanas to hibernate/brumate 
        during the winter. Not undergoing an annual hibernation/brumation may 
        ultimately have no effect that could result in early death or disease. 
        Or, it might. It may or may not have any bearing on whether the hormonal 
        changes associated with breeding season and mating will be triggered appropriately 
        or not.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Have fresh water available 
        for the lizard and the normal temperatures and day length ready to go 
        for when the lizard emerges from hibernation. It is not unusual for them 
        to be a bit sluggish for a couple of days, as their metabolism and other 
        systems adjust to the change. Offer fresh food as well, once they are 
        out, replacing it daily if not eaten. If they haven't started to eat by 
        the third day or so, try offering a pungent herb or, if available, creosote 
        leaves. This may act to stimulate feeding.</font></p>

        predators by entering a rocky crevice and taking a deep breath, bloating 
        their body size, effectively wedging themselves in the space, making it

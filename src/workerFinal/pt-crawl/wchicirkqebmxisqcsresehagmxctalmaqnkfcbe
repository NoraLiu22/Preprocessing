    <div class="subTitleBanner">The Approach of War</div>
    <br />
    Before the war, there was an Equipment Department and a Station Design and 
    Installation Department. S.D. &amp; I.D. was based in London, under Mr. B. 
    N. MacLarty, and it was responsible for the planning, design and installation 
    of transmitters and also for the wiring and power supplies in studio premises. 
    <br />
    <br />
    The more technical aspects of the L.F. side of broadcasting were the responsibility 
    of Equipment Department, which had a workshop that made the items (since at 
    that time one could not purchase commercial equipment that was of a sufficiently 
    high standard), and a small Designs Section under Mr. Colborn with about six 
    engineers. Broadcasting House and the studios, as far as the lighting, heating 
    and electrical cabling were concerned, were therefore the responsibility of 
    SD&amp; ID, but the technical equipment, microphones, amplifiers, switching 
    and control room, and studio cubicle equipment, were the responsibility of 
    Mr. Colborn's Designs Section.<br />
    <br />
    Up to 1938, most of our regional premises, and Broadcasting House of course, 
    were equipped with apparatus operating from batteries charged by mains-driven 
    generators. The only mains operated studios were Bangor - a small studio centre 
    with a control room operating from the mains via a large H.T. rectifier, supplied 
    in duplicate, and L.T. rectifiers operated from two large transformers - and 
    Maida Vale, which operated in a similar way. In addition there was the training 
    school premises in Duchess Street which had a small control room and studios.<br />
    <br />
    After the Munich crisis in 1938, steps were taken to devise an emergency control 
    room in the basement of Broadcasting House, the original control room on the 
    eighth floor clearly being vulnerable to bomb attacks. <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="lg_pics/woodnortonhall.jpg" width="450" height="255" alt="Wood Norton Hall" title="Wood Norton Hall" /></div>
    <br />
    In April 1939 the BBC bought Wood Norton Hall (seen here in 1960), near Evesham 
    in Worcestershire and once the home of an exiled Duc d'Orleans. These premises 
    were very secret; few people knew where they were - such knowledge must, I 
    think, have been restricted to about a dozen people. We called it &quot;Hogsnorton&quot; 
    after the mythical village created by the comedian Gillie Potter.<br />
    <br />
    <a id="apm1" name="apm1"></a>As far as Equipment Department at Avenue House 
    was concerned, Mr. C. H. Colborn and Mr. Lock, who was Mr. Colborn's chief 
    assistant designer, designed some rack-mounted OBA/8 amplifiers, called APM/1s 
    (Amplifier Programme Meter). The OBA/8 amplifier, used for Outside Broadcasts, 
    was a very versatile microphone-to-line-level amplifier with a main control 
    on it. It had a four-channel mixer, the MX/18, associated with it. The new 
    design made these into rack-mounted units, providing a single output for feeding 
    to line and a monitoring output for feeding headphones. In order to make these 
    usable in a control room, we needed some trap-valve amplifiers, and new designs, 
    TV/17 and TV/18, were devised for the purpose. This equipment had been through 
    the drawing office, it was being made but only a very small number, if any, 
    had actually been delivered in the summer of 1939.<br />
    <br />
    During August 1939 two or three of the Designs Section engineers were up at 
    Broadcasting House with Equipment Department workshop staff working very hard 
    and speedily to erect the temporary emergency control room. This was very 
    tiny in area, I think about fifteen feet wide by twenty feet long, in what 
    was, I believe, the fireman's room, next to the gallery of studio BA.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="lg_pics/huts.jpg" width="450" height="312" alt="Huts" title="Huts" /></div>
    At Wood Norton, Building Department had done a certain amount of work; they 
    had erected about a dozen huts some of which were to house stores and workshop 
    equipment, because Wood Norton was also to be the wartime home of Equipment 
    Department. One of the huts had been equipped as a workshop, with lathes, 
    drilling machines, etc, and another as a technical store filled with raw material, 
    and these facilities were to prove invaluable in the next few months. In the 
    control room, a false floor had been put down, a Post Office distribution 
    frame had been erected and some Post Office cables laid, but it was otherwise 
    in no fit state to do any broadcasting at all.<br />
    <br />
    We were then going through the usual, very long-term, motions of schedules, 
    drawings, collection of information for the installation, and the APM/1s, 
    TV/17s and TV/18s, with apparatus bays, were all on order and were not scheduled 
    for delivery for some months. <br />
    <br />
    As I mentioned just now, one of the mains-operated control rooms was in the 
    Training School premises in Duchess Street. These premises had, I think, three 
    studios, a small control room of four bays and a small, six-channel, dramatic 
    control panel. This, looked at in its entirety, formed a complete broadcasting 
    unit and, on the Friday before war broke out (25th August 1939) Mr. Colborn 
    came to me in some considerable haste, and it was unusual to see him hurrying, 
    before lunch and asked me how long I thought it would take to remove the equipment 
    at Duchess Street and re-install it in a secret place. <br />
    <br />
    Now at that time we usually took about three months to install that sort of 
    equipment, and that was provided we had all the drawings, plans, etc. ready. 
    I said I thought that, with unlimited labour, we might be able to get it done 
    in a month. Mr. Colborn went away, again in rather a hurry. After lunch, he 
    came running back to me and said, &quot;You must do this as soon as you can.&quot; 
    <br />
    <br />
    Equipment Department did not have a very large staff at that time and I found 
    that almost all the manual workshop staff, mechanics and wiremen, were away 
    doing emergency work in Broadcasting House and other places and that likewise 
    most of the engineers had disappeared from their offices, presumably on special 
    duties.<br />
    <br />
    However, I found one engineer, Mr. Petrie, to assist in the dismantling of 
    the equipment together with a wireman, a gardener and a general handyman. 
    I then contracted two further wiremen from the Broadcasting House work and 
    commandeered a large pantechnicon and driver from the garage at Avenue House.<br />
    <br />
    We went that very afternoon to Duchess Street and started dismantling the 
    control room and studios. We worked until l0 p.m. when I and the wiremen went 
    home to sleep and left the engineer with the gardener and handyman to work 
    through the night, dismantling the equipment. <br />
    <br />
    <div class="subTitleBanner">Off to Wood Norton</div>
    <br />
    At 8 am the next morning we loaded the pantechnicon and set off for &quot;Hogsnorton.&quot; 
    I was on a motorbike and the two wiremen were in a car. The senior wireman 
    was the only one of us who knew the exact location of Wood Norton as he had 
    been there in great secrecy to connect up a temporary installation in Steward's 
    House. This consisted of OB equipment to provide three small studios, a tiny 
    control room in the pantry, and lines to Evesham telephone exchange.<br />
    <br />
    We got there at 3.15 p.m. and for the next week we worked all the hours that 
    there were - we didn't move out of Wood Norton and we slept on the floor of 
    the control room. One must remember in this connection that it was not just 
    a matter of putting a mains lead on to this equipment. Eight bays of equipment 
    had to be erected and wired. The L.T. Rectifiers and the two mains transformers 
    had to be installed down in the cellar and heavy, lead-covered 7/.036 twin 
    filament cables had to run from each rectifier back to each amplifier. These 
    were not just soldered on; they had to be put on by lugs and with a blow-lamp, 
    so it was no easy matter to terminate this sort of run of heavy lead-covered 
    cabling. Similarly, all the H.T. leads were of single .036 lead-covered cable, 
    and of course, 1-pr./10 was used for most of the programme circuits. <br />
    <br />
    It may be of interest to realise that, until Wood Norton, the BBC always used 
    single 1-pr./10 lead covered cable for all programme circuits, but when we 
    came to install the Wood Norton control room, this cable was in rather short 
    supply and, in order to cable the distribution frame to the jackfield we used, 
    for feeding all the lines, a piece of 38-pair cable. This, to my knowledge, 
    was the first time that a multicore cable had been used inside any BBC premises.<br />
    <br />
    We were fortunate, in this instance, in having Mr. John Holmes, of BBC Lines 
    Department, around the place, who told us how to connect up this quadded cable. 
    I remember discussions taking place between myself, Mr. Holmes and Mr. Reggie 
    Patrick (Assistant Engineer in Charge to Bruce Purslow), in which, although 
    the BBC had always used individual lengths of 1pr./10 lead covered cable for 
    all programme circuits, since a multicore 38-pair cable had been used by the 
    Post Office from Evesham Exchange to Wood Norton there seemed to be no reason 
    why we should not use this type of cable inside BBC premises provided it was 
    balanced at both ends. This we did, the cable being provided by the goodness 
    and courtesy of the Evesham P.O. I remember that from that day we used multicore 
    cable increasingly in the Wood Norton installation, particularly for feeding 
    programmes that we now refer to as 'ring-main' programmes.<br />
    <br />
    For the main control position we used a large equipment cabinet from the training 
    school, about 8' high and about 2'6&quot; x 2'6&quot;, which we tipped on 
    its side. The whole exercise was a very &quot;make-do-and-mend&quot; effort, 
    and we put the dramatic control unit out of Duchess Street on top of this 
    cabinet - this was the main control position! However, by Tuesday 5th September, 
    we could have put out a programme from our lashed-up microphone on to the 
    Post Office cables that were then terminated in the control room. From then 
    on, we gradually tidied up the equipment and scrounged more - fortunately 
    we had access to the wartime Avenue House emergency store hut, which was full 
    of all sorts of devices, mostly raw materials, such as steel, brass, cable, 
    wire, resistance wire, and we had the emergency workshops, so we had no bother 
    on that side. Equipment gradually became available, and by November we began 
    to receive the real wartime TV/17s, TV/18s and the rack-mounted APM/1s that 
    had originally been ordered for installation at Wood Norton. As these became 
    available, they were installed, and we slowly developed a comprehensive control 
    and studio equipment.<br />
    <br />
    A master clock was set up and adjusted on the control room wall. This was 
    a pendulum clock normally adjusted by the manufacturer by the addition of 
    tiny pieces of &quot;silver paper&quot; on the pendulum to get its effective 
    length exactly right for accurate time keeping - no crystal controlled clocks 
    or watches that we now take for granted!<br />
    <a name="blattner"></a><br />
    Facilities were also arranged for recording programmes. In the early 30's 
    the first sound recording equipment consisted of a large machine, known as 
    the Blattnerphone, with reels about 2ft in diameter holding a little over 
    a mile of steel tape capable of recording about 30 minutes of programme. These

      <div class="sideBoxLink"><a href="../tapes/blattner.htm">See here for a 
        description of the Blattnerphone and Marconi-Stille machines.</a></div>
    </div>
    machines were later developed as the Marconi-Stille - an apparatus about the 
    size of a sideboard still using the large reels of steel tape. The original 
    machine found its way into a &quot;museum&quot; in Equipment Department.<br />
    <br />
    In August 1939 Reggie Patrick, who had been involved in the installation and 
    development of the original machine in Broadcasting House, was working in 
    Equipment. He &quot;disappeared&quot; from his office in August and, in fact, 
    had taken the recording machine out of the museum and was trying to get it 
    operational at Wood Norton. This he succeeded in doing and, in fact, managed 
    to make a recording of the Prime Minister's declaration of war. <br />

        <div class="w400">The interior of the first mobile recording van, M53,

          with facilities for levelling the turntables, and associated amplifiers 
          operating from a 24 volt battery.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    The first mobile recording van, M53, a 30cwt Morris equipped a pair of MSS 
    disc recording equipment was sent to Wood Norton and as the months passed 
    more recording equipment of all types then available was obtained from British 
    and American sources and installed there to provide two tape channels, three 
    disc channels and one Philips-Miller film channel.<br />
    <br />
    From Sept 1939 the studios were in frequent use for Music, Schools Programmes, 
    Features and Drama, these Departments having moved to Wood Norton in the first 
    few days of the war, although they were later to move to Bristol, Bangor and 
    Bedford.<br />
    <br />
    The permanent equipment continued to be installed as it became available in 
    early 1940 and Wood Norton became one of the largest broadcasting centres 
    in Europe. According to Mr. B. Cox's 'History of Wood Norton' it was producing 
    at its peak an output averaging 1300 programme items per week or about 835 
    hours of Broadcasting, most of it for various overseas services. News Agency 
    information was provided by teleprinters associated with Press Association, 
    British United Press, Exchange Telegraph and Reuters.<br />
    <br />
    Other communication facilities included private lines to various Government 
    Departments and to Fighter Command Main and Reserve RAF Headquarters. This 
    was to receive instructions to close down various transmitters if required 
    to prevent the Luftwaffe using BBC transmitters as direction finding aids 
    on their air raids. <br />
    <br />
    <div class="subTitleBanner">Life at Wood Norton</div>
    <br />
    Wood Norton was a very secret place, no mention of it was made in any local 
    or National paper and particularly no mention of the BBC.<br />
    <br />
    No sleeping accommodation was available on the site, all the BBC staff were 
    billeted in and around Evesham for which the people on whom they were billeted 
    were paid a guinea (&pound;1.05p) a week for board and lodging. Since, in 
    those days, anyone from outside the immediate vicinity of Evesham was regarded 
    as a &quot;forriner&quot;, relations were sometimes rather strained between 
    the townspeople and those forcibly billeted on them, who could not explain, 
    due to the secret nature of the project, what they were doing at Wood Norton. 
    This attitude was very much aggravated when real foreigners - Russians, Poles, 
    Hungarians and other Europeans arrived to work in the monitoring service. 
    Not all relationships were strained since it was in Evesham that I met my 
    wife, who was a receptionist in the Northwick Arms, when I was billeted with 
    her mother.<br />
    <br />
    Life outside work was virtually confined to what was available in Evesham 
    since the bus services were severely curtailed, the timing being such that 
    it was not possible to get to Cheltenham or Worcester and back in a day. I 
    was fond of walking a lot in Kent and Surrey, but around Evesham I found no 
    footpaths and the only walking seemed to be through vast fields of cabbages 
    and Brussels sprouts - both vegetables which I hate! One could go to the cinema, 
    however. There were two in Evesham - the Regal and the Clifton. There was 
    also an occasional dance in the Town Hall.<br />
    <br />
    I was one of the first engineers at Wood Norton following the arrival of Bruce 
    Purslow as Engineer-in-Charge in Easter 1939. He took up residence in the 
    south lodge by the Golden Gates. These gates at the main entrance had come 
    from another property once owned by the Duc d'Orleans - York House at Twickenham. 
    The only brick buildings then on the site were - The Hall, Smith's Cottage, 
    Steward's House, part of the Pear Tree complex and the restaurant complex 
    which was then an open courtyard surrounded by stabling accommodation with 
    a cowshed along the north east side of the courtyard. This cowshed formed 
    our canteen and Bruce Purslow obtained a drinks licence for a bar. In 1940 
    the stable yard was roofed over to provide a much larger restaurant since 
    the total staff, including Monitoring, by then exceeded a thousand.<br />
    <br />
    In the beginning transport between Wood Norton and Evesham was by a quantity 
    of bicycles, two small 150cc James motorcycles, one old Austin Twelve four 
    seater saloon car and a shooting brake, the general idea was that any person 
    wanting transport took whatever was available, drove it or rode it into Evesham 
    and left it in the courtyard of the Northwick Arms. On return one went to 
    the Northwick and took whatever was available. Never having driven anything 
    as large as a shooting brake, I remember trying to drive it up Bridge St, 
    with about half a dozen passengers when I stalled the engine and we ran backwards 
    towards the Workman bridge till I managed to operate the hand brake! Some 
    of the passengers wanted to walk back to Wood Norton. <br />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="lg_pics/wood_norton_gates.jpg" width="188" height="330" alt="The Golden Gates" title="The Golden Gates" /></div>
    This transport was sorted out in the first few weeks, after the arrival of 
    the main staff, when two old double decked London General Omnibuses with solid 
    tyres were available. These buses had been purchased some months earlier, 
    repainted green, and garaged at Avenue House, Clapham, the headquarters of 
    Equipment Department. I think their first use was to transport Mr. Ralph Wade, 
    pre-war Director of Office Administration in London, to Wood Norton when he 
    came with the 'advance party' during the last week of August 1939. There was 
    a little difference of opinion between him and Bruce Purslow as to who should 
    have priority on the buses, Mr. Purslow's engineers or Mr. Wade's administrative 
    gentlemen. That occasion was one of the few in the Corporation's history when 
    the engineers obtained priority in everything. To enable the buses to get 
    up the drive, the top of the Golden Gates was removed and stored in Evesham 
    museum until the gates were refurbished and officially opened by the Mayor 
    of Evesham on 30th May 1985, as seen in the photo. <br />
    <br />
    Fortunately in Bruce Purslow we had an Engineer-in-Charge who was not very 
    interested in red tape and who realised the urgent necessity of getting things 
    done. When, for instance, we had to get equipment to the top of the hill, 
    he went down to the town and purchased a tractor. The idea of doing anything 
    like this without the necessary approvals, schemes and all the paper work 
    was at that time very unorthodox; so was the fact that anybody who wanted 
    to get to the top of the hill would drive the tractor up there!<br />
    <br />
    A great debt is owed to Bruce Purslow, a colourful character and unorthodox 
    engineer, for the satisfactory co-ordination and operation of Wood Norton 
    at the outbreak of war. He encouraged and inspired everyone on the site to 
    ensure the operation was a success. As an example, he encouraged the use of 
    Christian names when this was not considered &quot;correct&quot;. When petrol 
    rationing was imminent, Bruce collected all the suitable containers he could 
    find and had them filled with petrol for Wood Norton use. He encouraged anyone 
    with innovative ideas, whether senior or junior, and was undoubtedly the right 
    man for the job. <br />
    <a id="mon" name="mon"></a><br />
    <div class="subTitleBanner">The Monitoring Service at Wood Norton</div>
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="lg_pics/monitoring.jpg" width="450" height="316" alt="Monitoring" title="Monitoring" /></div>
    The monitoring service had no connection with the main building, Wood Norton 
    Hall, nor with any of the then permanent buildings on the site except for 
    a few weeks at the beginning when Smith's House was used until two huts had 
    been equipped with listening facilities and teleprinters.<br />
    <br />
    Reception equipment was located in two huts on the top of the hill, staffed 
    mostly by engineers responsible for sending the signals to the two huts on 
    the main compound which were staffed by foreign language monitors who recorded 
    and transcribed the signals into English. There was another monitoring hut 
    situated in the main compound. It's work was very secret; it was guarded by 
    troops and was a 'Y' unit, monitoring morse and other transmissions in connection 
    with Bletchley Park decoding work.<br />
    <br />
    Recording equipment required for the Monitoring Service, where high quality 
    sound was not so necessary, consisted of wax cylinders similar to those used 
    in the very earliest &quot;gramophones&quot;. These wax cylinders could be 
    &quot;shaved&quot; and re-used.<br />
    <br />
    The successful running of the teleprinter and communications side of monitoring 
    owed a great deal to John Holmes and Jock Norwell, both from BBC Lines Dept, 
    who went to Wood Norton in August 1939 to test the lines and then just &quot;stayed 
    there&quot; for the duration, and in particular to a junior engineer from 
    the small local telephone exchange - Maurice Hughes. He found himself responsible 
    for PO/BBC work on lines and communications of national importance. He had 
    no experience of teleprinters but rapidly learned to cope with the maintenance 
    of them and became almost one of the BBC staff with the time he spent at Wood 
    Norton. He was very willing to turn out at any time of the day or night to 
    deal with emergencies and &quot;acquire&quot; for us any items of engineering 
    equipment to assist us, conveniently forgetting the usual &quot;red tape&quot; 
    associated with this, and his own hours of work.<br />
    <br />
    Monitoring left Evesham in 1943, moving to Caversham Park, near Reading. <br />

    <div class="subTitleBanner">Continuity Suites</div>
    <br />
    The idea of continuity working had been discussed in defining the relative 
    responsibilities of the balance and control of musical programmes by musicians 
    and the switching of programmes by engineers during the mid 1930s. This was 
    further emphasised by the famous Tommy Woodroffe broadcast of &quot;The Fleet's 
    Lit Up&quot; as part of the Coronation broadcasts in 1937. Although there 
    was much discussion about it, the actual carrying out of the exercise, which 
    relied on a very close co-operation between programme presentation people 
    and engineers, really happened in the operation of the &quot;Red&quot; Network.<br />
    <br />
    This was based in Abbey Manor, a large house between Wood Norton and Evesham 
    owned by Squire Rudd. The BBC took over the house for the use of the Empire 
    News Service in the spring or summer of 1940 and installed in there, I think, 
    three studios and what we would now call a continuity suite. Out of this continuity 
    suite the programme was fed down the line to Wood Norton control room for 
    distribution to the S.B. network. It was the very great degree of close cooperation 
    and discussion between Bruce Purslow as E.i.C. and Tom Chalmers as the Chief 
    of the Presentation of the programmes which put into practice the close liaison 
    between programme and engineering people, and those two gentlemen had the

    <div class="subTitleBanner">The Fire</div>
    <br />
    On the day of the fire at Wood Norton, 4th September 1940, I was enjoying 
    a rare day off and on the road between Evesham and Wood Norton. I saw the 
    smoke and hurried to the scene.<br />
    <br />
    I mentioned, in the section about Continuities, a large house called Abbey 
    Manor. It was owned by Squire Rudd who had a hobby of fire fighting. He owned 
    an old London Fire Brigade solid-tyred fire engine, full uniforms with brass 
    helmets for his staff and a silver helmet for himself. He had a private telephone 
    line to the local telephone exchange and would be informed of any rick fire 
    in the district, whereupon he and his male staff would set off in the fire 
    engine driven by his chauffeur/handyman. The latter was the only member of 
    the Squire's staff still in residence.<br />
    <br />
    On my arrival at Wood Norton it appeared that the fire hydrants and hoses 
    in the building were fed from a small pond halfway up the hill which had quickly 
    been used up and the Evesham fire fighting equipment, in attendance, consisted 
    only of a taxi towing a small trailer pump - this was a wartime arrangement 
    provided in many small towns during the war and not of much use in fighting 
    the Wood Norton blaze.<br />
    <br />
    I immediately went back to Abbey Manor and found the chauffeur anxiously waiting 
    to know if his fire engine could be of use. We quickly took it out and, with 
    me ringing the bell on the engine, drove to Wood Norton. He took the engine 
    across the fields to the nearby River Avon for a supply of water whilst I 
    ran out the hoses up the drive from the Golden Gates. Being used to the location 
    of Rick fires, away from a supply of water, there were ample lengths of hose 
    and we soon had a better &quot;squirt&quot; than the Evesham fire fighters.<br />
    <br />
    Soon fire fighting equipment arrived from Pershore and Worcester enabling 
    the blaze to be got under control by about 1 am the next morning. We were 
    of course very worried lest the fire should attract German bombers known to 
    be in the vicinity and great efforts were made by all staff to rescue technical 
    equipment, records, office furniture, filing cabinets, typewriters, etc. all 
    of which would have been very difficult to replace in wartime. It was quite 
    understandable in these circumstances that in their efforts to save a grand 
    piano, staff not normally associated with orchestral activities should have 
    sawn off the legs of the piano to get it out through a doorway not aware that 
    the top was made to lift off the leg-framework for transportation!<br />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"> <img src="lg_pics/fire_damage.jpg" width="450" height="286" alt="Fire damage" title="Fire damage" /> 
    </div>
    Due to the magnificent woodwork of the floors and ceilings, practically no 
    water came through the ceilings and the extent of the damage was confined 
    to the roof and a few rooms directly beneath the seat of the fire. Fortunately, 
    the control room was undamaged, and equipment removed was rapidly re-installed 
    during the next day or so.<br />
    <br />
    Several Post Office circuits were put out of action but these were quickly 
    restored and broadcasting was not interrupted except for an orchestral broadcast 
    under the direction of Stanford Robinson which had to be cancelled. By about 
    2am the following morning, however, Wood Norton was able to give a tape reproduction 
    of the broadcast via the emergency control room in the Steward's House.<br />
    <br />
    The cause of the fire was never definitely known. The most likely explanation 
    seems to have been that sunlight shining through a glass skylight had ignited 
    insulation packing in the roof.<br />
    <br />
    A temporary roof was soon constructed. This turned out to be not that temporary, 
    as it survived until 1990 when the roof was reconstructed to the original 
    design. <br />
    <br />
    <div class="subTitleBanner">The Flood</div>
    <br />
    Another notable incident which took place at Wood Norton during my period 
    there was the flood. The Post Office had laid their usual 4&quot; cable ducts 
    down the main drive in the compound with manholes at suitable places - one 
    opposite the Steward's House, for instance, one outside the control room and 
    one opposite the monitoring huts. From this manhole a duct lead to a position 
    under the monitoring hut and finished level with the ground. Cables then fed 
    up a leg of the hut to terminate inside. From the manhole opposite the control 
    room a duct led into the room through a hole about 18&quot; above the floor 
    since the control room floor was below the level of the manhole.<br />
    <br />
    I was on duty that night, after a day or so of heavy rain, and heard a dripping 
    sound from behind the equipment which was traced to water dripping from the 
    duct. This was about 11 pm. We put a metal wastepaper bucket to catch the 
    drips but these rapidly increased until water was coming out of the duct like 
    two bath taps turned on. In spite of a relay of engineers with buckets etc.

      </div>
    </div>
    the situation rapidly got out of control. Since the water was coming from 
    the Post Office manhole we called out the local P.O engineers who arrived 
    first with a hand pump followed by power pumps from Pershore or Worcester. 
    In spite of these efforts the control room cable ducts and those leading to 
    the PBX were flooded, putting the telephone system out of action. <br />
    <br />
    Order was restored the following day and the cause traced. Across the hill 
    ran a dry ditch and this crossed the site of the monitoring huts. When these 
    had been erected by a London contractor, unfamiliar with country ditches and 
    drainage, the ditch had been filled in. Consequently when the heavy rain occurred 
    the dry ditch, provided to drain the rainwater away from the Wood Norton site, 
    overflowed when reaching the monitoring hut and then used the P.O duct under 
    the hut as a natural drain. Unfortunately this led into the Control Room.<br />

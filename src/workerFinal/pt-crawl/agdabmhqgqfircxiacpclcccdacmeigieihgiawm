<p>Peter Singer is a prominent philosopher/bio-ethicist whose recent appointment
to a chair in bio-ethics at Princeton University's Center for Human Values
was covered&nbsp; on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>; see <a href="SingerNYT.html">Princeton
Appointment Creates an Uproar</a> (local copy). In the following interview,
he takes on the vital task of negotiating the role of evolutionary psychology
in ethics and politics. This topic is followed up in a forthcoming book,
<i>A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution and Cooperation </i>(New Haven:
Yale UP, 2000), where Singer argues that once we separate "ought" from
"is," Darwinism will be freed of its ideological baggage. By "is" he means
the way things are, from the perspective of evolutionary psychology. By
"ought" he means the decisions we make based on those accounts. He points
out, for example, that "To say that human beings have a tendency to form
hierarchies is not to say that it is right for our society to remain hierarchal;
but it is to issue a warning that we should not expect to abolish hierarchy
by eliminating the particular hierarchy we have in our society."
<p>Singer uses game theory to make his point. In the well-known Prisoner's
Dilemma, you and another prisoner are being held incommunicado from each
other and the world. Your interrogator gives you a set of options. If you
inform on the other person and he stays silent, you go free while he is
stuck with the sucker's payoff of a twenty-year term. Or vice versa if
you don't talk and he does. If you both talk, you each get ten years. If
neither of you squeals, the case against both is weak; after a term of
six months each, you'll both go free.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The puzzle of game theory is that it was hard to avoid the prediction
that most people would betray the other prisoner. From a Darwinian perspective,
this seemed necessary -- yet it would create an evolutionary stable strategy
at a common prison term of ten years instead of six months. How could natural
selection avoid this suboptimal strategy? As Brian Skyrms has argued in
<a href="../Bibliography.html#Skyrms (1996)"><i>Evolution of the Social
Contract </i>(1996)</a><i>, </i>natural selection appears able to overcome
this difficulty. Singer references an experimental study that ran the scenario
two hundred times using the same players in order to observe how people
modified their behavior to respond to each other. This revealed that the
most effective strategy was what Axelrod (see <a href="../Bibliography.html#Axelrod and Hamilton (1981)">Axelrod
& Hamilton, 1981</a>) called "tit for tat." Simply put, start nice,
then mirror the moves made by the other player. If he or she is selfish,
adopt the same posture. But if both players start nice -- and players who
do so are most likely to survive -- the game never comes to blows.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Singer strikingly argues that "This amounts to nothing less than an
experimental refutation of Jesus' celebrated teaching about turning the
other cheek." He sees in such adaptions for cooperation the possibility
of a new society that "we can barely glimpse," he now writes, one he's
convinced does not need to be utopian. His suggestion amounts to a proposal
that ethics can be grounded in reason rather than (or in addition to) in
emotions -- or in faith.
<p>It may be objected that if the issue could be robustly resolved by adaptations,
it would long since have been resolved. Tit-for-tat-style cooperation is
facilitated in situations where interactions are repeated and where information
is openly shared. This is precisely the problem faced by modernity, and
to a lesser extent by any form of civilization: interactions are not repeated,
information does not flow openly. People are robbers at night and upright
citizens by day; they cheat with one hand and claim honesty with the other.
Tit-for-tat is as susceptible to corruption as are rights, duties, or laws;
in fact, these concepts are in large part already underwritten by a mentality
of reciprocal exchange.
<p>Even if Singer's claims for Darwinism as a possible basis for ethics
appear to fall short of their promise, the discussion is clearly crucial.
Failures in this program will be important for clarifying its limitations.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=+1>Peter Singer: An interview</font></font>
<br><i>The Philosopher's Magazine</i>
<p>"Peter Singer is the most effective philosopher alive." It would be
hard to argue with Brian Appleyard's assessment of the man who has been
the intellectual driving force behind the animal rights movement, and whose
views on euthanasia, though often greeted with hostility, have stimulated
an enormous amount of public debate. Now Singer has turned his attention
to Darwinism and ethics. While in London, he talked to Julian Baggini about
what the Left can learn from evolution.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Claiming Darwin for the Left</font>
<p>Peter Singer looks a very tired man. It's not so much the early morning
start of the interview, but the weeks of media scrutiny, misrepresentation
and criticism, which seem to have taken their toll.
<p>Singer came to England to talk about "A Darwinian Left", but no sooner
had he stepped off the plane than the <i>Daily Express</i> was reviving
the old controversy over Singer's view that in certain circumstances, it
may be better to end the life of a very severely handicapped baby in a
humane way, rather than use all modern medicine can do to let it live a
painful and often brief life. Singer tried to defend himself on Radio Four's
Today programme, but in such a brief news item, his calm reasoning was
always likely to have less impact than the emotive pleas of his interloper.
<p>So once again, what Singer really wanted to say was overshadowed by
his reputation. Which is a pity, because his LSE lecture, A Darwinian Left?,
which formed the centrepiece of his visit, sees Singer challenging a rather
different taboo: the exclusion from left-wing thought of the ideas of Charles
Darwin.
<p>Singer argues that the left's utopianism has failed to take account
of human nature, because it has denied there is such a thing as a human
nature. For Marx, it is the "ensemble of social relations" which makes
us the people we are, and so, as Singer points out, "It follows from this
belief that if you can change the 'ensemble of social relation', you can
totally change human nature."
<p>The corruption and authoritarianism of so-called Marxist and communist
states in this century is testament to the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of this
view. As the anarchist Bakunin said, once even workers are given absolute
power, "they represent not the people but themselves… Those who doubt this
know nothing at all about human nature."
<p>But what then is this human nature? Singer believes the answer comes
from Darwin. Human nature is an evolved human nature. To understand why
we are the way we are and the origins of ethics, we have to understand
how we have evolved not just physically, but mentally. Evolutionary psychology,
as it is known, is the intellectual growth industry of the last decade
of the millennium, though not without its detractors.
<p>If the left takes account of evolutionary psychology, Singer argues
that it will be better able to harness that understanding of human nature
to implement policies which have a better chance of success. In doing so,
two evolutionary fallacies have to be cleared up. First of all, we have
evolved not to be ruthless proto-capitalists, but to "enter into mutually
beneficial forms of co-operation." It is the evolutionary psychologist's
work in explaining how 'survival of the fittest' translates into co-operative
behaviour which has been, arguably, its greatest success. Secondly, there
is the "is/ought" gap. To say a certain type of behaviour has evolved is
not to say it is morally right. To accept a need to understand how our
minds evolved is not to endorse every human trait with an evolutionary
origin.
<p>When I spoke to Peter Singer, I wanted to get clearer about what he
thinks Darwinism can do to help us understand ethics. Singer is a preference
utilitarian, which means he thinks the morally right action is that which
has the consequences of satisfying the preferences of the greatest number
of people. Singer seems now to be saying was that the importance of Darwinism
is that if we take it into account, we will be better at producing the
greatest utility &shy; the satisfaction of people's preferences.
<p>"That's my philosophical goal," acknowledges Singer. "I was speaking
more broadly for anyone who shares a whole range of values. You don't have
to be a preference utilitarian. But I think it would be true generally
that anyone who has views about how society should end up will have a better
chance to achieve that if they understand the Darwinian framework of human
nature."
<p>Does that mean there's not one specifically Darwinian ethic, it's just
Darwinian evolution is one more thing to take into account?
<p>"Well, one very important thing to take into account."
<p>Singer also argues that Darwinism has a destructive effect, in that
if you accept it, certain other positions are fatally undermined. For example,
the idea that God gave Adam, and by proxy, us, dominion over the animal
kingdom is a view "thoroughly refuted by the theory of evolution." I was
unsure that those victories are always so straightforward. For example,
there are, presumably, many Christians who don't buy the Adam and Eve creation
myth as literal truth. Nevertheless, can't they live with Darwinism and
have their ethics?
<p>"I don't think Darwinism is incompatible with any Christian ethic,"
Singer is happy to allow, "except a really fundamentalist one that takes
Genesis literally. And it's not even incompatible strictly with the divine
command theory, it just means the divine command theory is based on all
sorts of hypotheses which you don't need because you've got other explanations."
<p>So how is the divine command theory undermined by evolution? Couldn't
the Christian, for example, say, yes, evolution is how man came to be,
but given there is an is/ought gap, can't the ethical commands come from
on high, as it were?
<p>"Entirely possible. I was just saying that a lot of the impetus for
a divine command theory comes from the idea that 'where could ethics come
from?'. It's something totally different, out of this world so therefore
you have to assume we're talking about the will of God or something. Once
you have a Darwinian understanding of how ethics can emerge, you absolutely
don't have to assume that, but it's still possible to assume it. It's really
the 'I have no need of the hypothesis' rather than 'that hypothesis is
hereby refuted'."
<p>The question of how far evolution can help us understand the origin
of ethics is perhaps the most contentious part of evolutionary psychologists'
claims in general and Singer's thesis in particular. Singer believes Darwinian
theory gives us an understanding of the origin of ethics, because, for
example, it gives an evolutionary explanation of how reciprocity came to
be. Put crudely, if you model the survival prospects for different kinds
of creatures with different ways of interacting with others -- from serial
exploiters to serial co-operators and every shade in between -- it turns
out that the creatures who thrive in the long one are those that adopt
a strategy called 'tit for tat'. This means that they always seek to co-operate
with others, but withdraw that co-operation as soon as they are taken advantage
of. Because this is the attitude which increases the survival value of
a species, it would seem to follow that humans have evolved an in-built
tendency to co-operation, along with a tendency to withdraw that co-operation
if exploited. Hence, it is argued, and essential feature of ethics -- reciprocity
-- is explained by evolution.
<p>But, I put it to Singer, does the is/ought gap reappear in a historical
version if you follow that theory? When we give an evolutionary explanation
of how reciprocity came to be, so far we're only describing evolved behaviour,
but it's quite clear that what you think ethics is now goes beyond a mere
description of our evolved behaviour. So how historically or logically
is that gap bridged?
<p>"It's not bridged historically at all. Of any culture and people you
can describe their ethic, but that remains entirely on the level of description.
'The Inuit people do this and this and this, the British people do that
and that and that'. You can describe that ethic but you don't get from
the answer to 'what ought I to do?' So the gap is a logical one and it
just arises from the fact the when we seek to answer the question, 'What
ought I to do?' we're asking for a prescription, we're not asking for a
description. Any description of existing morals in our culture or the origins
of morals are not going to enable us to deduce what ought we to do."
<p>But, I insist, doesn't then evolution merely explain the descriptive
part of how certain behaviours came to be. It doesn't really explain our
ethics, it explains social codes, rules of social conduct. If ethics is
a prescriptive field distinct from a descriptive one, how does evolutionary
explanation of how merely described behaviour comes to be explain how ethics
came to be?
<p>"I think in a way that's so obvious that it doesn't need any explanation,"
retorts Singer. "That's just that we have the capacity to make choices
and that we make judgements which are prescriptive, first person, second
person or third person judgements. So, in a way, that is not what I'm trying
to explain the origins of, although you can see how if you add it to the
kinds of accounts I've given, we have language and we are a social animals
you can see why we end up talking about these things and discussing them.
It's not something that I talked about. We know that we do that, and that's
a process you would expect beings, once they had a certain degree of language,
faced with these choices, to do."
<p>The question is important, because some prominent workers in the area
of decision-theory and evolution argue that evolution explains how it comes
to be that we have social rules and that in fact understanding these origins
shows to us that there's no extra moral dimension to these things. They
are merely evolved and we deceive ourselves if we think there is an ethical
dimension.
<p>I tried to probe this apparent gap between evolution and ethics by considering
two of Singer's examples of how our ethics must account for our evolved
human nature. If we take into account the fact that we feel more protective
towards our own offspring than to children in general, it's a good rule
that parents should take care of their children because there's a greater
chance it will increase the general happiness. On the other hand, the double
standard towards female and male sexual behaviour, even though it may have
an evolutionary explanation, is something that should not be tolerated.
I put it to Singer that, it follows that the moral judgements that we're
going to make are going to be of the sort, 'If the evolved behaviour is
going to lead to the morally desirable result follow it and if the evolved
behaviour does not lead to the morally desirable result, don't follow it'.
So isn't the observation of what has evolved going to drop out of the equation?
It's not going to feed at all directly into what our moral rules are going
to be.
<p>Singer's answer reveals more precisely the limited, but important role,
he believes Darwinian explanations play in our ethics. "I think the Darwinian
is going to alert us to what rules are going to work and what rules are
going to meet a lot of resistance and I think we have to bear that in mind.
But always there's a trade off between how important the values are to
us and the strength of the evolved tendency in our natures."
<p>Given Singer's willingness to challenge established views, I was a little
surprised that he still talks in terms of the left and right, particularly
as it seems his conception of the left is a long way from any traditional
view. Singer characterises the left as being concerned with eliminating
the sufferings of others and of the oppressed. A lot of people on the left
would consider that quite a diluted view of the left, which has something
to do with common ownership. I wondered if it was useful to maintain the
label 'the left'.
<p>"The label's kind of there to stay," replies Singer. "It's been there
so long. We're not about to get rid of it. You would have to be rather
far on the left now to think that a lot of common ownership is a good idea,
beyond some major utilities. I wouldn't say the left ought to be committed
to common ownership. Common Ownership is possibly a means to achieving
the goals of the left. That debate should continue. But I wouldn't say
it was a prerequisite for being part of the left."
<p>But is Singer's view really leftist at all? Take what he says about
tit-for tat, for example. He argues that tit-for-tat would appeal to people
on the left because it is a 'nice' strategy, but presumably a lot of people
who wouldn't identify themselves as left-wing would be keen on adopting
what he calls nice strategies. And similarly a number of people on the
left might be against the nicer strategies &shy; the more revolutionary
left wing, for example. So I'm left wondering really if there is a significant
distinction to be made between the left and other political stances that
are committed to the reduction of inequality.
<p>But it's quite clear that Singer, though keen to identify himself as
being on the left, isn't as interested this particular issue as I am. He
simply replies, "I think there's a lot less to the distinction [left/right]
than there was, undoubtedly."
<p>Singer's interest in Darwin pre-dates the current revival in evolutionary
explanations, and goes back to his earlier work in animal liberation.
<p>"It was there in the background. It wasn't central to it but I did talk
about it a bit in Animal Liberation. I certainly was interested in it before
Wilson's <i>Sociobiology</i> came out, but my interest in it as an aid
to understanding what ethics is really does date from <i>Sociobiology</i>
because I then addressed that in the <i>Expanding Circle</i>, which was
published in 1908, and that was explicitly a response to Wilson."
<p>What, I wondered, explains the current explosion of interest in Darwin,
particularly in philosophy and psychology?
<p>"Well, Darwin's been around for such a long period of time but understanding
Darwinian accounts of human affairs has not been about for such a long
time. It's been neglected after Darwin himself. And then there was this
great taboo against applying Darwinian hypotheses to human social behaviour
until Wilson's <i>Sociobiology</i> in 1975 and that was greeted with a
huge amount of hostility, which is evidence of the taboo. Even then a lot
of people shuddered because they saw it as something that was associated
with nasty, right-wing biological determinism, which is not really true.
So it's only more recently than 1975 that the taboo has broken down and
people have started to accept that there are interesting and important
insights into human affairs that come from applying Darwinian thinking
to human social conduct."
<center>***</center>

<p>Singer may feel that his new take on Darwin ought to have been the main
focus of his visit to London. But aside from Singer the academic philosopher,
there is also Singer the campaigner and polemicist. If the media have focused
on other things, it is at least partly due to Singer's own outspokenness
about issues that matter to him.
<p>One of the first controversies to blow up in the press during Singer's
visit was his withdrawal of a lecture he was due to give and the King's
Centre for Philosophy, because of its sponsorship by Shell UK and his very
public letter to the <i>Guardian</i> explaining why.
<p>Singer's reason for pulling out is that, "I did not really want to appear
on a programme that says 'supported by Shell' and is seen as therefore
promoting the idea that Shell is a good corporate citizen. It's not that
I'm against taking corporate money under any circumstances. I think there
are some circumstances in which I would take it, but I think that you always
have to be careful about taking corporate money. At present Shell's record,
particularly in Nigeria, is really lamentable. I think that you can see
a connection between the money that is going here [to the King's Centre]
and the profits made out of the extraction of oil in Nigeria, with all
of the consequences that has for the Ogoni people, both in terms of environmental
damage to their land, the way in which Shell revenues support the Nigerian
dictatorship, which is one of the most oppressive around. So I just didn't
want to be part of that."
<p>Interestingly, at one recent Environmental Ethics conference (see Conference
Briefing, issue three), at which the Shell issue in particular was in the
forefront of people's minds, a lot of the people who ran consequentialist
arguments at the conference actually came out in favour of taking the money
because they felt that the benefits of having the conference supported
would outweigh the very marginal benefits that Shell would receive for
having its logo in the corner of the posters. People said thinks like "It's
better this money is spent on a conference in environmental ethics, which
should be discussed, than the money should go to a big billboard poster
for Shell or something. What does Singer, as a consequentialist, make of
this argument?
<p>"The consequentialist could go both ways, I don't deny that. I don't
think it's all that important to have another environmental ethics conference
frankly &shy; there are plenty of environmental ethics conferences and
discussions about environmental ethics around. There's certainly an argument
about what else would happen to the money. But I think that in fact it's
clear that as far as my gesture of refusing to take Shell's sponsorship
-- and it was a gesture, there's no doubt about it &shy; it's had worthwhile
consequences. What it's meant is that there's one lecture in my London
programme that did not go ahead as sponsored, but in fact that was made
up for by the fact that I gave a lecture organised at King's College by
some students who were opposed to Shell's sponsorship. So people at King's
still got to hear me give a lecture, if that's what the were interested
in. By refusing and by writing a letter to The Guardian about my refusing
to do so, there was a whole lot more discussion of the issue, so people
have again become more aware that there is a real issue about corporate
sponsorship and the question about Shell in particular has got aired. So,
it seems to me that's clearly been a good thing. In other words, it's clear
that I made the right decision on consequentialist grounds.
<p>"But I think it's important that people enter some discussion, that
it's not just a silent gesture that I didn't give a lecture and no-one
ever heard about why I didn't."
<p>Singer is always very open in showing the full implications, consequences
and ramifications of his viewpoint which doesn't always make him popular.
As a consequentialist, how does he feel about the argument that the best
way to bring about a better society from a utilitarian point of view is
not to advance complex utilitarian arguments but to appeal to more simple
concepts?
<p>"I think people are in different positions and different roles. For
a political heavyweight involved in strategies for a political party to
achieve office, it probably wouldn't be possible to be quite so open. But
I think philosophers can have a role in clarifying people's thinking, with
broader aims than simply saying 'I want the political party with these
view to get into office and do this and that'."
<p>As an animal rights campaigner, I suggest, his roles perhaps are more
mixed and I asked Singer whether he felt that being so open, and talking
about the implications of his views on animals for mentally handicapped
children has had the effect of blunting his points on animal liberation,
because people are inevitably not going to focus on his positive points
about animals, they focus on the perceived negative implications for the
sanctity of life.
<p>"Maybe that's true. It's become a larger focus in recent years. I'm
not quite sure why, but I think that what you'd have to say there is that
if you take that line then it was a mistake to write <i>Should the Baby
Live? </i>back in 1985. It's done now – I think the book's done some good
in alerting people to the nature of that particular problem and making
parents of the disabled able to discuss it more openly. I'm not going to
deny that the conclusions still seem to be sound ones.
<p>"I think you could say that politically it's been a mistake to accept
invitations to debate it. What's happened in Britain over the last couple
of weeks is that there was a rather silly article in the <i>Daily Express</i>
that raised this issue, which probably should have been ignored, and I
was called by the <i>BBC</i> for the Today programme and a lot of people
heard that so maybe I would be more prudent to tell the <i>BBC</i> that
I didn't really want to discuss that anymore and that wasn't what I was
coming here to discuss this time.
<p>"It's very hard because on the other hand some of the discussions were
quite useful and it wasn't all silly stuff like the one on the Today programme
I think was. So you have to say, well, it gets more attention more read
about my views, maybe some of them will think, 'Well, this is not so silly
and bad, maybe I should look at some of his books', and maybe more people
will get involved in it. It's very hard to say, I think."
<p>Singer is always going to be a controversial thinker because of his
willingness to confront political and ethical issues without being constrained
by current orthodoxy. His application of Darwin to left-wing thought is
certainly not going to make him popular with the right, but it is also
likely to lose him some friends on the left, just as his measured contribution
to the issue of animal rights challenges society's attitudes while not
going far enough to satisfy many activists.
<p>Singer returned to his native Australia leaving behind a big question
and a tentative answer. Can the scientific theories of Charles Darwin really
contribute to our philosophical understanding of ethics? Singer has tried
to show how it can, but this is a debate which clearly has a lot further
to run.

is the first decrease we haveyet had in the sickness since it begun [during the week 29 August - 5 September,6988 died of the plague; the next week, 6544 died of plague out of 7690deaths altogether]--and great hopes that the next week it will be greater.&nbsp;Then, on the other side--my finding that though the Bill in general is abated,yet the City within the walls is encreased and likely to continue so, andis close to our house there--my meeting dead corps's of the plague, carriedto be buried close to me at noonday through the City in Fanchurch-street--tosee a person sick of the sores, carried close by me by Grace-church ina hackney-coach--my finding the Angell tavern, at the lower end of Tower-hillshut up; and more than that, the alehouse at the Tower-stairs; and morethan that, that the person was then dying of the plague when I was lastthere, a little while ago at night, to write a short letter there, andI overheard the mistress of the house sadly saying to her husband somebodywas very ill, but did not think it was of the plague--to hear that poorPayne, my water[man], hath buried a child and is dying himself--to hearthat a labourer I sent but the other day to Dagenhams to know how theydid there, is dead of the plague; and that one of my own watermen, thatcarried me daily, fell sick as soon as he had landed me on Friday morninglast, when I had been all night upon the water (and I believe he did gethis infection that day at Brainford) is now dead of the plague--to hearthat Captain Lambert and Cuttle are killed in the taking these ships andthat Mr Sidny Montagu is sick of a desperate fever at my Lady Carteret's,at Scott's hall--to hear that Mr. Lewes hath another daughter sick--and lastly,that both my servants, W[ill] Hewers and Tom Edwards, have lost their fathers,both in St. Sepulcher's parish, of the plague this week--doth put me intogreat apprehensions of melancholy, and with good reason.&nbsp; But I putoff the

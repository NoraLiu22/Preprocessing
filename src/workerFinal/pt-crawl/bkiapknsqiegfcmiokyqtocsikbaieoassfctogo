<p><strong>The Smoothie Diet</strong> is the ultimate guide and 5-week program for using smoothies to support your weight loss and health goals, one sip at a time. While smoothies have long been appreciated for their delicious and nutritious flavor, not all of them are healthy. Yes, even the ones made with fruits and vegetables could actually be wreaking havoc on your health, all the while hindering your weight loss goals. That’s because many of the pre-made versions you find at the grocery store or varieties at the smoothie bar are made excessive sugar and additives. So, although they may contain some nutrition from the fruits and vegetables, the other elements can quickly take over. But that doesn’t mean that all smoothies are out of the question. Nutritional experts have confirmed that, as long as you’re making smoothies at home with whole fruits and vegetables and as little added sugar as possible, they should be good to go. And that’s where The Smoothie Diet comes in to save the day. It not only teaches you what to look for in your smoothies; it also teaches you smoothie recipes to have over the course of the next 5 weeks to amplify your weight loss and boost your health.  It takes the guessing game out of the equation, so you can focus on what feels – and tastes good. </p>
<p>It not only teaches you the ins and outs of using these nutritious drinks to your benefit; it also shows you how to do just that. With it, you receive a 5-week regime that sets you up with different recipes for different times throughout the day so you can have the right types of blended beverage. This offers you a strategic approach to using smoothies, while also taking all of the hard work, prep and planning out of the mix. Pardon the pun. All you have to do is follow the 5-week plan, make up the smoothie recipes shown on the correct days, and enjoy. The program also comes with an abundance of additional resources to help make the process of making your smoothie at home as easy and convenient as possible. As such, it includes recipe cards and pre-made grocery shopping lists, as well as a tracking journal and optional workout plans you can blend into your day.  </p>
<p>Have a dietary restriction? Not a problem. The Smoothie Diet comes with guides for smoothies that are diabetes-friendly, as well as a guide that is gluten-free and even a kid-friendly smoothie guide, so you can get your little ones enjoying some more veggies. </p>

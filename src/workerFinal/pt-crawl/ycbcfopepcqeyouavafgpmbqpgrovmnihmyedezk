					<h3 class="line">Howâ€™s Life?</h3>
					<p align="left">The Netherlands performs well in many dimensions of well-being relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. The Netherlands outperforms the average in &nbsp;jobs, work-life balance, education, environmental quality, social networks, civic engagement, safety and life satisfaction.. These assessments are based on available selected data.</p>
<p align="left">Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In the Netherlands,<strong>&nbsp;the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;34 984 a year</strong>, more than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490 a year.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of employment,&nbsp;<strong>about 78% of people aged 15 to 64 in the Netherlands have a paid job</strong>, above the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 82% of men are in paid work, compared with 74% of women.<strong>&nbsp;In the Netherlands, almost 0% of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, below the OECD average of 10%, with 1% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 0% of women.</p>
<p align="left">Good education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>81% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 79%. Completion does not vary between men and women in the Netherlands. In terms of the quality of the education system,<strong>&nbsp;the average student scored 502 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)</strong>. This score is higher than the OECD average of 488. On average in the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>girls outperformed boys by 12 points</strong>, well above the average OECD gap of 5 points.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of health,&nbsp;<strong>life expectancy at birth in the Netherlands is around 82 years</strong>, one year higher than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 84 years, compared with 81 for men.&nbsp;<strong>The level of atmospheric PM2.5</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>is 12.2 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, below the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In the Netherlands, <strong>91% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 84%.</p>
<p align="left">Concerning the public sphere, there is a strong sense of community and high levels of civic participation in the Netherlands, where<strong>&nbsp;94% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need</strong>, more than the OECD average of 91%. <strong>Voter turnout,</strong>&nbsp;a measure of citizens' participation in the political process,&nbsp;<strong>was 79% during recent elections</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 69%. Social and economic status can affect voting rates; voter turnout for the top 20% of the population is an estimated 88% and for the bottom 20% it is an estimated 68%.</p>
<p align="left">When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Dutch people gave it&nbsp;<strong>a 7.5 grade on average,&nbsp;higher than the OECD average of 6.7.</strong></p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people's lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. All of these elements help make a house a home. And of course there is the question whether people can afford adequate housing.</p>
<p align="left">Housing costs take up a large share of the household budget and represent the largest single expenditure for many individuals and families, by the time you add up elements such as rent, gas, electricity, water, furniture or repairs. In the Netherlands, households on average spend almost&nbsp;<strong>20% of their</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gross adjusted disposable income on keeping a roof over their heads</strong>, broadly in line with the OECD average.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">In addition to housing costs it is also important to examine living conditions, such as the average number of rooms shared per person and whether households have access to basic facilities. The number of rooms in a dwelling, divided by the number of persons living there, indicates whether residents are living in crowded conditions. Overcrowded housing may have a negative impact on physical and mental health, relations with others and children's development. In addition, dense living conditions are often a sign of inadequate water and sewage supply. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>the average home contains 2 rooms per person</strong>, more than the OECD average of 1.7 rooms per person. In terms of basic facilities,&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;<strong>100% of dwellings sampled in the Netherlands contain private access to an indoor flushing toilet,</strong>&nbsp;compared with an OECD average of 97%.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">While money may not buy happiness, it is an important means to achieving higher living standards and thus greater well-being. Higher economic wealth may also improve access to quality education, health care and housing.</p>
<p align="left">Household net adjusted disposable income is the amount of money that a household earns each year after taxes and transfers. It represents the money available to a household for spending on goods or services. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;34 984</strong>&nbsp;a year, higher than the OECD average of&nbsp;USD&nbsp;30 490.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Having a job brings many important benefits, including: providing a source of income, improving social inclusion, fulfilling one's own aspirations, building self-esteem and developing skills and competencies. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>about&nbsp;78% of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 has a paid job</strong>. This figure is higher than the OECD employment average of 66% and one of the highest in the OECD.</p>
<p align="left">Unemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at about 0.9%</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 1.3%.</p>
<p align="left">The wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality.&nbsp;<strong>Dutch people earn&nbsp;USD&nbsp;58 828&nbsp;per year on average</strong>, more than the OECD average of USD 49 165.</p>
<p align="left">Another essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>workers face an expected 2.5% loss of earnings if they become unemployed</strong>, much lower than the OECD average of 5.1%.</p>

                <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Helping disabled students find work</em></p>
<p align="left">The project "Boris helps you into work" (<em>Boris brengt je naar een baan</em>) helps secondary schools better support students with disabilities in acquiring a job. In collaboration with vocational schools and certified companies, the approach of practice-based learning was adapted to students with disabilities in secondary special education.</p>
<p align="left">About a third of the 355 students completed the programme; of these 51% ended up in work, 31% went on to subsequent education and the remaining group moved on to sheltered employment or daytime activities. The participating schools judged that the project helped them in improving the quality of practice-based learning trajectories, acquiring a better view on the job opportunities within the region and extending their network for internships.</p>
<p align="left">The project "With the coach for the job" (<em>Met de coach naar de job</em>) supports students with a disability during the internship in their final study year and in their transition into the labour market. Job coaches were placed in secondary special education to help students looking for a suitable company for their internship and to guide them during the period of the internship. Students with a job coach had fewer problems during their internship and more often acquired regular work after finishing the study (50% compared with 33% of the students without a job coach).</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. People in the Netherlands can expect to go through nearly&nbsp;<strong>18.8 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, slightly more than the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>81%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, &nbsp;above the OECD average of 79%.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students&rsquo; reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in the Netherlands scored 502 in reading literacy, maths and sciences,&nbsp;</strong>above the OECD average of 488.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions,&nbsp;<strong>the health impacts of urban air pollution&nbsp;continue to worsen</strong>, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p align="left">PM2.5 &ndash; tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung &ndash; is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>PM2.5 levels are 12.2 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter and higher than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the&nbsp;World Health Organization.</p>
<p align="left">Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In the Netherlands,&nbsp;<strong>91% of people say they are satisfied with water quality,</strong>&nbsp;higher than the OECD average of 84%.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

<p align="left"><em>A flexible and integrated approach to climate risks</em></p>
<p align="left">Climate change poses a challenge for long-term planning in the protection against flooding in river deltas and coastal areas. In the Netherlands, the Delta programme uses an approach called &ldquo;adaptation pathways&rdquo; to identify approaches for managing flood risk. Central to this is the identification of tipping points, where the existing set of measures in place would no longer achieve the desired objectives. Once tipping points are identified, a range of potential options are chosen and a monitoring system is established to track changes and ensure there is flexibility to change course if needed. The Delta programme takes a cross-sectoral approach, involving stakeholders in the water sector throughout the process so that all aspects of a decision are taken into account. The Delta Fund, which finances the programme, plans to integrate more of the existing water-related programmes into the yearly EUR 1 billion fund from 2020 onwards.</p>

<p align="left">Broader public engagement in the decision-making process is also important for holding the government to account and maintaining confidence in public institutions. The formal process for public engagement in developing laws and regulations is one way to measure the extent to which people can become involved in government decisions on key issues that affect their lives. In the Netherlands, the level of stakeholder engagement in developing regulations is 2.6 (on a scale between 0 and 4); higher than the OECD average of 2.1.</p>

<p align="left">Ministry-led consultative tools allow Dutch citizens to participate in the preliminary phase of decision making by sharing their opinions, concerns, objections, and solutions to delivering public services or draft regulations. These consultations ensure citizens have a voice and strengthen their connection with government.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Citizen engagement for better water policies</em></p>
<p align="left">Water is a longstanding priority in the Netherlands. Rijnland's regional water authority's working programme and policy plan for 2015-2021 encourages people to participate in decision-making. Citizens and stakeholders were called to participate in a survey and congress to better assess existing knowledge gaps and re-engage locals in the development of water policy. People can also access a new online participation platform that provides information on the roles and responsibilities of the regional water authorities and encourages discussion and new ideas. The results of these public engagements are being considered in the policy plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care.&nbsp;<strong>Life</strong>&nbsp;<strong>expectancy at birth in the Netherlands stands at 82 years</strong>, one year above the OECD average of 81 years.

<p align="left"><em>Mental health support</em></p>
<p align="left">The Dutch government funds mental health professionals to help general practitioners (GPs) to better recognise and treat mental illness. These mental health professionals provide problem analysis and screening; develop and discuss treatment plans; offer psycho-education; support self-management; and conduct interventions for behavioural change, indicated prevention, and relapse prevention. Final treatment and referrals are then determined by the GP.</p>
<p align="left">The share of GPs seeking assistance from mental health professionals has increased from 11% in 2009 to 34% in 2011 and 62% in 2013. Evaluations show that 90% of GPs rate their experience as good or excellent. Patients also report positively on their experiences with the mental health professionals. Both GPs and patients value the professional, quick, low-threshold support provided. Potential for improvement includes greater transparency and familiarity with patients and better integrating mental health professionals in local care teams.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Long-term study on health</em></p>
<p align="left">The region of the North of the Netherlands faces a shrinking population and an ageing society. Local government has created a major health database to investigate why some people develop chronic illness relatively early in life, while others remain vital and healthy into old age. This investigation will span 30 years, monitoring 165 000 residents of the Northern Netherlands from youth through parenthood to old age. This pioneering three-generation study involves an unprecedented number of life aspects, from heredity and lifestyle to physical and social factors. Participants are called in for an examination once every five years. During this examination, they are asked to complete detailed questionnaires about their medical records, their habits, including diet, smoking, lifestyle, use of medicines, etc. The baseline phase has just been completed and the follow-up phase is about to start.</p>
<p align="left">The results are expected to lead to a faster identification of diseases, discovering new treatments and even preventing chronic disorders. The challenge of staying healthy longer through innovation calls for fundamental breakthroughs in core areas that determine sickness and health, in particular in the fields of life sciences, food and nutrition, medical technology, care and cure and healthy lifestyles.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">A group of specialists worked together over a period of three months to identify challenges, plan and implement solutions. Following evaluation, new principles of action and engagement were established taking a systems approach to protecting children. Under this new approach, silos were removed so that case workers could deal with the whole family system and communicate directly with families. Teams are organised around each potential case and focus early intervention and care for the entire family.</p>
<p align="left">The redesign of the organisation proved to be extremely successful and exceeded expectations. Both the quality of public service increased and the associated costs reduced. More importantly, the number of cases where children had to be forcibly removed from their families decreased by 50%. Considering these positive and continuous results, the CYPSA was elected the Best Public Sector Organisation in the Netherlands in 2015.</p>

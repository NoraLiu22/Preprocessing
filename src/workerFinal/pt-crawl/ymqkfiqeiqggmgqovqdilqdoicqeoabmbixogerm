<p><i><font face="Times New Roman">We must be on guard, from the beginning
to the end, against infiltrating, subversive and splittist activities by
international and domestic hostile forces. Any political behavior that
is aimed at damaging the stability and unity of our country runs counter
to the will and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. No matter
where these factors which damage social stability come from, we must firmly
hold to the Four Basic Principles and have a clear-cut stand in increasingly
opposing them and firmly nipping them in the bud.</font></i>

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</font></font></b></h1></center>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="blubvspm.gif" width="300" height="3"></CENTER>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This report documents the Chinese government's
reaction to the efforts of a small number of democracy activists in 1998
and 1999 to take the first steps toward establishing a legal opposition
party. It illustrates how tightly the government continues to control and
restrict freedom of expression and association, despite China's signing
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and public
assurances by its leaders of their concern for human rights. It shows that,
while China has undergone phenomenal economic and social transformation
over the last two decades, there has been no significant change in the
government's policy toward any organization which overtly challenges the
Communist Party's control: suppression.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The China Democracy Party (CDP), a loosely
linked group of political activists, operating nationwide, emerged in mid-1998.
It was significant because it was the first time since the establishment
of the People's Republic of China in 1949 that an attempt was made to obtain
the formal legal registration of an opposition political party. Over the
next eighteen months, however, it was systematically crushed. Known members
of the CDP were summarily arrested and detained, and though most were held
for relatively brief periods, at least thirty-four of them were sentenced
to prison terms of up to thirteen years on charges of attempted subversion.
At least four others fled into exile abroad. Others, who remain in China
but are not in prison, live under close police surveillance and have ceased
to be openly active.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The CDP called for multiparty democracy
in China and respect for human rights. Chinese leaders saw it as a group
that aimed to undermine the basic principles and the monopoly of power
of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). CDP members were veteran dissidents,
many of them former political prisoners. They were skilled in modern communication
techniques and strategic in their timing of statements and actions. They
were determined to test the Chinese government's stated commitment to improved
respect for human rights and willing to face the consequences of doing
so.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Three of the group's founders, Wang Youcai,
Wang Donghai and Lin Hui, seized the opportunity presented by U.S. President
Bill Clinton's state visit to China in June 1998 to announce the formation
of the CDP's first local preparatory committee in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.
Then, taking advantage of the relatively relaxed political atmosphere at
the time, CDP activists sought to register preparatory committees in other<b><i>
</i></b>provinces. And as the government announced that China would sign
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), they
cited that treaty's provisions on freedom of association and expression
as evidence of their right to organize.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">At first, local authorities to whom CDP
members applied to register their preparatory committees appear to have
been uncertain how to react. But when the CDP announced that it planned
to create a national structure, the central government, led by National
People's Congress chairman Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin, denounced
the fledgling party, and CDP leaders were arrested and imprisoned. The
first wave of arrests took place in November and December 1998, but neither
it nor a subsequent series of arrests in May 1999 deterred the remaining
CDP members from continuing their efforts to build the party, issue public
statements, or hold discussion groups. It was only in late 1999 that the
CDP was effectively silenced.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">CDP members stressed during their efforts
to obtain legal recognition that they were seeking to do so in accordance
with existing laws. In the absence of regulations specifically governing
the registration of political parties, they sought to register with the
relevant provincial branches of the Civil Affairs Ministry in view of its
responsibility for the registration of "social groups." They also invoked
the Chinese constitution and official regulations on social groups issued
in October 1989 and pointed to China's stated commitment to the rights
enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Finally, when all else had failed, they tried to go directly to the State
Council, China's equivalent of an executive cabinet, to register. The end
result, however, was that the embryonic party was declared an "illegal
organization."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The main regulation used to try and sentence
CDP leaders was Article 105 of the 1997 Penal Code, which penalizes "those
involved in organizing, scheming or acting to subvert the political power
of the state and overthrow the socialist system." Since the offense of
"counterrevolution" was dropped from the 1997 Penal Code, Article 105 has
become one of the charges used by the government to punish peaceful exercise
of the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Civil society has been growing increasingly
rapidly in China since 1979: to date more than 200,000 social groups are
officially registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs. As of this writing,
however, no organization has been allowed publicly to challenge the role
of the Communist Party, and any open expression of opinions that deviate
from the official party line remains hazardous.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In this report, Human Rights Watch documents
the emergence and suppression of the CDP. The report is based on CDP documents,
original court material, and interviews with members living in exile in
the United States or resident in Hong Kong.</font>
<p><a NAME="P72_6901"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">Recommendations</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Human Rights Watch urges the government
of the People's Republic of China to:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Release all those detained and
sentenced for their peaceful activities in connection with the CDP.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Revoke all laws and regulations
that illegitimately curb the right to freedom of association, expression,
and assembly.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Take steps to bring domestic laws
into full accordance with the provisions of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Ratify, as soon as possible and
without reservations, the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural
Rights.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">At the same time, Human Rights Watch calls
upon the international community to:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Use international fora and the
occasion of state visits involving Chinese leaders, to press for the release
of CDP members and all others detained solely for the expression of their
political and religious beliefs.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Urge China's early ratification,
without reservation, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural
Rights.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Use any bilateral human rights
dialogue meetings with China to raise the case of the CDP's suppression
and publicly press for the release of CDP activists and for full recognition
of the rights to freedom of association, expression, and assembly.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Call on the World Bank, in its
policy dialogue with China, to promote an open approach on the part of
the Chinese authorities to the creation of social groups and civil society
generally.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&middot; Signal to China that its prospective
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) must be accompanied by significant
measures to respect international human rights norms, and that the crackdown
on the CDP, anti-corruption groups, the Falun Gong, and others, undermines
international confidence in Jiang Zemin's willingness to implement both
political and economic reforms.</font>

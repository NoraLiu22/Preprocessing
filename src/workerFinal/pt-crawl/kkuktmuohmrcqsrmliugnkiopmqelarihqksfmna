          <font color="#CCCCCC" size="4">The late Mrs. Laszlo Halasz (cellist 
          Suzette Forgues, before she married the conductor who founded the New 
          York City Opera Company), told me the story of soprano Camilla Williams 
          singing Cio Cio San in Madame Butterfly (Puccini, 1946). After I had 
          published this recollection of a remarkable event on <img src="knlinkedpage.jpg" width="13" height="14" align="absmiddle"> 
          <a href="http://www.soundfountain.org/rem/remhalasz.html"><b>The Remington 
          Site</b></a> in November 2000, I received an e-mail from a gentleman 
          friend of Camilla Williams who had told the soprano about it. Camilla 
          Williams sang Bess in the first &quot;complete&quot; recording of George 
          Gershwin's great opera, conducted by Lehman Engel and produced by Goddard 
          Lieberson for Columbia Records in 1951. And while I had a page about 
          Porgy and Bess in mind, she would love to give more details and information 
          and would authorize me to publish a page about Camilla Williams herself.<br>
          That was in 2000 when I had started the project about the nineteen fifties 
          label Remington Records and gave it a sort of encyclopedic form which 
          is the same today as it was then. However separate individual pages 
          about Porgy and Bess and about Camilla Williams never materialized as 
          after a computer crash all e-mails had been erased, addresses had 'evaporated' 
          and my good intentions had gone up in smoke. Remember, in those days 
          an external 500 Gigabyte hard disk to back up an entire system was non 
          existent. <br>
          No way to be able to establish the contact again. </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
          Now, many years later, I have started to publish a page on Porgy &amp; 
          Bess. It may seem rather pretentious as already so much has been written 
          by experts on George and Ira Gershwin, on Edwin DuBose Heyward and his 
          wife Dorothy, about the people involved in the first production, how 
          George Gershwin himself did the casting of the (main) characters and 
          the chorus for the premiere in Boston in 1935... so much has been written 
          and said, that there would hardly be anything left to report on. <br>
          But as a record collector - I grew up with Gershwin's music as did so 
          many of my generation - I thought that it would be interesting to give 
          a round up of recordings, to publish details, and to show a few memorabilia, 
          connected to the opera and the artists. Especially because there is 
          the complete original, lengthy 1935 score version available now on CD, 
          recorded by Decca, released in 2005. You will have to judge about that 
          performance for yourself.</font></font>

        ASSESSMENT</font></strong></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#CCCCCC">Reading 
          the novel is not too easy, at least at first sight. It initially asks 
          for a lot of concentration because of the writing of the spoken language, 
          no matter if it is a true rendition of the Gullah language or not. This 
          is not a criticism. There are other aspects of the novel, the play and 
          the opera, which have been criticized by several people. These aspects 
          are about ethics, about the distortion of the originality of the characters 
          that really have existed, and the way the play and the opera have been 
          &quot;exploited&quot; right from the early days on. You may read the 
          assessment written by <img src="knlinkedpage.jpg" width="13" height="14" align="absmiddle"> 
          <a href="https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-55907445/goat-cart-sam-a-k-a-porgy-an-icon-of-a-sanitized"><b>Kendra 
          Hamilton: 'I grew up in Charleston, South Carolina'.</b></a><br>
          It is good to view Porgy &amp; Bess from a different perspective.<br>
          Her criticism is partly of a technical nature. The question is: Were 
          the facts distorted? It is also a sociological issue: the disintegration 
          of society which was the result when Charleston became a tourist attraction.<br>
          There is also the feeling that &quot;whites&quot; came up with novel, 
          play and opera. (Duke Ellington apparently despised the work. Yet he 
          performed and recorded at least Summertime with singer Betty Roch&eacute;, 
          and finally contributed to a 3 Lp jazzy version.) But to the true beholder 
          the white initiative seems less important in the end. Porgy &amp; Bess 
          is a mirror to one's own soul, to everybody's soul. It is about the 
          vitality and the despair, the passion and the hope for a better life. 
          That is the universality of the story which became the folk opera.<br>
          Porgy and Bess is about the caring, the empathy and the love people 
          have for each other. It is also about the dangers the world has to offer.

          <font size="4">The first &quot;complete&quot; recording was made by 
          Columbia. In the picture you see Lehman Engel and Goddard Lieberson. 
          Engel was the conductor and Lieberson the producer for the Columbia 
          recording. The edited images of Camilla Williams and of Lehman Engel 
          and Goddard Lieberson are from the accompanying notes of the original 
          Columbia SET SL-162 from 1951.<br>
          Though it was quite a long version, several cuts were made. There is 
          no Maria addressing Sporting Life who wants to be friends with her. 
          But there is of course the omen in the &quot;Buzzard Song&quot;. For 
          that song one can also play the wonderfully dramatic and swinging concept 
          of Miles Davis and Gil Evans on Columbia LP CS 8085.</font></font></p>

          re-channeled for stereo&quot;. The recording dates of course from 1951.

          feather in Columbia's operatic cap.<br>
          The rapid growing library of complete operas opens endless new vistas 
          to music lovers unable to attend live performances. Porgy and Bess is 
          a case in point. For so many, it has been a work read about in the Sunday 
          theatre sections of metropolitan newspapers, and heard only in snatches 
          of particularly popular songs. Now for the first time, anyone with even 
          an inexpensive LP record-player attachment can hear all of Porgy and 
          Bess and will, no doubt, find many a song or melody which will become 
          better loved than some of those previously in the record library. (...)<br>
          The man with a hi-fi listening system will be rewarded indeed, for the 
          sound on these discs is typical of what can be done when a record manufaturer 
          decides to do its best. And this best can be, today, wonderful to hear. 
          (...)<br>
          Columbia is also to be congratulated on a very deft handling of sound 
          effects. These sounds - walking, doors closing, coins dropping - are 
          held to naturelness; the stage is not suddenly stilled, a door slammed 
          with a crash, and then the actors brought back to life again.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#CCCCCC"><br>

          Mezzo Soprano Inez Matthews sang the role of Serena. Her beautiful voice 
          was also preserved on Vol. 6 of the <b>Great Voices of Today</b> Series. 
          Inez Matthews made her debut in New York's Town Hall when she was still 
          in high school. One critic wrote: &quot;A rare and luminous talent&quot;. 
          </font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#CCCCCC">In 
          the June 1954 issue of High Fidelity Magazine, John M. Conly reviewed 
          the recording <b>Inez Matthews sings Spirituals</b> (Period SPL 580). 
          What he wrote is a precise description of the voice and personallity 
          of Inez Matthews, but now, some 55 years later, it can be read as a 
          tribute. Mr. Conly wrote:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#CCCCCC">&quot;While 
          still very young she was selected to sing the lead in Billy Rose's <b>Carmen 
          Jones</b>. Then she got the feminine lead opposite Todd Duncan in the 
          Kurt Weill-Maxwell Anderson production<b> Lost in the Stars</b>. Goddard 
          Lieberson choose her as the <b>Serena</b> in his uncut Columbia <b>Porgy 
          and Bess</b>, and Virgil Thomson made her <b>St. Therese I</b> in his 
          revival of <b>Four Saints in Three Acts</b>. Miss Matthews won them 
          through a liberal application of brains, a brilliant feeling for drama, 
          a natural vocal limpidity and a trick of delivery, sparingly used, hard 
          to describe but equally hard to resists, a sort of educated scoop which 
          invests her full voice with a remarkable sobbing quality. In these spirituals 
          it is electrifying. It is also exactly right. I know of no record so 
          convincing or so moving as this one. To put yourself to the test, hear 
          her sing Balm in Gilead, and feel the history in it. The recording is 
          for its purposes, practically perfect, intimate and high in level.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#CCCCCC">Edward 
          Matthews was her brother and teacher. He was <b>Jake the Fisherman</b> 
          in the Columbia production of <b>Porgy and Bess</b> and he was <b>St. 
          Ignatius</b> in <b>Four Saints in Three Acts</b>. Conly ends his review 
          on a very sad note: &quot;The week this record was issued his car skidded 
          off a Virginia highway. He was killed.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

          <font size="4">In Europe the complete 3 Lp Set of the 1951 recording 
          was released by Philips in a book with a yellow spiral coil at the spine, 
          the way Philips bound complete sets of operas like Richard Strauss's 
          Salome with soprano Walburga Wegner and conductor Rudolf Moralt, and 
          I Pagliacci with Richard Tucker and the Metropolitan Opera conducted 
          by Fausto Cleva.</font></font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          </font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Around 1953 the 
          Dutch record company Philips (known as <i>Philips Phonografische Industrie</i>, 
          in short PPI), made a deal with Columbia Records which became effective 
          in the spring of 1954. Columbia licensed their recordings to Philips 
          (and no longer to EMI) for release on the Philips label. These were 
          recordings ranging from Bruno Walter, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Rudolf Serkin, 
          and Zino Francescati, to Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Erroll Garner, 
          and the Rampart Street Paraders. Original Philips recordings were released 
          in America on the Epic label, a sub label of Columbia. A few recordings 
          were issued as a Columbia release like Mengelberg's St. Matthew Passion. 
          Some other recordings were made in cooperation. Like the Robert Cassadesus-Eduard 
          Van Beinum recording of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 which also 
          appeared on Columbia instead of Epic. This became evident when in 1961 
          the deal was ended and Philips bought the Chicago based Mercury Records. 
          When CBS started to market their recordings in Europe themselves the 
          CBS release of this concerto was pressed from the original Philips HiFi-Stereo 
          plates instead of plates cut by the Columbia engineers. More CBS records 
          were pressed from original Philips HiFi-Stereo matrices or from Fontana 
          Full Stereo plates like Dave Brubeck's album Gone With The Wind.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The 
          first performance of Porgy and Bess was in the Colonial Theater in Boston, 
          on September 30, 1935. It was presented by the Theater Guild. The opera 
          was far too long. It took hours and hours to come to an end. The costly 
          production was directed by Rouben Mamoulian. The settings were by Sergei 
          Soudeikine, and the orchestra was conducted by Alexander Smallens. After 
          the problematic staging in Boston, the production went to New York, 
          to show in the Avalon Theater.<br>
          Like George Gershwin, Alexander Smallens was of Russian descent but 
          had come to the US as a young child, whereas Gershwin was born in Brooklyn. 
          For many years Alexander Smallens was the best advocate of George's 
          masterpiece. He conducted highlights in 1942, released on several 78 
          RPM shellac records. These were later transferred to Lp: Decca DL 9024. 
          <br>
          Smallens was also the conductor of excerpts of the opera recorded by 
          Victor. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

          later in the opera for Bess to sing, illustrating how much she loved 
          that song sung by Serena at the beginning right after the Overture. 
          That is what George did. In Norway Anne Brown recorded &quot;Summertime&quot; 
          for the TONO label on 78 RPM shellac on the B-Side. And on Side One 
          she sang &quot;My Man 's Gone Now&quot;. She was accompanied by the 
          Royal Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Johan Hye-Knudsen, or in Danish: 
          Det kongelige Kapel og Kor, Dirigent: Joh. Hye-Knudsen. The reference 
          number of the disc is X 2512. (I will add an audio clip later.)</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

          Kolodin is one of the most well known critics from the nineteen forties 
          and fifties and sixties. He evaluates several performances in <b>The 
          New Guide To Recorded Music</b> which Kolodin prepared at the end of 
          the nineteen forties and was published in 1950 (Double Day and Company). 
          Naturally this guide deals mostly with 78 RPM shellac records and just 
          a few long playing records, mostly dubbings from earlier shellac recordings. 
          This is what he says about recordings available at the time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Summertime</b> 
          - &quot;There can be little doubt that the most colorful and understanding 
          of these performances is Anne Brown's, sounding as it did when she created 
          the part of Bess. Steber sings with exceptional beauty of sound and 
          a lovely lyric sympathy that are quite thrilling; moreover against an 
          orchestral background distinctly superior to those provided for Brown 
          and Jepson.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>I 
          got Plenty o' Nuttin - </b> &quot;Duncan has both the voice for this 
          music and the style to utilize it fully.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Bess 
          You is My Woman Now:</b> &quot;Better by Jepson and Tibbett than Brown 
          and Duncan.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>It 
          Ain't Necessarily So - </b> Kolodin can not endorse the performances 
          by Avon Long, nor Lawrence Tibbett and Paul Robeson in the role of Sportin' 
          Life. They do not match the performance which John Bubbles gave in the 
          original production of Porgy and Bess in 1935 which Kolodin, then 27, 
          must have attended. He finds Avon Long to be an affected and self-conscious 
          performer.<br>
          It is just that trait which gave producer Goddard Lieberson the idea 
          to have Avon Long sing Sportin' Life in the 1951 Columbia recording. 
          Lehman Engel certainly had a different concept of Sportin' Life in mind 
          than Alexander Smallens would allow and Engel gave Long the artistic 
          space for a memorable performance. From then on every Sportin' Life 
          was measured against Avon Long's &quot;teasing and slimy&quot; Sportin' 
          Life. <br>

          Berlin (Titania Palast), London, and Paris (Salle Wagram). This production 
          was also showed in the Ziegfeld Theater (Broadway). That was the production

        <br />
        <font color="#CCCCCC" size="4">Because of the great success of the performances 
        in the Carr&eacute; Theatre in Amsterdam, it was arranged that members 
        of the production were to record excerpts in the Haarlem Concertgebouw 
        (today <i>Philharmonie Haarlem</i>) with the so-called Concerthall Haarlem 
        Symphony Orchestra and Chorus - musicians and voices hired for the occasion. 
        The recording was produced by N.V. Bovema, the Dutch distributor of EMI 
        in the town of Heemstede, and was taped on Friday, June 1st, 1956. Instead 
        of Smallens or one of the two assistant conductors,<b> Lorenzo Fuller</b> 
        was the conductor. And he was an enthousiastic one. Alexander Smallens 
        was probably under contract with another record company and to get permissin 
        on short notice was impossible. Or, the recording was done on the instigation 
        of the performers and Bovema, bypassing the producers of the tour. It 
        was a low budget recording and a quick fix which is shown by the somewhat 
        unprofessional microphone placement. Yet Martha Flowers sings with her 
        clear and transparent voice a beautiful Summertime and she is an expressive 
        Strawberry Woman. Leesa Foster is Bess, regrettably with some rather unstable 
        singing. Barnes, Attles and Fuller are quite good. It remains a memorable 
        document.<br>
        The recording was distributed in more countries. In France on <i>La voix 
        de son maitre</i> (FALP 30198) and in England on the Music for Pleasure 
        label. It was even available in the DDR, the former German Democratic 
        Republic (GDR) on Eterna 820 432 in a series entitled &quot;Musikalische 
        Kostbarkeiten&quot; (Musical Treasures).</font></font><br>

          on Cadence LP CLP 1004, entitled Piano Perspectives, magnificent pianist 
          Don Shirley starts playing &quot;I can't get started&quot;, his introduction 
          reminds one of I loves You Porgy. Don Shirley knows every brand and 
          style. His improvisations shift easily from jazz to popular to classical. 
          That is why Ravel unexpectedly turns up on CLP 1004. And Rachmaninoff 
          shines through on Cadence CLP 25055 &quot;Don Shirley Presents Martha 
          Flowers&quot;. This record is also a grand introduction to Don Shirley 
          himself, to his elaborate technique, subtle swinging and inspired harmonies. 
          It is an introduction for all those people who did not get acquainted 
          with this phenomenon from the nineteen fifties and sixties. The first 
          side of the LP (with songs by Victor Young, Richard Rogers, Harold Arlen, 
          R. Bloom, and George Gershwin) was recorded on August 6, 1962 by engineer 
          John Quinn. The Porgy and Bess Suite on Side Two was recorded much earlier, 
          on October 19, 1960, by famous recording technician <b>George Piros</b>. 
          Both recordings were made at Fine Recording Studios, New York City, 
          and have all the traits of a perfect <b>C. Robert Fine </b>production. 
          <br>
          Martha Flowers sings - accompanied by Shirley and a cello and string 
          bass player - the songs she did so well on the Dutch recording made 
          6 years earlier: Strawberry Woman, and an ever so compelling Oh, Doctor 
          Jezus. </font><font size="3" color="#333333">- <i>R.A.B.</i></font><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC"><br>

          nineteen fifties he also sang the part of Daniel in the one-act opera 
          The Devil And Daniel Webster composed by Douglas Moore, recorded by 
          Westminster. After he had gone to live in Germany in 1959, he recorded

          Lesser known is his rather trivial arrangement of selections from Porgy

          were <b>Lawrence Winters, Isabelle Lucas, Ray Ellington, Barbara Elsy,

          maybe four. <br>
          It is one of the recordings of the Symphonic Picture for Orchestra, 
          an arrangement written by <b>Robert Russell Bennett</b>. The Symphonic 
          Suite &quot;Catfish Row&quot; was written in 1943 and premiered in that 
          year by Alexander Smallens conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. There 
          are a few other recordings of this orchestral suite, by Antal Dorati, 
          by Eduardo Mata, by Felix Slatkin, and by Andre Previn. It seems that 
          recording this score is gone somewhat out of fashion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#CCCCCC">Well, 
          what is remarkable is that this Command Classic CC 11037 SD, is directed 
          by William Steinberg and played by the Pittsburg Symphony, the house 
          orchestra of the label at the time.<br>
          The performance is recorded by C. Robert Fine and Robert Eberenz, who 
          were responsible for so many outstanding <img src="knlinkedpage.jpg" width="13" height="14" align="absmiddle">

          recordings. Outstanding because of the microphone placement, the use 
          of 35 mm recording film and - last but not least - the way the lacquer 
          was cut by George Piros. Here it is also Piros who did the cutting.<br>
          And finally there are two pictures on the cover. One of William Steinberg. 
          And one of Fritz Reiner (who is not conducting here, but he commissioned 
          the work), together with George Gershwin, Deems Taylor, and... Robert 
          Russell Bennett. It was taken in 1931, long before Porgy &amp; Bess 
          was conceived. Robert knew George and he made several arrangements of 
          Gershwin shows in the 1930s.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>

        had died, the Suite remained in Ira Gershwin's family papers until Maurice

        There are always people who want to have the best seat in the theatre

        4114 recording of Gershwin's arrangement of the Porgy and Bess Suite played 
        by the Broadway Symphonic Jazz Orchestra directed by S. Auber is a bad 
        investment, but they may suspect that this Allegro disc may have been 
        made well before Maurice Abravanel did the recording for Westminster.<br>
        Another recording of the Suite appeared in 1974 on the East German Eterna 
        label and was played by the Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig, conducted by 
        Kurt Masur. The disc also containes An American in Paris and Cuban Overture.

          <br />
          <font color="#CCCCCC" size="4">An artist's creativity, and the pinacle 
          of it, often has its roots in early childhood. It is a setting of the 
          mind, of the spirit which is mostly brought about by an occurence, a 
          confrontation, an event - how sudden and short and how insignificant 
          it may seem - that makes him realize what the path is which he will 
          follow, in fact is compelled to follow, and eventually will bring him 
          to the top of that gradually unwinding road when he creates that final 
          masterpiece, be it a novel, a painting, a sculpture or a musical composition. 
          Each and every event in the artist's life leads to the next, and always 
          this kernel, the thought, the idea, will be residing deep in his brain, 
          will be slumbering, be it subcounsciously or just as a vague notion. 
          'Porgy and Bess' may have begun even before Al Jolson sang Swanee, even 
          before George Gershwin studied harmony with Edward Kilenyi Sr., even 
          before him being a Tin Pan Alley song plugger, even earlier did it strike 
          the little boy when hearing street noise, people talking, someone singing, 
          the playing of a piano. Every show, every song, every musical composition 
          - as great as the Rhapsodies, the Concerto in F, and An American in 
          Paris may be - can in the end be regarded as an exercise, as a study 
          in music and drama, which would lead the way to 'Porgy and Bess'. Along 
          the road the idea often emerged in a song or a setting, and also in 
          a Broadway show, but most clearly in 1922 when George Gershwin wrote 
          BLUE MONDAY, &quot;A Chamber Opera&quot;. </font></font><br>

          book about the Gershwins which every admirer of George Gershwin's music 
          and Ira Gershwin's Lyrics should own. It deals with all the musical 
          shows, the Rhapsody in Blue, The Concerto in F, the Second Rhapsody, 
          and the opera. It is written and compiled by Robert Kimball and Alfred 
          Simon, and places the Gershwins in the context of the period they lived 
          in. The book is beautifully designed by Bea Feitler. The very sympathetic 
          preface is written by Richard Rogers. <br>
          The book which was first published in 1973 (Bonanza Books, New York), 
          may have inspired many a record producer and stage director.</font></font><br>

          the start there were strong preferences for this or that performance

          in the List of the Absolute Sound (TAS List), but there is also much

          <font size="4" color="#000033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
          owe a deep insight into the creativity of George Gershwin to a wonderful 
          man with whom I became friends in New York. There his name was Albert 
          Sirmai (also written as Szirmay, ed.) (...) managing director of the 
          famous Chappell Publishing Company and who earlier had been a close 
          collaborator of George Gershwin. Nearly all Gershwin's piano scores 
          show his name as a publisher. Countless times I have visited him after 
          office hours at Chapell's and did not get tired to listen to his stories 
          about George Gershwin. Because of his inadequate classical music studies, 
          Gershwin suffered from poor selfesteem, and was a Wagnerian, and Sirmai 
          had always to explain the technique of the 'Leitmotiv' (leading motif) 
          of his idol. He (Sirmai. ed.) once <b>showed me a 'Meistersinger' opera 
          vocal score with Gershwin's written remarks.</b> &quot;Porgy&quot; is 
          indeed the only opera which exists with the most 'leading motifs' ever.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#000000"> 
          The premiere performance in the year 1935 in the Alvin Theatre was no 
          good - except for the leading performers Todd Duncan and Anne Brown. 
          And when I came to America in 1939 people still said to me (...) that 
          Porgy, the last (composition) of Gershwin, was nothing.(...) Than they 
          remodeled &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, inserted spoken dialog (these 
          are hardly present in the original), the heavy chorusses were abridged, 
          and changed it into a musical. That was an immense triumph in 1942. 
          (...) I was present. Suddenly there was a musical which had less similarity 
          with Gershwin's opera, but had started a triumphant tour.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#000000">I 
          was the first who said to director Moser of the "Volksoper":<br>
          "What in fact about the original which was never performed? As an opera 
          house we have all the possibilities - Gershwin never did have these. 
          Why don't we do that for the first time in Vienna?" <br>
          Moser agreed. And in 1965 we did produce for the first time the original 
          score of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, as a large, heavy opera with a 
          large orchestra, big chorusses, with these difficult things to sing, 
          for the first time in the world on October 19, 1965, at the Volksoper. 
          (Olive) Moorefield was Bess, William Warfield Porgy, and I was very 
          proud of the headline in an American newspaper: &quot;Vienna gave Gershwin 
          what America did refuse him.&quot; - <i><b>Marcel Prawy</b></i></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><br>

          CD have the typical and well-known open sound from ETERNA as the performances 
          were most certainly recorded in a church. Roberta Alexander who is well 
          known from her Mahler recording with Bernard Haitink and songs on the 
          Etcetera label, gives a fine account of &quot;I loves you Porgy&quot;.

          or had not listened to other productions before. The performance was 
          also criticised, especially by those who had a more deepened knowledge 
          of the opera. Since this Porgy and Bess was a filmed performance without 
          the artists singing while being filmed, the intensity was not always 
          there. </font></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#CCCCCC">There

          Simon Rattle wanted to make a mark with a showman's concept rather then 
          a more integer, soul searching intention. A reviewer of the performance 
          justly mentioned the ultra slow Summertime which misses the tension 
          of the expectation of the drama to come, the drama of love, life, crime, 
          deception and hope. Furthermore Porgy is walking around with crutches 
          while in the original he rides in a goat car. And when at the end he 
          sings I'm on My Way and goes to New York to find Bess, he throws his 
          crutches away and walks... a miracle has happened.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

        is impossible to mention on this page all the performances that took place 
        over the years. An interesting name but unexpectedly linked for once to 
        Gershwin&acute;s masterpiece is that of Nicolaus Harnoncourt. He conducted 
        the Arnold Schoenberg Choir and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in performances 
        given in Graz (Austria) to the occasion of Harnoncourt's 80th birthday. 
        Harnoncourt included African drums and the Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg Choir 
        had to study the Galla dialect! Main performers were Jonathan Lemalu (Porgy), 
        Isabelle Kabatu (Bess), and Angela Renee Simpson (Serena). Samples of 
        this performance can be found on <b><img src="knlinkedpage.jpg" width="13" height="14" align="absmiddle"></b></font> 
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#CCCCCC"><b><a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/recsradio/radio/B002R5V7LM/ref=pd_krex_dp_001_001?ie=UTF8&track=001&disc=001">RCA</a></b>. 
        Gershwin lovers are devided over this performance and recording. The immediate 
        question is: Is it Porgy &amp; Bess with a baroque flavour or is it a 
        revolutionnary performance which will take the listener to the heart of 
        the story and the score? One thing is sure. The Harnoncourt recording 
        is different and it seems that the aim was to render the score in a metaculously 
        detailed fashion. But what is also true is that some of the soul is missing 
        and therefor this performance is more for the classical music oriented 
        person than for the lover of the authenticity of Gershwin's masterpiece 
        which had been so amply given in the 1951 Lehman/Lieberson production.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

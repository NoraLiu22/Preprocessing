<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
The Digital Library Initiative (DLI) projects, funded jointly
by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA), and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) began about a year ago. Their user study
teams have already produced some valuable findings and described
some provocative theoretical and methodological challenges.  From
my vantage point as coordinator of the University of Illinois
DLI Social Science team, I will highlight the efforts of the six
projects to communicate with each other about user research. 
Links to the DLI project home pages and to some of the papers
published by project members have been included for more in-depth
coverage of some of the issues summarized.  In this article, I
will also discuss the upcoming Allerton Institute at the University
of Illinois, a methodological forum on digital library use that
will provide another means for researchers in a variety of disciplines
and settings to share their ideas and concerns about the conduct
of social science research related to digital library use.
<H3>The Growth of Digital Libraries and the Challenge of Understanding
Their Use</H3>

<P>
Improvements in information technologies and increased support
directed towards our national information infrastructure have
led to the development of a wide range of digital library collections
and services. Academic, special, and public libraries are implementing
on-line systems that provide their patrons with electronic access
to library catalogs and a variety of other information resources.
NASA is developing on-line collections of images and data for
scientists and engineers. Museums are digitizing their collections
and making them available on the Internet. Members of scientific
communities are building collaboratories to support their work
and communication. Publishers are experimenting with the creation
of digital archives of their journals and books. And individuals
and groups from all walks of life are using community-based networks
to provide local and global access to information resources they
have created. In addition to this array of existing networked
information tools and resources--all of which can be thought of
as variations on theme of the digital library or as pieces and
layers of the digital information infrastructure--research and
development projects related to building the next generation of
digital library systems are also flourishing.
<P>
Digital libraries pose fascinating socio-technical challenges
for understanding their use. Those supporting the construction
of digital libraries are naturally concerned that their investments
pay off in terms of attracting users and making information services
more effective and efficient. The design and evaluation of digital
libraries, however, are complicated by the newness of the systems,
their ability to integrate a range of functions that were previously
designed and evaluated separately, the heterogeneity of their
user population, the physically distributed nature of usage, the
ability to fragment and rearrange previously integrated documents
and images, and the rapid versioning of digital objects. Appropriate
user-centered research objectives, measures, and methods for the
digital library are just beginning to emerge.
<P>
Results from user studies can help digital library designers and
policymakers formulate appropriate goals, arrive at a more complete
understanding of costs and benefits, design and allocate resources
to both technologies and programs that offer the best means of
achieving goals, and assess the degree to which network policies
and programs have achieved their stated goals. Granted, determining
(let alone predicting) impacts from information technology at
the individual, organizational, and societal levels is notoriously
difficult. But without such investigations, the views, needs,
and experiences of individual information creators and consumers
will be lost in the push and pull of constituencies with more
powerful and direct voices in the process of building digital
libraries, a process in which users themselves are all too apt
to be considered mere passive consumers in the technology-implementation
chain.
<P>
How can we learn more about the use and users of digital libraries?
How can people involved in user-centered studies associated with
the vastly different kinds of digital library initiatives described
above share their ideas, concerns, methodological approaches,
and findings? I would like to turn now to describing digital library
user research, and mechanisms for sharing that research, that
I have become involved with as a participant in the NSF/ARPA/NASA
Digital Library Initiative.
<H3>Synchronizing Work Across the Six DLI Projects: The Role of
the User Research Working Group</H3>

<P>
With encouragement from project sponsors, we have established
an informal DLI-wide User Research Working Group. The motivation
for the working group stems from our sense that the six DLI projects
are similar enough that we can learn from each others' experiences.
In addition, we have found that each user research group has different
strengths. While our group at University of Illinois, for example,
is especially strong in ethnographic approaches to studying system
use, other groups have had more experience with conducting usability
tests and designing system instrumentation.  Common problems include
the need to develop new methods for tracking distributed &quot;virtual&quot;
users, difficulties in integrating and making sense of data vrom
various quantitative and qualitative sources, and dealing with
a large and heterogeneous user population.
<P>
For this first year, our interactions have been somewhat limited
in scope and informal in nature. We get together twice a year
at the DLI synchronization meetings and have set up a mailing
list for working group members. At the Spring 1995 meeting, we
discussed our basic approaches to user evaluation and the recognition
that evaluation can proceed at different levels, to reach different
goals. Summarizing our discussion, Karen Drabenstott of the University
of Michigan suggested the following schema for evaluation levels:
<MENU>
<LI>Adequacy of the collection, functionality, interface, usability.
<LI>Search and retrieval performance and behavior.
<LI>Effect on work of users, fundamental changes in processes
<LI>Public policy implications
</MENU>

<P>
It was clear that the six projects are devoting varying amounts
of attention to each of these evaluation levels.
<P>
We also realized that there were a number of unresolved issues
confronting virtually all the user research groups. We discussed
the way, for example, in which the new phenomena engendered by
digital library technology lead to exploring unfamiliar methods
and conceptual realms. Another major dilemma we all faced was
figuring out how best to produce useful results for our system
designers. Problems arose in juggling conflicting schedules, maintaining
effective communication, and knowing how to make our findings
operational. We concluded that there were new pulls on both system
designers (new ways of thinking about use and users) and social
scientists (new approaches to studying systems), so that it was
important to try to keep dialogue open among users, sponsors,
social scientists, and computer scientists.
<P>
We agreed that members of our cross-project working group would
present a status report on goals, methods, results, and problems
for each synchronization meeting. We also agreed that we would
try to facilitate cross-team sharing through posting our working
papers, including instruments, on our project home pages, and
that members from each project would complete brief user research
&quot;templates&quot; (see Figure 1) to describe their work.<HR>

<P>
Based on information provided by members of each DLI project,
I have prepared capsule descriptions of each project's user research
efforts (<A HREF="http://anshar.grainger.uiuc.edu/dlisoc/home_page.html/user_research_wg">http://anshar.grainger.uiuc.edu/dlisoc/home_page.html/user_research_wg</A>).
<H3>Building Understanding Beyond the DLI Projects: The Allerton
Institute</H3>

<P>
One recommendation that arose from the User Research Working Group
at the Fall 1994 DLI synchronization meeting was to find a way
that we could get together with other interested researchers to
explore methodological approaches associated with the use of digital
libraries. This recommendation has been realized in the 1995 Allerton
Institute conducted by the Graduate School of Library and Information
Science at the University of Illinois, titled &quot;How We Do
User-Centered Design and Evaluation of Digital Libraries: A Methodological
Forum.&quot; The Institute, sponsored by the National Science
Foundation (NSF), will be held on October 29-31.
<P>
As chairperson, my goal is to bring together an interdisciplinary
group of researchers and practitioners involved in the design
and study of information systems, in user-centered research in
traditional libraries, and in a wide range of digital library
projects. The purpose of the forum is to present both the range
of user-centered methods available for studying digital libraries
and rationales for choosing amongst them; we also want to look
ahead to new methods and developments and map out the challenges
that lie ahead. This methodological forum will give the 60 invited
participants an opportunity to share their expertise, experiences,
and ideas with their peers in a relaxed environment. Forum activities
will be devoted to issues such as:
<MENU>
<LI>What are appropriate measures for gauging digital library
outcomes at the individual, group, institutional, and global levels?
<LI>How can we best incorporate knowledge of user needs and behavior
in designing digital library interactions and interfaces?
<LI>What do we need to know about how people use electronic texts
and how can we gain this knowledge and apply it to the development
of digital libraries?
<LI>What can we learn from studies of traditional library use?
<LI>How can we develop an understanding of the computerization
of library work that will help as digital systems are incorporated
into current institutional practices?
<LI>How can we deal with the ethical, practical, and conceptual
issues that arise in the remote observation of on-line (and off-line)
behavior on a very large scale?
<LI>How do we foster effective communication among digital library
designers, users, and social science researchers?
</MENU>

<P>
Each participant submitted a brief discussion document outlining
their work and the issues they were most eager to explore. These
papers were used to develop the five major Institute sessions,
which will focus on co-design approaches, work practice and institutional
change, migrating foundational approaches to virtual library environment,
electronic information seeking behavior, and understanding diversity
and change. Participants include researchers from the fields of
Computer Science, Sociology, Library and Information Science,
Education, and Psychology who are involved in digital library
projects in a wide range of settings. Presentations will be given
by a number of participants, including Michael Twidale, Annelise
Mark Pejtersen, William L. Anderson and Susan L. Anderson, F.
W. Lancaster, Andrew Dillon, John M. Carroll, Brenda Dervin, Rob
Kling, Chip Bruce, and Gary Marchionini. Discussion documents
from participants, plus perhaps other related material from the
Institute, will be made publicly available at some point after
the Institute.
<P>
I hope that the user research efforts of the DLI projects, along
with the ideas arising from the Allerton Institute, will help
in building a framework for understanding the use and implications
of digital information infrastructure, as our research methods,
systems, and expectations of systems continually evolve.  By situating
the study of DLI testbed use within the broader context of professional
work and social practices, I believe we will gain more robust
insights into the functions and features that will make digital
libraries more effective.  In addition, we will get a sense of
large-scale changes in work and cognition that occur as the nation's
entire information infrastructure begins to change.

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: Published in the

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 174]]</font> It has been 
          well said that no man is good enough to have absolute power over another, 
          and the same may be said with still greater certainty of nations. It 
          almost invariably happens that when any such despotism is attempted 
          both the rulers and the men or nations who are governed by them suffer 
          in character even more than in material results. It is now universally 
          admitted that actual slavery produces these evil consequences to the 
          individuals concerned, while few will deny that they are almost equally 
          clear in the case of nations, often leading to the downfall or deterioration 
          of the ruling state. Assyria and Egypt, Greece and Rome, are examples 
          from the ancient world, while in more recent times we have the disastrous 
          results of her vast American conquests to Spain, of the Napoleonic empire 
          to France, of Ireland, India, North America, and South Africa to England. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all these cases, just in proportion as despotic 
          rule has been enforced, discontent, rebellion, and devastating wars 
          have been the result; while on the other hand, whenever subject peoples, 
          whether civilised, barbarian, or savage, have been permitted either 
          wholly or partially to govern themselves, peace and contentment have 
          followed to the equal benefit of both parties. As illustrative of such 
          happy results we need only mention Penn and Lord Elgin in North America, 
          Lord Lawrence in the Punjaub, and Sir James Brooke in Borneo. Equally 
          suggestive is the fact, that some of the best governed and most contented 
          parts of India to-day, are to be found among the Native Provinces, <font color="990000">[[p. 
          175]]</font> ruled by their hereditary or native chiefs with the advice 
          of a British Resident and protection from external enemies by the British 
          Government. So in South Africa, Basutoland and Bechuanaland, governed 
          by native law and custom under their own chiefs, assisted by the sympathetic 
          advice of a British Resident Commissioner, are thoroughly contented; 
          but this happy state of things is only preserved by the strict prohibition 
          of European settlement, and thus of the exploitation and so-called development 
          of the country with its inevitable consequence, the deterioration both 
          of the native and the European. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely these examples are of so striking a nature 
          as to deserve our careful consideration, and we may well ask ourselves 
          whether it is not possible to learn from them how to deal with those 
          more complex and more difficult cases where two antagonistic races are 
          more or less intermingled, and where the actual state of things is unsatisfactory 
          to both, ranging from smouldering discontent as in many parts of India, 
          to more open disaffection and resentment sometimes rising to what we 
          term rebellion, as we now see in parts of South Africa.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fundamental reason of success and failure in 
          these several cases, is, that where we have succeeded we have done so 
          by giving to the inferior race our protection and our advice, through 
          some man of high character in sympathy with those he lives among and 
          who exercises the minimum of compulsion. We have acted as the disinterested 
          friend, not as the mere self-interested conqueror and despotic ruler. 
          However much we may protest to the contrary, the latter is our position 
          in South Africa to-day, and it is also our position over the larger 
          part of India. In both these countries we make laws affecting the coloured 
          races without consulting them in any way, and however much these laws 
          may conflict with their mode of life, their customs, or their prejudices, 
          we enforce them by means of armed police or bodies of troops, and if 
          they resist we dub them rebels and remorselessly destroy them by means 
          of our overwhelming superiority in arms.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those cases where a large coloured population 
          inhabits the same territory with a much smaller body of whites, we <font color="990000">[[p. 
          176]]</font> not only enforce against them our complex machinery of 
          law and punishment, but we also often make special laws or regulations 
          against the coloured races, which have the effect of stamping them with 
          the badge of inferiority and serfdom. This treatment is the more galling 
          to them now, because we have for many years striven to convert them 
          to our religion, and have either educated them or assisted them to educate 
          themselves, with the result that considerable numbers of them are now 
          better educated and more truly civilised than a considerable number 
          of the low-class Europeans who despise and ill-treat them. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident that we have here a state of things 
          which cannot go on indefinitely. We have drifted into it without any 
          forecast of the necessary consequences. One set of influences and one 
          trend of opinion, most prevalent in the Colonies, leads to the belief 
          that the natives are the predestined servants or serfs of the whites, 
          and sees no reason why they should not for ever be thus treated, kept 
          in their place by force if necessary, and denied all the rights of freemen 
          or of equals. On the other side we have the religious world and the 
          philanthropists at home who have always exerted themselves to convert 
          the natives to Christianity, to educate them, to force upon them our 
          complex civilisation, and to claim for them, though rather half-heartedly, 
          equal political and social rights. These persons almost ignore the antipathies 
          and ingrained prejudices which everywhere manifest themselves where 
          white and dark races are forced to live together, and which even the 
          loudly proclaimed belief in the brotherhood of man, the equality of 
          rights and the teachings of Christianity, are powerless to overcome.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a calm consideration of the whole problem it 
          must be admitted that the former point of view--that of inherently superior 
          and inferior races--of master and servant, ruler and ruled, is the most 
          consistent with actual facts and perhaps not the less fitted to ensure 
          the well-being, contentment, and ultimate civilisation of the inferior 
          race. It is also by no means incompatible with a just treatment of the 
          native, with sympathetic interest in his welfare, and with the grant 
          of a considerable amount of <font color="990000">[[p. 177]]</font> self-government; 
          and it is for the purpose of suggesting how this latter may be effected 
          that I am venturing to make a slight contribution to this very thorny 
          subject. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty is of course very much increased 
          in the case of a self-governing colony, composed largely of people who 
          are seeking for wealth through the labour of the natives in agriculture 
          or in various forms of commerce or industry, and whose interests and 
          prejudices largely influence the government. It is therefore unwise, 
          when the proportion of whites to natives is very small, to grant self-government 
          to such a colony unless special reservations are made for the protection 
          of the natives. At the present time there is a strong desire for self-government 
          in Trinidad, and perhaps in some other West Indian islands, but it is 
          asked for by the white traders and planters for the express purpose 
          of obtaining complete power over the coloured labouring classes, free 
          from what they consider the harassing regulations for their protection 
          now in force. But as there is in the island a large population of negroes 
          and mulattoes as well as coolies from India, races very antipathetic 
          to each other, even the greatest friends of self-government consider 
          that in this case it would certainly lead to injurious results.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same difficulties occur in the case of the new 
          colonies in South Africa and especially in Natal, where besides the 
          very large number of natives there are also Indians in nearly equal 
          numbers with the Europeans. The extreme diversity of ideas, customs, 
          laws, and religion between these two dark races, renders the application 
          of our laws and regulations to both of them, extremely irritating and 
          often unjust; while, when the two coloured races come into conflict, 
          the methods of our ordinary courts of justice are quite unfitted to 
          hold the balance fairly between them. Hence there almost always arises 
          a sense of injustice and oppression, which is increased by the fact 
          that in many cases these people are well educated and have very strong 
          feelings in regard to infringements of their personal freedom or the 
          sanctity of their homes.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, now, we are to be guided by the varied experience 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 178]]</font> in all parts of the world here 
          briefly referred to, it becomes clear that in handing over the government 
          of Zululand to the Governor of Natal, who is necessarily very largely 
          influenced by local opinion, a great mistake was made, which should 
          be at once retraced and the country administered in the same way as 
          the other protected states under the direct supervision of the home 
          government, and with the same sympathetic consideration for native habits 
          and prejudices as in the other Protectorates. Looking at this matter 
          merely from a Colonial point of view, it would surely be better for 
          Natal to have as a neighbour a contented and prosperous native state, 
          with which a considerable trade would arise, and which would, as the 
          population increased, afford a large amount of native labour when required. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now approach the main problem, which is, how 
          to provide some amount of self-government for the native population 
          of Natal and of the two new Boer Colonies, so as to satisfy to some 
          extent the just demands of the educated and civilised portion of the 
          natives, and to do this without exciting the strong and very natural 
          opposition to any suggestion of putting the coloured races on a political 
          equality with the whites. What we have to aim at is, in the first place, 
          to diminish the sense of injustice now felt by the educated and christianised 
          natives, at being treated as a subject and degraded race, despotically 
          ruled by aliens who, for the most part, take no account whatever of 
          their feelings and claims as British subjects and fellow Christians. 
          In the second place, we must proceed tentatively so as not to arouse 
          antagonism in the ruling race, our aim being to give the better and 
          higher among the natives an opportunity of freely stating their political 
          and social grievances, so as to influence the legislature towards a 
          more just and sympathetic treatment of them.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first and most obvious thing to do is to give 
          to the natives in every district of each Colony one or more chiefs or 
          magistrates of their own race, chosen from the native clergy or schoolmasters 
          or any other adequately qualified individuals. These native magistrates 
          should sit with the ordinary magistrates, and in all cases, criminal 
          or civil, <font color="990000">[[p. 179]]</font> where both natives 
          and Europeans were concerned, would act as the official protector or 
          advocate for the native in the interests of justice, and for the purpose 
          of putting the native point of view before the European magistrate or 
          judge, who would alone be responsible for the decision of the court. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of disputes between or crimes by natives, 
          in which no whites were concerned, the native magistrate would hear 
          and decide the matter according to native law and custom, but modified 
          where necessary in accordance with European law. Here too the Colonial 
          magistrate would (at first) preside over the court, giving advice and 
          suggestions to the native magistrate; but except in very difficult or 
          important cases would allow the native magistrate to give the judgment 
          of the court.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way it seems to me not only would much hardship 
          and injustice to natives be avoided, but the effect on the native mind 
          generally would be most beneficial, by showing a full recognition of 
          their rights in the very large and complex department of the administration 
          of justice. The association of the two races in this way would also 
          have an important educational influence on both. The native magistrate 
          would learn much from frequent official intercourse with an educated 
          European, while he would gain thereby a dignity and influence among 
          his countrymen which he would value highly, and which would have an 
          important and beneficial influence on his own character and conduct. 
          On the other side the European magistrate would be equally or even more 
          benefited, since by association with educated natives in the hearing 
          of the infinitely varied cases that come before him, he would acquire 
          a knowledge of native character, customs, and feelings which he could 
          obtain in no other way, and which might have an important influence 
          on the welfare of the community, when, in after years, some of these 
          magistrates became members of the legislature.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another step of very great value and importance 
          would be the introduction into all local authorities, such as education 
          boards, district councils, town councils, etc., of one or more educated 
          natives of each nationality (Kaffir or Indian) chosen to represent their 
          fellow-countrymen, and to express <font color="990000">[[p. 180]]</font> 
          their views and wishes as to any bye-laws or regulations which they 
          found to be oppressive and unjust. Even if these representatives of 
          the coloured races did not have votes, their constant presence at meetings, 
          their right to protest against oppressive or one-sided regulations, 
          often made in ignorance of the effects produced by them, could not fail 
          to be of great value. They would also be able to bring before the authorities 
          all cases of cruel or unfair treatment of natives by the police, a matter 
          of the greatest importance in all countries, and especially in those 
          where there are antagonisms of race. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here again the educational influence on the ruling 
          class of constant official communication with some of the best among 
          the native races would certainly be very great, and would probably lead 
          in time to a better understanding between them than has been created 
          by the present system of aggressive rule of a superior caste over their 
          serfs.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps more important still would be the application 
          of the same principle to the Colonial legislature itself in both chambers. 
          The native representatives need be few in number--perhaps three or four 
          in the lower and one or two in the upper house, the object being in 
          no sense to place the coloured race on an equality with the white, but 
          to provide each branch of the legislature with accurate and precise 
          information as to how both existing and proposed laws affect the natives, 
          how and why they feel themselves injured or oppressed by them, and thus 
          enable modifications to be made which, though apparently of trifling 
          importance, may make all the difference between a condition of constant 
          irritation and one of cheerful acquiescence.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the mode of election of these native representatives 
          it would be best to leave it largely to themselves to suggest the best 
          method. It would probably be most in accordance with their customs for 
          local chiefs, ministers of religion, teachers, etc., to meet together 
          and nominate perhaps twice the number of members required. From these 
          names the Governor of the Colony, after due inquiry among local magistrates 
          or others well acquainted with the natives, would choose the members, 
          who would thus be not only elected by their countrymen, but nominated 
          by the Governor <font color="990000">[[p. 181]]</font> as the representative 
          of the Crown. As the chief function of these members would be consultative 
          and educational as regards the opinions and feelings of the natives, 
          it would not much matter whether they had votes or not; but I do not 
          think it would be necessary or wise to make any invidious distinction 
          against them, as their very limited numbers would not give them any 
          real power except in cases where public opinion was already nearly equally 
          divided as to the advisability of the legislation in question. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, I think, almost impossible to exaggerate 
          the beneficial influence of some such small share in the government 
          of a country as here suggested being awarded to the natives. Not only 
          would it diminish, and in time destroy, the sense of injustice and oppression 
          that now so largely prevails among the native races, but it would greatly 
          extend mutual knowledge and give rise to that mutual respect which generally 
          exists when men of different races and civilisations come to know each 
          other intimately. It is to be hoped that in the constitutions now being 
          elaborated for the two Colonies we have so recently devastated and conquered, 
          some instalment, however small, of such a concession to just principles 
          may be introduced; and, that powers may be reserved by the Crown for 
          a further extension of the principle whenever it seems advisable. If 
          that is done, and the results are found to be beneficial, other self-governing 
          colonies may find it advantageous to adopt the plan.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as we possess colonies in which a considerable 
          native population still exists we should, I think, always retain our 
          guardianship of those natives in order to protect them from the oppression 
          and cruelty which always occurs when a young, and mainly wealth-seeking 
          community has absolute power over them. Where these natives are numerous 
          and energetic, and are rapidly acquiring our education, our religion, 
          and the outward form at all events of our civilisation, things cannot 
          remain as they are. What the ultimate condition of such mixed communities 
          may be it is difficult to say, but, whatever the future may have in 
          store for us, it is certain that a method which recognises that the 
          coloured <font color="990000">[[p. 182]]</font> races are men of fundamentally 
          the same nature as ourselves, and which aims at developing the best 
          that is in them, by granting them some at least of the elementary rights 
          of men and citizens, is more likely to bring about a satisfactory solution 
          of this difficult problem, than that system of contemptuous superiority 
          and denial of all political and social claims that has hitherto so largely 
          prevailed. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having no personal knowledge of the country more 
          particularly referred to in this article, I only put forward my views 
          in a suggestive form. Forty years ago I had the privilege of enjoying 
          the friendship of Sir James Brooke, and, during more than a year's residence 
          in Sarawak, of observing the mode and results of his beneficent and 
          sympathetic rule over antagonistic native races. A little later I spent 
          several months in North Celebes, in Java, and in East Sumatra, where 
          I had full opportunity of noticing the effects of the judicious rule 
          of the Dutch, almost wholly exerted through native chieftains. For nearly 
          twelve years I travelled and lived mostly among uncivilised or completely 
          savage races, and I became convinced that they all possessed good qualities, 
          some of them in a very remarkable degree, and that in all the great 
          characteristics of humanity they are wonderfully like ourselves. Some, 
          indeed, among the brown Polynesians especially, are declared by numerous 
          independent and unprejudiced observers, to be both physically, morally, 
          and intellectually our equals, if not our superiors; and it has always 
          seemed to me one of the disgraces of our civilisation that these fine 
          people have not in a single case been protected from contamination by 
          the vices and follies of our more degraded classes, and allowed to develope 
          their own social and political organism under the advice of some of 
          our best and wisest men and the protection of our world-wide power. 
          That would have been indeed a worthy trophy of our civilisation. What 
          we have actually done, and left undone, resulting in the degradation 
          and lingering extermination of so fine a people, is one of the most 
          pathetic of its tragedies.</p>

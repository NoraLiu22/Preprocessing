As such, the region features six of Japan\u0026#39;s most rural prefectures; from\u0026nbsp;Yamagata\u0026nbsp;to\u0026nbsp;Aomori\u0026nbsp;to the very north of Honshū. Sitting higher on the northern hemisphere, Tōhoku experiences cooler summer temperatures but also harsher winters. With the advent of the \u003cem\u003eshinkansen\u003c/em\u003e bullet train and a great range of domestic airports, it is simple to travel to all six of Tōhoku\u0026#39;s prefectures either on land or by air. For example, you can reach\u0026nbsp;Shin-Aomori\u0026nbsp;station from Tōkyō station in roughly three hours \u0026ndash; a distance of nearly 700 km. From there, regional trains and buses reach out across the region, allowing visitors and residents to travel around easily from town to town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ctable align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:90%\"\u003e\n\t\u003ctbody\u003e\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://static-oku.diqit.io/uploads/oku/000000982-1666833213399.jpg\" width=\"300\" /\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color:rgba(220,220,220,0.5)\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" width=\"15\" /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e​\u003c/td\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://static-oku.diqit.io/uploads/oku/00000167-1666833151338.jpg\" width=\"300\" /\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color:rgba(220,220,220,0.5)\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" width=\"15\" /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e​\u003c/td\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://static-oku.diqit.io/uploads/oku/walking-1666833264287.jpg\" width=\"300\" /\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color:rgba(220,220,220,0.5)\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" width=\"15\" /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e​\u003c/td\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/tr\u003e\n\t\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:20px\"\u003eHighlights of Northern Japan\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify\"\u003eTōhoku was traditionally considered the granary of Japan thanks in part to the city of Sendai being the key supplier of rice to Tōkyō markets, where it provided 20 percent of the entire nation\u0026#39;s rice.

JTB Australia who we chose to book our whole tour with due to their knowledge of Japan recommended OKU JAPAN for the Komuno Kodo trail walk. A 3 night 4 day walk across the Kii Peninsular was arranged from Kii-Tanabe on the west coast to Hongu in the centre.\n\nOur walk itinerary, maps and a waterproof plastic map holder were delivered to our Kyoto hotel to meet us on arrival as promised.\n\nSure enough the first challenging day greeted us with heavy rain, with all clothing including shoes and packs saturated - but for our waterproof itinerary and maps!\n\nThe walk was quite challenging at times, but very satisfying, with a number of shrines and villages visited, and comprehensive notes on the deep historical origins of the walk.\n\nThe accommodation ranged from a small Ryokan, to a private homestay, and finally a luxury onsen “spa hotel”. They were very different and interesting, and two meals and a packed lunch were provided each day and bags forwarded without fault.\n\nThe highlight of our OKU JAPAN experience though was how we were cared for when my wallet was lost on the second day of the walk. Without exception we were told you will get it back, you can trust Japanese who are so very honest, which turned out to be right.\n\nOn arrival at Chikatsuyu where the OKU office is based we went straight to the OKU JAPAN office in the centre of the village. There we met Satoe and Mayumi who welcomed us partner like family. After offering tea or coffee, phone calls were made to our hosts the previous night, the owners of a cafe at the base of the main climb for the day, and the police. Then because I had developed a painful groin injury we were driven to the local supermarket to buy some treats.\n\nThe following afternoon we received a delightful call from Mayumi at OKU advising that my wallet had been handed in to the cafe, with all contents in place, and that the Chikatsuyu Police would deliver it to me that evening.\n\nI was so pleased to have my wallet with cash, credit cards and driver’s licence returned in tact. Most of all I was so impressed by the efficiency, courtesy and kindness shown by Satoe and Mayumi in the OKU JAPAN Chikatsuyu office.

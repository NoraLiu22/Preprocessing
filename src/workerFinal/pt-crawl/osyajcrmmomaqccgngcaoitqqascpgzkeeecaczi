          <b>Abstract</b>: The naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) has 
          for many years been standing in the shadow of his more famed co-discoverer 
          of the principle of natural selection, Charles Darwin. Despite outward 
          similarities between the two men's formulation of the principle, however, 
          Wallace had fit his appreciation of natural selection into views on 
          evolution that were quite different from Darwin's. A closer examination 
          of what Wallace had in mind suggests a model of process in which natural 
          selection <EM>per se</EM> acts as the negative feedback mechanism (actually, 
          a "state space") in the relation between population and environment, 
          and environmental engagement as made possible by the resulting selection 
          of traits acts as the positive feedback part of the cycle. Thus, it 
          may be better to contextualize adaptive structures as entropy-relaying 
          biogeochemical facilitators that only "generate a potential for evolution" 
          than to portray them as the end results of evolution. This systems point 
          of view better lends itself to appreciations of the biogeographical 
          context of evolution than does the tree-thinking of a more conventional 
          style of speciation-focused Darwinism, which sometimes confuses process 
          with result. <b>Keywords</b>: Alfred Russel Wallace, natural selection,

</blockquote>
      <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an international biogeography society should 
        name an award after Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) is both natural 
        and appropriate: he is, after all, the acknowledged "father" of the modern 
        study of the subject (or at the very least of zoogeography, one of its 
        two main subdivisions). That being so, there are probably very few among 
        us here who are not at least generally familiar with his life and contributions 
        in this realm. Very briefly, it was Wallace who, along with Darwin, gave 
        us the model--natural selection--that sustains a dynamic view of the subject; 
        he also made fundamental contributions to a variety of more specific studies, 
        for example: the nature of island biotas, the process of corridor dispersal, 
        the connection between glacial epochs and distribution patterns, the relation 
        of river barriers to species divergence, the systematic study of regional 
        biotas--and last but not least--astrobiology, and in particular the ecoclimatological 
        study of extraterrestrial surface environments. We should perhaps additionally 
        remind ourselves that many observers also regard Wallace not only as the 
        leading tropical regions naturalist in history, but perhaps, in more general 
        terms yet, as its pre-eminent field biologist overall.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of dwelling on the obvious, I would prefer 
        to focus here on what I personally feel is Wallace's most important legacy 
        for biogeographical studies: one which, I submit, does not reduce to a 
        matter of history alone. This concerns how he was able to bring together 
        historical and ecological approaches to the study of biogeography--and 
        in a fashion capable of sustaining a logical process of investigation 
        not only into the twentieth century, but on to the twenty-first as well. 
        To understand how Wallace came to such a synthesis, we need return ourselves 
        to his days as a young naturalist, traipsing through the tropical forests 
        of the Amazon and Malay Archipelago.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point--the early and mid 1850s--Wallace 
        was pursuing a research program that hinged on one understanding that 
        most observers of today, knowing what we know of <font color="990000">[[p. 
        1510]]</font> his later writings, should find surprising. Specifically, 
        he was operating under the assumption that characteristic organismal traits 
        were <EM>not</EM> necessarily functionally utilitarian. Two or three of 
        his early writings are quite clear on this score (see especially Wallace, 
        1853, 1856); he probably felt this way largely because it appeared that 
        to embrace notions of necessary function was to support a view of a preordained 
        existence akin to, or exactly the same as, a first causes-based creationism. 
        What, then, was his provisional working model of how the evolution of 
        species proceeded? Although the evidence is not yet absolutely conclusive, 
        he appears to have adopted a <EM>final</EM> causes-based scheme--one that 
        looked to some fairly subtle or remote environmental influence as pulling 
        the strings. In this understanding, individual adaptations were to a certain 
        degree incidental, coming into being for unknown reasons, and then promoted 
        or overturned by forces extending well beyond the level of populations, 
        much less individual organisms.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An environmentally deterministic presence of 
        this type might be expected to relay various signs of its enactment through 
        the characteristic results of distribution and adaptation it yielded, 
        so Wallace made it his business to look for such. When in good time he 
        felt he had accumulated enough evidence to characterize one such result--the 
        spatial-temporal pattern of divergence of species lines--he issued the 
        paper "On the Law Which Has Regulated the Introduction of New Species" 
        (Wallace, 1855). This featured his famous "Sarawak law," the notion that 
        "Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time 
        with a pre-existing closely allied species." The essence of this law, 
        which many have marked as the dawn of modern biogeographical studies, 
        has sometimes been forgotten: far from being a prescription for dispersalism, 
        it is more the archetypal example of tree-thinking. Some might argue, 
        therefore (and some have: see, for example, Michaux, 1991), that it looks 
        ahead more to the dawn of vicariance biogeography studies than it does 
        to the kind of thinking expressed by later workers such as Matthew and 
        Simpson.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reminder, however, that despite his embrace 
        of this principle--which we still endorse today--Wallace was not yet at 
        this point a believer in the necessary utility of adaptive characters. 
        In a little-known paper on the orangutan published a year <EM>after</EM> 
        the Sarawak essay, he continues to state in the most explicit terms his 
        belief that many adaptive structures have no functional value:</P>
<blockquote>
        <P><font size="-1">Do you mean to assert, then, some of my readers will 
          indignantly ask, that this animal, or any animal, is provided with organs 
          which are of no use to it? Yes, we reply, we do mean to assert that 
          many animals are provided with organs and appendages which serve no 
          material or physical purpose. The extraordinary excrescences of many 
          insects, the fantastic and many-coloured plumes which adorn certain 
          birds, the excessively developed horns in some of the antelopes, the 
          colours and infinitely modified forms of many flower-petals, are all 
          cases, for an explanation of which we must look to some general principle 
          far more recondite than a simple relation to the necessities of the 
          individual (Wallace, 1856, p. 30).</font></P>
      </blockquote>


      <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, something was going to have to give. 
        Wallace had for all intensive purposes shown through his Sarawak law that 
        evolution did in fact take place, but so far all he had was an inductive 
        demonstration of its results, and no model of ecological or population 
        dynamics that could <EM>explain</EM> those results. Wallace had always 
        recognized the importance of morphological features in characterizing 
        the basic differences among species, of course, but apparently he was 
        still expecting to identify a final cause that bore ultimate responsibility 
        for guiding the longer-term fates of these various outcomes. Much later, 
        in his autobiography <EM>My Life</EM> (Wallace, 1905, Vol. 1, p. 360), 
        he would refer to this time as a period during which he believed it would 
        be impossible to understand how and why every individual adaptation had 
        come about: seemingly, no one causal process could be held responsible.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in early 1858, during a bout with malaria, 
        and while he was thinking about the writings of Thomas Malthus on population 
        controls, the solution came to him. It was simple, actually: as he had 
        thought, adaptations were not preordained; there was enough variation 
        within every population to respond adaptively to the multi-causal constraints 
        and opportunities afforded by environment, and enough time to allow all 
        the relative probabilities of operationalization success to play themselves 
        out.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a man named Charles Darwin had experienced 
        a not wholly dissimilar revelation some years earlier, and as events transpired 
        it was Darwin who would end up monopolizing the stage in the theatre of 
        nineteenth and twentieth century evolutionary studies. And while it is 
        true that the two men's conceptualizations of the principle had much in 
        common, there are also important differences between the Darwinian and 
        Wallaceian versions of natural selection--including one which, I now suggest, 
        will ultimately go in Wallace's favor.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, though no mean observer of living things, 
        tended to think linearly--more like a geologist than an ecologist or geographer--when 
        pondering the mysteries of organic change. Indeed, "tree-thinking" was 
        his forte, and he could not help but look upon the key concept of adaptation 
        as both a process and a result. To this day we are dominated by this view 
        that evolution as a process yields particulate results--individual adaptations, 
        creatures, and species populations--that stick out like so many little 
        twigs on the great metaphorical tree of life. Darwin and his followers 
        have been criticized for this alleged circularity in their reasoning--even 
        the phylogenetic systematists, the "twiggiest" of all evolutionists, are 
        guarded on the matter, sometimes disowning (or maybe ignoring) the more 
        contentious specifics of Darwinian theory and preferring to dwell, Wallace-like, 
        on objective facts of specimen morphology and location in space and time. 
        So far no one has seen any pressing need to abandon the greater good to 
        respond to this apparent lesser evil.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, in Wallace's model of natural selection--even 
        after 1858--there actually is no implied <EM>process</EM> of adaptation: 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 1511]]</font> there is only the logical <EM>result</EM> 
        of being adapted. For Wallace, adaptation represents a state-space: the 
        logical implication of the interplay of variation, over-achieving reproduction 
        rates, and finitely limited resources. Actually, he usually referred to 
        his brainchild as the "law" of natural selection, a usage we don't see 
        much these days. [Note in this context his attempt to "demonstrate" (his 
        word) the origin of species by natural selection through the logic of 
        necessary result on page 302 of his book <EM>Contributions to the Theory 
        of Natural Selection</EM> (Wallace, 1870)]. Wallace also has endured a 
        lot of criticism for his approach, most notably in the form of accusations 
        of hyperselectionism raised by historical science-focused naturalists 
        like the late Stephen Jay Gould. But this ambush is not really fair, as 
        Wallace only reasoned that the whole of the evolutionary process passed 
        through the natural selection filter, and not that natural selection itself 
        <EM>initiated</EM> it. In fact, he pointed out on many occasions that 
        we were largely ignorant of the laws that govern the origin of variation, 
        and it reasonably can be argued that all those subsequent theories and 
        discoveries that have been viewed as possibly overturning natural selection--e.g., 
        mutation theory, Mendelism, and more lately molecular evolution--are no 
        more than realizations of our efforts to expose inherent causes of the 
        type he alluded to.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years "Darwin versus Wallace" debates 
        over various particulars of evolutionary theory focused on other matters, 
        many of which are of limited direct interest to biogeographers: sexual 
        selection, for example, and whether natural selection can explain the 
        existence of humankind's higher faculties. Then, in 1972, some hint of 
        a possible new order arose from a rather unlikely source: an anthropologist 
        exploring some elements of the then still-emerging science of cybernetics. 
        Gregory Bateson, remembering some intriguing passages in Wallace's Ternate 
        essay likening the action of natural selection to a governor on a steam 
        engine (Wallace, 1858, p. 62), remarked in his <EM>Steps to an ecology 
        of the mind</EM> (Bateson, 1972, p. 435):</P>
<blockquote>
        <P><font size="-1">The steam engine with a governor is simply a circular 
          train of causal events, with somewhere a link in that chain such that 
          the more of something, the less of the next thing in the circuit . . 
          . If causal chains with that general characteristic are provided with 
          energy, the result will be . . . a self-corrective system. Wallace, 
          in fact, proposed the first cybernetic model . . . Basically these systems 
          are always <EM>conservative</EM> . . . in such systems changes occur 
          to conserve the truth of some descriptive statement, some component 
          of the <EM>status quo</EM>. Wallace saw the matter correctly, and natural 
          selection acts primarily to keep the species unvarying . . .</font></P>
</blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bateson was not content to let the matter go 
        at that. Later, in the collection <EM>Mind and nature: a necessary unity</EM>, 
        he added the following observations (Bateson, 1979, p. 43):</p>
<blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">If it had been Wallace instead of Darwin [who started 
          the trend], we would have had a very different theory of evolution today. 
          The whole cybernetic movement might have occurred one hundred years 
          earlier as a result of Wallace's comparison between the steam engine 
          with a governor and the process of natural selection . . .</font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bateson makes a very interesting point here, 
        but he neglects an important issue: clearly, models of the general evolutionary 
        program cannot rest <EM>entirely</EM> on negative feedback-based mechanisms 
        and explanations; it is ultimately the breaking away from such recursive 
        constraints that by definition leads to novel development. Had Bateson 
        dug a bit further he would have discovered that the evolutionary relationship 
        between negative and positive feedback relations had already been explored 
        some years earlier in an important work titled "The second cybernetics: 
        deviation-amplifying mutual causal processes" (Maruyama, 1963). In this 
        milestone paper Magoroh Maruyama describes how the information imported 
        to an organism from the environment mediates two kinds of feedback: deviation-countering 
        processes (negative feedbacks) which tend to enforce equilibrium conditions, 
        and deviation-amplifying processes (positive feedbacks), which cause systems 
        to change in directions either of greater or of lesser order. While Maruyama's 
        perspective helps us understand how a living system might be looked at 
        as being either or both equilibrium conserving and equilibrium countering, 
        however, it still does not specify the conditions under which directions 
        of "greater or lesser order" might be obtained; <EM>i.e.</EM>, what is 
        it in the longer term evolutionary sense that tips the scales in favour 
        of greater order?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question leads us back to Wallace, and an 
        opportunity to re-examine some fundamental aspects of the relation between 
        biogeography and natural selection. We can begin by entertaining the notion 
        that Wallace's initial struggle to understand the adaptive process might 
        have been due to his early inability to distinguish between the negative 
        and positive feedback components of the system. As Bateson pointed out, 
        the "governor-like" action of selective forces on existing adaptations 
        has the effect, over generations, of weeding out poorly adapted individuals--an 
        effect whose cumulating results may be seen in changes in morphology at 
        the individual level. Historically speaking, one might describe this as 
        "evolutionary change" or the "evolution of adaptations," but unless one 
        can show at the level of the process itself why such change need be negentropy-accumulating, 
        we are left only with an ecological reality: that adaptive structures 
        are but the focus of the <EM>negative</EM> feedback part of the cycle, 
        operationalizing an organismal state-space through which energy sources 
        at the surface of the earth are temporarily diverted and captured, applied 
        to do chemical and physical work, and then returned in degraded form to 
        the physical environment envelope (and ultimately out into space), maximizing 
        system entropy. From this perspective adaptations are little more than 
        one--though admittedly complex--interface in the biogeochemical cycling 
        process.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting this, one is inclined to wonder whether 
        Wallace's early preoccupation with identifying large scale, environment-level 
        forcing functions that could drive evolution might still <font color="990000">[[p. 
        1512]]</font> make sense. Adaptive <EM>structures</EM> aside, it would 
        appear to be the realization of adaptive <EM>potential</EM>--the entry 
        into new ecological involvements through organismal/population behaviour, 
        movement, and dispersal--that represents the positive feedback part of 
        the cycle leading to evolution. Because they are not one-dimensional entities, 
        organisms/populations can and do enter into new associations with their 
        environment, the result being the sorting out of gene pools into new adaptive 
        structures. Some of these are adaptive in the short term sense but not 
        in the longer term sense, producing overspecialization and, ultimately, 
        dead-ends: extinction (an example of a deviation-amplifying trend resulting 
        in a reduction of order). Others turn out to be adaptive across both time 
        scales, supporting a flexibility of genetics and structure that leads 
        to serial phylogenesis (a deviation-amplifying process yielding longer-term, 
        larger-scale, diversification, and thus higher levels of order).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that Wallace seems to have had in mind 
        an evolutionary process subservient to final causes. In his own words, 
        the "changes of organic forms" are "to keep them in harmony with the changed 
        conditions" (<EM>i.e.</EM>, of the environment, characterized very generally) 
        (Wallace, 1870, p. 302). We are not accustomed to thinking in such terms 
        in biogeography, but it may be time to reconsider our position. It should 
        be apparent from the variety of stances taken by proponents of the anthropic 
        and Gaia hypotheses that, philosophically speaking, the "final causes" 
        concept has produced the gamut of teleological mind-sets. We need not, 
        however, adopt the more extreme of these to imagine how a system as described 
        here could find its way to higher levels of order. Suppose, for example, 
        that the environment as it physically extends away from any given individual 
        organism inherently presents statistically greater survival probabilities 
        in some directions than in others. On this basis, individuals--and more 
        importantly, populations--might tend to disperse in some spatial directions 
        more easily than in others.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further suppose that these survival probabilities 
        are set by the level of optimality of delivery, directly, and indirectly, 
        of certain very basic resources--for example, and most probably, water--to 
        the adaptive structures of the organisms mediating energy transfer through 
        the system. If this is so, perhaps the degree of specification of selection 
        required to fit into the less ideal environments in this respect will 
        be more than that required to fit into more ideal ones: that is, that 
        because there is too much or too little of something vital at certain 
        times and places, a good deal more selection must go into establishing 
        adaptations that will continue to support morphostasis in those places. 
        This latter kind of selection will tend to produce the kinds of specialized 
        organisms whose populations will be at greater risk should the environment 
        change markedly at some future point.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimality" of delivery of resources must involve 
        one further consideration, however: how efficiently the living structure 
        supported can be turned over within the local ecosystem for continuing 
        re-use. The cycle of life and death in any community is such as to influence 
        the turnover rate of vital resources in the local ecosystem. Temperature 
        governs the rate of biological modification at the molecular level, but 
        here too there is an optimum, as too great a deviation from the mean is 
        bound to have negative effects on the nature of stability at the community 
        level. If one couples a surplus of water with a considerably higher than 
        average mean ambient temperature, for example, a little noted kind of 
        stress on community organization is imposed. Under these conditions in 
        tropical rain forests, great surpluses of water combined with high temperatures 
        produce leaching rates that keep soils depleted of nutrients. The effect 
        of this stress has been to force a community structure in which most of 
        the vital nutrients in the system are kept locked up in inaccessible biomass 
        at any given time: they cannot be leached out of the system, but neither 
        can they be turned over quickly enough to support productivity levels 
        that match, for example, those of midlatitude grassland systems.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding sketch describes what can be interpreted 
        as a mild form of final causation. In theory, as a population grows, it 
        should first find it easier to spread out in directions of lower environmental 
        stress as here portrayed, since the conservative "governing function" 
        of selection (&agrave; la Wallace) to fit in will not be as severe as 
        in areas of high stress. Thus, the suggestion is that <EM>all</EM> populations 
        will tend to disperse in the same preferred directions, in so doing non-randomly 
        perpetuating genetic flexibility--and, importantly, contributing to the 
        shaping of ever-more stable and resilient biogeochemical pathways. This 
        is evolution--environmentally mediated (or even directed) evolution, to 
        be sure, but not environmentally <EM>determined</EM> evolution: again, 
        as in Wallace's thinking, that which is selected for to meet the challenge 
        in any given instance constitutes <EM>whatever</EM> can be genetically 
        sorted out, in large part by trial and error, to support persistence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1980s I applied this line of reasoning 
        in my PhD thesis (Smith, 1984) and a follow-up paper (Smith, 1986) in 
        some detail. Not much came of the effort at the time, however, as this 
        was a period dominated by discussions on other ideas--notably, non-equilibrium 
        evolution, vicariance biogeography, and molecular evolution. In the two 
        works just mentioned, I suggested three immediate reasons why an emphasis 
        on this "evolution as spatial interaction" notion might be a preferable 
        starting point for complex environmental studies to "adaptation-as-evolution" 
        approaches. These considerations still, I think, are worthy of reflection:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To begin with, we are provided with means 
        lending themselves equally well to either state-space or process modelling 
        efforts. As part of a discussion concerning the non-equilibrium theory 
        of biological evolution proposed by E. O. Wiley and Dan Brooks in the 
        1980s (Wiley &amp; Brooks, 1982; Brooks &amp; Wiley, 1986), Wicken (1983, 
        p. 442) remarked that:</p>
<blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">. . . internal ordering depends on a system's ability 
          to export entropy to its environment. . . . The virtue of the thermodynamic 
          approach to evolution is its ability to connect life <EM>ecologically</EM> 
          to the rest of nature through <font color="990000">[[p. 1513]]</font> 
          shared matter and energy flows; denying the ecological component of 
          evolution, or the influence of ecology on development, badly weakens 
          (their) thermodynamic base.</font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>Wiley and Brooks's theory, though provoking a good deal of discussion 
        over the years, has seemingly run its course. They continued to defend 
        it vigorously for a time; regarding the matter of the effect of ecology 
        on evolution they only claimed to be "rejecting ecological determinism" 
        (Brooks &amp; Wiley, 1985, p. 94). In the understanding expressed here, 
        the environment does provide a forcing function, but this is viewed as 
        implemented at the community, rather than individual, level. The environment 
        can, I submit, effect direct control over what kinds of spatial interaction 
        processes operate <EM>among</EM> organisms but only very indirectly, in 
        the terminology of Brooks and Wiley (1985, p. 93), over the way each population's 
        "phase space defining the maximum number of microstates which the evolving 
        lineage could occupy" changes with time (since this phase space is, as 
        Brooks and Wiley themselves would argue, locked in as a function of the 
        particular constraints and potentials developed over the line's own history, 
        as "summarized" at any given time within its gene pool). Outside variables 
        (<EM>i.e.</EM>, environmental delivery of vital resources) may thus be 
        interpreted as defining the state-space within which organisms find themselves 
        in the immediate sense, but not in such a fashion as to subvert the "individuality" 
        of development of any given evolutionary line. This overall causal structure 
        has the obvious advantage of lending itself to ecological state-space 
        description in which the controlling variables may also be understood 
        to produce change in a way that need not be viewed as the kind of "ecological 
        determinism" Brooks and Wiley object to.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This portrayal of the complementary--but 
        still entirely separable--roles of spatial interaction and adaptation 
        solves outright the philosophical dilemma attending the earlier mentioned 
        complaint that in Darwinian thinking evolution involves a process (adaptation) 
        yielding structures (adaptation) of non-independent definition (Ghiselin, 
        1966; Grene, 1971; Gould &amp; Lewontin, 1979; Brookfield, 1982). As Lewontin 
        (1984, pp. 237-238) has put it, "The process is <EM>adaptation</EM> and 
        the end result is the state of being <EM>adapted</EM>. . . The problem 
        is how species can be at all times both adapting and adapted." When evolution 
        is understood as the characteristics of change in the spatial interaction 
        regime at the community/environment level (and not "the process of adaptation"), 
        the role of adaptive <EM>structures</EM> can be viewed as strictly ecological, 
        providing a straightforward causal picture devoid of circularity and attending 
        logical difficulties. In this role, adaptations are regarded simply (as 
        described earlier) as structural attributes matched to environmental throughput: 
        they mediate energy degradation, or, as Wicken (1983, p. 440) has put 
        it, "provide a means by which potential energy can be converted to thermal 
        entropy and released to space."</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Further, re-interpreting evolution as a spatial 
        interaction process provides a response to the complaint that the study 
        of the "evolution" of adaptations (<EM>i.e.</EM>, phylogenetic studies) 
        reduces to idiographic "narrative" (Goudge, 1961). Particular adaptations 
        are still regarded, of course, as arising in response to one-of-a-kind 
        combinations of environmental and biological circumstances; given ever-complexifying 
        genetic constraints on the way change can be implemented, we should expect 
        the exact manner in which potential energy is converted to thermal entropy 
        to remain individually unique to each population. Again, this understanding--focusing 
        on the homeostatic function of adaptation--resists any systematic biological 
        interpretation beyond the identification of when and where each novelty 
        arose (and the <EM>post-hoc</EM> narrative sequencing of this information 
        with all other such information). But when the homeorhetic function of 
        adaptive structures--spatial interaction--is emphasized, such criticism 
        is rendered moot. Following this interpretation makes it possible to think 
        of irreversible processes as leading to more than the unique structures 
        we call adaptations; specifically, to standing interaction patterns interpretable 
        on normative grounds as well: in the biological sense, as competition 
        / natural selection, and in the spatial sense as statistically interpretable 
        multi-species distribution patterns (in effect, an answer to Eldredge's 
        [1981] complaints regarding the "just so" nature of much of descriptive 
        biogeography). Like individual organisms, species populations (and their 
        particular constitutent adaptive arrays) eventually die and disappear--entirely--as 
        functional (ecological) entities; not necessarily so, communities and 
        ecosystems, that are more likely either to modify in place, or be forced 
        to disperse <EM>en masse</EM>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To these three points two more may be added--briefly. 
        First, as it may be admitted that with respect to adaptive structures 
        evolution historically proceeds randomly (or at the least, stochastically), 
        it is likely the case that predictive modelling based on this focus will 
        always be limited to identifying the <EM>immediate</EM> causal conditions 
        involved. Wallace's original dilemma as to the means of origination of 
        adaptations is thus likely to be a permanent one. We can, of course, identify 
        certain classes of immediate results (such as mimetic resemblance), or 
        use any number of kinds of experimental frameworks to relate specific 
        cause to specific outcome--and in turn manipulate particular processes 
        to serve our immediate ends (as, for example, in various medical contexts)--but 
        there remains the real problem that trying to generalize this manipulation 
        to the level of natural process is extremely tedious, as no state-space 
        common to all relevant factors can ever be isolated. By contrast, if one 
        regards the environment as an information field across which populations 
        disperse, and with which they become integrated, one can begin to look 
        at process in terms of relative rates and directions of change <EM>in 
        space</EM>. If in fact such information fields exist in nature--related 
        most elementally, as I have suggested, to certain optimalities in the 
        rates of provision of fundamental resources--then one should be able to 
        identify population-level traits that have developed in response to them. 
        In my Dissertation (Smith, 1984) I made a first pass attempt at this. 
        Variations in <font color="990000">[[p. 1514]]</font> soil moisture levels 
        over the central United States constituted the "resource" variable studied; 
        this was combined with a similarly varying turnover-related multiplier 
        based on ambient temperatures (via Van't Hoff's law) to produce a geographially-varying 
        indicator of eco-/evolutionary stress. Reasoning that populations should 
        disperse preferentially according to the shape of this "stress field," 
        I examined range boundary records for the over five hundred species of 
        mammals and herptiles occurring in the study area for evidence of such 
        an effect, and in fact found some fairly good confirming evidence. Since 
        that time much better distributional data and means of manipulating them 
        have become available, and more elaborate tests could be performed. Further, 
        and more importantly, tests of this kind could also be applied to particular 
        spatial patterns of gene flow within individual populations (i.e., clinal 
        analyses).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a second point, and as suggested by comments 
        made earlier regarding differences in selection regimes, the kind of approach 
        advocated here could be instrumental in clarifying our understanding of 
        the relation between r- and K- kinds of selection. Obviously, if evolution 
        really is directly related to how certain fundamental resources are made 
        regularly available for procurement and retained and recycled, this influence 
        will find its way into all manner of associations between adaptive strategy 
        and the organism's surroundings. In some instances, for example, life's 
        economy may be dictated by seasonalities; in others, an ease in finding 
        hosts. Trophic level organization, morphology, and life histories should 
        also show signs of such influence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years many investigators have been 
        attempting to model spatial variation in diversity patterns by looking 
        to the possible associative influence of a range of independent environmental 
        variables: climate, soil moisture, ecological complexity, energy levels, 
        and so forth (see, for example, Kerr &amp; Packer, 1997; O'Brien, 1998; 
        Hawkins &amp; Porter, 2003, Hawkins <EM>et al.</EM>, 2003). So far these 
        efforts have lacked the dynamic modelling perspective that allows them 
        to do more than correlate certain diversity characteristics with particular 
        ambient environmental conditions. These are not, therefore, evolutionary 
        models as they now stand, but it would not take much re-orientation to 
        turn them into such. Efforts of this kind might give us a much more interactive 
        view of the meaning of biodiversity, and at the same time allow us to 
        follow Wallace's original lead and understand that there really <EM>is</EM> 
        no generalizable "process of adaptation." We need to pay less attention 
        to the "twigs" themselves, and more to how they generate actions eventually 
        playing out in space and time as responses to final causes inherent in 
        the environmental delivery system.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full one hundred and fifty years have now passed 
        since Wallace's "Sarawak law" essay of early 1855 put us at the brink 
        of a biogeographical understanding that might have formed the very central 
        element of a symmetrically logical evolutionary theory. Only three years 
        later Wallace came up with the key remaining piece of the puzzle, but 
        to no avail: Darwin's conception of adaptation-as-evolution--tree-thinking--was 
        quickly to assume dominance on the stage of evolutionary theorizing, and 
        continues to do so today. There are signs, however, that things may be 
        changing. One immediate result of the biodiversity studies movement has 
        been the realization that a biology (or conservation program) dominated 
        by independent investigations of individual species does not bring us 
        a level of understanding of the biosphere that will ultimately be informative 
        enough to preserve it. It appears that we are, whether we care to acknowledge 
        it or not, increasingly on a search for final causes in the theatre of 
        life. Alfred Russel Wallace embraced this ideal so many years ago, and 
        though he had few theoretical vehicles through which he could express 
        this orientation, every fibre of his intellect was committed to it. We 
        cannot do better than to honour and affirm his commitment through the 
        connection of his name with our own goals, both through commemorations 
        of the type we are taking part in this day, and through continuing efforts 
        to explore and extend his ideas.</p>

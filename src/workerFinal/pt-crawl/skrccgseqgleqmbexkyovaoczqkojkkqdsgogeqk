            Freiberg</font></i> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One major factor in the 
              Japanese film industry's successful survival of the transition to 
              sound was its ability to convert to sound very slowly - over a ten 
              year period - because of the popularity and strength of the indigenous 
              variety of "silent film". Film in Japan was never experienced by 
              the audience in silence; instead, the screening of silent films 
              was accompanied by the live performance of narration and music in 
              the theatre.<font size="2"><a href="#1">(1)</a></font> The narrators 
              were popular entertainers: </font> 
            <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The narrators 
              not only recounted the plot of the films, they enhanced the emotional 
              content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing 
              evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen - much 
              like the narrators of the bunraku puppet theatre. The most popular 
              narrators were stars in their own right, solely responsible for 
              the patronage of a particular theatre.<font size="2"><a href="#2">(2)</a></font> 
              </font></blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The combined performance-cum-screening 
              was in many ways more lively, entertaining and dramatic than the 
              new sound film.<font size="2"><a href="#3">(3)</a></font> Thus, 
              while the industry was experimenting with the new medium of sound, 
              and consolidating its resources, it could and did continue to produce, 
              distribute and exhibit the silent product in great numbers, without 
              losing money. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was not until 1935 
              that a talkie film won first prize at the Kinema Jumpo annual critics' 
              poll. In 1933, the four top awards went to silents (directed by 
              Ozu, Mizoguchi and Naruse, respectively); and in 1934, an Ozu silent 
              again won the top award. In 1933, 81% of films produced were silent, 
              despite the fact that talkies had been made in Japan since 1931. 
              In 1937 and 1938, roughly a third of films produced were still silent.<a href="#4"><font size="2">(4)</font></a> 
              </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even in 1942, 14% of 
              films exhibited in Japan were still silents. Although the major 
              companies (Shockiku, Nikkatsu, Shinko and the new company Toho) 
              had converted to full talkie production by mid decade, there were 
              two other companies that were founded in the 1930s that specialized 
              in silent production. Daito Co was formed in 1933 when an existing 
              private family company (Kawai) was joined by distributors and exhibitors 
              from all over Japan who had been associated with two collapsed companies 
              (Toa and Tokatsu). They produced about 100 films per annum, and 
              supplied two films per week to 450 theatres. After 1937, they made 
              a few talkies, but more often added a sound band - a recording of 
              the benshi's narration, combined with music and sound effects - 
              to their silents rather than using synchronized sound. The second 
              company which specialized in silent production was Kyokuto Film 
              Co. Founded in 1935, it made four reel silent jidai-geki (period 
              films) as supports. From 1938 to 1940, it continued to produce one 
              a week (50 per annum), but, like Daito, added a sound band of recorded 
              narration to its silently produced films. This company was eventually 
              absorbed by Toho, and Daito amalgamated with Shinko and Nikkatsu 
              to become Daiei during the war, when the government insisted on 
              reducing the number of fiction film production companies to three 
              large companies.<font size="2"><a href="#5">(5)</a> </font></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the transition to 
              full talkie production, the major company Shochiku also used a sound 
              band of recorded music and sound effects, but tended to prefer the 
              use of written intertitles rather than the recorded voice of the 
              narrator (benshi) to convey the words of the dialogue. Ozu's late 
              silents are of this type. Other films made by small companies continued 
              to rely on the voice of the benshi, either live in the theatre or 
              recorded onto the sound band, to convey basic information as well 
              as the dialogue. Mizoguchi's late silents, made for small independent 
              companies, are often difficult to follow when viewed today without 
              the benshi's narration. Throughout the 1930s then, four kinds of 
              films co-existed in Japanese cinemas:</font> 
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(i) 
                silent films accompanied by live benshi narration and live music 
                performed in the theatre; <br>
                <br>
                (ii) silent films with a "sound band" of recorded music and sound 
                effects and written intertitles to convey the dialogue; <br>
                <br>
                (iii) sound films with a post-synchronized "sound band" of recorded 
                music, sound effects and narration; <br>
                <br>
                (iv) full talkies, with actors speaking synchronized dialogue, 
                mixed with recorded sound and music onto the soundtrack. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In one case, three of 
              these types of film were combined into the production of one film, 
              a 1934 Shochiku film called <i>Chijo no Seiza</i>, directed by Nomura 
              and promoted as a "neo-film <i>sans</i> silence"(!). The beginning 
              of the film was a talkie, the middle of the film used a sound band 
              of recorded music and sound effects, and the end of the film used 
              a recorded narrator.<font size="2"><a href="#6">(6)</a></font> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the second half of 
              the decade, a measure of economic stability was brought to the very 
              volatile and undercapitalized Japanese industry (in which numerous 
              small companies emerged and collapsed, reformed, amalgamated with 
              each other or were absorbed by other companies, with monotonous 
              regularity) by the concentration of capital and resources (human 
              and technical) in two big rival trusts - Shochiku and Toho. They 
              absorbed small companies, built huge theatres in the major capital 
              cities, had their own distribution and exhibition companies and 
              introduced "progressive" business methods to the industry (e.g. 
              hiring staff and stars on contracts instead of following the traditional 
              method of lifetime employment, promotion by merit rather than seniority, 
              organizing production under the producer system, sub-delegating 
              responsibility for the budgeting and planning of a single film, 
              or series of films, to the producer).</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Their economic power 
              and strength was due not just to the fact that they controlled a 
              national distribution and exhibition network - although this made 
              them more secure than production companies in France and England, 
              who had no exhibition network of their own and faced resistance 
              from exhibitors who favoured popular American films over the local 
              product - but also to their heavy involvement in the live theatre 
              industry. They had their own theatrical companies under contract 
              to them, their popular film stars could make appearances live on 
              stage in their theatres, their stage stars could make screen appearances, 
              and popular successes could be repeated on stage and screen. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Japanese films were more 
              widely distributed in Japan than foreign films, which tended to 
              be restricted to special theatres in major cities and patronized 
              by an educated elite.<font size="2"><a href="#7">(7)</a></font> 
              Factors which contributed to Hollywood's failure to swamp the Japanese 
              market, despite the fact that all the big Hollywood companies had 
              active distribution branches in Japan, are spelt out below. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Firstly,</b> <b>the 
              language and cultural barriers </b>that faced pre-war Japanese audiences 
              of American films. There were some benshi, like Akira Kurosawa's 
              brother, who specialized in the interpretation and narration of 
              foreign films, but after their services were dispensed with, in 
              the early 1930s,<font size="2"><a href="#8">(8)</a></font> this 
              effective form of mediation was lacking. Film buffs had access to 
              the translated scripts of foreign films, which were published in 
              specialist film journals like <i>Kinema Jumpo</i> and somtimes distributed 
              at the cinema, but this form of mediation (like the subtitles, printed) 
              was not as direct or as easy on the viewer /listener as the benshi's 
              performance. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Secondly</b> <b>there 
              was the growing nationalism and xenophobia </b>of the Japanese after 
              Japan's territorial annexation of Manchuria in 1931 and subsequent 
              expulsion from the League of Nations. Although American films remained 
              popular in Japan right up to Pearl Harbour, and continued to be 
              distributed and exhibited until then, the authorities waged a constant 
              propaganda war throughout the 1930s, inveighing against the corrupting 
              influence of American films and westernized values on the "purity" 
              of "the Japanese spirit". They were vigilant in their censorship 
              of "undesirable films" (local and imported), introduced a National 
              Policy on Film (in imitation of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany) 
              and finally, at the end of the decade, passed a Film Law which gave 
              the government control of the production, distribution, exhibition, 
              export and import of film. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              the national interest, they then restricted the number of American 
              films that could be imported, distributed and exhibited in Japan. 
              However, they were not able to control the local industry as tightly 
              as they wished, because the industry was financially independent 
              of the government. It was in fact in the newsreel and documentary 
              area - the non-fiction film industry - that strident propaganda 
              films were made, as the militarists in the government had direct 
              control of news reporting in all the media. (See case of <i>Hijoji 
              Nihon</i> below) </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Thirdly</b>, <b>rental 
              charges for American films were higher </b>than those for Japanese 
              films, and therefore entrance charges at theatres which exhibited 
              American films were higher than those at other theatres. This gave 
              the excursion to see an American film a higher prestige value but 
              doubtless prohibited the regular attendance of the poor at these 
              screenings. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Fourthly</b>, <b>Japanese 
              exhibitors were mostly shareholders</b> and sometimes partners in 
              Japanese film production companies, and so, unlike their counterparts 
              in France and Britain, had a vested interest in exhibiting the local 
              product. In rural areas, theatres mainly exhibited Japanese films; 
              and even in the big expensive theatres in the major cities, a new 
              Japanese feature was usually released on a double bill with an American 
              or other foreign film. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As in Britain,<font size="2"><a href="#9">(9)</a></font> 
              the Depression did not affect attendances at film screenings in 
              Japan, where there was a steady growth in the number of cinemas 
              and the number of tickets sold over the decade, except for a temporary 
              drop in attendances in 1935.<a href="#10"><font size="2">(10)</font></a> 
              However, in marked contrast to the exodus from Europe to Hollywood 
              and the consequent depletion of European film talent, there was 
              no corresponding exodus of Japanese film talent to Hollywood. Whether 
              or not they supported their government's policies, they continued 
              to work in the industry at home and in the occupied countries of 
              east and south-east Asia. One man only, the leftist critic Iwasaki 
              Akira, was outspokenly critical of the Film Law and, after a brief 
              spell in gaol, was forbidden to work in the industry; but even he 
              was put on the payroll of the Manchurian Film Co. by its managing 
              director, who was his mate. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One documentary filmmaker, 
              in 1938, lost his licence after making an elegaic rather than a 
              celebratory documentary on the invasion of China. Otherwise, the 
              personnel of the Japanese film industry proceeded with business 
              as usual and appeared to have no misgivings, until the military 
              defeat of Japan and the Occupation made them repent their collaborative 
              past. If anything, the early military expansion into east and south-east 
              Asia gave a boost to employment in and profits for the industry, 
              opened up potential new markets for Japanese film and provided exciting 
              new locations for film production, as well as new subjects for films. 
              </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The military expansion 
              also helped to foster a realist aesthetic, by giving a boost to 
              newsreel and documentary production, as well as a new genre of war 
              films with on location sound. The authentic images and sounds of 
              the action on the frontlines and the exciting military victories 
              could thereby be experienced by the people back home. A realist 
              aesthetic had also been advocated by the "progressive" film lobby 
              in Tokyo with cosmopolitan leftist film critics like Iwasaki supporting 
              the introduction of realism and the abandonment of the hybrid benshi 
              cinema. They, along with the educated middle class urban audiences, 
              applauded the realistic sound and look of Mizoguchi's 1936 punchy 
              social melodramas, the understated performances of Shimazu's "neo-realismo" 
              films, the classy literary adaptations made at the Nikkatsu studios 
              and the gritty earthiness of Uchida Tomu's <i>Tsuchi </i>(Earth). 
              </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new generation of 
              filmmakers entering the film industry in the mid-to-late 1930s were 
              better educated and from higher status backgrounds than the pioneers 
              of the industry, and they had aspirations to be realist artists, 
              not company hacks. The military leaders and the educationalists 
              needed to construct a unified national consciousness - and obedient, 
              loyal subjects - and promoted the virtues of discipline, restraint 
              and perseverence. The government, from 1933 on, recognized the "educational 
              potential" (i.e. propaganda value) of film to promote "the national 
              spirit" and decried the poor quality and backward technique of Japanese 
              films, in comparison with overseas products, encouraging Japanese 
              filmmakers to improve so that they could better serve the nation.<font size="2"><a href="#11">(11)</a></font> 
              The Prime Minister, Viscount Saito, at the inauguration of the Great-Japan 
              Film Association in 1936, claimed that the local industry was underdeveloped 
              in capital, penetration of overseas markets and production technology, 
              in comparison with the American industry, and that it should aim 
              to improve the quality of its products and increase overseas distribution.<font size="2"><a href="#12">(12)</a></font> 
              </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would like to end this 
              paper with a brief examination of one film from this period <i>Hijoji 
              Nihon</i> (Japan in a Time of Emergency). This "educational" sound 
              film, made in 1933 by the Osaka Daily Newspaper Film Department, 
              and narrated by General Araki, Minister of the Army, used a full 
              battery of "modern" techniques and soviet-style montage to propound 
              the need for moral and military rearmament and industrial productivity. 
              Employing a full barrage of sound effects, it has dramatic thunder, 
              lightning, crashing waves, howling winds, whistling trains. The 
              narrator addresses the audience directly, standing in front of a 
              Japanese flag or map, and his address to the nation continues in 
              voice-over, but periodically returns to him. Through menacing arrows 
              on maps and diagrams, Araki encourages his audience to feel threatened 
              by the aggressive might of Great Britain, France, the USA and Soviet 
              Russia. Dramatized sequences show decadent westernized urban Japanese 
              admonished in the street by a "pure" Japanese whose stance is supported 
              by Araki. The depicted evils of western influence include Hollywood 
              film posters, English novels, and women wearing make-up, high heels 
              and stockings, going to cafes, smoking and flirting with men. One 
              breathtaking montage sequence in Reel 8 has: trains racing, wharfies 
              loading and unloading coal, telephonists connecting lines, machines 
              turning, steelworkers welding, furnaces blazing, chimney stacks 
              smoking. Another montage sequence of military activity in Reel 10 
              has: tanks rolling in formation, cavalry riding, infantry running, 
              the lighting of flares, cavalry charging, anti-aircraft guns and 
              cannons firing, morse-code messages tapping out, planes flying, 
              boats launched on a river, rafts built, a floating bridge erected, 
              and the infantry crossing over, carrying aloft the national flag. 
              The final rousing montage in Reel 12 combines images of nationalism, 
              national productivity and military marching with climactic music 
              and the fluttering of national flags. </font>

              At the Perth Conference my presentation included not only extracts 
              from audio-tapes, which reproduced the kind of sound track which 
              was performed live in Japanese theatres to accompany the screening 
              of silent films but also an analysis of the narration to two melodramas 
              of the early 1930s, translations of which were distributed to the 
              audience. Lacking the dramatic voice of the narrator, the music 
              and the sound effects, this paper must necessarily lose much of 
              the interest of the original presentation. Because of the absence 
              of an audio channel, and the prohibitive length of the translations, 
              I have had to omit a full discussion of the functions of the benshi 
              in the Japanese silent cinema in this paper (I intend to tackle 
              this subject on its own on another occasion). I have decided to 
              publish the rest of the paper because it includes some useful data 
              on the Japanese film industry in the 1930s and the transition to 
              sound in Japan; because its absence would leave an important gap 
              in the coverage of cinema of the 1930s undertaken by the conference; 
              and because its account of developments in Japan offers instructive 
              parallels and contrasts with developments in other film industries, 
              as described in other papers delivered at the Conference and collected 
              here. </font>

              The number of cinemas in Japan increased steadily from 1057 in 1926

              The 1934 "Rationale for the proposed establishment of a National 
              Policy on Film" argued: "Film is an important means of public enlightenment 
              as well as entert-ainment... It has a greater influence on the young 
              than the other media and than formal education... therefore it is 
              necessary to guide and control the film industry, which has up till 
              now been left without positive guidance or control and been guided 
              purely by the profit motive. It is impossible to depend on private 
              companies alone to project a positive image of Japan abroad." from

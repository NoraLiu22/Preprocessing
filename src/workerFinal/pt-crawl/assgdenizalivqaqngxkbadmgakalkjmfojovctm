/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

          at the Royal Geographical Society meeting of 8 June 1863 (and
published  in volume 33 of their <u>Journal</u> series later the same year),
was a notable success, and did much to solidify Wallace's reputation as the leading
expert on the natural history of the Indonesia region. Discussion following the
paper's presentation was recorded, separately, in volume seven (for 1862-63),
issue five, of the Society's <u>Proceedings</u> series. Both are reproduced below, with

        </p><p> <font color="#990000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[p. 217]]</font> The Malay 
          
          or Indian Archipelago is that extensive group of islands which occupies
          the space between south-eastern Asia and Australia, and divides the
          Indian from the Pacific Ocean. From whatever point of view we survey
          this portion of the earth's surface--whether as regards its superficial
          extent, or the immense number of islands with which it is overspread,
          or the individual size of those islands; whether we examine their peculiarities
          of climate, or their geological structure, their rich and varied vegetation,
          their wonderful animal productions, or the strongly-contrasted races
          of mankind that inhabit them; or if, lastly, we look at them from a
          commercial and political point of view, noting the varied products
          which
          they furnish to supply the necessities and luxuries of mankind, trace
          the struggles of the chief nations of Europe for a share in their fertile
          soil, and watch the interesting moral and political problems now being
          worked out there; we shall be convinced that no part of the world can
          offer a greater number of interesting facts for our contemplation,
          or
          furnish us with more extensive and varied materials for speculation
          in almost every great department of human knowledge. 
          
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the present occasion I propose to give a sketch 

          of what is most interesting in the physical geography of this region, 

          including <font color="#990000">[[p. 218]]</font> in that term the general 

          relations of the organic world to the present and past conditions of 

          the earth's surface. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <i>Definition of the Archipelago, Position, Extent, 

          and Magnitude of the chief Islands.</i>--It first becomes necessary 

          to define accurately the limits of the Archipelago, pointing out exactly 

          what islands we include within it; for, though &quot;all the islands between 

          south-eastern Asia and Australia&quot; seems pretty definite, yet to the 

          eastward this region blends insensibly into the vast extent of the Pacific 

          islands. According to my views, the Malay--or, as I should prefer to 

          name it, the Indo-Australian--Archipelago extends from the <i>Nicobar 

          Islands</i> on the north-west to <i>St. Christoval</i>, one of the Solomon 

          Islands, on the south-east, and from<i> Luzon</i> on the north to <i>Rotti</i>, 

          near Timor, on the south. The eastern boundary is drawn at this particular 

          point for reasons which will be explained further on. Though not geographically 

          correct to include any part of a continent in an archipelago, it is 

          necessary for our purpose to consider the Malay peninsula as not only 

          almost but quite an island, since it cannot be physically separated 

          from the region of which we are now treating.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus limited, the Archipelago is of a somewhat triangular 

          form, with an extreme length of about 5000, and a breadth of rather 

          more than 2000 English miles. The mere statement of these dimensions, 

          however, will give but an imperfect idea of the extent and geographical 

          importance of this region, which, owing to its peculiar position, is 

          worse represented on maps than any other on the globe. In many atlases 

          of great pretension there is no map of the whole Archipelago. A small 

          portion of it generally comes in with Asia, and another piece with the 

          Pacific Islands; but in order to ascertain its form and extent as a 

          whole we are almost always obliged to turn to the map of the Eastern 

          Hemisphere. It thus happens that seldom seeing this region, except on 

          a diminutive scale, its real form, dimensions, and the size, situations, 

          and names of its component islands, are, perhaps, less familiar to educated 

          persons than those of any other countries of equal importance. They 

          can hardly bring themselves to imagine that this sea of islands is really 

          in many respects comparable with the great continents of the earth. 

          The traveller, however, soon acquires different ideas. He finds himself 

          sailing for days or even for weeks along the shores of one of these 

          great islands, often so great that the inhabitants believe it to be 

          a boundless continent. He finds that voyages among these islands are 

          commonly reckoned by weeks and months, and that the inhabitants of the 

          eastern and western portions of the Archipelago are as mutually unknown 

          to each other as are the native races of North and South America. On 

          visiting the coasts of one of the larger islands, he hears of the <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          219]]</font> distinct kingdoms which lie along its shores, of the remote 

          north or east or south of which he can obtain little definite information, 

          and of the wild and inaccessible interior, inhabited by cannibals and 

          demons, the haunt of the charmed deer which bears a precious jewel in 

          its forehead, and of the prim&aelig;val men who have not yet lost their 

          tails. The traveller, therefore, soon looks upon this region as one 

          altogether apart. He finds it possesses its own races of men and its 

          own aspects of Nature. It is an island-world, with insular ideas and 

          feelings, customs, and modes of speech; altogether cut off from the 

          great continents into which we are accustomed to divide the globe, and 

          quite incapable of being classed with any of them. Its dimensions, too, 

          are continental. You may travel as many thousand miles across it, in 

          various directions, occupying as many weeks and months as would be necessary 

          to explore any of the so-called quarters of the globe. It contains as 

          much variety in its climate, in its physical phenomena, its animate 

          and inanimate life, and its races of mankind as some of those regions 

          exhibit. If, therefore, the claim of Australia to be a <i>fifth</i> 

          division of the globe be admitted, I would ask for this great archipelago 

          (at least on the present occasion) to be considered a <i>sixth</i>. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now endeavour to give you a clearer idea 

          of its extent and magnitude by comparing it with some regions nearer 

          home. If, first, we bring the Malay Archipelago to Europe, keeping the 

          meridians parallel, and place the western extremity of the island of 

          <em>Sumatra</em> upon the <i>Land's End</i>, <i>New Guinea</i> will then spread 

          over <i>Turkey</i> and a good deal of <i>Persia</i>, and the <i>Solomon 

          Islands</i> will reach to the borders of the <i>Punjaub</i>; while the 

          northern extremity of <i>Luzon</i> will be near the <i>White Sea</i>, 

          and the islands of <i>Timor</i> and <i>Rotti</i> in <i>Syria</i>. The 

          area of the whole Archipelago is, however, much less than its dimensions 

          would seem to imply, being, on a fair calculation, about equal to that 

          portion of Europe which lies south of St. Petersburg and the Shetland 

          Islands.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, if we compare it with Equatorial America,
          

          we shall find its extent in longitude to exceed the width of that great
          

          continent, <i>Sumatra</i> stretching out into the Pacific to the west
          

          of <i>Panama</i>, while <i>New Guinea</i> would be washed by the
          Atlantic 

          to the east of <i>Pernambuco</i>.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This great region of mingled land and water is, 

          then, as a whole, comparable in its dimensions with the primary divisions 

          of the earth, while its component parts are on an equally extended scale,--two 

          of the islands, <i>Borneo</i> and<i> New Guinea</i>, being the largest 

          on the globe. They are nearly equal in extent, and the only other island 

          which approaches them is <i>Madagascar</i>. Borneo would contain within 

          its vast area the whole of Great Britain and <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          220]]</font> Ireland, with all their islets from Scilly to Shetland 

          in their true relative positions, and still leave boundless forests 

          stretching out like an ocean beyond them. Then comes <i>Sumatra</i>, 

          about equal to Great Britain; after which follow <i>Java</i>, <i>Luzon</i>, 

          and <i>Celebes</i>, either of which may compare in size with <i>Ireland 

          </i>or one of the larger <i>New Zealand Islands</i>. After these succeed 

          eighteen islands, which average as large as Jamaica; more than <i>one 

          hundred</i> about the size of the isles of Wight and Man, with many 

          thousands of isles and islets below these, and which are practically 

          innumerable. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their physical constitution and attendant phenomena 

          the islands of the Archipelago offer us some remarkable and instructive 

          contrasts. Active and extinct volcanoes are abundant in many of the 

          islands, in others they are altogether absent. The former, as a general 

          rule, are subject to frequent earthquakes, which in the others are quite 

          unknown. In the greater part of the Archipelago one vast, ever-verdant 

          forest covers hill and valley, plain and mountain, up to the very loftiest 

          summits; whereas in another and much smaller portion such dense and 

          gloomy forests are altogether unknown, the country consisting of arid 

          hills and plains, with a comparatively scanty covering of shrubs and 

          trees. Again, over some extensive districts the monsoons, or periodical 

          winds, with their attendant rains or drought, divide the year into a 

          well-defined and regularly-recurring wet and dry season. Over other 

          scarcely less extensive districts no such regularity exists; the inhabitants 

          themselves can hardly tell you when their rainy or dry season usually 

          begins, and the traveller soon finds the climate to be almost as variable 

          and the skies as inconstant as in our own much-abused island. Even in 

          districts where the season is regular, there are no less striking contrasts; 

          one portion of an island having its wet weather while the remainder 

          is parched up, and islands within sight of each other having very different 

          seasons.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is yet another contrasting aspect in which 

          the Archipelago may be viewed, less obvious but leading to far more 

          important results than any I have yet mentioned, namely, that one large 

          portion of it is connected by a very shallow sea to the continent of 

          Asia, another part is similarly joined to Australia, while the remaining 

          islands are surrounded by a practically unfathomable ocean. We shall 

          consider the chief islands of the Archipelago, therefore, under the 

          heads of,--1st. <i>Volcanic</i> and <i>Non-Volcanic</i>; 2nd. <i>Forest 

          Country</i> and <i>Open Country</i>; 3rd. <i>Well-marked Seasons</i> 

          and <i>Undefined Seasons</i>; and 4th. <i>The Western or Indo-Malayan 

          Region</i>, and the <i>Eastern or Austro-Malayan Region</i>.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at a map on which the volcanic regions of 

          the Archipelago are marked out--those which are subject to earthquakes, 

          which are of volcanic origin, and which abound more or less in <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          221]]</font> extinct as well as active volcanoes--we see at a glance 

          that the great islands of Borneo and Celebes form the central mass around 

          which the volcanic islands are distributed so as rudely to follow their 

          outline and embrace them on every side but one in a vast fiery girdle. 

          Along this great volcanic band (about 5000 miles in length) at least 

          fifty mountains are continually active, visibly emitting smoke or vapour; 

          a much larger number are known to have been in eruption during the last 

          300 years; while the number which are so decidedly of volcanic origin 

          that they may at any moment burst forth again, must be reckoned by hundreds. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the whole region occupied by this volcanic belt, 

          and for a considerable breadth on each side of it, earthquakes are of 

          continual recurrence, slight shocks being felt at intervals of every 

          few weeks or months, while more severe ones, shaking down whole villages, 

          and doing more or less injury to life and property, are sure to happen 

          in one part or another of this district almost every year. In many of 

          the islands the years of the great earthquakes form the chronological 

          epochs of the native inhabitants, by the aid of which the ages of their 

          children are remembered, and the dates of many important events are 

          determined.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not now my object to describe the many fearful 

          eruptions that have taken place in this region. In the amount of injury 

          to life and property, and in the magnitude of their effects, they have 

          not been surpassed by any upon record. Forty villages were destroyed 

          by the eruption of Papaudayang in Java, where the whole mountain was 

          blown up by repeated explosions, and a large lake left in its place. 

          By the great eruption of Toruboro in Sumbawa 12,000 people were destroyed, 

          and the ashes darkened the air, and fell thick upon the earth and sea 

          for 300 miles round. Even quite recently, since I quitted the country, 

          a mountain which had been quiescent for more than 200 years suddenly 

          burst into activity. The island of Makiau, one of the Moluccas, was 

          rent open in 1646 by a violent eruption which left a huge chasm on one 

          side, extending into the heart of the mountain. It was, when I last 

          visited it, clothed with vegetation to the summit, and contained twelve 

          populous Malay villages. On the 29th of December, 1862, after 215 years 

          of perfect inaction, it again suddenly burst forth, blowing up and completely 

          altering the appearance of the mountain, destroying the greater part 

          of the inhabitants, and sending forth such volumes of ashes as to darken 

          the air at Ternate, 40 miles off, and almost entirely to destroy the 

          growing crops on that and the surrounding islands.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The island of Java contains more volcanoes, active 

          and extinct, than any other known district of equal extent. They are 

          about forty-five in number, and many of them exhibit most beautiful 

          examples of the volcanic cone on a large scale, single or double, <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          222]]</font> with entire or truncated summits, and averaging 10,000 

          feet high. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now well ascertained that almost all volcanoes 

          have been slowly built up by the accumulation of the matter--mud, ashes, 

          and lava--ejected by themselves. The openings or craters, however, frequently 

          shift their position; so that a country may be covered with a more or 

          less irregular series of hills in chains and masses only here and there 

          rising into lofty cones, and yet the whole may be produced by true volcanic 

          action. In this manner the greater part of Java has been formed. There 

          has been some elevation, especially on the south coast, where are extensive 

          cliffs of raised coral limestone; and there may be a substratum of older 

          stratified rocks, but still essentially Java is volcanic; and that noble 

          and fertile island--the very garden of the East, and perhaps upon the 

          whole the richest, the best cultivated, and the best governed tropical 

          island in the world--owes its very existence to the same intense volcanic 

          activity which still occasionally devastates its surface.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great island of Sumatra exhibits in proportion 

          to its extent a much smaller number of volcanoes, and a considerable 

          portion of it has had probably a non-volcanic origin.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the eastward the long string of islands from 

          Java passing by the north of Timor and away to Banda are probably all 

          due to volcanic action. Timor itself consists of ancient stratified 

          rocks, but is said to have one volcano near its centre.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going northward, Amboyna, a part of Bouru, and the 

          west end of Ceram, the north part of Gilolo and all the small islands 

          around it, the northern extremity of Celebes, and the islands of Siau 

          and Sauguir are wholly volcanic. The Philippine Archipelago contains 

          many active and extinct volcanoes, and has probably been reduced to 

          its present fragmentary condition by subsidences attending on volcanic 

          action.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All along this great line of volcanoes are to be 

          found more of less palpable signs of great upheaval and depression of 

          land. The range of islands south of Sumatra, a part of the south coast 

          of Java, and of the islands east of it, the west and east end of Timor, 

          portions of all the Moluccas, the K&eacute; and Aru Islands, Waigiou, 

          and the whole south and east of Gilolo consist in a great measure of 

          upraised coral-rock, exactly corresponding to that now forming in the 

          adjacent seas. In many places I have observed the very surfaces of the 

          upraised reefs, with the great masses of coral standing up in their 

          natural position and hundreds of shells, so fresh-looking that it was 

          hard to believe they had been more than a few years out of the water; 

          and, in fact, it is very probable that such changes have occurred within 

          a few centuries.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In striking contrast with this region of subterranean 

          fires, the <font color="#990000">[[p. 223]]</font> island of Celebes 

          in all its southern peninsulas, the great mass of Borneo, and the Malay 

          peninsula, are not known to contain a single volcano, active or extinct. 

          To the east of the volcanic band is another quiescent area of 1000 miles 

          wide, the great island of New Guinea being free from volcanoes and earthquakes. 

          Towards its eastern extremity, however, these reappear in some small 

          islands off its coast, and in New Britain, New Ireland, and the Solomon 

          Islands, which contain active volcanoes. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference between the aspect of the volcanic 

          and the non-volcanic regions is by no means so striking as might be 

          imagined. Where active volcanoes or true volcanic peaks exist, a peculiar 

          character is at once given to the islands, which are also in almost 

          every case characterised by excessive fertility. In many of the adjoining 

          districts, however, though volcanic products may be everywhere visible, 

          the general aspect of the country, the outline of the hills, and the 

          character of the vegetation, does not differ materially from those of 

          many parts of Borneo and New Guinea. The island of Amboyna, for instance, 

          consists principally of raised coral-rock almost everywhere covered 

          with deep-red volcanic clays and gravels, and in places capped with 

          basalt and lavas; yet the soil is by no means fertile, and where the 

          native forest vegetation is cleared off, the ground bears only a scanty 

          covering of dwarf shrubs and rigid herbage. The chief characteristic 

          of the non-volcanic regions appears to me to consist in the great flat 

          valleys that line the coasts, and penetrate far inland between the mountain 

          ranges--the result of the long and uninterrupted action of rivers and 

          tropical rains (combined probably with a slow elevation of the land) 

          in filling up the gulfs that once intervened between the mountain ranges. 

          A subsidence of a few hundred feet would reduce Borneo into a shape 

          very similar to that of Celebes, which island may be considered to be 

          now in the state that Borneo has just passed out of, and to be still 

          engaged in filling up and converting into swampy plains the deep gulfs 

          that at present occupy the spaces between her radiating lines of mountains.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very extraordinary forms of Celebes and Gilolo 

          have been imputed by some authors to sudden and capricious elevation. 

          Mr. Windsor Earl speaks of the volcanic action where it was strongest 

          &quot;throwing the islands into fantastic forms.&quot; Celebes, however, is free 

          from volcanoes except at its northern extremity, and its southern peninsula 

          consists of mountains of basalt and limestone. From peculiarities in 

          its natural productions, the shallowness of some of the gulfs between 

          its peninsulas, and the number of coral islets that surround the southern 

          portion of it, Celebes was once probably much more extensive, perhaps 

          equal to Borneo, at a time when Borneo was just rising above the ocean, 

          <font color="#990000">[[p. 224]]</font> and having the form rudely represented 

          in the diagram. As in every part of the world of which we have accurate 

          geological knowledge, risings and sinkings of the land to the amount 

          of several hundreds of feet have repeatedly occurred, these two islands 

          may each have successively assumed the form of the other without any 

          violent convulsion. From the vast, swampy, level plains which stretch 

          into the very heart of Borneo, allowing vessels to ascend its southern 

          rivers about 300 miles in a straight line, it has probably been for 

          a long time stationary, and thus been enabled to fill up the gulfs that 

          formerly penetrated it. At a still earlier period it must have been 

          much more deeply submerged, when the extensive coal-beds found in almost 

          every part of it were being formed. This, however, was at no very remote 

          period, geologically speaking, for the coal of Borneo is all tertiary. 

          Instead of the ferns and lepidodendra, and other plants of extinct genera 

          which abound in our coal-shales, those of Borneo contain only impressions 

          of leaves of exogenous trees which can hardly be distinguished from 

          those growing in the surrounding forests. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contrasts of vegetation and of climate in the 

          Archipelago may best be considered together, the one being to some extent 

          dependent on the other.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Placed immediately upon the Equator, and surrounded 

          by extensive oceans, it is not surprising that the various islands of 

          the Archipelago should be almost always clothed with a forest vegetation 

          from the level of the sea to the summits of the loftiest mountains. 

          This is the general rule. Sumatra, New Guinea, Borneo, the Philippines 

          and the Moluccas, and the uncultivated parts of Java and Celebes, are 

          all forest countries, except a few small and unimportant tracts, due 

          perhaps, in some cases, to ancient cultivation or accidental fires. 

          To this, however, there is one important exception in the island of 

          Timor and all the smaller islands opposite, in which there is absolutely 

          no forest such as exists in the other islands, and this character extends 

          in a lesser degree to Flores, Sumbawa, Lombock, and Bali.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Timor the most common trees are <i>Eucalypti</i> 

          of several species, so characteristic of Australia, with sandalwood, 

          acacia, and other sorts in less abundance. These are scattered over 

          the country more or less thickly, but never so as to deserve the name 

          of a forest. Coarse and scanty grasses grow beneath them on the more 

          barren hills, and a luxuriant herbage in the moister localities. In 

          the islands between Timor and Java there is often a more thickly wooded 

          country, but thorny and prickly trees abound. They seldom reach any 

          great height, and during the force of the dry season they almost completely 

          lose their leaves, allowing the ground to be parched beneath them, and 

          contrasting strongly with <font color="#990000">[[p. 225]]</font> the 

          damp, gloomy, ever-verdant forests of the other islands. This peculiar 

          character, which extends in a less degree to the southern peninsula 

          of Celebes and the east end of Java, is most probably owing to the proximity 

          of Australia. The south-east monsoon, which lasts for about two-thirds 

          of the year (from March to November), blowing over the northern parts 

          of that country, produces a degree of heat and dryness which assimilates 

          the vegetation and physical aspect of the adjacent islands to its own. 

          A little further eastward in Timorlaut and the K&eacute; Islands, a 

          moister climate prevails, the south-east winds blowing from the Pacific 

          through Torres Straits, and as a consequence every rocky islet is clothed 

          with verdure to its very summit. Further west again, as the same winds 

          blow over a wider and wider extent of ocean, they have time to absorb 

          fresh moisture, and we accordingly find the island of Java possessing 

          a less and less arid climate in the dry season, till in the extreme 

          west near Batavia rain occurs more or less all the year round, and the 

          mountains are everywhere clothed with forests of unexampled luxuriance. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes of the monsoons and of the wet and dry 

          seasons in some parts of the Archipelago, are very puzzling; and an 

          accurate series of observations in numerous localities is required to 

          elucidate them.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Speaking generally,&quot; said Mr. Wallace, &quot;the whole
          south-western part 

          of the Archipelago, including the whole range of islands from Sumatra
          

          to Timor, with the larger half of Borneo and the southern peninsula
          

          of Celebes, have a dry season from April to November, with the south-east
          

          monsoon. This same wind, however, bends round Borneo, becoming the
          south-west 

          monsoon in the China sea, and bringing the rainy season to Northern
          

          Borneo and the Philippines.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Moluccas and New Guinea the seasons are most 

          uncertain. In the south-east monsoon from April to November, it is often 

          stormy at sea, while on the islands it is very fine weather. There is 

          generally not more than two or three months of dry hot weather about 

          August and September. This is the case in the northern extremity of 

          Celebes and in Bouru, whereas in Amboyna July and August are the worst 

          months in the year. In Ternate, where I resided at intervals for three 

          years, I never could find out which was the wet and which the dry season. 

          The same is the case at Banda, and a similar uncertainty prevails in 

          Menado, showing probably that the proximity of active volcanoes has 

          a great disturbing meteorological influence. In New Guinea a great amount 

          of rain falls more or less all the year round. On the whole the only 

          general statement we can make seems to be that the countries within 

          about 3&deg; on each side of the Equator have much rain and not very 

          strongly contrasted seasons; while those with more south <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          226]]</font> or north latitude, have daily rains during about four months 

          in the year, while for five or six months there is almost always a cloudless 

          sky and a continual drought. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have next to consider the Malayan Archipelago 

          in its geological and zoological relations to Asia and to Australia, 

          it being now a well established fact that one portion of it is almost 

          as much Asiatic in its organic productions as the British Isles are 

          European, while the remainder bears the same relation to Australia that 

          the West India Islands do to America.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was first pointed out by Mr. George Windsor Earl, 

          in a paper read before this Society eighteen years ago, that a shallow 

          sea connected the great islands of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, to the 

          Asiatic continent, with which they generally agreed in their natural 

          productions; while a similar shallow sea connected New Guinea and some 

          of the adjacent islands to Australia. Owing, however, to that gentleman's 

          imperfect knowledge of the natural history of the various islands, he 

          did not fully appreciate the important results of this observation, 

          and in fact in the same paper argued in favour of the former connection 

          of Asia and Australia--a connection to which the whole bearing of the 

          facts in physical geography and natural history is plainly opposed.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make this subject intelligible, it is 

          necessary to make a few observations on the relations of the geographical 

          distribution of animals and plants with geology.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now generally admitted that the present distribution 

          of living things on the surface of the earth, is mainly the result of 

          the last series of changes that the surface has undergone. Geology teaches 

          us that the surface of the land and the distribution of land and water 

          is everywhere slowly changing. It further teaches us that the forms 

          of life which inhabit that surface have, during every period of which 

          we possess any record, been also slowly changing.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not now necessary to say anything about <i>how</i> 

          either of those changes took place; as to that, opinions may differ; 

          but as to the fact that the changes themselves <i>have </i>occurred 

          from the earliest geological ages down to the present day, and are still 

          going on, there is no difference of opinion. Every successive stratum 

          of sedimentary rock, sand or gravel, is a proof that changes of level 

          have taken place; and the different species of animals and plants, whose 

          remains are found in these deposits, prove that corresponding changes 

          did occur in the organic world.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking, therefore, these two series of changes for 

          granted, some of their effects are visible in the present peculiarities 

          and anomalies in the distribution of species. In our own islands, with 

          a few very trifling exceptions, every quadruped, bird, reptile, insect, 

          and plant, is found also on the adjacent continent. In the small island 

          of Corsica, there are some quadrupeds, birds and insects quite peculiar 

          <font color="#990000">[[p. 227]]</font> to it; in Ceylon, more closely 

          connected to India than Britain is to Europe, many animals and plants 

          of all kinds are quite different from those found in India. In the Galapagos 

          Islands every indigenous living thing is peculiar to them, though closely 

          resembling other kinds found in the neighbouring parts of the American 

          continent. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in all cases where we have independent geological 

          evidence, we find that those islands, the productions of which are identical 

          with those of the adjacent countries, have been joined to them within 

          a comparatively recent period, such recent unity being in most cases 

          indicated by the very shallow sea still dividing them; while in cases 

          where the natural productions of two adjacent countries is very different, 

          they have been separated at a more remote epoch--a fact generally indicated 

          by a deeper sea now dividing them. The reason of this is obvious. For 

          example: let a subsidence take place, cutting off any portion of a continent, 

          and forming an island. The organic productions of the two portions are 

          at first identical, but they are not permanent. The changes that have 

          always gone on still go on. Some species slowly die out, new ones take 

          their place, and thus in time the animals and plants of the island come 

          to differ from those of the country from which it was severed; and if 

          the subsidence which first separated them goes on widening and deepening 

          the sea between them, there will come in time to be such a marked difference 

          in their productions as we see between Madagascar and Africa.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This general principle is of almost universal application, 

          so that when we find an island whose animals and plants exactly agree 

          with those of an adjacent land, we look for evidence of its recent separation 

          from that land; while, on the other hand, any remarkable diversity of 

          natural productions forces on us the conclusion that the watery barrier 

          which now exists has existed for a very long geological period; and 

          when the diversity is almost total, not only in species but in larger 

          groups such as general families and orders, we conclude that these countries 

          could never have been connected since our continents and oceans had 

          assumed their present general outlines.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning now to the Malay Archipelago, we see
          that 

          the whole of the seas connecting Java, Sumatra, and Borneo with Malacca
          

          and Siam are under 50 fathoms deep, so that an elevation of only 300
          

          feet would add this immense district to the Asiatic continent. The
          100 

          fathom line will also include the Philippine Islands and the island
          

          of Bali, east of Java. From this we should naturally conclude that
          the 

          subsidence breaking up this portion of Asia had recently taken place,
          

          and we have a very sufficient cause for such subsidence in the vast
          

          range of volcanoes in Sumatra and Java, whose elevatory action must
          

          have been counterbalanced by some <font color="#990000">[[p. 228]]</font> 

          adjacent depression. On examining the zoology of these countries this
          

          opinion is confirmed, for we find the most overwhelming evidence that
          

          these great islands must have once formed a part of the continent,
          and 

          could only have been separated at a very recent geological epoch. The
          

          elephant and tapir of Sumatra and Borneo, the rhinoceros of Sumatra
          

          and the allied species of Java, the wild cattle of Borneo and the kind
          

          long supposed to be peculiar to Java, are now known all to inhabit
          some 

          part or other of Southern Asia. None of these large animals could possibly
          

          have passed over the arms of the sea which now separate these countries,
          

          and therefore plainly indicate that a land communication must have
          existed 

          since the origin of the species. Among the smaller mammals a considerable
          

          portion are common to each island and the continent; but the vast physical
          

          changes that must have occurred during the breaking up and subsidence
          

          of such extensive regions have led to the extinction of some in one
          

          or more of the islands, and in some cases there seems also to have
          been 

          time for a change of species to have taken place. Birds and insects
          

          illustrate the same view, for every family and almost every genus of
          

          birds and insects found in any of the islands occur also in the Asiatic
          

          continent, and in a great number of cases the species are exactly identical.
          

          Birds offer us one of the best means of determining the laws of distribution;
          

          for though at first sight it would appear that the watery boundaries
          

          which keep out the land quadrupeds could be easily passed over by birds,
          

          yet practically it is not so, for if we leave out the aquatic tribes
          

          which are pre-eminently wanderers, it is found that the others (and
          

          especially the passeres or true perching-birds which form the vast
          majority) 

          are generally as strictly limited by straits and arms of the sea as
          

          are quadrupeds themselves. As an instance among the islands of which
          

          I am now speaking, it is a remarkable fact that Java possesses numerous
          

          birds which never pass over to Sumatra, though they are separated by
          

          a strait only 15 miles wide, and with islands in mid-channel. Java,
          

          in fact, possesses more birds and insects peculiar to itself than either
          

          Sumatra or Borneo, and this would indicate that it was earliest separated
          

          from the continent; next in organic individuality is Borneo, while
          Sumatra 

          is so nearly identical with the peninsula of Malacca in all its animal
          

          forms, that we may safely conclude it to have been the most recently
          

          dismembered island. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general result, therefore, at which we arrive 

          is, that the great islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo resemble in 

          their natural productions the adjacent parts of the continent, almost 

          as much as such widely-separated districts could be expected to do even 

          if they still formed a part of Asia; and this close resemblance, joined 

          with the fact of the wide extent of sea which separates them being so 

          uniformly and remarkably shallow, and lastly, the existence of the <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          229]]</font> extensive range of volcanoes in Sumatra and Java, which 

          have poured out vast quantities of subterranean matter and have built 

          up extensive plateaux and lofty mountain ranges, thus furnishing a &quot;<i>vera 

          causa</i>&quot; for a parallel line of subsidence--all lead us irresistibly 

          to the conclusion that at a very recent geological epoch the continent 

          of Asia extended far beyond its present limits in a south-easterly direction, 

          including the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, and probably reaching 

          as far as the present 100 fathom line of soundings. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Philippine Islands agree in many respects with 

          Asia and the other islands, but present some anomalies, which seem to 

          indicate that they were separated at an earlier period, and have since 

          been subject to many revolutions in their physical geography.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning our attention now to the remaining portion 

          of the Archipelago, we shall find that all the islands from Celebes 

          and Lombock eastward, exhibit almost as close a resemblance to Australia 

          and New Guinea as the Western Islands do to Asia. It is well known that 

          the natural productions of Australia differ from those of Asia more 

          than those of any of the four ancient quarters of the world do from 

          each other. Australia, in fact, stands alone: it possesses no apes or 

          monkeys, no cats or tigers, wolves, bears, or hyenas; no deer, or sheep, 

          or oxen; no elephant, horse, squirrel, or rabbit; none, in short, of 

          those familiar types of quadruped which are met with in every other 

          part of the world. Instead of these, it has marsupials only, kangaroos 

          and opossums, wombats and the duck-billed <i>platypus</i>. In birds 

          it is almost as peculiar. It has no woodpeckers and no pheasants, families 

          which exist in every other part of the world; but instead of them it 

          has the mound-making brush-turkeys, the honey-suckers, the cockatoos, 

          and the brush-tongued lories, which are found nowhere else upon the 

          globe.

      </blockquote>
        <p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all these peculiarities exist also in the Australian 

          portion of the Malay Archipelago, as may be seen by the tables of characteristic 

          mammals and birds of the two regions. The contrast is nowhere so abruptly 

          exhibited as on passing from the island of Bali to that of Lombock, 

          where the two regions are in closest proximity. In Bali we have barbets, 

          fruit-thrushes, and woodpeckers; on passing over to Lombock these are 

          seen no more, but we have abundance of cockatoos, honeysuckers, and 

          brush-turkeys, which are equally unknown in Bali and every island further 

          west. The strait here is 15 miles wide, so that we may pass in two hours 

          from one great division of the earth to another, differing as essentially 

          in their animal life as Europe does from America. If we travel from 

          Java or Borneo, to Celebes or the Moluccas, the difference is still 

          more striking. In the first, the forests abound in <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          231]]</font> monkeys of many kinds, wild cats, deer, civets, and otters, 

          and numerous varieties of squirrels are constantly met with. In the 

          latter none of these occur; but the prehensile-tailed opossum is almost 

          the only terrestrial animal seen, except wild pigs, which are found 

          in all the islands, and deer (which have probably been recently introduced) 

          in Celebes and the Moluccas. The birds which are most abundant in the 

          Western Islands are woodpeckers, barbets, trogons, fruit-thrushes, and 

          leaf-thrushes: they are seen daily, and form the great ornithological 

          features of the country. In the Eastern Islands these are absolutely 

          unknown, honeysuckers and small lories being the most common birds; 

          so that the naturalist feels himself in a new world, and can hardly 

          realise that he has passed from the one region to the other in a few 

          days, without ever being out of sight of land. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inference that we must draw from these facts 

          is undoubtedly that the whole of the islands eastwards from Java and 

          Borneo do essentially form a part of a former Australian or Pacific 

          Continent, from which they were separated, not only before the Western 

          Islands were separated from Asia, but probably before the extreme south-eastern 

          portion of Asia was raised above the waters of the ocean; for a great 

          part of the land of Borneo and Java is known to be geologically of quite 

          recent formation, while the very great difference of species and in 

          many cases of genera also between the productions of the Eastern Malay 

          Islands and Australia, as well as the great depth of the sea now separating 

          them, point to a comparatively long isolation and an early epoch of 

          separation. It is interesting to observe among the islands themselves 

          how a shallow sea always intimates a recent land-connection. The Aru 

          Islands, Mysol, and Waigiou, as well as Jobie, agree with New Guinea 

          in their mammalia and birds much more closely than they do with the 

          Moluccas, and we find that they are all united to New Guinea by a shallow 

          sea. In fact, the 100 fathom line round New Guinea marks out accurately 

          the range of the true Paradise birds.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existence of a Pacific continent was long ago 

          indicated by Mr. Darwin's researches on the structure and origin of 

          coral-reefs, the numerous atolls and barrier-reefs in the whole of this 

          district being shown to depend upon the subsidence of land for long 

          periods. This so exactly agrees with the singular unity now existing 

          among the organic productions of a vast number of islands, which at 

          the same time are very different from those of any other part of the 

          world, that we must accept it as a fair deduction from the only evidence 

          we can ever hope to obtain of this class of changes.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would particularly call attention to the fact 

          that the division of the Archipelago here pointed out, into two regions 

          characterised by a striking diversity in their natural productions, 

          does <i>not</i> correspond to any of the physical or climatal divisions 

          of the surface. <font color="#990000">[[p. 232]]</font> The great volcanic 

          chain runs through both parts: Borneo closely resembles New Guinea, 

          not only in its vast size but in its climate and the general aspect 

          of its vegetation; the Moluccas are the counterpart of the Philippines 

          in their volcanic origin, their extreme fertility, their luxuriant forests, 

          and their frequent earthquakes; and the east end of Java has a climate 

          almost as dry as that of Timor. Yet between these corresponding groups 

          of islands, constructed as it were after the same pattern, there is 

          the greatest possible contrast in the animal productions. Nowhere does 

          the ancient doctrine--that the peculiar animal and vegetable productions 

          of the various countries of the globe are directly dependent on the 

          physical conditions of those countries (such as climate, soil, elevation, 

          &amp;c.)--meet with a more direct and palpable contradiction. Borneo 

          and New Guinea, as physically alike as two distinct countries can be, 

          are zoologically wide as the poles asunder; while Australia, with its 

          dry winds, its open plains, stony deserts, and temperate climate, yet 

          produces the quadrupeds and birds which are most nearly allied to those 

          inhabiting the hot, damp forests which everywhere clothe the plains 

          and mountains of New Guinea. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can now give the reason for limiting the Malay
          

          Archipelago on the east by the Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean.
          

          Certain groups of birds, which have their metropolis in New Guinea
          and 

          extend over the Moluccas to the westward, are found also as far as
          the 

          Solomon Islands to the eastward, but do not extend to New Caledonia
          

          (which is much more Australian in its productions), or to the Fejee
          

          Islands, where the peculiar Pacific fauna commences. These groups are
          

          the <i>scarlet lories</i> and the <i>white cockatoos</i>, and the occurrence
          

          of a new species of cassowary in New Britain is a further indication
          

          of these islands being as closely allied to New Guinea on the one hand
          

          as are the Moluccas on the other.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of the contrast between these two great 

          divisions of the Malay Archipelago will be best understood by considering 

          what would take place if any two of the primary divisions of the earth 

          were brought into equally close contact. Africa and South America, for 

          example, differ very greatly in all their animal forms. On the one side 

          we have baboons, lions, elephants, buffaloes, and giraffes; on the other 

          spider-monkeys, pumas, tapirs, ant-eaters, and sloths; while among birds, 

          the hornbills, turacos, orioles, and honey-suckers of Africa contrast 

          strongly with the toucans, macaws, chatterers, and humming-birds of 

          America.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let us endeavour to imagine (what it is very
          

          probable may occur in future ages) that a slow upheaval of the bed
          of 

          the Atlantic should take place, while at the same time earthquake-shocks
          

          and volcanic action on the land should cause increased volumes of sediment
          

          to be poured down by the rivers, so that the two continents should
          gradually 

          spread out by the addition of <font color="#990000">[[p. 233]]</font> 

          newly-formed lands, so as to reduce the Atlantic which now separates
          

          them to an arm of the sea a few hundred miles wide. At the same time
          

          we may suppose islands to be upheaved in mid-channel, and, as the subterranean
          

          forces varied in intensity and shifted their points of greatest action,
          

          these islands would sometimes become connected with the land on one
          

          side or other of the strait, and at other times again be separated
          from 

          it. Several islands would at one time be joined together, at another
          

          would be broken up again, till at last, after many long ages of such
          

          intermittent action, we might have an irregular archipelago of islands
          

          filling up the ocean channel of the Atlantic, in whose appearance and
          

          arrangement we could discover nothing to tell us which had been connected
          

          with Africa and which with America. The animals and plants inhabiting
          

          these islands would, however, certainly reveal this portion of their
          

          former history. On those islands which had ever formed a part of the
          

          South American continent we should be sure to find such common birds
          

          as chatterers and toucans and humming-birds, and some of the peculiar
          

          American quadrupeds; while on those which had been separated from Africa,
          

          hornbills, orioles, and honey-suckers would as certainly be found.
          Some 

          portion of the upraised land might at different times have had a temporary
          

          connection with both continents, and would then contain a certain amount
          

          of mixture in its living inhabitants. Such seems to have been the case
          

          with the islands of Celebes and the Philippines. Other islands, again,
          

          though in such close proximity as Bali and Lombock, might each exhibit
          an 

          almost unmixed sample of the productions of the continents of which
          

          they had directly or indirectly once formed a part. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Malayan Archipelago we have, I believe, a 

          case exactly parallel to that which I have here supposed. We have indications 

          of a vast continent, with a peculiar fauna and flora, having been gradually 

          and irregularly broken up; the island of Celebes probably marking its 

          furthest westward extension, beyond which was a wide ocean. At the same 

          time Asia appears to have been extending its limits in a south-east 

          direction, first in an unbroken mass, then separated into islands as 

          we now see it, and almost coming into actual contact with the scattered 

          fragments of the great southern land.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In dwelling upon this subject--which I trust I have 

          succeeded in making intelligible--my object has been to show the important 

          bearing of researches into the natural history of every part of the 

          world upon the study of its past history. An accurate knowledge of any 

          group of birds or of insects, and of their geographical distribution, 

          may assist us to map out the islands and continents of a former epoch; 

          the amount of difference that exists between the <font color="#990000">[[p. 

          234]]</font> animals of adjacent districts being closely dependent upon 

          preceding geological changes. By the collection of such minute facts 

          alone can we hope to fill up a great gap in the past history of the 

          earth as revealed by geology, and obtain some indications of the existence 

          of those ancient lands which now lie buried beneath the ocean, and have 

          left us nothing but these living records of their former existence. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is for such inquiries the modern naturalist
          collects 

          his materials; it is for this that he still wants to add to the apparently
          

          boundless treasures of our national museums, and will never rest satisfied
          

          as long as the native country, the geographical distribution, and the
          

          amount of variation of any living thing remains imperfectly known.
          He 

          looks upon every species of animal and plant now living as the individual
          

          letters which go to make up one of the volumes of our earth's history;
          

          and, as a few lost letters may make a sentence unintelligible, so the
          

          extinction of the numerous forms of life which the progress of cultivation
          

          invariably entails will necessarily render obscure this invaluable
          record of 

          the past. It is, therefore, an important object, which governments
          and 

          scientific institutions should immediately take steps to secure, that
          

          in all tropical countries colonised by Europeans the most perfect collections
          

          possible in every branch of natural history should be made and deposited
          

          in national museums, where they may be available for study and interpretation.

        </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is not done, future ages 

          will certainly look back upon us as a people so immersed in the pursuit 

          of wealth as to be blind to higher considerations. They will charge 

          us with having culpably allowed the destruction of some of those records 

          of Creation which we had it in our power to preserve; and while professing 

          to regard every living thing as the direct handiwork and best evidence 

          of a Creator, yet, with a strange inconsistency, seeing many of them 

          perish irrecoverably from the face of the earth, uncared for and unknown.</p>

        PRESIDENT remarked that as a geologist, he must say, in all the years
        he had had the 
honour of being connected with the Society, he had never heard a paper read of
a more luminous character, 
and which so bound together in the most perfect forms all the branches of the
science of natural history, 
more particularly as it developed the truths of geography upon what he considered
to be its soundest basis, 
that of geological observation and analogy. He was perfectly certain there was
no person present, who 
could not say that they had never sent a traveller into a foreign country, who
had more completely studied 
all the grand features of its natural history, or who had combined them together
in a more profoundly 
philosophical spirit.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. CRAWFURD said the subject of the Malay Archipelago
had been the study of his life; but he felt 
himself much enlightened by the paper of Mr. Wallace. He did not know that he
could add any 
information. He might not entirely agree with all his theories, and, perhaps,
not even with his divisions of 
the Archipelago; but for all that, his paper was a most enlightened <font color="990000">[[p.
211]]</font> and a most able one. He 
wished Mr. Wallace had said something about the human inhabitants of these regions.
Mr. Wallace knew 
more about them than any Englishman, for he had lived among them; and he should
be glad to hear his 
opinion of them. He divided the Archipelago into two parts, the Indian portion
and the Australian portion. 
Now he wished to ask Mr. Wallace, seeing that he conjoined Australia and
New Guinea as part of the 
same region, how it happened that the human inhabitants were totally different?
Again, if the Indo-Malay 
portion of the Islands were grouped with India, how came it that no two human
beings could be more 
unlike than the Hindoo and the Malay? How did the Malays come there? How were
the dwarfish 
inhabitants of the Andaman Islands to be accounted for? for there were no such
people in India--that was 
certain. How were the pigmy negroes of the Malay Peninsula to be accounted for?
There were differences 
here which he (Mr. Wallace) might perhaps be able to reconcile. Mr. Wallace had
mentioned the eruption 
of the mountain Tomboro. He was himself old enough to have been an eye-witness
of the commencement 
of that eruption, probably the most remarkable one on record. In the year 1814
he proceeded with an 
expedition to the island of Celebes; and as they approached the island of Sumbawa,
which contained this 
famous mountain, they thought they saw a very heavy squall coming on. They were
beating up against the 
south-east monsoon, and as they approached they saw that it was a volcano. As
they beat up nearer the 
shore of the island, the ashes fell on the deck. That was one whole year before
the great eruption took 
place. He was then at Soerabaya, at the eastern extremity of Java, about 300
miles distant from the 
mountain of Tomboro. For three days it was pitch dark. Mr. Wallace had greatly
underrated the extent of 
ashes that were ejected, which were certainly not confined to an area of 300
miles, as they fell at 
Bencoolen, 1200 miles distant, transported thither by the south-east monsoon;
and they were carried by a 
second current of air a thousand miles in an opposite direction, as far, in fact,
as the island of Banda. For 
ten days he had to write by candlelight; and the country-people were compelled
to travel into the country 
with flambeaux. For six weeks together they could not see the plain disc of the
sun. There was one 
difference between the volcanic and non-volcanic portions of these islands. Generally
speaking, the 
volcanic part was highly fertile. Mr. Wallace had given a just eulogy of the
island of Java. He himself 
resided on that island six years, and he was tolerably well acquainted with it.
Java was about half the size 
of Great Britain; it was a fertile island, beautifully watered, and at present
contained a population of full 
12,000,000; indeed, the last accounts make it about 13,200,000. On the other
hand, he did not believe the 
population of Borneo exceeded four or five inhabitants to the square mile, and
probably on the whole did 
not exceed one million and a quarter. If Borneo were as fertile as Java, as well
watered, and as suitable to 
maintain a population, it ought, according to its immense size, to contain a
population of 80,000,000. The 
people of Java were civilised, having fine monuments and a literature. The whole
of the inhabitants of 
Borneo, who were not strangers, were savages. There was a still more remarkable
example. Mr. Wallace 
had mentioned the islands of Bali and Lombok. Now, those two very small islands
were highly fertile, and 
although they were not above one-eightieth part of the size of Borneo, they contained
a population equal to 
that of Borneo, and a civilised population too, well-clothed and well-fed, and
possessing a literature. These 
were striking differences between the volcanic and non-volcanic islands.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. WALLACE said with regard to the question that Mr. Crawfurd had asked, why
he did not refer to 
the races of men inhabiting these islands, it was simply because his paper was
already too long, and it 
would require another paper equally long to do justice to the subject.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. CRAWFURD.--Will you promise one?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. WALLACE.--Certainly. He should just like to say a word with regard <font color="990000">[[p.
212]]</font> to the number of 
very difficult problems that Mr. Crawfurd had proposed to him--problems
which, as Mr. Crawfurd, who 
had devoted his whole life to the subject, was unable to answer, it was not likely
he should be able to 
answer upon such short notice, if indeed at all. However, he would say, generally,
that the races of man do 
not correspond at all accurately to those two great divisions of the Archipelago,
which differed so 
remarkably in their natural productions. The reason why they did not correspond
appeared to him to be 
simply this; that man is a migratory animal and continually moving about. We
had a great deal of historical 
evidence of the number of changes of the races of man in the Archipelago itself.
Some races have been 
driven out; others have come in; others have made conquests; others have gone
to more fertile regions. 
Therefore, the races of man would not correspond to those of animals and plants.
Still there was a slight 
general correspondence. There was the Malay race, the whole of which, generally
speaking, corresponded 
to the western half of the Archipelago; they did stretch into the eastern half,
but not a great part of it. The 
Papuan race occupied the eastern half, and extended into New Guinea. It was probable
they had extended 
still further west, but they had been driven back by the Malayan race.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRESIDENT, in adjourning the Meeting, congratulated them upon having had
from Mr. Wallace 
a proof that Geography as a science embraced all the sciences relating to Natural
History. He had proved 
himself not alone a first-rate naturalist, but also a good geologist.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Meeting then adjourned, after a cordial vote of thanks had been unanimously
passed to Mr. 
Wallace for his most interesting and instructive paper.</font><br />

      <strong><i><font color="993366">Comment by Bernard Michaux, paleobiologist (pers. commun. 7/00):</font></i></strong></p>

          <p align="left"><em>With some wonderful turn of phrase Wallace's paper 

            gave most British and European readers their first summary description 

            of the natural circumstances of the Malay Archipelago. In 1863 there 

            wasn't even a map that showed the region in its entirety. Wallace 

            notes that &quot;this sea of islands&quot; is in fact continental in extent 

            (some 10 million square miles), and his evocative description of Borneo's 

            size, in which &quot;the whole of Great Britain and Ireland, with all their 

            islets from Scilly to Shetland&quot; would easily fit &quot;and still leave 

            boundless forests stretching out like an ocean beyond them,&quot; is wonderful 

            writing. What Wallace wants to do is to convince his readers that 

            Indonesia is deserving of being considered its own major biogeographic 

            region.</em></p>

          

          <p align="left"><em>Wallace's style of writing here is part scientific, 

            part travelogue. He compares and contrasts the physical geography, 

            climate and vegetation over this broad region before getting down 

            to the real business of biogeographical interpretation. Wallace's 

            Line is clearly described, and the relationship between the distribution 

            of Australian and Asian mammals and birds discussed in the light of 

            what Wallace knew of Indonesian geology. This latter discussion is 

            now of historical interest only, unlike his biological observations, 

            which largely retain their relevance to modern readers. It is a sad 

            fact that the Indonesia Wallace knew is rapidly disappearing, making 

            the conservation of Indonesia's remaining biodiversity an ever more 

            pressing problem. It would be a wonderful memorial to Wallace if the 

            biological diversity he so ably promoted to the Victorians survived, 

            in some sustainable way, in perpetuity.</em></p>

<b>Abstract</b> 
<p>
Although thought suppression is a popular form of mental control, research has 
indicated that it can be counterproductive, helping assure the very state of mind 
one had hoped to avoid. This chapter reviews the research on suppression, which 
spans a wide range of domains, including emotions, memory, interpersonal processes, 
psychophysiological reactions, and psychopathology. The chapter considers the 
relevant methodological and theoretical issues and suggests directions for future 
research. 
<p>
<b>Introduction</b> 
<p>
There is a certain predictability to unwanted thoughts, a grim precision in the 
way our mental clockwork returns such thoughts to mind each time we try to suppress 
them. As a result, it is tempting to attribute special significance or power to 
suppressed thoughts, to see them as expressions of sinister workings of mind—and 
in fact, it was exactly this approach that led Freud (e.g. 1953) to focus his 
attention on the nature of thoughts that are expelled from consciousness. As it 
turns out, however, it may not be especially useful to ascribe significance to 
unwanted thoughts themselves. 
<p>
Contemporary research suggests that it is the process of thought suppression, 
not the product, that should be examined for its significance and power. This 
realization has emerged from studies in which people are instructed to spend time 
trying not to think about some particular thought, however neutral or mundane, 
with the consequences of their activity being measured. Early research hinted 
that such instructions might make such a thought tend to return (e.g. Antrobus 
et al 1964, Langfeld 1910). This finding was most pronounced in the "white bear" 
studies of Wegner et al (1987), and the introduction of this standardized laboratory 
paradigm has yielded substantial evidence that the paradoxical nature of the process 
of thought suppression is responsible for the returning of unwanted thoughts to 
mind. 
<p>
Evidence on thought suppression is accumulating broadly at a rapid pace. Although 
there are reviews of aspects of this literature (Beevers et al 1999; Bodenhausen 
& Macrae 1996; Monteith et al 1998a; Purdon & Clark 1999; Wegner 1989, 1992; Wegner 
et al 1994a; Wegner & Wenzlaff 1996), the topic deserves an integrated and current 
review. We endeavor to provide this by focusing on research on the process of 
thought suppression that has accrued since the white bear studies. We begin by 
describing the phenomenon—when suppression is apt to backfire—and the methodological 
considerations relevant to the detection of this paradoxical effect. Next, we 
consider the main theoretical accounts for this outcome and examine the key variables 
that may mediate the effects of thought suppression. We then review the impact 
of suppression on intrapersonal states (e.g. emotional, cognitive) and interpersonal 
processes (e.g. attraction, prejudice), and finally we consider the relationship 
of thought suppression to psychopathology. <br>
&nbsp; 
<p>
<b>The Phenomena</b> 
<p>
Researchers have identified three classes of suppression-related effects: (a) 
enhanced occurrence of target thoughts following a period of suppression; (b) 
an immediate, suppression-induced surge in target thoughts; and (c) an intensification 
of intrusions during suppression, triggered by cognitive demands. In this section, 
we examine the evidence for these different suppression-related phenomena. First, 
however, we briefly discuss the importance of baseline considerations in assessing 
suppression-related effects. 
<p>
<i>Emptying the Head</i> <br>
What exactly does it mean not to think of something? If thought suppression were 
a perfect process, it would ideally leave a person with no vestige of the unwanted 
thought at all. The initial "white bear" experiments of Wegner et al (1987) compared 
thought suppression to this ideal and found it wanting. It was assumed in these 
studies that college students in Texas would almost never think of a white bear 
spontaneously, and therefore that any evidence of such a thought during suppression 
was an indication that suppression had failed. And indeed, many such indications 
were observed. Participants’ signals that the thought was occurring during a 5-minute 
suppression session—in the form of verbal reports or bell-rings to indicate the 
thought’s return—on average exceeded one per minute. 
<p>
This frequency of thinking seems excessive if people can indeed suppress a thought 
completely, but perhaps this is too much to ask. After all, the instruction to 
suppress is a sort of reminder of the unwanted thought. Perhaps this instruction 
cues people to think of the target more than they would have normally. To control 
for such cuing, investigators have examined several comparisons, each implying 
a different baseline level of spontaneous thinking. 
<p>
One baseline approach is the "free monitoring" method, in which participants are 
asked to report whatever comes to mind. This approach is appealing because it 
does not produce artificially high rates of target thoughts and avoids potential 
ceiling and exhaustion effects. It does not, however, control for cuing effects 
that can result when the suppression group is specifically instructed to inhibit 
a particular thought. Moreover, the monitoring condition can risk floor effects 
when natural baseline levels for a particular thought are very low. To avoid the 
problem of a zero baseline and to minimize differential cuing, this free-monitoring 
method typically requires that the experimental procedure expose participants 
to the thought target (e.g. in a film or a reading) prior to the thought reporting 
period. 
<p>
Another possible comparison involves a "cued monitoring" or "mention" control. 
In this case, instructions mention the target thought, either alone or in the 
context of other thoughts, optionally with some instruction indicating that these 
are things the participant may or may not consider during the thought report period. 
In some cases, the participant is also asked to monitor the occurrence of the 
cued thought. This approach helps equate cuing for the suppression and control 
groups while minimizing ceiling and floor effects. Although this approach has 
several advantages, the "mention" instructions may promote excessive attention 
to the target and could distort responses by making participants suspicious about 
its role in the study. Indeed, the attempt to monitor a thought may be a component 
of the mental process of suppression, in which case monitoring serves as a seriously 
flawed baseline. 
<p>
The third potential comparison is the "expression" method, in which control participants 
are instructed to think about the item that the suppression group is trying to 
inhibit. Not surprisingly, this control method produces high rates of target thoughts 
in the control condition, and so makes instructed suppression look very successful. 
Trying not to think of something produces far fewer thoughts than does trying 
to think of it on purpose—but this effect seems attributable to the effectiveness 
of expression, not the effectiveness of suppression. Expression is thus used more 
as an informative comparison condition than as a control. And expression conditions 
have come to be important in suppression research because of the discovery that 
prior suppression can enhance the degree of subsequent expression—the post-suppression 
rebound effect (Wegner et al 1987).

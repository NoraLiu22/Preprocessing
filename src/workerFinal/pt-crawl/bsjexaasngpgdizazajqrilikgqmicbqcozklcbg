        like other reptiles and most (if not all) other animals, have many ways 
        in which they receive input from their environment. The ones we tend to 
        think of are the ones that we humans consciously make the most use of: 
        sight, sound, smell, touch and taste. What we remain largely unconscious 
        of is something that many researchers - and perfume designers - are well 
        aware of: we also receive chemical input that is processed through different 
        pathways than our more obvious senses.</font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">What does 
        this have to do with anoles and other animals? Humans tend to forget that 
        animals rely more heavily on chemical input than we do As a result, how 
        well they do - or don't do - in captivity may be affected by not only 
        what they see and hear, but by the chemicals they are picking up with 
        their tongue and vomeronasal (Jacobson's) organ. Anoles, bearded dragons, 
        leopard geckos and other lizards who live in dynamic social groups can 
        become highly stressed by being forced to live with dominant conspecifics 
        in the close quarters imposed by captivity. This leads to abnormal behavior 
        and, eventually, illness, even death, if the lizard isn't moved out of 
        the enclosure; some may even require being moved into another room so 
        as to be out of smell range as well as out of sight of the dominant lizard.

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Tongue-flicking 
        in reptiles is frequently seen to increase in novel habitats and is presumed 
        to involve the acquisition of chemical information. Like most behavioral 
        patterns, however, tongue-flicking has both multiple causes and multiple 
        functions, only some of which involve chemosensation. This paper describes 
        units of exploratory behavior, including use of the tongue, in a microsmatic 
        lizard, the green anole, <i>Anolis carolinensi</i>s. This species employs 
        its tongue in a manner suggestive of chemosensory exploration, but it 
        possesses modest peripheral chemosensory organs and reduced central representation 
        of chemosensory target cell groups. Further, specific elements of exploratory 
        behavior are affected differently by treatments that involve altering 
        levels of stress-sensitive hormones, androgen, and central catecholamines. 
        Such differential responses suggest that exploratory behavior is an ensemble 
        of individual units, some of which are selectively sensitive to specific 
        physiological elements of the stress response and of elevated arousal.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Recent 
        advances in the field of squamate reptile chemoreception have been paralleled 
        by the growth and preeminence of cladistics in the field of systematics, 
        but for the most part, workers in the former have failed to incorporate 
        the conceptual and informational advances of the latter. In this paper, 
        I attempt a preliminary rapprochement by combining the methods of phylogenetic 
        systematics and current hypotheses of squamate relationships with an overview 
        of squamate chemosensory biology. This purely phylogenetic approach leads 
        to a number of falsifiable generalizations about the evolution of chemoreception 
        in squamates: 1) Evolution of this system is conservative rather than 
        plastic, reflecting to a large extent suprafamilial attributes rather 
        than adaptation to local conditions; 2) Anguimorphs are highly chemosensory 
        and teiids show convergence with this group; 3) Tongue-flicking, a bifurcated 
        tongue tip, a vomeronasal (VNO) mushroom body, and a complete circular 
        muscle system in the tongue are a correlated character complex associated 
        with the attainment, in squamates, of a direct VNO-oral connection and 
        the loss of a VNO-nasal connection; 4) There is little support for a visual-chemosensory 
        dichotomy within Squamata; 5) Gekkotans are allied with Autarchoglossa, 
        both phylogenetically and in terms of chemosensory biology; 6) Iguania 
        are highly variable in chemosensory development; iguanids represent the 
        primitive iguanian condition, while agamids and chamaeleonids have secondarily 
        reduced or lost their chemosensory abilities; 7) Apparent contradictions 
        in chemosensory behavior among iguanids probably represent intrafamilial 
        divergence; 8) Ecological correlates within Iguanidae and other taxa might 
        be spurious, resulting from historical factors unrelated to the adaptations 
        in question; 9) The mechanical demands of lingual food prehension have 
        constrained chemosensory evolution in Iguania; chemosensory evolution 
        within Scleroglossa was permitted by the liberation of the tongue from 
        this ancestral role.</font></p>

        male and female conspecific odor, male and female heterospecific odor, 
        cologne odor, and distilled water. The number of tongue extrusions and

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Aggressive 
        interactions in Anolis carolinensis result in increased circulating levels 
        of epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) and conspicuous color changes. 
        This activation of the adrenergic component of an acute stress response 
        is externally represented by the darkening of the postorbital eyespot 
        of <i>A. carolinensis</i>. In adult males, this site darkens in response 
        to stressful physical stimulation (trauma, passive restraint) or psychological 
        stimuli, most notably the sight of an aggressively intruding conspecific. 
        Aggressive male<i> A. carolinensis</i> exhibit postorbital eyespot darkening; 
        animals that have a longer latency to expression of this eyespot and those 
        that never show this response were defeated in agonistic interactions. 
        Also, during agonistic interactions, subjects that subsequently win are 
        the first to display eyespot darkening. Plasma catecholamine levels are 
        significantly elevated within 30 sec in both combatants. At 30 sec following 
        the determination of the outcome, winning male lizards have plasma NE 
        levels which are higher than those of losers. Castration, however, significantly 
        increases the latency to eyespot darkening and extends its duration. Testosterone 
        levels may therefore enhance the onset of Epi-mediated eyespot darkening 
        as well as other aspects of the endocrine stress response. Elevated androgen 
        levels and more rapid activation of acute catecholamine response increases 
        the likelihood of becoming socially dominant.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hormonal 
        responses to male-male interactions have been detected in some studies 
        of vertebrates but not others. One hypothesis that may partially explain 
        these discrepancies is that differences in the duration of male-male interactions 
        cause different hormonal responses. In social systems based on dominance-subordinance 
        hierarchies interactions often last longer than if exclusive territories 
        are maintained. Tests of the hypothesis that encounter duration explains 
        discrepancies in hormonal responses would be facilitated by a species 
        that shows elements of both types of social systems, such as species in 
        which males practice alternative reproductive tactics. We compared plasma 
        levels of corticosterone and testosterone in males of the territorial 
        morph of the tree lizard (<i>Urosaurus ornatus</i>) subjected either to 
        short (15 min) male-male encounters or to long (7 days) dominance interactions. 
        In the long interactions, dominant males had lower levels of corticosterone 
        than did subordinate males over the first day, but this difference subsequently 
        disappeared. In sharp contrast, winners of short-term encounters had elevated 
        plasma corticosterone levels which peaked the day after the encounter. 
        Thus, males isolated after a short encounter experienced an increase in 
        corticosterone that was apparently inhibited in males who continued interacting 
        with other males. The delayed increase in corticosterone after a short 
        encounter may facilitate metabolic recovery from the encounter, mobilize 
        metabolic substrates useful in subsequent encounters, or may alter subsequent 
        behavior. The response does not appear to be simply recovery from exercise 
        because in a second experiment males exercised for 15 min did not show 
        a similar delayed increase in corticosterone the following day. Testosterone 
        levels were also monitored and did not change in any of these treatments. 
        These results demonstrate that the duration and the outcome of male-male 
        interactions may each independently influence hormone levels.</font></p>

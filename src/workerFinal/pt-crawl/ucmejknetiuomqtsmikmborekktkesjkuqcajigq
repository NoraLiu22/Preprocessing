And the new instrument was brought called the <b>Arched Viall</b>--where
being tuned with lute-strings, and played on with kees like an organ--a
piece of parchment is alway kept moving; and the strings, which by the
kees are pressed down upon it, are grated, in imitation of a bow, by the
parchment; and so it is intended to resemble several vyalls played on with
one bow,--but so basely and harshly, that it will never do.&nbsp; But after
three hours' stay it could not be fixed in tune:&nbsp; and so they were
fain to go to some other musique of instruments....</td>

<td WIDTH="70%" BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">15.&nbsp; ...to the Coffee-house, where
great talk of the <b>Comett</b> seen in several places and among our men
at sea and by my Lord Sandwich, to whom I intend to write about it tonight....&nbsp;
<p>17.&nbsp; ...Mighty talk there is of this Comet that is seen a'nights;
and the King and Queene did sit up last night to see it, and did, it seems.&nbsp;
And to-night I thought to have done so too; but it is cloudy, and so no
stars appear.&nbsp; But I will endeavour it.&nbsp; Mr. Gray did tell me
tonight, for certain, that the Dutch, as high as they seem, do begin to
buckle....
<p>21.&nbsp; ...My Lord Sandwich this day writes me word that he hath seen
(at Portsmouth) the Comett, and says it is the most extraordinary thing
he ever saw.
<p>23.&nbsp; ...It being a bright night, which it hath not been a great
while, I purpose to endeavour to be called in the morning to see the Comett;
though I fear we shall not see it, because it rises at the highest but
16 degrees, and then the houses will hinder us.
<p></a>24.&nbsp; Having sat up all night, to past 2 a-clock
this morning, our porter, being appointed, comes and tells us that the
Bell-man tells him that the star is seen upon <strong>Tower-hill</strong> (<a href="pepysmap1b.html" target="_blank">Map
1</a>,
<b><font color="#ED181E">10</font></b>).&nbsp; So I, that had been all night setting in order
all my old papers in my chamber, did leave off all; and my boy and I to
Tower hill, it being a most fine bright moonshine night and a great frost,
but no Comett to be seen; so after running once round the Hill, I and Tom,
we home and then to bed....&nbsp; This evening, I being informed, did look
and saw the Comett, which is now, whether worn away or no I know not, but
appears not with a tail; but only is larger and duller than any other star,
and is come to rise betimes, and to make a great arch, and is gone quite
to a new place in the heavens than it was before--but I hope, in a clearer
night something more will be seen....
<p>31.&nbsp; ...Public matters are all in a hurry about a Duch warr.&nbsp;
Our preparations great.&nbsp; Our provocations against them great; and
after all our presumption, we are now afraid as much of them, as we lately
contemned them.&nbsp; Every thing else in the State quiet, blessed be God....</td>

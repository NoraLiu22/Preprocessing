	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although the Ring is not a living creature, it seems
		to have a will of its own. In order to return to its Master, it may tempt its
		bearer to put it on when agents of the Enemy are near or it may abandon its
		bearer when least expected. The Ring is a temptation to all who come in contact
		with it. Even the most powerful are lured by their desire to use the Ring to do
		good, but it would corrupt them to evil in the end. Frodo the Hobbit is
		extraordinary in his ability to resist the Ring's will for so long and under
		such extreme circumstances. </FONT></P>

			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A lowly hobbit, long content to live quietly
				with his own unremarkable kind in a remote corner of Middle Earth, is given an
				audacious challenge: return the Ring of Power to the fiery pit where it was
				forged and, against all the massed legions of evil, save the world. That was
				the task of Frodo Baggins in J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary and much-loved The Lord
				of the Rings.</FONT></P> </TD>

			 <P> <FONT FACE="Arial">Director Peter Jackson might have felt a bit
				Frodo-ish when he got the job of bringing Tolkien's trilogy to the screen. He
				has made most of his quirky little films (the deranged puppet farce Meet the
				Feebles, the zombie classic Braindead, the rapturous murder story Heavenly
				Creatures) in his native New Zealand. True to form, he shot this three-part,
				$300 million fantasy back home &#151; and back-to-back-to-back. Shooting is
				completed on all three films, which will be released in consecutive Decembers,
				beginning with this month's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.
				Now he has to be ready for all sorts of comparisons: not just with the Tolkien
				originals, but with a certain other fantasy film franchise launched this year.
				</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If Jackson ever fretted, he needn't have. Like
				Frodo, he should emerge triumphant, for The Fellowship of the Ring is a bigger,
				richer, way-better film than Harry Potter and the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's,
				depending on where you live) Stone. Jackson's work is not simply a sumptuous
				illustration of a favorite fable; though faithful in every detail to Tolkien,
				it has a vigorous life of its own. And it possesses a grandeur, a moral heft
				and emotional depth, that the Potter people never tried for. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Part of the difference between the films and
				their relative achievements derives from the source novels. Rowling's work is
				an intimate epic, a Tom Brown's School Days with some fabulous sleight-of-hand,
				and featuring a trim trio of central characters: the Magical Musketeers of
				English adolescence. Tolkien's is an Iliad, a vast tale of war, sprawling
				across Middle Earth in a metaphor for the Allies' battle against Hitler (in the
				book, the Dark Lord Sauron) or, for that matter, the U.S. and the Northern
				Alliance against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Its cast of characters is
				huge, varied (humans, dwarves, elves, wraiths, Orcs, Ents) and adult.
				</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The only childlike creatures are the Hobbits,
				short of stature and averse to responsibility. In this sense, Frodo and his
				pals Pippin and Sam, whose maturity is won in bitter trials, have echoes in
				Harry and his chums Hermione and Ron. But the Hobbits' journey has heartache at
				its core: they are like kids drafted into a holy, hellish war. And Frodo, as
				the Ring bearer, has what amounts to a suicide mission: the Ring both empowers
				and corrupts anyone who would have it. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">So any apt adaptation of Lord of the Rings is
				bound to have a gravity, even a kind of dread, about the awful task at hand.
				Jackson's film has that gravity. But it is also a buoyant experience &#151; an
				excellent film and a ripping yarn of a movie &#151; because the characters are
				lively and engaging, and because the production team put such skill and joy
				into designing a movie Middle Earth. The landscapes, a cunning mixture of
				computer images and real New Zealand, bestow a distinct and beguiling
				personality to each realm: the elves' sylvan fairy land, the dwarves' dark
				Mines of Moria, the fabulous castle of chief wizard Saruman and, of course, the
				Hobbits' own Shire. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Think of the River Bank from The Wind in the
				Willows, but on the grandest scale, with dozens of Hobbit homes built into
				hillsides. The hutches have a sturdiness &#151; part medieval, part Art Nouveau
				&#151; that takes its style cues from the natural environment; lots of solid
				furniture, and hardly a right angle in sight. The Hobbits blend in, too. They
				are short, round-faced, curly-haired and hairy-footed, and the movie perfectly
				visualizes them. One of the film's small miracles is the persuasive integration
				of these 1.1-m-tall creatures into scenes with all the bigger people. It's done
				with forced perspective, back projection, clever intercutting and frequent
				doubling of the standard-size actors by small folks seen from behind.
				</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It's said that, in movies, 90% of good acting
				is good casting. Every time a new actor shows up &#151; Viggo Mortensen as
				Prince Aragon, Sean Bean as gruff, troubled Boromir, Cate Blanchett and Liv
				Tyler as two great ladies of the wood and lake &#151; the viewer says, "Yes,
				he/she is just right." As Frodo, Elijah Wood uses his giant eyes to project a
				kind of haunted innocence. And Ian McKellen has a lovely time as the wizard
				Gandalf; he sparkles with wisdom, humor, sympathy and worry. Together they
				paint a living portrait of Middle Earth's many peoples and conflicting agendas.
				</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A few caveats for parents: the film is never
				gross, but it's sometimes scary. At 2 hr. 58 min., it will test children's
				endurance and their bladders &#151; but probably not their patience. (Besides,
				an informal poll of New Yorkers who'd seen the 2 hr. 32 min. Harry Potter film
				indicated that adults thought it slow and stodgy while the kids complained that
				it wasn't long enough.) Fellowship may disappoint children because it lacks a
				conventionally satisfying resolution; the movie ends, as the first book does,
				on the cusp of a great adventure. Like Oliver Twist in the Workhouse, kids may
				be wailing, "Please, sir, I want some more" for the next 12 months. </FONT></P>
			 
			 <P><FONT FACE="Arial">But that is the seductive tease of great
				bedtime stories. Jackson's achievement is nearly at that level. His movie
				achieves what the best fairy tales do: the creation of an alternate world,
				plausible and persuasive, where the young &#151; and not only the young &#151;
				can lose themselves. And perhaps, in identifying with the little Hobbit that
				could, find their better selves. </FONT></P>

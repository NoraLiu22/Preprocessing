/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. (1)]]</font> Museums 
          of Natural History should be, one would think, among the most entertaining 
          and instructive of public exhibitions, since their object is to show 
          us life-like restorations of all those wonderful and beautiful animals, 
          the mere description of which in the pages of the traveller, the naturalist, 
          or the sportsman, are of such absorbing interest. Strange to say, however, 
          such is by no means generally the case; and these institutions rarely 
          appear to yield either pleasure or information at all proportionate 
          to their immense cost. We can hardly impute this failure to anything 
          in the nature of museums or of their contents, when we remember that 
          good illustrated works on natural history are universally interesting 
          and instructive; and that private collections of birds, shells, or insects 
          are often very attractive even to the uninitiated, and at the same time 
          of the highest value to the student. We must therefore seek for an explanation 
          of the anomaly in the system on which public museums are usually constituted, 
          in the quality of the specimens they exhibit, and in the mode of exhibiting 
          them, all which, it is now generally admitted, are equally unsuited 
          for the amusement and instruction of the public and for the purposes 
          of the scientific student.</p>
    
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 2]]</font> Public 
          museums of natural objects being such entirely modern institutions, 
          we can hardly wonder that no generally accepted principles have yet 
          been laid down for their construction or arrangement. They most frequently 
          originated with private collectors, whose plan was naturally followed 
          in their enlargement; and when they outgrew their original domicile, 
          an architect was called in, who, according to his special tastes, designed 
          a temple or a palace for their reception. However inconvenient or unsuitable 
          the original mode of exhibition might turn out, or however ill adapted 
          to its purpose the new building might prove, it would, of course, be 
          exceedingly difficult and expensive to alter either of them, more especially 
          as the modified plan might be found, after trial, to have defects as 
          great as that which it replaced.</p>
   
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two eminent naturalists, Sir Joseph Hooker 
          and the late Dr. J. E. Gray, both connected with great public museums, 
          have made suggestions towards a more rational system; and as it is evident 
          that museums will increase, and may be made an important agent in national 
          education and the elevation of the masses of the people, it seems advisable 
          that the subject should be brought forward for popular discussion.</p>
    
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting as a basis the few essential principles 
          that seem now to be agreed upon, I propose to follow them out into some 
          rather important details.</p>
    
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall consider, in the first place, what 
          should be the scope of a Typical Popular Museum, and then sketch out 
          the arrangements best adapted to make it both entertaining and instructive 
          to the young and ignorant, and a means of high intellectual culture 
          and enjoyment to such as may be disposed to avail themselves fully of 
          its teachings.</p>

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Museums are well adapted to illustrate all 
          those branches of knowledge whose subject-matter consists mainly of 
          definite movable and portable objects. The great group of the natural 
          history sciences can scarcely be taught without them; while mathematics, 
          astronomy, physics, and chemistry make use of observatories and laboratories 
          rather than museums. The fine and <font color="990000">[[p. 3]]</font> 
          mechanical arts, as well as history, can also be illustrated by extensive 
          collections of objects; and we are thus led to a broad division of museums, 
          according as they deal mainly with natural objects or with works of 
          art.</p>
 
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A museum of natural objects appears, for a 
          variety of reasons, best fitted to interest, instruct, and elevate the 
          middle and lower classes, and the young. It is more in accordance with 
          their tastes and sympathies, as shown by the universal fondness for 
          flowers and birds, and the great interest excited by new or strange 
          animals. It enables them to acquire a wide and accurate knowledge of 
          the earth and of its varied productions; and if they wish to follow 
          up any branch of natural history as an amusement or a study, it leads 
          them into the pure air and pleasant scenes of the country, and is likely 
          to be the best antidote to habits of dissipation or immorality. Such 
          museums, too, offer the only means by which the mass of the working 
          classes can obtain any actual knowledge of the wonderful productions 
          of nature in present or past ages; and such knowledge gives a new interest 
          to works on geography, travel, or natural history. Owing to the wide 
          disconnection of these subjects from the daily pursuits of life, they 
          are so much the better adapted for the relaxation of those who earn 
          their bread by manual labour. The inexhaustible variety, the strange 
          beauty, and the wondrous complexity of natural objects, are pre-eminently 
          adapted to excite both the observing and reflective powers of the mind, 
          and their study is well calculated to have an elevating and refining 
          effect upon the character.</p>
  
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works of art, on the other hand, though in 
          the highest degree instructive and elevating to some minds, are not 
          so universally attractive; and, what is more important, do not exercise 
          so many faculties, and do not offer such wide and easily-reached fields 
          of study for the working classes. Some previous training or special 
          aptitude is required in order to appreciate them; and it may even be 
          asserted with truth that the study of nature is a necessary preliminary 
          to the appreciation of art. It does not seem improbable that, even if 
          our object were to make artists and lovers of art, good museums of natural 
          objects might be the most useful first step. We have further to <font color="990000">[[p. 
          4]]</font> consider that objects of art are already widely spread, and 
          more or less accessible. Our great public buildings contain their art-decorations. 
          The houses of the wealthy and the shops of our streets are full of art, 
          and the artisan has frequent opportunities of seeing them, while local 
          exhibitions of art are not uncommon, and will no doubt become more and 
          more frequent. The very young and the very ignorant would learn nothing 
          in an art museum, while they would certainly gain both knowledge and 
          pleasure in such an one as I am about to describe.</p>

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Typical Museum of Natural History should 
          contain a series of objects to illustrate all the sciences which treat 
          of the earth, nature, and man. These are--1, Geography and Geology; 
          2, Mineralogy; 3, Botany; 4, Zoology; 5, Ethnology. I will briefly sketch 
          what seems to be the best mode of illustrating these sciences in a museum 
          for the people.</p>
   
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geography and Geology.</em>--Some knowledge 
          of the earth and its structure is so essential a preliminary to any 
          acquaintance with natural history, and the working classes have so few 
          opportunities of seeing large maps, globes, or models, that a good series 
          of these should form a part of the museum. In particular, relief-maps, 
          models, and maps to illustrate physical geography and geology, large 
          sections and diagrams, and large globes, should be so exhibited that 
          they could be conveniently examined and studied in detail.</p>
  
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country around the museum should be shown 
          on a large scale by a model or relief-map, in which the undulations 
          of the ground and the hills, valleys, mountains and streams should be 
          shown on a natural scale of heights, so as not to exaggerate the slopes 
          to three or four times their actual steepness, as is usually done. The 
          more important mountainous regions of our islands, as well as some portions 
          of the Alps and Himalayas, should be shown in the same manner, and all 
          on the same scale, so as to exhibit their true relations to each other. 
          Only in this way can the erroneous ideas derived from maps on different 
          scales and models on an exaggerated vertical scale, be counteracted.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geological maps and sections should also be 
          exhibited; <font color="990000">[[p. 5]]</font> and some geological 
          models on a large scale, built up in separate layers to show the actual 
          position of the stratified rocks in some district not far removed from 
          the museum, would give a more accurate notion of the geological structure 
          of the earth than could be obtained by any number of maps and descriptions. 
          In the same way the extent of the ice during the glacial period in the 
          north of England might be shown, by movable layers of white cement or 
          papier-mach&eacute;, while very large-scale models of portions of the 
          same area might show the results of the ice-action in the rounded and 
          smoothed rocks, the moraines and the deposits of boulder-clays, as well 
          as the erratic blocks coloured to show the parent-rock from which they 
          had been brought by the ice and with lines to show, the course they 
          had travelled. Ice-ground boulders from the moraines and slabs showing 
          glacial stri&aelig; and polish should also be exhibited, with special 
          models of remarkable perched blocks and erratics, moraines and extensive 
          striated rocks. Clearly printed labels should explain how these various 
          objects enable us to determine with considerable accuracy the height 
          to which different areas were buried in ice and the directions in which 
          it flowed. By these various illustrations the reality and the marvellous 
          character of the Great Ice Age would be brought home to all intelligent 
          visitors, and would so interest them that they would long to see the 
          proofs of it in some glaciated country which they could reach by a holiday 
          excursion; and the evidences of ice-action are so widely spread over 
          all the northern and western portions of our islands that for most persons 
          the opportunity could without difficulty be found.</p>
    
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mineralogy.</em>--A series of the most 
          important and best marked minerals should be exhibited, with tables 
          and diagrams explaining the principles of their classification. Their 
          number should not be too large, and every specimen should be accompanied 
          by a label containing a brief account of all that is most interesting 
          connected with it--its chemical constitution, its affinities, its distribution, 
          and its uses. Combined with this collection there should be a series 
          of specimens illustrating the mode <font color="990000">[[p. 6]]</font> 
          of manufacture of the more important minerals, and their application 
          to the arts and sciences. To give a local interest, all British specimens 
          should be placed on tablets of one distinct colour, so as at once to 
          catch the eye, and enable the student to form some idea of the comparative 
          productiveness of his own country.</p>
   
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Botany.</em>--The series of specimens 
          to illustrate the science of botany in a popular museum may be of two 
          kinds: such as show the main facts of plant-structure and classification; 
          and others to teach something of the variety, the distribution, and 
          the uses of plants.</p>
    
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By means of specimens, dissections, drawings, 
          and models, the important radical differences of the great primary divisions 
          of plants--cellular and vascular--acrogenous, endogenous, and exogenous--might 
          be made clearly manifest. Alongside of the drawings and dissections 
          there should be cheap fixed microscopes, showing the main structural 
          differences, thus giving a reality and intensity to the characters which 
          drawings or descriptions alone can never do.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the most important natural orders 
          of plants should next be illustrated by specimens of various kinds. 
          Their structure and essential characters should first be shown, in the 
          same way as the higher groups. Their geographical distribution should 
          be marked out on small maps. Good dried specimens, and, if necessary, 
          drawings or models of flowers or fruit, of the more characteristic and 
          remarkable species, should then be exhibited; and along with these, 
          samples of whatever useful products are derived from them. Where remarkable 
          forest-trees occur in an order, good coloured drawings of them should 
          be shown, as well as longitudinal and cross sections of their wood. 
          In the same, or an adjoining case, specimens or casts of the most important 
          fossil-plants of the same order may be exhibited, illustrating their 
          range backward into past time.</p>
   
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By such a scheme as this, in a comparatively 
          small space and with a small number of specimens, all that is of most 
          importance in the vegetable kingdom would be shown. The attentive observer 
          might learn much of <font color="990000">[[p. 7]]</font> the structure, 
          the forms, and the varied modifications of plants: their classification 
          and affinities; their distribution in space and time; their habits and 
          modes of growth; their uses to savage and to civilized man. An outline 
          of all that is most interesting and instructive in the science would 
          be made visible to the eye and clear to the understanding; and it does 
          not seem too much to expect that, so exhibited, Botany would lose much 
          of its supposed difficulty and repulsiveness, and that many might be 
          thereby induced to devote their leisure to this most useful and attractive 
          study.</p>
    
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to assist those who are really students, 
          a separate room should be provided, containing a Herbarium of British 
          plants, as well as one illustrative of the more important exotic families 
          and genera; and to this should be attached a collection of the more 
          useful botanical works.</p>
     
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoology.</em>--Owing to the superior numbers 
          and greater variety of animals, their more complicated structure and 
          more divergent habits, the higher interest that attaches to them, and 
          their greater adaptability for exhibition, this department must always 
          be the most extensive and most important in a Natural History Museum.</p>
   
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general principles guiding the selection 
          and exhibition of animals are the same as have been applied to plants, 
          subject to many modifications in detail. The great primary divisions, 
          or sub-kingdoms (Vertebrata, Mollusca, &amp;c.), as well as the classes 
          in each sub-kingdom (Mammalia, Birds, &amp;c. and Cephalopoda, Gasteropoda, 
          &amp;c.), should be defined, by means of skeletons and anatomical preparations 
          or models, so as to render their fundamental differences of structure 
          clear and intelligible. At the head of each order (or subdivision of 
          the class) a similar exposition should be made of essential differences 
          of structure; and in every case the function or purpose of these differences 
          should be pointed out by means of clearly-expressed tables and diagrams.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the specimens of animals to 
          be exhibited, in order to give an adequate idea of their variety and 
          beauty; their strange modifications of form <font color="990000">[[p. 
          8]]</font> and structure, their singular habits and mode of life, their 
          distribution over the surface of the earth, and their first appearance 
          in past time. To do this effectively requires a mode of exhibition very 
          different from that which has been usually adopted in museums.</p>
      
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the animal kingdom, at least one 
          or more species of every important family group should be exhibited; 
          and in the larger and more interesting families, one or more species 
          of each genus. The number of specimens is not, however, so important 
          as their quality and the mode of exhibiting them. A few of the more 
          important species in each order, well illustrated by fine and characteristic 
          specimens, would be far better than ten times the number if imperfect, 
          badly prepared, and badly arranged. Let any one look at an artistically 
          mounted group of fine and perfect quadruped or bird skins, which represent 
          the living animals in perfect health and vigour, and by their characteristic 
          attitudes and accessories tell the history of the creature's life and 
          habits; and compare this with the immature, ragged, mangy-looking specimens 
          one often sees in museums, stuck up in stiff and unnatural attitudes, 
          and resembling only mummies or scarecrows. The one is both instructive 
          and pleasing, and we return again and again to gaze upon it with delight. 
          The other is positively repellent, and we feel that we never want to 
          look upon it again.</p>
    
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider it therefore an important principle, 
          that in a museum for the people nothing should be exhibited that is 
          not good of its kind, and mounted in the very best manner. Fortunately, 
          specimens of a large number of the most beautiful and extraordinary 
          animals are now exceedingly common, and every well-marked group in nature 
          may be illustrated without having recourse to the rarer and more costly 
          species. Carrying out these views, we should exhibit our animal in such 
          a way as to convey the largest amount of information possible. The male, 
          female, and young should be shown together, the mode of feeding or of 
          capturing its prey, and the most characteristic attitudes and motions, 
          should be indicated; and the accessories should point out the country 
          the species <font color="990000">[[p. 9]]</font> inhabits, or the kind 
          of locality it most frequents. A descriptive tablet should of course 
          give further information; and in the immediate vicinity, specimens showing 
          any remarkable points of its anatomy, and any useful products that are 
          derived from it, should be exhibited.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each group of this kind would be a study of 
          itself, and should therefore be kept quite distinct and apart from every 
          other group. It should be so placed that it could be seen from several 
          points of view, and every part of each individual composing it closely 
          examined. To encourage such examination and study, seats should be placed 
          conveniently near it--a point strangely overlooked in most museums, 
          where it seems to be taken for granted that visitors will pass on without 
          any desire to linger, or any wish for a more close examination. It would 
          add still further to the interest of these typical groups, if it were 
          clearly shown how much they represented, by giving a list of all the 
          well-known species of the genus or family, with their native country 
          and proportionate size, and indicating, by means of a coloured line, 
          which of them were exhibited in the museum. This would be an excellent 
          and most intelligible guide to the collection itself, and would enable 
          the visitor to judge how far it gave any adequate notion of the variety 
          and exuberance of nature.</p>
      
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also, I think, be advisable, that 
          as far as possible each well-marked and important group of any considerable 
          extent should occupy one room or compartment only, where it would be 
          separated from all others, where the attention could be concentrated 
          upon it, and where the extent to which it was illustrated could be seen 
          at a glance. This has not, I believe, been yet attempted in any museum; 
          and when I come to speak of the building arrangements, I will explain 
          how it can be easily managed. In this room, a department would also 
          be devoted to the comparative anatomy of all the more important species 
          and groups exhibited; and a large map should be suspended, showing in 
          some detail their geographical distribution. Here, too, we should place 
          specimens or casts of the fossil remains of the family, with restorations 
          of some of the more important species; <font color="990000">[[p. 10]]</font> 
          and along with these, diagrams, showing the progress of development 
          of the group throughout past time, as far as yet known.</p>
      
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode of attractive and instructive exhibition 
          might be well carried out in the Mammalia, Birds, and Insects; less 
          perfectly in the Reptiles and Fishes, whose colours can hardly be well 
          preserved except in spirits. Even here, however, by using oblong earthenware 
          vessels with glass fronts, instead of the usual bottles, many fishes 
          and marine animals could be exhibited in life-like attitudes and with 
          their colours well preserved. Mollusca may be well illustrated by means 
          of models of the animals, as also may the marine and fresh-water Zoophytes. 
          The more minute and delicate animals should be shown by means of a series 
          of cheap microscopes or large lenses, fixed in suitable positions; and 
          with a careful outline of the animal's history on a tablet or card, 
          close by.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected with this, as with the botanical division 
          of the museum, there should be a students' department, to which all 
          should have free access who wished to obtain more detailed knowledge. 
          Here would be preserved, in the most compact and accessible form, in 
          cabinets or boxes, all specimens acquired by the museum and which were 
          not required or were not adapted for exhibition in the popular department. 
          Here, too, should be formed a complete local or British collection of 
          indigenous animals, according to the extent and means of the institution, 
          with the best zoological library of reference that could be obtained. 
          In this department, donations of almost any kind would be acceptable; 
          for, when not required for popular exhibition, an immense number of 
          specimens can be conveniently and systematically arranged in a very 
          limited space, and for purposes of study or for identification of species 
          are almost sure to be of value. One of the greatest evils of most local 
          museums is thus got rid of--the giving offence by refusing donations, 
          or being forced to occupy much valuable space with such as are utterly 
          unfit for popular exhibition.</p>
      
        <p> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethnology.</em>--We now come to the last 
          department of our ideal museum, and it is one to which a large or a 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 11]]</font> small proportion of space may 
          be devoted, according to the importance that may be attached to it. 
          In accordance with the plan already sketched out for other departments, 
          the following would be a fair representation of Ethnological science.</p>
       
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief well-marked races of man should 
          be illustrated either by life-size models, casts, coloured figures, 
          or by photographs. A corresponding series of their crania should also 
          be shown; and such portions of the skeleton as should exhibit the differences 
          that exist between certain races, as well as those between the lower 
          races and those animals which most nearly approach them. Casts of the 
          best authenticated remains of prehistoric man should also be obtained, 
          and compared with the corresponding parts of existing races.</p>
       
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arts of mankind should be illustrated 
          by a series, commencing with the rudest flint implements, and passing 
          through those of polished stone, bronze, and iron--showing in every 
          case, along with the works of prehistoric man, those corresponding to 
          them formed by existing savage races. Implements of bone and of horn 
          should follow the same order.</p>
      
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pottery would furnish a most interesting series. 
          Beginning with the rude forms of prehistoric races, and following with 
          those of modern savages, we should have the strangely-modelled vessels 
          of Peru and of North America, those of Egypt, Assyria, Etruria, Greece, 
          and Rome, as well as the works of China and of medi&aelig;val and modern 
          Europe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The art of sculpture and mode of ornamentation 
          should be traced in like manner, among savage tribes, the Oriental nations, 
          Greece, and Rome, to modern civilization. Works in metal and textile 
          fabrics would admit of similar illustration. Characteristic weapons 
          should also be exhibited; and painting might be traced in broad steps, 
          from the contemporary delineation of a Mammoth up to the animal portraiture 
          of Landseer.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comprises a series of Ethnological illustrations 
          that need not occupy much space, and would, I think, be eminently instructive. 
          The clothing, the houses, the household utensils, and the weapons of 
          mankind, can <font color="990000">[[p. 12]]</font> hardly be shown with 
          any approach to completeness in a Popular Museum; and many of these 
          objects occupy space quite disproportionate to their intrinsic interest 
          or scientific value. They could in most cases be sufficiently indicated 
          by drawings or models.</p>
    
        <p align="center"><em>Situation and Plan of Museum.</em></p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The museum here sketched, beginning with illustrations 
          of the earth and its component minerals, passing through the whole vegetable 
          and animal kingdoms, and culminating in the highest art-products of 
          civilized man, would combine a very wide range of objects with a clearly 
          limited scheme, and would, I believe, well answer to the definition 
          of a Typical Museum of Natural History. Although of such wide scope, 
          it need not necessarily occupy a very large space; and I believe it 
          might be instructively carried out in a building no larger than is devoted 
          to many local museums. This brings me to say a few words on the kind 
          of building best adapted to such an institution as is here sketched 
          out.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his President's address to the British 
          Association at Norwich, Sir Joseph Hooker made some admirable remarks 
          on the situation of museums. He observed:
        </p>
     
        </p><blockquote><font size="-1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Much of the utility 
          of museums depends on two conditions often strangely overlooked, viz. 
          their situation, and their lighting and interior arrangements. The provincial 
          museum is too often huddled away almost out of sight, in a dark, crowded, 
          dirty thoroughfare, where it pays dear for ground rent, rates, and taxes, 
          and cannot be extended. Such localities are frequented by the townspeople 
          only when on business, and when they consequently have no time for sight 
          seeing. In the evening, or on holidays, when they would visit the museum, 
          they naturally prefer the outskirts of the town to its centre. . . . 
          The museum should be in an open grassed square or park, planted with 
          trees, in the town or its outskirts; a main object being to secure cleanliness, 
          a cheerful aspect, and space for extension. Now, vegetation is the best 
          interceptor of dust, which is injurious to the specimens as well as 
          unsightly, whilst a cheerful aspect, and grass and trees, will attract 
          visitors, and especially families and schools.&quot;</font></blockquote>
  
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently, then, the proper place for the 
          museum is the centre of the park or public garden. This furnishes the 
          largest and cleanest open space, the best light, the purest <font color="990000">[[p. 
          13]]</font> air, and the readiest access. With how much greater pleasure 
          the workman and his family could spend a day at the museum, if at intervals 
          they could stroll out on to the grass, among flowers and under shady 
          trees, to enjoy the refreshments they had brought with them. They would 
          then return to the building with renewed zest, and would probably escape 
          the fatigue and headache that a day in a museum almost invariably brings 
          on. The public park is the proper locality for the public museum.</p>
      
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In designing museums, architects seem to pay 
          little regard to the special purposes they are intended to fulfil. They 
          often adopt the general arrangement of a church, or the immense galleries 
          and lofty halls of a palace. Now, the main object of a museum-building 
          is to furnish the greatest amount of well lighted space, for the convenient 
          arrangement and exhibition of objects which almost all require to be 
          closely examined. At the same time they should be visible by several 
          persons at once without crowding, and admit of others freely passing 
          by them. None except the very largest specimens should be placed so 
          as to rise higher than seven feet above the floor, so that palatial 
          rooms and extensive galleries, requiring proportionate altitude, are 
          exceedingly wasteful of space, and otherwise ill adapted and unnecessary 
          for the real purposes of a museum. It is true that side-galleries against 
          the walls may be and often are used to utilize the height, but these 
          are almost necessarily narrow, and totally unadapted for the proper 
          exhibition of any but a limited class of objects. By this plan, too, 
          the whole upper-floor space is lost, which is of great importance, because 
          a large proportion of objects are best exhibited on tables or in detached 
          cases.</p>
     
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following out this view, a simple and economical 
          plan for a museum would seem to be, a series of long rooms or galleries, 
          about thirty-five or forty feet wide, and twelve or fourteen feet high 
          on each floor, the four or five feet below the ceiling on both sides 
          being an almost continuous series of window openings, while at rather 
          wide intervals large windows might descend to within three feet of the 
          floor. At such distances apart as were found most <font color="990000">[[p. 
          14]]</font> convenient for the arrangement of the collections, movable 
          upright cases might be placed transversely, leaving a central space 
          of about five feet for a continuous passage; and the compartments thus 
          formed might be completed by partitions and doors connecting opposite 
          cases, wherever it was thought advisable to isolate any well-marked 
          group of animals, or other division of the museum. By this means the 
          proportion between wall-cases and floor space might be regulated exactly 
          according to the requirements of each portion of the collection; and 
          abundant light would be obtained for the perfect examination of every 
          specimen.</p>
      
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the great evils of museums are, crowding 
          and distraction. By the crowding of specimens, the effect of each is 
          weakened or destroyed; the eye takes in so many at once that it is continually 
          wandering towards something more strange and beautiful, and there is 
          nothing to concentrate the attention on a special object. Distraction 
          is produced also by the great size of the galleries, and the multiplicity 
          of objects that strike the eye. It is almost impossible for a casual 
          visitor to avoid the desire of continually going on to see what comes 
          next, or wondering what is that bright mass of colour or strange form 
          that catches the eye at the other end of the long gallery. These evils 
          can best be avoided, by keeping, as far as possible, each natural group 
          of objects in a separate room, or a separate compartment of that room--by 
          limiting as much as possible the number of illustrative groups of species, 
          and at the same time making each group as attractive and instructive 
          as possible. The object aimed at should be, to compel attention to each 
          group of specimens. This may be done by making it so interesting or 
          beautiful at first sight as to secure a close examination; by carefully 
          isolating it, so that no other object close by should divide attention 
          with it; and by giving so much information and interesting the mind 
          in so many collateral matters connected with it, as to excite the observant 
          and reflective as well as the emotional faculties.</p>
      
        <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general system of arrangement 
          and exhibition here pointed out does not at all depend on the building. 
          It <font color="990000">[[p. 15]]</font> can be applied in any museum, 
          and is, I believe, already to some extent adopted in our best local 
          institutions. It has, however, never yet been carried out systematically; 
          and till this is done, we can form no true estimate of how popular a 
          Natural History Museum may become, or how much it may aid in the great 
          work of national education.</p>

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper on American Museums, which follows 
          this, was written eighteen years later, in Washington, immediately after 
          a careful study of the two most remarkable museums in the United States. 
          It will be seen, that one of these has carried out most of the suggestions 
          of my early article, and has besides developed the idea of illustrating 
          the Geographical Distribution of Animals which is, so far as I know, 
          entirely new.</p>

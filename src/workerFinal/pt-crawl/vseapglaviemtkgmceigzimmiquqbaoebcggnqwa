   <p><span class="selection-dropcap">D</span>ecarbonization has ascended to the top of the global business agenda, ushering in a period of exponential growth in companies committing to net zero following the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). More than 3,000 businesses and financial institutions have declared their intentions and are working with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce their emissions in line with climate science.</p> 
   <p>Momentum continues to build as businesses transform their operations to support decarbonization. But for growing organizations everywhere, the benefits of positive growth come with an urgent need to manage the risk of increased emissions as a result.</p> 
   <p>“The challenge we face in FY23 and beyond is to continue to grow our business and maintain our distinctive global culture, while reducing our absolute emissions,” says Steve Varley, EY Global Vice Chair – Sustainability. This challenge is illustrated by the fact that the EY people base (measured in Full Time Equivalents, or FTE) has grown 29% since our baseline year of FY19.</p> 
   <p>In addition, with the return of business travel, FY23 is the first year we expect our air travel emission limits to be really tested.<strong> </strong>“We are ready to meet this challenge and are confident that the actions laid out in our carbon action plan will help us remain on track to reach net zero,” says Varley.</p>

   <p>EY launched its <a href="/en_cn/sustainability/how-can-carbon-negative-unlock-positive-value-for-the-planet"><strong>carbon ambition</strong></a> in January 2021: to reach net zero in 2025 with a 40% reduction in our absolute GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions (against an FY19 baseline). This is consistent with a 1.5°C reduction pathway approved by SBTi<sup>1</sup>. This target aligns with what climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C degrees.</p> 
   <p>We reached the major milestone of becoming carbon negative globally in FY21. Being carbon negative means we offset or remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit. We are proud to remain carbon negative in FY22, keeping us on track to reach net zero in 2025.</p> 
   <h4>How EY is reducing GHG emissions and remaining carbon negative</h4> 
   <p>In FY22, our GHG emissions totalled 597k tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e). While this represents a 56% reduction on our baseline of FY19 (1,354k tCO<sub>2</sub>e), it also reflects a 52% increase from FY21 — a year which saw a dramatic drop in our Scope 3 travel emissions and Scope 2 office electricity usage. This was not unexpected, as many EY businesses in FY22 resumed more normal business operations, and our 1.5°C pathway factors in an expected increase in GHG emissions in the post-COVID-19 environment.</p> 
   <p>To offset the emissions that we have not yet eliminated, EY continues to invest in a carbon offset portfolio with leading project developers and global climate solutions providers Combined, these projects offset 723k tCO<sub>2</sub>e, representing 121% of EY’s FY22 emissions — confirming our carbon negative position for FY22. All projects meet our criteria for quality offsets and have demonstrated that they are independently verified, additional, permanent, not used for other purposes, will not result in leakage, and have a positive impact on the community.<strong></strong></p> 
   <p>We have implemented new technology, just as many of our clients are doing, to help track our emissions with greater precision. Through the implementation of <a href="/en_gl/news/2021/03/ey-and-enablon-announce-environmental-social-and-governance-management-and-reporting-solution">Enablon</a>, we can now more precisely track our emissions across Scopes 1 and 2. This includes data points like energy usage, water consumption, fuel data and more from around 650 offices across the EY network.</p> 
   <p>We also continue to closely track our Scope 3 emissions through analysis of our travel bookings and spend across air, rail and car. Travel plays a critical role in helping enable us to deliver exceptional client service, win in the market, collaborate across EY teams and strengthen our EY culture. But we recognize we must travel in a way that is thoughtful and considered, and ensures we remain on track to reach our net-zero target in 2025. Our air travel emissions limit for FY23 is a 6% decrease on our FY22 limit. To ensure we meet this reduced limit, our challenge for FY23 and beyond will be to balance the reduction of emissions with meeting travel requirements for EY clients and other activities.</p> 
   <h4>Progress on our seven-point plan to reach net zero in 2025</h4> 
   <p>To reach net zero in 2025, we will continue to deliver on our seven-point plan to reduce our GHG emissions and become an even more sustainable organization. Over FY22 we’ve made substantial progress on each of our key actions:</p>

          <p>*Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in line with the global EY carbon footprint methodology. This is based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), using its ‘location-based’ approach to reporting scope 2 emissions. Emissions calculations use 2022 conversion factors published by the UK Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy or locally published factors where appropriate. Conversion factors used to calculate emissions from air travel include the impact of ‘radiative forcing’. Emissions from office energy consumption are estimated using activity data representing 83% of the global office portfolio. In 2022 additional categories of scope 3 emissions have been included to align our reporting with our Science Based Target. Figures for each of the three reported years (above) include emissions relating to the following scope 3 categories: business travel; employee commuting; remote working; waste generated in operations; and fuel and energy related activities.</p>

          <p><strong>Science-based target (SBT): </strong>A greenhouse gas reduction target to reduce an organization’s emissions in line with climate science and the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels.</p> 
          <p><strong>Carbon neutral:</strong> The result of an organization removing and offsetting emissions equivalent to its carbon footprint each year.</p> 
          <p><strong>Carbon negative:</strong> The result of an organization both reducing its emissions in line with its 1.5˚C SBT and investing in nature-based solutions and carbon technologies to remove and offset more carbon than it emits each year.</p> 
          <p><strong>Net zero:</strong> The point at which an organization has achieved its 1.5˚C SBT and removed its residual emissions from the atmosphere.</p> 
          <p><strong>Emission scopes:</strong> Emissions are split into three categories by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol:</p> 
          <p>Scope 1: All direct emissions from the activities of an organization or those under its control<br> Scope 2: Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by an organization<br> Scope 3: All other indirect emissions from activities of an organization, excluding electricity</p> 
          <p>For EY, scope 1 and 2 is largely related to office energy, while scope 3 is from business travel.<br> </p>

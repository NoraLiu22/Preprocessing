If the fossil matrix was uncooperative, and specimens were only                partially revealed, then tools such as brushes, steel dental                picks, and power sanding heads might be used to attempt to                remove the matrix. In Morocco, native extractors still use                hammer and nails, leaving heavily damaged specimens that are                very sad to see indeed! Compare, for example, the two specimens                of the phacopid&nbsp;trilobite <i>Hollardops</i> sp.                (previously called <i>Metacanthina</i>) from Morocco. The one                on the left was extracted crudely, while the one on the right                was prepared using modern equipment and methods.&nbsp;</td>              <td align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="metgood.jpg" height="257"                  width="165">                <br>                <font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="-1">superbly-prepared                    specimen</font></font></td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </center>      <hr width="100%"> <br>      <b><font size="+1">Modern equipment</font></b> <br>      Although good hand-preparation is still valuable today, there are a number      of enhancements that can greatly augment the preparation of fossils. For      example, with today's wide range of abrasives, and devices that use      air-pressure to direct abrasive grit at very small targets, it is possible      to remove surrounding matrix from a trilobite specimen without damaging      even the finest structures of the&nbsp;trilobite's exoskeleton. This      requires hours of fine work, typically under a stereomicroscope. The basic      principle is to select a grit hardness that is greater than that of the      matrix, yet softer than the&nbsp;trilobite's shell material. That way, the      grit cuts readily into the matrix, but does little or no damage to      the&nbsp;trilobite. The equipment is costly, between rotary tools and      scribes, air-abrasive equipment, microscope and other lab preparations, a      set-up for good fossil&nbsp;preparation will easily run over $8,000.

        Brett</a> a 1" specimen of the Moroccan <i>Proetus</i> (<i>Gerastos</i>)      cf <i>granulosus</i> that had been carefully prepared, largely using      air-abrasion techniques.

After an hour of this, the very top of the              trilobite specimen is revealed, and the experienced preparator can              identify it, anticipate its shape within the matrix, and remove              matrix accordingly with confidence. <br>              <img src="preppro1b.jpg" height="93" width="175"> <br>              <font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="-1">lateral view&nbsp;</font></font>              <hr width="100%"></td>          </tr>          <tr valign="bottom">            <td valign="bottom" width="33%">              <center><b>At 2 hours:</b>                <p><img src="preppro2.jpg" height="157" width="100"> <br>                  <font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="-1">top view</font></font>                </p>                <hr width="90%"></center>            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="67%">To roughly expose              the&nbsp;trilobite, the correct grit is selected, and the matrix              is air-abraded away from the&nbsp;trilobite, alternating with              air-scribe to remove thicker portions of surrounding matrix, and              sculpt the matrix around the&nbsp;trilobite. The preparator's              experience with previous trilobite specimens of this taxon is very              important here, since the goal is to expose the trilobite down to              the edges of the dorsal shell, yet provide a strong enough              foundation that those edges aren't over-exposed and prone to              breakage. <br>              <img src="preppro2b.jpg" height="88" width="166"> <br>              <font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="-1">lateral view&nbsp;</font></font>              <hr width="100%"></td>          </tr>          <tr valign="bottom">            <td valign="bottom" width="33%">              <center><b>At 3 hours:</b>                <p><img src="preppro3.jpg" height="162" width="95"> <br>                  <font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="-1">top view</font></font></p>              </center>            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="67%">The edges of the dorsal exoskeleton              are completely exposed, alternating between air abrasives and air              scribe, until the rough stage is essentially complete.

At this point, the air-scribe is set              aside, and only air-abrasives are used in stages 2 and 3. <br>              <img src="preppro3b.jpg" height="94" width="159"> <br>              <font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="-1">lateral view</font></font></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td colspan="2" bgcolor="#f0dcce" valign="top"><font size="+1">&nbsp;<b><font                    color="#993300">STAGE

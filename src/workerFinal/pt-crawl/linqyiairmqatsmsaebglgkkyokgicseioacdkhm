/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 289]]</font> This 
        new volume of the International Scientific Series gives an excellent summary 
        of the most recent researches as to the varied uses of the colours of 
        animals, and more especially of those admirable observations and experiments 
        on variable protective colouring with which Mr. Poulton's name is associated, 
        and which mark an era in this branch of natural history. The main outlines 
        of the subject are so well known, both to naturalists and to general readers, 
        that it will only be necessary here to indicate some of the more important 
        of the matters now first treated in a popular work, and to make a few 
        remarks on some of the more difficult problems discussed in the volume.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first chapter 
        gives a short but very clear statement of the physical cause of animal 
        colours, and contains some valuable observations on the effect of thin 
        films of air or of liquids in the production of iridescent colours. In 
        some cases dried insects lose some of their metallic colours, but these 
        reappear when the specimen is dipped in water. Even living beetles have 
        been observed to lose their lustre after hybernation, and to regain it 
        after drinking water. Then we have a sketch of the general uses of colour 
        to animals, and it is shown that the frequent dark colour of arctic insects 
        has probably a physiological use in enabling them to absorb as much heat 
        as possible during the brief period of their existence under an arctic 
        sun. This is supported by some direct observations; but the further suggestion 
        that the white colour of so many arctic birds and mammals has also a physiological 
        use in checking the loss of heat through radiation is less satisfactory. 
        Not only is there no evidence to show that the loss of animal heat is 
        at all influenced by the colour of the fur or feathers, but it is evident 
        that the same result could be brought about by a very slight increase 
        in the texture or thickness of the covering, such as actually occurs in 
        all arctic animals. In the seventh chapter there is a very interesting 
        discussion on the way in which the white winter coat of arctic animals 
        is produced, and it is shown that in the American arctic hare the brown 
        hairs of the summer coat turn white at the tips, while a quantity of new 
        white hairs grow among them, producing at once the thickening of the coat 
        for warmth and the change of colour for protection. That this last is 
        the only function of the colour is well indicated by the case of the raven, 
        which is found in the extreme north of the polar regions, even during 
        the most intense colds of winter, wherever the reindeer and musk-sheep 
        range. Yet it is here as black as elsewhere, although the occasional occurrence 
        of pied and even of white ravens in various parts of Europe and America 
        shows that a white race could be produced if that colour was of any advantage 
        to the bird in its arctic habitat.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two chapters are 
        devoted to a subject which Mr. Poulton has made especially his own, the 
        variable protective colouring of insects. This was first noticed by the 
        late Mr. T. W. Wood, the well-known natural history artist who furnished 
        many of the best illustrations for Darwin's &quot;Expression of the Emotions 
        in Man and Animals,&quot; and the result of his experiments were brought before 
        the Entomological Society of London in 1867. Since then a few other observations 
        have been made by several naturalists, but little was known of the extent 
        or of the exact causes of the adaptation till Mr. Poulton carried out 
        his experiments for several years in succession, and on so extensive a 
        scale that in one year over 700 larv&aelig; of the small tortoiseshell 
        butterfly (<em>Vanessa urtic&aelig;</em>) were observed under various 
        surroundings, and the colours of the resulting chrysalides recorded. In 
        this way pup&aelig; were obtained varying from black to nearly white or 
        metallic golden colours, in each case corresponding more or less closely 
        to the coloured surfaces on which they were suspended. By changing the 
        coloured surroundings at different stages of the process, and by blinding 
        some of the larv&aelig;, it was ascertained that the period of susceptibility 
        is the quiescent stage just before the change to the pupa state, and that 
        in this case vision has nothing to do with the change of colour. By a 
        number of ingenious experiments, it was ascertained that the whole surface 
        of the skin is sensitive to the action of variously-coloured light, and 
        the effect on the pupa-skin is produced, not directly, as by some photographic 
        action, but by a physiological process acting through the nervous system. 
        In some cases even the cocoons spun by the larv&aelig; are modified by 
        the surrounding colours; and still more curious changes are effected in 
        the larva itself when, as in so many cases, the same species feeds on 
        several plants having differently-coloured leaves. Even the presence of 
        numerous dark twigs has been shown to cause a corresponding change of 
        colour in the larva of the peppered moth (<em>Amphidasis betularia</em>). 
        These two chapters afford a beautiful example of a very difficult and 
        interesting inquiry leading to an explanation of some of the most curious 
        colour-phenomena in the animal kingdom. Mr. Poulton points out the essential 
        difference between this mode of colour-adjustment and that of the chameleon, 
        and of some crustacea, frogs, and fishes, which can rapidly adjust their 
        colours to new surroundings, in the following passage:--</p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
        essential difference between the two kinds of adjustment is that, in the 
        one case, the pigmented part of certain cells contracts in obedience to 
        nervous stimuli, and thus alters the general appearance; while in the 
        other case the coloured part is actually built up of the appropriate tint, 
        or loses its colour altogether and becomes transparent in obedience to 
        the same stimuli. The frog or fish has a series of ready-made screens 
        which can be shifted to suit the environment; the insect has the power 
        of building up an appropriate screen. In many cases, however, the green 
        colour of caterpillars is due to the ready-made colour of the blood, which 
        becomes effective when pigment is removed from the superficial cells, 
        but which disappears when the latter are rendered opaque. Here, however, 
        the superficial cells form the screen which has to be built up, or from 
        which the colour must be dismissed; and in certain species [<font color="#990000">[p. 
        290]]</font> even the colour of the blood is entirely changed in the passage 
        from a green to a dark variety, or <em>vice vers&acirc;</em>. Hence it 
        is to be expected that the changes occurring in an insect will occupy 
        a considerable time as compared with those which take place in a frog. 
        Another difference between the two processes is that the stimulus from 
        the environment falls upon the eye in the one case, and probably upon 
        the surface of the skin in the other.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Poulton's work 
        is of special importance for the numerous experimental proofs he gives 
        of the protective value of many of the peculiarities in the colour markings 
        or attitudes of insects. Thus the green lizard (<em>Lacerta viridis</em>) 
        generally failed to detect a &quot;stick caterpillar&quot; in its position of rest, 
        although the insect is seized and greedily devoured directly it moves. 
        The value of the tufts of hair, called &quot;tussocks,&quot; on many caterpillars 
        was also proved experimentally.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A 
        caterpillar of the common vapourer moth (<em>Orgyia antiqua</em>) was 
        introduced into a lizards' cage, and when attacked, instantly assumed 
        the defensive attitude, with the head tucked in and the 'tussocks' separated 
        and rendered as prominent as possible. An unwary lizard seized the apparently 
        convenient projection; most of the 'tussock' came out in its mouth, and 
        the caterpillar was not troubled further. The lizard spent a long and 
        evidently most uncomfortable time in trying to get rid of its mouthful 
        of hairs.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a most 
        excellent account of the larva of the lobster moth (<em>Stauropus fagi</em>) 
        which is protected by its marvellous resemblance to a withered beech-leaf 
        and its stipules, and is also able to assume a terrifying attitude, when 
        it resembles some large and strangely formed spider. When one of these 
        larv&aelig; had assumed the terrifying attitude, a marmoset monkey was 
        much impressed by the alarming sight, and only ventured to attack after 
        the most careful examination, and even then in the most cautious manner. 
        A lizard exhibited the same caution before the larva was attacked. The 
        same insect is also to some extent protected from ichneumons by two black 
        marks, exhibited only when attacked, which resemble those produced by 
        the stings of ichneumons, and thus prevent an attack, since these parasites 
        always avoid larv&aelig; which are already occupied.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two chapters are 
        devoted to an excellent account of the various forms of mimicry, a subject 
        which, however interesting, has been so often treated that there is comparatively 
        little new to be said upon it; and then we have two chapters on sexual 
        colours, which will offer material for a few remarks, as the whole subject 
        is full of difficulties, and requires much more observation and experiment 
        before the problems it presents can be satisfactorily settled.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Poulton fully 
        accepts Darwin's theory of female choice as the source of the greater 
        part of the brilliant colour, delicate patterns, and ornamental appendages 
        that exist among animals, and especially among birds and insects. Much 
        stress is laid on the observations of two American writers on the courtship 
        of spiders. These show that spiders resemble birds in the strange postures 
        and long-continued antics of the male during courtship, and that he always 
        exhibits whatever portion of his body is most conspicuously coloured.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
        female always watches the antics of the male intently, but often refuses 
        him in the end, 'even after dancing before her for a long time.' Such 
        observations strongly point towards the existence of female preference 
        based on &aelig;sthetic considerations.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the last four 
        words we demur, as being altogether unproved. Why <em>&aelig;sthetic</em> 
        considerations? Why not a deficiency in activity, or in size, or in some 
        exciting odour, or in the excitability of the female at the moment? Any 
        of these causes, or others unknown to us, may determine the acceptance 
        or rejection of a male spider; and it is to be noted that the long-continued 
        and careful observations of these American authors have not enabled them 
        to adduce a single case in which any deficiency of colour was observed 
        in a rejected male. There is, indeed, one case in which two well-marked 
        male varieties of a species exist--one red, the other black; and these 
        assume different attitudes in courtship. Messrs. Peckham say &quot;the <em>niger</em> 
        form, evidently a later development, is much the more lively of the two, 
        and whenever the two varieties were seen to compete for a female, the 
        black one was successful.&quot; On this Mr. Poulton remarks: &quot;It must be admitted 
        that these facts afford the <em>strongest support</em> to the theory of 
        sexual selection&quot;; but there is not a particle of proof that the black 
        colour was the cause of the selection rather than the &quot;superior liveliness&quot; 
        which all breeders of animals believe to be the most attractive characteristic 
        a male can possess.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Poulton speaks 
        continually of the possession of an &quot;&aelig;sthetic sense&quot; by those creatures 
        in which sexual ornament occurs, but no proof whatever of this is given, 
        other than the fact that insects do recognize diversities of colour, and 
        that a few birds collect bright objects, as in the case of the bower-birds. 
        This habit, existing in a few species only of one of the highest groups 
        of birds, can hardly be held to be a proof that in all birds, even in 
        such comparatively low types as ducks and Gallinace&aelig;, slight variations 
        of colour in the male determine the choice of the female.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This &aelig;sthetic 
        sense is supposed to exist even in insects, and some very doubtful facts 
        are alleged in support of this view. It is stated that if all the brightly-coloured 
        butterflies and moths in England were arranged in two divisions, the one 
        containing all the beautiful patterns and combinations of colours, the 
        other including the staring, strongly-contrasted colours and crude patterns, 
        we should find that the latter would contain, with hardly an exception, 
        the species in which independent evidence has shown, or is likely to show, 
        the existence of some unpleasant quality. The former division would contain 
        the colours displayed in courtship and when the insect is on the alert. 
        And it is added that there is an immense difference between the two divisions--the 
        one most pleasing, the other highly repugnant, to our &aelig;sthetic sensibilities, 
        because the pleasing colours have been determined by the insect's sense 
        of what is <em>beautiful</em>, the displeasing colours by the need for 
        what is <em>conspicuous</em> to a vertebrate enemy. If there is, indeed, 
        any such great and constant difference due to these causes, it must exist 
        in all countries, and in all groups where these causes have come into 
        play; but it is very doubtful whether any such difference does exist. 
        In looking over a general collection of butterflies few would decide that 
        the Danaid&aelig;, Acr&aelig;id&aelig;, and Heliconid&aelig; showed any 
        deficiency in beauty and harmony of colour; yet they are pre- <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        291]]</font> eminently the groups in which warning colours are predominant. 
        So, also, the American and Eastern sections of the genus Papilio which 
        are both subjects of mimicry and have all the other characteristics of 
        protected groups with warning colours, are all exquisitely beautiful, 
        with their rich green or crimson spots on a velvety black ground. And 
        if we turn to birds, in which, as there are no known warning colours, 
        all that are not protective are supposed to be due to sexual selection, 
        we find, among much that is beautiful, great numbers of the harshest contrasts 
        and most inharmonious combinations of colour that it is possible to conceive. 
        Such are the blues and yellows and reds of the macaws and of a great number 
        of other parrots; the equally harsh colours of the barbets and the toucans; 
        the contrasted blue and purple or magenta and black of many of the chatterers. 
        In many of these, no doubt, the texture of the surface is so delicate 
        and the colours so bright and pure that we cannot but admire the tints 
        themselves, although it is impossible to claim for the mode in which they 
        are combined even the rudiments of &aelig;sthetic beauty. On the other 
        hand, we find really beautiful combinations of colour and marking where 
        sexual selection has certainly not come into play. Such are the exquisite 
        tints and patterns of the cones, cowries, olives, harps, volutes, pectens, 
        and innumerable other molluscan shells; while many of the sea-anemones, 
        and considerable numbers of the caterpillars with warning colours, are 
        equally beautiful.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still more doubtful 
        and more opposed to reasonable probability is the statement that &quot;our 
        standards of beauty are largely derived from the contemplation of the 
        numerous examples around us, which, strange as it may seem, have been 
        created by the &aelig;sthetic preferences of the insect world&quot;--alluding, 
        of course, to the colours and structures of flowers as being due to the 
        need of attracting insects to fertilize them. Here objection may be taken, 
        first, to the term <em>preferences</em> as applying to mere beauty in 
        the flower, and still more emphatically to the term <em>&aelig;sthetic</em>, 
        which there is not a particle of evidence for believing to enter at all 
        into an insect's very limited mentality. Insects visit flowers wholly 
        and solely, so far as we know, to obtain food or other necessaries of 
        their existence, and every fact connected with the colours of flowers 
        can be explained as due to the advantage of conspicuousness amid surrounding 
        foliage, and distinctness from other flowers which are especially suited 
        to different species of insects. When cows and horses refuse to eat the 
        acrid buttercup, we do not say that the glaring yellow colour is repugnant 
        to their &aelig;sthetic sensibilities, and that their dislike to the plant 
        as food is the result; yet this would be less improbable than that bees 
        and butterflies have any admiration of or liking for flowers independent 
        of the supply of their physical wants. Moreover, a large part of the beauty 
        <em>we</em> see in flowers is independent of colour, and is due to the 
        graceful forms of individual flowers, their elegant groupings, and their 
        charming contrast to the foliage which surrounds them. We now know that 
        much of the variety in the form and position of flowers is dependent on 
        their own physical needs, the protection of the pollen and the germ from 
        rain, wind, or insect enemies, and that it has been produced by natural 
        selection acting under the limitations due to the fundamental laws of 
        vegetable growth. The purity and intensity of the colours are due to the 
        fact that such colours offer a greater contrast to the ever-varying tints 
        of foliage, twig, and bark, seen under constant modifications of light 
        and shade, than would be offered by more sober hues; and thus it is that 
        flowers usually exhibit the purest and brightest colours, which, combined 
        with their elegant or curious forms, and the exquisite setting of green 
        foliage which surrounds them, produce a general effect which is to us 
        inexpressibly charming. But we have no reason to believe that any of the 
        lower animals are affected in the smallest degree by these truly &aelig;sthetic 
        feelings, and the use of the term as applied to them is simply begging 
        the question, and is, therefore, not scientific.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because Mr. 
        Poulton himself admits that the theory of sexual selection is still to 
        some extent <em>sub judice</em> that the preceding remarks have been made 
        in the way of protest against the use of terms which themselves tend to 
        prejudge the case. In his chapters on this subject he has brought many 
        arguments in its favour, some of which are ingenious and novel; but they 
        all appear to rest on very slender evidence or to admit of another interpretation. 
        They will, however, be useful as an incitement to further observation 
        on this most interesting question, which, in all probability, will not 
        be finally settled by the present generation of naturalists.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is well 
        illustrated by numerous excellent woodcuts and a coloured plate, and there 
        appear to be few if any misprints, the only one calling for remark being 
        the placing of the cut at p. 34 upside down, so that the resemblance to 
        a catkin is lost. Mr. Poulton is to be congratulated on having produced 
        so readable and suggestive a volume on one of the most attractive departments 
        of natural history, and on having by his own researches contributed so 
        largely to the solution of some of the more interesting problems which 
        it presents.</p>

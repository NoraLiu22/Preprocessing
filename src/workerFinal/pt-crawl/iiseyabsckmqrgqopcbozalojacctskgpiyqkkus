<p>In the Foreword, Clifford Lynch summarizes <em>The Virtual Reference Librarian's Handbook</em>
 as "a book that is really about questions, about the process of asking questions and
 challenging assumptions in a constructive, analytical, and thoughtful way,
 about developing new and broader visions for libraries" (p. xiv).</p>

<p>We couldn't agree more.  <em>The Virtual Reference Librarian's Handbook</em> 
has a clear orientation toward raising issues rather than issuing proclamations 
regarding effective virtual reference services.  Instead of advocating a 'one-size-fits-all' 
approach to virtual reference planning, Anne Grodzins Lipow has created a set of
 questions and exercises that help guide librarians through the maze of complex
 issues surrounding the extension of a library's current reference services
 into the virtual realm.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this book, Lipow defines virtual reference (VR) as
 synchronous, point-of-need reference via chat or voice software.  The book
 is structured into three main sections: Part I is written for librarians in
 the process of deciding whether to start a virtual reference service; Part II
 is for those who are about to launch a VR service, or those who currently offer
 VR but would like to improve their service; Part III tackles the subject of
 marketing VR services to ensure a consistent volume of question traffic. Organized
 in this manner, the handbook is not meant to be read cover-to-cover.  Instead,
 readers are encouraged to focus on the parts that are most relevant to their
 libraries at the present time.  Along the way, Lipow allots lined margins for
 note-taking, and includes a CD-ROM containing printable versions of all the
 exercises and checklists presented in the book.  As virtual reference practitioners
 ourselves, we can see how the book would be helpful for all virtual librarians,
 regardless of how far along they might be in implementing their own services.</p>

<p>Part I, "Making the Decision to Go Virtual," focuses largely on exploring
 the reasons and motivations for launching a virtual reference service.  Rather
 than spending much time addressing factors that might indicate VR isn't
 feasible for a particular library at this time, this section is geared
 toward those librarians who will, in fact, decide to offer VR.  
 However, Lipow does address common reasons why some libraries choose not
 to go with VR, and she offers convincing rebuttal to those reasons. She also challenges reference
 librarians to rethink their role in a virtual environment. For example, instead
 of waiting for users to come to the desk to ask a question, why not bring a 
virtual desk to meet users at their point of need. Lipow acknowledges that 
librarians may be wary of adding a virtual reference shift to their already-busy
 schedules.  To counter this concern, she offers suggestions for redistributing 
workloads and freeing up staff time to monitor the virtual reference desk.</p>

<p>Once a library has decided to launch a VR service, one of the first challenges
 is choosing a software product. Lipow has conveniently outlined all the possible
 issues a librarian would need to consider when evaluating software for VR purposes.
 Does it have a co-browse feature? What about transcripts? Do users  have to download
 anything to use the service? What platforms does it support? What are the costs?
 Is training included? The book includes a thorough checklist librarians
 can use to compare all the VR software possibilities, as well as advice on how to
 choose the software that best meets a library's needs and, perhaps more
 importantly, budget.</p>

<p>Part II of Lipow's book begins with a set of exercises to help staff
 practice the basic technical skills on which they'll need to rely
 during VR sessions&#151;skills such as chat etiquette, navigating 
multiple browser windows, becoming familiar with online resources, 
controlling session lengths, etc.  The goal is for librarians to become 
extremely fluent in the online environment to ensure they can deliver 
a level of high-quality service comparable to that which they  provide at the physical reference desk.  The exercises are very practical and skill-centered; librarians responsible for training other staff members will benefit from choosing exercises
 from this section of the book to structure their training sessions.</p>

<p>Lipow devotes an entire chapter to the development of library policies
 that address issues specific to virtual reference services.  In keeping
 with the style of the book, rather than simply presenting a list of 
issues to consider, Lipow provides sets of questions to guide librarians 
through the process of drafting meaningful policies&#151;to address issues 
such as: who the eligible users are, how the scope of the service will be designed
 (and which types of questions will be referred elsewhere), the ever popular 
"use of licensed databases to answer questions", and how to deal with
 inappropriate client behavior.  Although not explicitly stated, we 
think the author would agree that it is helpful to view policies as 
flexible statements of intent; no matter how much forethought goes
 into policy drafts, over time each VR service will find policies that
 must be updated, revised, or adapted to fit changing circumstances. 
 It may be difficult to decide beforehand, for example, on a limit for
 how many virtual questions a patron may submit per day.  In policymaking,
 it is better to let flexibility and experience be the guides.  Often, VR policies
 are planned with the best possible intentions, but these policies should be revisited frequently 
to ensure they still make sense and continue to guide service in
 productive ways.</p>

<p>While there is much discussion in professional circles regarding
 appropriate policies, or issues surrounding staff training for
 reference in the virtual realm, we have seen far less attention
 to the presentation of a library's webpage (aside from discussions
 regarding the placement of links to the VR service). However, Lipow
 clearly shares our belief that the design of a library website can
 make or break a VR service. She writes, "Just as your physical desk 
has a personality that falls somewhere along the spectrum from inviting
 to intimidating, so too can your cyberdesk range from welcoming to
 bewildering" (p.91).  Libraries must ensure their websites have
 a clean, logical design that facilitates quick access to online 
resources, including the virtual reference service.  Lipow presents
 a series of checklists for evaluating current websites, and 
suggests ways to survey library users to determine how to better 
design the website for their ease of use.  For example, choice of 
terminology can make a big difference in a site's usability; while 
the word "reference" is quite meaningful to members of the librarian
 community, to a user "ask a question" may more readily convey the 
purpose and usefulness of a library chat service.</p> 

<p>Part III of Lipow's book covers one of the most challenging aspects
 of building a virtual reference service: marketing/promotion.
 Lipow recommends a four-step marketing strategy for libraries
 to follow when planning for promotion, and she provides tips for how each
 step could be carried out. For example, a slogan and a logo
 are important parts of any marketing strategy, but they should
 be complete enough to let users know exactly what type of
 service they represent. As examples, several VR services 
successfully employing these strategies are highlighted. One
 interesting strategy involves dividing the community into market
 segments to target specific user populations, e.g., graduate vs. 
undergraduate students. Lipow also points out the importance of
 marketing to non-users; VR service, with its anonymity and 
convenience, may be what they've always wanted but were afraid to 
ask for or didn't even realize was possible. Reflecting on her 
previous web design discussion, Lipow also makes the case that good 
web design is an important marketing technique for VR services. These
 marketing techniques are designed to help libraries create lively VR 
services and attract new library users, which should be a goal of any 
library implementing this type of service. While it's true that
 this could result in overload, Lipow hopes that librarians will
 embrace the challenge. Unfortunately, she doesn't provide advice
 on how specifically to handle overload, aside from briefly mentioning
 consortiums as an option. As an established service, we would like to 
have seen some specific suggestions on how we can increase our network 
or VR options to continue providing quality service even after we've 
exceeded our current capacity.</p>

<p>Throughout the book are undercurrents of Lipow's client-centered 
service values.  Rather than thinking "How can we get our clientele 
to come to the library to use the wonderful services we have for them?",
 she challenges us to consider "How can we bring those services to 
wherever our users are?"   From the planning stages to the
 marketing phases of VR services, designing a user-oriented service 
is not only the key to maintaining a high volume of happy users&#151;it's a
 confirmation of the service values held so dearly by the library profession.

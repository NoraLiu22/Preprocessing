/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

      <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 241]]</font> Annulose 
        animals have found little favour as articles of food, and those which 
        have come into use in one country are often despised in another. We ourselves 
        consume quantities of <i>Crustacea</i>, but would be loth to eat the locusts 
        of the East or the fat butterflies of Australia; while the palm worms 
        of the West Indies, though highly esteemed there, have not yet been introduced 
        at the tables of our epicures.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indians of the Amazon are less fastidious 
        in their tastes, for while turtles, alligators, lizards, snakes and frogs 
        are all common articles of food, some species of insects and other <i>Annulosa</i> 
        furnish them with their greatest luxuries. Six different orders--<i>Hymenoptera</i>, 
        <i>Neuroptera</i>, <i>Homoptera</i>,<i> Coleoptera</i>, <i>Aptera</i> 
        and <font color="990000">[[p. 242]]</font> <i>Annelida</i>--each supply 
        one species to add to the varieties of the Indian's bill of fare.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a great-headed red ant, the <i>&#140;codoma 
        cephalotes</i> of<b><i> </i></b><i></i>Latreille. This insect inhabits 
        the whole Amazon district, and, I believe, a great part of Brazil and 
        Guiana, and is one of the most destructive of the whole family. It frequents 
        sandy districts and places where &quot;red earth&quot; is found, but is absent from 
        the &quot;black earth&quot; or the rich alluvial soil of the Amazon. It forms its 
        nests in the woods and in gardens, turning up the soil in such large heaps 
        as to make one doubt whether so small an insect could have been the workman. 
        I have seen elevations of this kind twenty feet square and a yard high, 
        containing many tons of earth. These hillocks are riddled with holes in 
        every direction, and into them the ants may be seen dragging little circular 
        pieces of leaf, which they cut off from particular trees which they prefer; 
        orange trees and leguminous shrubs suffer most from their ravages, and 
        these they will sometimes entirely strip of their leaves in a night or 
        two. Young<b> </b>plants too of every kind suffer very much, and cannot 
        be grown in many places on account of them. They remain in one locality 
        a long time; for on my observing to a gentleman at a cattle estate near 
        Par&aacute; how remarkably the track of these ants was worn down across 
        a pathway and through grass, he informed me that he had observed them 
        marching along that very track for fifteen or twenty years. The insects 
        which do this are of course the neuters, which have tremendous jaws. They 
        often swarm in houses at night, crawling over the supper table and carrying 
        away fragments of bread and farina; and should any cloth or handkerchief 
        be left on the ground, especially with anything eatable in it, it will 
        be found in the morning cut in semicircular holes in every direction as 
        neatly as if done with scissors. It is the female of this destructive 
        creature that furnishes the Indian with a luxurious repast. At a certain 
        season the insects come out of their holes in such numbers, that they 
        are caught by basketsfull. When this takes place in the neighbourhood 
        of an Indian village all is stir and excitement; the young men, women 
        and children go out to catch <i>sa&uuml;bas</i> with baskets and calabashes, 
        which they soon fill; for though the female ants have wings, they are 
        very sluggish and seldom or never fly. The part eaten is the abdomen, 
        which is very rich and fatty from the mass of undeveloped eggs. They are 
        eaten alive; the insect being held by the head as we hold a strawberry 
        by its stalk, and the abdomen being bitten off, the body, wings and legs 
        are thrown down on the floor, where they continue to crawl along apparently 
        unaware of the loss of their <font color="990000">[[p. 243]]</font> posterior 
        extremities. They are kept in calabashes or bottle-shaped baskets, the 
        mouths of which are stopped up with a few leaves, and it is rather a singular 
        sight to see for the first time an Indian taking his breakfast in the 
        <i>sa&uuml;ba</i> season. He opens the basket, and as the great-winged 
        ants crawl slowly out, he picks them up carefully and transfers them with 
        alternate hand-fulls of farina to his mouth. When great quantities are 
        caught, they are slightly roasted or smoked, with a little salt sprinkled 
        among them, and are then generally much liked by Europeans.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next insect in the list is the <i>Termes 
        flavicolle</i>, Perty; a large white ant common in the Upper Amazon. 
        It inhabits holes<b> </b>in the earth about the roots of rotten 
        trees, and is much sought after for food by the great ant-eater, <i>Myrmecophaga 
        jubata</i>, as well as by the Indians. In this case it is not the winged 
        female that is eaten, but the great-headed, hard-biting worker, and it 
        is by means of his jaws that the creature is entrapped. An Indian boy 
        going after &quot;<i>cupim</i>&quot; takes with him a calabash or a bottle-basket, 
        and searches about for a nest. He then scrapes away some of the earth, 
        and taking a long piece of grass inserts it as far as it will go, and 
        on withdrawing it finds a row of ten or a dozen <i>Termes </i>holding 
        tightly on to it; and he repeats this operation till he fills his basket. 
        These insects are also eaten alive or roasted; but in this case it is 
        not the abdomen but the enormous head and thorax which is devoured, as 
        those parts contain a considerable mass of muscular matter. These insects 
        have generally a bitter taste and are not much esteemed, except by the 
        Indians themselves.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edible Homopterous insect is the <i>Umbonia 
        spinosa</i>, which swarms at certain seasons on the Inga trees, which 
        are universally planted by the Indians near their cottages for the sake 
        of the fruit, which is much esteemed by them. The insects fall upon the 
        ground in great numbers, and the sharp spine on their thorax renders walking 
        barefoot very disagreeable. This spine seems to render them very ill adapted 
        for food, but when they first appear the whole body is soft and flaccid, 
        and they are then collected and roasted in a flat earthen pan. They are 
        not, however, so much esteemed as the other insects I have mentioned.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next edible insect I shall allude to is 
        the larva of a beetle, but of what species or genus I am unable to say, 
        though it is probably a <i>Calandra</i>, as it is found in the stem of 
        a palm tree. It is much swollen, and attenuated at each end; and is a 
        rich fatty mass, which is eaten slightly roasted or fried. It is not by 
        any <font color="990000">[[p. 244]]</font> means so common in the Amazon 
        as the other edible insects; and in fact, I never saw it eaten, or ate 
        it myself but once. It is called &quot;<i>muxeina</i>&quot; by the Indians.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apterous insect which is eaten by the South 
        American Indians, more I presume as a delicacy than as an article of food, 
        is a species of <i>Pediculus </i>which inhabits the heads of that variety 
        of mankind, and is probably a distinct species from that of our own country. 
        The method of capturing and devouring this insect is exactly the same 
        as that which every one has<i> </i>seen adopted by the monkeys at the 
        gardens of the Zoological Society. A couple of Indian belles will often 
        devote a spare half-hour to entomological researches in each others' glossy 
        tresses, every capture being immediately transferred with much gusto to 
        the mouth of the operator.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining annulose animal I have to mention 
        is a singular species of earth worm. It has the body flat beneath, and 
        the rings very hispid. It inhabits the gap&oacute;, or flooded lands, 
        in the dry season; and, when the waters rise, it ascends the trees and 
        takes refuge in the hollow leaves of the <i>Tillandsias</i>, where it 
        accumulates in great numbers; and it is a singular sight to see an Indian 
        fisherman climb up a tree and return with plenty of worms for bait. In 
        every house these <i>Tillandsias </i>may be seen hanging, the leaves 
        carefully tied together at the top to keep the worms from escaping should 
        they get too warm or dry. When more are obtained than are wanted for bait 
        they are boiled with fish; and, though they look very disgusting and are 
        intensely bitter, they are a favourite food with most Indians.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any other insects being used 
        for food by the Indians of that part of South America which I visited, 
        and trust that this short notice of them may call attention to the subject 
        in other parts of the world.</p>

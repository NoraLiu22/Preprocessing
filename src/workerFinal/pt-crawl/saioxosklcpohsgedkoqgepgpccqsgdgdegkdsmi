</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/leaders-project">LEADERS Project</a> (Linking EAD to Electronically Retrievable Sources), based at the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slais">School of Library, Archive and Information Studies, University College, London</a>, and funded by the <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk/">Arts and Humanities Research Board</a> (AHRB), is charged with employing reusable <a href="http://www.w3.org/xml">XML</a> technologies to provide access to transcripts and images of archival documents on the web.</p>

<p>In achieving our goal we have developed a toolkit for use on multiple projects and with a wide variety of archival source materials. The overarching generic requirement has led us to concentrate on reusability at all levels in our design. The entire system is built using open source, standard and platform independent technologies.</p>

<p>The LEADERS delivery system consists of data files, the LEADERS Toolkit, and a demonstrator application, each of which can be re-used independently of the others.</p>

<p><b>Data Files</b><br>
The data files consist of <a href="http://www.jpeg.org/">JPEG</a> images and XML documents encoded using the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org">Text Encoding Initiative</a> (TEI) for archive documents; the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead">Encoded Archival Description</a> (EAD) for archive finding aids, and the <a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/eac">Encoded Archival Context</a> (EAC) for information about the organisations and people connected with the archival material.</p>

<p><b>LEADERS Tools</b><br> 
The LEADERS tools comprise DTDs and Schemas derived from the encoding frameworks above, indexing utilities, a search engine and web services.</p> 

<p>Any source materials encoded using the LEADERS DTDs and Schemas can be exploited by the index and search and services, and thus act as a platform for a client application.</p>

<p>The indexing utilities are an <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL">XSL</a> stylesheet and a <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> routine, which together harvest index data from the data files to create an index document. This is used by the search engine - <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html">Lucene</a>, to generate browseable indexes for searching and retrieval.
The stylesheet may be modified to harvest more, and/or different tags, and different descriptive information.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws">Web Services</a> written in Java, provide the search, retrieve, and display functions which are consumed by the client application. The use of Web Services has enabled us to achieve:</p>
<ol><li><b>System independence</b> - the client application can exist on a different file system, and a different operating system, and be written in a different language to the toolkit and the data. </li></ol>
<ol start="2"><li><b>Application flexibility</b> - the same data and services may be consumed by different applications, concurrently, or at different times.</li></ol>
<ol start="3"><li><b>Extensibility and adaptation</b> - the use of Web Services makes it simpler to add and/or amend the functions offered by the toolkit to exploit the data.</li></ol>

<p><b>LEADERS Demonstrator Application</b><br> 
The demonstrator application has been constructed as an example of what can be achieved using the LEADERS Toolkit to obtain user feedback.</p>

<p>The application consists of a series of screens in the form of XML and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1">XHTML</a> documents; <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL</a> stylesheets; <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS">CSS</a> stylesheets and <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.0/userdocs/xsp">eXtensible Server Pages</a> (XSP) scripts. The files are parameterised and designed to operate together in a <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a> environment, and run from a <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Tomcat</a> applet server.</p>

<p>The encoding of the finding aids, the source documents and the EAC files, along with the basic system design and application design has been done by the LEADERS Project team. We contracted <a href="http://www.bookmarc.pt/eng/index.html">BookMARC</a>, a software development organisation based at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, to implement the designs for both the toolkit and the application.</p>

<p><b>What is CO-ODE?</b></p>
<p>The CO-ODE project (<a href="http://www.co-ode.org">http://www.co-ode.org</a>) aims to produce an open source, industrial strength ontology development environment, which can be used to create, edit and maintain ontologies.  The ontology development environment will cater to a wide customer base with varying needs, ranging from people who are developing small local ontologies on the order of one or two hundred concepts, to people who are developing and maintaining very large ontologies on the order of tens of thousands of concepts, extending existing ontologies and developing applications that use ontologies.  It will support all three common knowledge modeling paradigms&#151;Frames, Resource Description Framework (RDF)/Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS), and the new, emerging standard, Web Ontology Language (OWL <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt</a>).   A fundamental feature of the proposed architecture is its extensibility and flexibility. The architecture will be designed specifically to be able to link to further tools being developed in UK, EU and US projects, and will support third party plugins.</p>

<p><b>What's an ontology?</b></p>

<p>At this point you may be asking yourself, 'What is an ontology?'.  An ontology is a formal method of capturing knowledge about some domain of interest. For example, an ontology could be used to represent the content and services offered by a digital library.  Ontologies are based around classes or concepts and the relationships or properties that exist between them.  The concepts in an ontology are organized into rich classification hierarchies, or taxonomies. Superficially similar to the sophisticated classification hierarchies developed by librarians, ontologies typically aim for even greater rigour and consistency in order to be computable.  If a formal logic is used as a basis for the ontology, then the ontology will be amenable to being processed by a computer or automated agent that is able to make inferences and answer queries about the information captured in the ontology&#151;a particularly useful feature for digital libraries, given the vast amounts of information they could contain and the variety of services they could offer.  Ontologies and Metadata have therefore been widely identified as key technologies for digital libraries and a number of other areas, with the realization that robust, user-oriented ontology development and editing tools are of particular importance.</p>

<p><b>Who's Involved?</b></p>

<p>The CO-ODE team are based at the University Of Manchester in the UK, and they collaborate with Stanford University in the US, in order to integrate and build upon the most widely used tools for developing and using ontologies worldwide&#151;OilEd (<a href="http://oiled.man.ac.uk/">http://oiled.man.ac.uk</a>)  from the University of Manchester, and Prot&#233;g&#233; (<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">http://protege.stanford.edu/</a>) from Stanford University.  The CO-ODE project is funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk">http://www.jisc.ac.uk</a>).</p>

TOIA (Technologies for Online Interoperable Assessment): Free Assessment Tools for and by the Community </a></h3>

</p>

<p>TOIA (Technologies for Online Interoperable Assessment) is a JISC-funded project within the Exchange for Learning Programme (X4L).  TOIA began in October 2002 to build a computer-based assessment (CBA) system that is not only free to UK Further Education (FE) and Higher Education (HE), but properly addresses the interoperability of assessment.  The project is currently funded until October 2005.</p>

<p>For many people the CBA tools available to them are contained within their institutional VLE although many UK institutions have also purchased at significant cost a stand-alone CBA system.  Most systems now claim to comply with the globally used IMS Question and Test Interoperability Specification (QTI). Alas, if one attempts to move assessment material from one system to another&#151;even from their own compliant VLE to their compliant stand-alone system, there can be problems with the re-interpretation and display of questions and tests.</p>  

<p>One solution to reducing variation has been through TOIA, where in collaboration with CETIS (the Centre for Educational Technology Interoperability Standards), core elements of the specifications underwent systematic independent review. </p>

<p>This review generated a reference question set exhibiting best practice in QTI structure including explanations of how systems should render variants and guidance to developers on how to 'fix' your system.  A number of leading CBA systems, VLE's and TOIA have been tested so far. TOIA fared better than any other system available for testing although testing will continue as more software vendors/developers engage with TOIA and the real interoperability of assessment.</p>

<p>TOIA functionality stems from research and practice in further and higher education institutions and contains features common to all testing systems, but TOIA has enhanced both interoperability and functionality in line with the requirements of the education community.  Features include:</p>
<ul><li>suitable for formative and summative testing </li> 
<li>comprehensive administration tools</li>
<li>browser-based authoring</li> 
<li>advanced multiple response questions</li> 
<li>import/render of all IMS QTI Response Types</li> 
<li>restrict tests to IP Numbers, sub-net or domain</li>
<li>29 Standard Question/Test Reports</li>
<li>export questions/tests as IMS Content Packages</li>
<li>implementation of IMS Assessment Metadata</li></ul> 

<p>The system has undergone extensive evaluations from CBA and usability experts from across the UK.  We are now making changes to make it even easier to use for both old hands and newcomers to CBA.</p> 


<p>The X4L programme is all about proving that interoperability can actually happen, and providing the community with the resources needed to make their learning or assessment content as interoperable as possible.  TOIA, whilst the only project dealing with CBA, is one of three X4L projects looking at the mechanics and reality of interoperating in a fast-paced environment.  Also funded are Jorum+ and RELOAD which look at the Content Storage and Packaging of learning objects, respectively, again using up to the minute IMS specifications.</p>

<p>Further information on Jorum+ and ReLoad can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk">http://www.jorum.ac.uk</a>&gt; and &lt;<a href="http://www.reload.ac.uk">http://www.reload.ac.uk</a>&gt;.</p>

</p>

<p>KCL Digital Consulting Services (KDCS) is carrying out an extensive survey and investigation on behalf of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Information is being sought about any charging practice in US Art Museums for the sale of digital versions of cultural resources.  As many responses as possible are needed to the online survey. If you class yourself as an art museum and are based in the USA, please participate in the survey, which is located online at &lt;<a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/kdcs/">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/kdcs</a>&gt;.</p>

<p><b>Background information on the survey</b></p>
<p>The online survey (comprised of 19 questions) seeks basic information that is publicly available about each museum's activity. It should take no more than 25 minutes to complete.</p>  

<p>Questions are posed to explore the basic cost and policy models adopted in arriving at pricing structures for delivering digital surrogates of unique or rare items. The results will provide a unique examination of a fast evolving market of international cultural significance.</p>  

<p>We value any contribution and give the following assurances:</p>
<ol><li>We will acknowledge and list all the institutions that take part in the survey. However, the survey results will be aggregated to preclude identification of single organizations.</li></ol> 
<ol start="2"><li>The results will be disseminated via free and open access Web resources and papers.</li></ol> 
<ol start="3"><li>The association between you and your organization and the information you provide will be known only to the members of the research team.</li></ol> 
<ol start="4"><li>If the information you provide contributes to any publication, it will be presented in a manner which precludes any direct association with you and your organization. </li></ol>
<ol start="5"><li>We will not retain the data or personal information longer than is necessary to complete the study. </li></ol>

<p><b>Background Information on the study</b></p>
 
<p>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has provided a grant to KDCS for a study of USA art museum policy and practice regarding the market for digital resources.</p> 

<p>The study aims to examine the new market realities and opportunities cultural institutions face due to the transition to digitized collections. The project will explore the cost and policy models adopted in arriving at pricing structures for delivering surrogates of unique or rare items as digital objects. Further, it aims to discover the key factors that affect the willingness of museums to collaborate and enable digital content to be shared. The results will provide a unique examination of a fast evolving market of international cultural significance.</p> 

<p>The USA study is an extension of Simon Tanner's previous work for the Mellon Foundation, which looked into pricing policy within the UK and other European libraries and museums. The results of the previous study are linked from the KDCS website at &lt;<a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/kdcs/">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/kdcs</a>&gt;.</p>

</p>

<p>A new email list has been launched for people who are involved in describing resources using metadata schemas based on the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (LOM) standard. It should be relevant for people cataloguing digital learning resources and those writing the guidelines for this or managing the metadata creation process.</p>

<p>The new list is called lom-cataloguing, and details on how to join it are at &lt;<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/lom-cataloguing.html">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/lom-cataloguing.html</a>&gt;. The list is managed by the CETIS Metadata and Digital Repository Special Interest Group, (see &lt;<a href="http://metadata.cetis.ac.uk">http://metadata.cetis.ac.uk</a>&gt; for more details on this group).</p>

<p>The lom-cataloguing list came about after a workshop in London last year
that brought together staff from a variety of projects using
the LOM to catalogue resources. It became evident that (a) many
untrained and non-LIS qualified staff were employed in such activities,
and (b) they needed support and help, and to be in contact with each
other. Many of the people at the meeting wanted advice on LOM metadata creation but were distracted, confused and put off when discussions got too technical&#151;so on the new list discussion of XML bindings, identifier schemes and the like should be avoided. We hope the new list will encourage common practice in interpretation of the LOM elements.</p>

<H4>Resource Sponsors Three Fellowships on First Clore Leadership Programme</H4>

<p>&quot; 14 January 2004 - As part of its commitment to workforce development Resource will be a major sponsor for the Clore Leadership Programme in 2004 - 2005.  At a total cost of £135,000 Resource is funding three Fellowships, one for each of the museums, archives and libraries domains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Clore Leadership Programme is a new initiative established by the Clore Duffield Foundation in 2003 to help develop the knowledge, skills, networks and experience of potential leaders across the cultural sector.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Applications are open to any EU resident who has had at least five years' work experience, in the cultural sector or beyond.  The flexibly designed fellowships will normally last for one year, during which Clore Fellows will attend two intensive residential leadership courses, receive individual tuition and mentoring, extend their management experience through a high profile secondment and have an opportunity to engage in reflection and research.  Fellows will have the option of remaining with their present employers, and following the course in stages, or receiving a full-time bursary of £20,000.  Direct associated costs, including tuition fees, will be met by the programme.&quot;</p>

<H4>CIMI Is Ceasing Operations</H4>

<p><em>A December 16, 2003 announcement from John Perkins, CIMI</em></p>

<p>&quot;...as of December 15, 2003 and after a long and wonderful run that started in 1990 CIMI is ceasing operations. It was a difficult decision but one the Executive Committee felt was unavoidable after more than a year of searching for additional resources upon which to build a meaningful program.  The full text of the announcement is available at http://www.cimi.org &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Despite the closure CIMI's intellectual assets will be managed so they'll continue to be available to the community.  RLG has assumed responsibility for the CIMI website and will maintain its availability.  The Handscape project will continue to it's completion mid-2004 administered by RLG...&quot;</p>

<H4>CLIR Announces Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Scholarly Information Resources for Humanists</H4>

<p>&quot;December 8, 2003 - WASHINGTON, D.C.—The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) announces a post-doctoral fellowship program, offered in conjunction with a consortium of academic research institutions, that will establish a new kind of scholarly information professional. It will educate new scholars about the challenges and opportunities created by new forms of scholarly research and the information resources that support them, both traditional and digital.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The program will offer postdoctoral fellowships to individuals who have earned their Ph.D.s in disciplines in the humanities within the past three years (or who will complete it before starting the program) and who believe that there are opportunities to develop meaningful linkages among disciplinary scholarship, libraries, archives, and evolving digital tools.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ten to fifteen fellowships, of one to two years in length, will be awarded in 2004. The fellowship will pay a salary plus benefits at one of the collaborating research libraries, each of which will serve as a fellowship sponsor.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information, please see &lt;<a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/press/2003postdoc.html">http://www.clir.org/pubs/press/2003postdoc.html</a>&gt;.&quot;</p>

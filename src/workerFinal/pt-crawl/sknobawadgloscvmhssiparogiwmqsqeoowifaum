<p>There's help for people who want to know about the beginnings of the 
bread-slicer, the creation of the corn picker or the makings of the
matchstick. A new database from the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center for the
Study of Invention and Innovation will show the public where to find these
and thousands of other invention-related documents and collections. Created
by the Lemelson Center at the National Museum of American History, the MIND
(Modern Inventors Documentation) database identifies the invention-related
holdings of hundreds of archives across the United States and is the
nation's first database devoted exclusively to such documents.

<p>The collections in the database cover a variety of subjects, with many from
medical, consumer, scientific, household and legal fields. With more than
1,600 records when it debuted in May, it is continuing to grow daily as more
archives, museums, libraries and historical societies report the contents of
their invention-related collections to the Smithsonian for inclusion in the
MIND database.</p>



<p>
Records can be searched by subject, inventor name, collection
title or repository name. Users simply submit a key word to search and if
the invention is in the database it will note what materials exist about the
invention, which museum, archive or library holds the collection, and how to
contact them for more details.

<p>For example, if you type in "food" as your keyword search, dozens of
food-related invention collections appear. If you click on one, "Eskimo
Pie Corporation Records", the MIND database details the
location of the collection, a physical description of it, and a summary of
the contents. Where possible, there is also information on how to access the
collection and a direct weblink to the collection or its holder. With the
Eskimo Pie example, a click on the weblink takes you to the online finding
aid for the Archives Center of the National Museum of American History.
There, a more complete description of the contents, including image samples,
is found.</p>

<p>Advanced search options allow the user to search by repository, inventor
name, or collection title.  Users can also search for inventions from a list
of over sixty subjects, from agriculture to maritime to writing and drawing
technology.
</p>


<p>Easily accessed online, teachers can use the MIND database as a resource to
help teach students how to conduct historical research. Scholars can use it
as a "first stop" in locating historical documents about invention.
"Collections dealing with invention are fragmented but the MIND
database brings them together," said Lemelson Center director Art Molella.
"Now you can just as easily find a collection documenting the invention of
a small butter churn as you can find records on Thomas Edison." To access
the MIND database or learn how repositories with relevant collections can
contribute information about their holdings, visit

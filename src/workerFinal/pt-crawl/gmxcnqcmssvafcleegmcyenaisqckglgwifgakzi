<h3>Program of Study</h3>




<p>The purpose of the BA program in linguistics is to provide a solid, integrated introduction to the scientific study of language through course work in the core subdisciplines of linguistics, as well as to ensure that the student has a language background sufficient to provide a complement to the theoretical parts of the program and for an understanding of the complexities of human language. This program provides students with a general expertise in the field and prepares them for productive advanced study in linguistics.</p>




<p>Students who are majoring in linguistics may visit the <a href="https://linguistics.uchicago.edu">Department of Linguistics homepage</a> at <a href="http://linguistics.uchicago.edu">linguistics.uchicago.edu</a> to learn about events and resources on and off campus and for links to information on employment opportunities.</p>




<p>Students who are majoring in other fields of study may also complete a minor in linguistics. Information follows the description of the major.</p>




<a name="programrequirements"></a>
<h3>Program Requirements</h3>




<p>The BA in linguistics requires thirteen courses, which fall into two categories: courses that provide expertise in linguistics and courses that ensure breadth of study in a non–Indo-European language. Students have flexibility to construct a course of study that accords with their interests, but their final tally of thirteen courses must include the following:</p>




<table class="sc_courselist" width="100%"><colgroup><col class="codecol"/><col class="titlecol"/><col align="char" char="." class="hourscol"/></colgroup><tbody><tr class="even firstrow"><td class="codecol"><a href="/search/?P=LING%2020001" title="LING 20001" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LING 20001');">LING 20001</a></td><td>Introduction to Linguistics</td><td class="hourscol">100</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td class="codecol"><a href="/search/?P=LING%2020201" title="LING 20201" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LING 20201');">LING 20201</a></td><td>Introduction to Syntax</td><td class="hourscol">100</td></tr>

<tr class="even lastrow"><td colspan="2"><span class="courselistcomment">Study of a non-Indo-European language</span></td><td class="hourscol"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>





<p>The language requirement is designed to ensure breadth of study in a non–Indo-European language. This requirement can be met in four different ways:</p>




<ol>
	<li>By passing the third quarter of an introductory sequence in a non–Indo-European language on campus</li>
	<li>Examination credit in a non–Indo-European language for which the University offers placement examinations</li>
	<li>Registration for an intensive one-quarter course in the structure of a non–Indo-European language offered by a member of the linguistics faculty (or by another faculty member upon approval by the director of undergraduate studies)</li>
	<li>Completion of an approved intensive language program taken elsewhere for languages not offered or tested for at the University of Chicago</li>
</ol>




<p>Students who fulfill the non–Indo-European language requirement with fewer than three quarters of study must substitute elective courses for the language course quarters not taken. At least six electives for the major must be courses offered by the Department of Linguistics (i.e., courses whose numbers begin with LING). For any further electives, a student may petition the department to substitute a related course that does not have a LING number.</p>




<p>The complete list of available languages can be viewed at <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/about/languages-uchicago">Languages Taught at the University of Chicago (humanities.uchicago.edu/about/languages-uchicago</a>).</p>

<a name="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>




<p>All courses used to satisfy requirements for the major and minor must be taken for quality grades. With consent of the instructor, nonmajors may take linguistics courses for P/F grading.</p>




<a name="honors"></a>
<h3>Honors</h3>




<p>In order to receive the degree in linguistics with honors, a student must write an honors essay. At the end of a student's third year, any student who has maintained a 3.0 or better overall GPA and a 3.5 or better GPA in linguistics courses may consult with the director of undergraduate studies about submitting an honors essay. The honors essay must be submitted by fifth week of the quarter in which the student plans to graduate. Complete guidelines and requirements for the honors essay can be obtained from the director of undergraduate studies.</p>




<p>Students wishing to write an honors essay are required to take two graduate-level courses (numbered 30000 or above) in areas most relevant to their thesis work, as determined in consultation with their adviser(s) and approved by the director of undergraduate studies.</p>




<p>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major with the consent of both program chairs. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation.</p>




<a name="minorprograminlinguistics"></a>
<h3>Minor Program in Linguistics</h3>




<p>Students in other fields of study may complete a minor in linguistics. The minor in linguistics requires a total of seven courses, which must include three linguistics electives (courses whose numbers begin with LING) and the following four courses:</p>

</tbody></table>





<p>Students who elect the minor program in linguistics must contact the director of undergraduate studies before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor, using the <a href="https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/college-prod/s3fs-public/documents/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf">Consent to Complete a Minor Program</a> form available from the student's College adviser or online. The student should submit the form approved by the director to the College adviser by the deadline above. Courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades (not P/F), and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </p>

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>LING 10150.  Language and Conflict.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
An aphorism commonly thrown around, and then hastily disregarded, in linguistics courses is &quot;A language is a dialect with an army and a navy,&quot; popularized by sociolinguist Max Weinreich. While this definition may not hold water when it comes to analyzing the structures or validity of the world's languages, language and language ideology have played an important, but under-emphasized, role in colonial and nationalist power and policy. From early the early violence of linguistic imperialism to later attempts at creating ethnolinguistically unified nations during decolonization to post-colonial reconfigurations of global languages, this course will examine the varied roles language, language analysis, and language policy have played in cultural and political conflicts. We will consult academic scholarly work and public and polemic discourse surrounding these topics, culminating in a group research project where you will examine and present a language conflict of your choice.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course draws on readings in and case studies of language evolution, biological evolution, cognitive development and scaffolding, processes of socialization and formation of groups and institutions, and the history and philosophy of science and technology. We seek primarily to elaborate theory to understand and model processes of cultural evolution, while exploring analogies, differences, and relations to biological evolution. This has been a highly contentious area, and we examine why. We seek to evaluate what such a theory could reasonably cover and what it cannot.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course offers a brief survey of how linguists analyze the structure and the use of language. Looking at the structure of language means understanding what phonemes, words, and sentences are, and how each language establishes principles for the combinations of these things and for their use; looking at the use of language means understanding the ways in which individuals and groups use language to declare their social identities and the ways in which languages can change over time. The overarching theme is understanding what varieties of language structure and use are found across the world's languages and cultures, and what limitations on this variety exist.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course is an introduction to the study of speech sounds and their patterning in the world's languages. The first half of the course focuses on how speech sounds are described with respect to their articulatory, acoustic, and perceptual structures. There are lab exercises both in phonetic transcription and in the acoustic analysis of speech sounds. The second half focuses on fundamental notions that have always been central to phonological analysis and that transcend differences between theoretical approaches: contrast, neutralization, natural classes, distinctive features, and basic phonological processes (e.g., assimilation).</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

In this interdisciplinary course, students will delve into the multifaceted world of large language models (LLMs), investigating their computational, cognitive, and social dimensions. The course covers an array of topics, such as the history and evolution of LLMs, computational underpinnings like neural networks and training methodologies, cognitive aspects of human-like language understanding, communication, and creativity, as well as crucial ethical and social considerations, encompassing fairness, transparency, trustworthiness, and privacy. Through both lectures and discussions, we will examine the scientific and practical applications and limitations of LLMs across diverse domains and contemplate the future prospects and challenges LLMs pose for science, technology, and society. Through critical discourse, hands-on exercises, and case studies, our goal is to foster a comprehensive understanding of LLMs, empowering students to critically assess these models and contribute to ongoing dialogues regarding their broader implications. Prior experience in computer science or cognitive science is beneficial but not mandatory. Note: this course primarily focuses on cultivating reflective thinking about LLMs, rather than programming or implementation. Students with programming skills are, however, encouraged to utilize them to facilitate their learning.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course can also be taken by students who are not majoring in Linguistics but are interested in learning something about the uniqueness of human language, spoken or signed. It covers a selection from the following topics: What is the position of spoken language in the usually multimodal forms of communication among humans? In what ways does spoken language differ from signed language? What features make spoken and signed language linguistic? What features distinguish linguistic means of communication from animal communication? How do humans communicate with animals? From an evolutionary point of view, how can we account for the fact that spoken language is the dominant mode of communication in all human communities around the world? Why cannot animals really communicate linguistically? What do the terms language &quot;acquisition&quot; and &quot;transmission&quot; really mean? What factors account for differences between &quot;language acquisition&quot; by children and by adults? Are children really perfect language learners? What factors bring about language evolution, including language speciation and the emergence of new language varieties? How did language evolve in mankind? This is a general education course without any prerequisites.

Seminar on Sound Change. One of the great mysteries of linguistics is the so-called actuation problem (Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog 1968), that is, what causes the inception of language change, if the linguistic conditions favoring particular changes are always present? Recent work has drawn on interspeaker variation for a solution to the actuation puzzle. The main impetus for considering individual differences in the context of sound change comes from the need to build a linking theory that bridges the gap between the emergence of new linguistic variants and their eventual propagation. This seminar will explore sources of individual linguistic differences, and the role they may play in the initiation and propagation of sound change. By &quot;individual differences&quot;, we refer to those psychological, sociological, genetic and/or behavioral differences between the individuals who make up a speech community at the levels of production, perception and cognitive representation. Some questions we will consider in detail at this seminar include: How do individual differences affect variation? How do they affect the initiation, phonologization, and propagation of changes? How do they relate to community patterns?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This introductory course aims to foster appreciation for the Potawatomi
(Bodw´ewadmimwen) language, history, and culture as understood through a
linguistic, culturally relevant mode. We will become familiar with the rich
structures of the language through exposure to traditional stories (yadsokanen)
and personal narratives (yathmownen). Some course texts focus on the histories of displacement, sovereignty, and governmental relations as well as the use of humor to cope with tragedy and a shifting cultural identity. Potawatomi, or Bodw´ewadmik, are one of the original inhabitants of the land on which the University of Chicago occupies, and we (exclusive, unless students in the class are also Potawatomi) now have tribal governmental centers and reservations in Kansas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan as a result of Indian removal. As an Algonquian language, Potawatomi is understudied and endangered, but this course offers the ability to become familiar with the language of this land. Students won't be fluent following this course, but will possess newfound appreciation for the diversity of linguistic expression and this community of the Great Lakes region. By the end of this course, students will understand the foundations of Potawatomi phonology, morphosyntax, pragmatics, and discourse and will be prepared to develop new
analyses of Potawatomi. This course fulfills the non-Indo-European language

How do languages get into contact? How long do they stay in contact? What is contact-induced language change, and which are the mechanisms that govern it? What do arachnophobia, myalgia, geology, heterophagy  mean?
In this course we will study language contact and its outcomes, as well as the social and linguistic factors that regulate contact-induced changes. We will examine a wide range of language contact phenomena from both general linguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives, and survey current approaches to all of the major types of contact-induced change (e.g. borrowing). Having Greek (but also other languages) as an example, we will consider linguistic and social aspects of the contact context as well as look into how the particular language has shaped the savant vocabulary of science, philosophy, arts, etc.
More precisely, we will offer a brief overview of the history of the  Greek language with special emphasis on the Greek vocabulary that Greek language landed or borrowed at different stages of its history as a result of its linguistic contact with other nations and languages.

Signed languages offer a unique perspective through which to understand human language and linguistic structure as it is realized across modalities (spoken vs. signed). Although signed languages offer crucial linguistic insights, there are many widely held misconceptions about the structure of these languages. In this course, we deconstruct these misconceptions as we study the structure of American Sign Language (ASL). Specifically, we will be looking at how core areas of language are manifest in ASL including the component parts of a sign (phonology), individual signs (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), and meaning (semantics), while also addressing sociolinguistics and language acquisition. Through this exploration, we will consider what the visual modality can teach us about the human language capacity.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The aim of this course is two-fold: Firstly, we will examine the structural properties of Turkish by way of engaging in linguistic fieldwork with native speakers. This will allow us to improve our analytical thinking and problem solving skills and familiarize us with the workings of a non-Indo-European language. Then, we will focus on the differences between Turkish as spoken in the mainland (Türkiye) and heritage Turkish as spoken by Turkish speaking immigrants in Europe. In doing so, we will investigate the role of socio-economic and political factors in shaping the grammatical and structural properties of languages.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

lyrics written by Mark Davies<P>
<HR>
<P>Drunk bones in the basement, rotten smells upon the floor
<BR>A broken man slumped on a crate and staring down

<P>Lighting fires and snipping wires, praying to the ceiling
<BR>Pulling up his stomach, gray and green and brown

<P>The upstairs neighbor asked him up, said he could stay a while
<BR>Help with the chores, do the wash, sweep the stairway too

<P>He looked up every day, he looked down every night
<BR>Swept the stairs and watched - what could you do, what could you do?

<P>Holy Ghost, the clouds are calling, calling you

<P>I overheard the Holy Ghost
<BR>He said he might have been a spy
<BR>Hanging out with bishops and nuns
<BR>Eating gooseberry pie

<BR>In cahoots with the guy in the cellar
<BR>Or the man upstairs
<BR>I heard a door creaking at night
<BR>But I couldn't tell where

<P>Gangs are forming on the ground
<BR>The Caves versus the Clouds
<BR>One soul paces up and down
<BR>Referee in a dirty, dirty town

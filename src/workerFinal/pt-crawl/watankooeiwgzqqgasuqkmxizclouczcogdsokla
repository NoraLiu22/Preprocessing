            </b>American Sociological Association Political Economy of World-Systems Book Award 2000.<br>
            <b>Andre Gunder Frank has been turning our thinking upside-down </b>throughout his long
            and illustrious career. With his work on the development of underdevelopment, he
            successfully toppled the reigning orthodoxy of modernization theory and forced everyone to
            reconsider how underdevelopment comes about. The world, and our understanding of it has
            never been the same. Still working at full bore, fiercely attacking all of our
            preconceptions, Frank has written yet another masterpiece of provocative sociology. <b>ReOrient
            calls into question virtually every set of assumptions</b> that has dominated
            macrosociology since the inception of the discipline. All of the great thinkers of social
            science, <b>from Adam Smith, to Weber and Marx, to Wallerstein</b>, are put on the
            chopping block....Whether we agree with everything Frank says in this book or not, it is
            [a]<b>major intellectual achievement</b>. It forces us to confront the assumptions and
            concepts that our ideas and research have stood upon for generations. Now the rug is
            pulled out from under us, and we must question whether all of those &quot;givens&quot; are
            just cultural biases that we have inherited. This book is like a cold bath that you enter
            reluctantly, shiver in, and emerge from with a bracing vigor. What defines a great book?
            One model is a work that synthesizes everything that we already know. The greatness of
            ReOrient lies in an opposite principle: that of forcing its readers to revisit everything
            they have thought and read. We believe such a work <b>deserves to be cherished and honored</b>.

            World History Association First Book Prize 1999<br>
            This book has just won the 1999 World History Association Book Award, which was presented
            at the WHA conference in Victoria, BC, Canada, on June 26, 1999. The choice <b>was
            unanimous, because</b> we regard this book as being <b>in a class by itself</b>. Its
            breadth of vision, courageous analysis and apt warning not to let ethnocentrism deter
            historians from pursuing a global perspective on the past, all make Gunder Frank's book
            exceptional and a must read for historians, teachers and students of world history. The
            book argues that European hegemony in the modern era did not really emerge until the
            nineteenth century, and that before that Europe was a rather marginal player in the
            Eurasian world economy that was centered on China. Only the windfalls of American silver
            and the Atlantic slave trade enabled Europe to buy its way into the existing world economy
            and industrialize. Its holistic approach forces historians to look beyond Europe to
            understand the making of the modern world, and Frank's attention to historiographic issues
            is <b>outstanding</b>. <br>

            once in a generation,</b> such as with Arnold Toynbee's The Study of History, William
            McNeill's The Rise of the West, and Immanuel Wallerstein's The World-System as seminal
            works in world history. For scholars researching the onset of industrialism and the West's
            eventual dominance, they will be introduced to a whole new set of questions found in
            neither Marx nor Weber that require exploration. This book will give world history a
            research agenda for a generation. Original, contentious, challenging, yet accessible, this
            is Frank at his best. <br>

            <b>One of the best books of this century, November 18, 2000 <br>
            </b>Reviewer: A reader from North America <br>
            Gunder Frank have really helped to open up the eyes of people, who have long gotten used
            to reading books and literary works written with Eurocentric bias. He conclusively proves
            that Europe's success was nothing unique, and that Europe was the lesser of the many
            players in world economics, technology, and industry until about 1800 AD. China, India,
            Central Asia, South-East Asia, and the Middle East were those main players of the global
            trade, spanning from 1500 BC to 1800 AD. These above five regions also had the world's
            highest standards of living, most advanced technology, greatest industrial and commercial
            enterprises, best art forms, literature, philosophy, and musical styles, and also the most
            sophisticated government and best infrastructure in roads, bridges, canals, river and
            seaborne transportation from 5000 BC to 1800 AD Special note must be made of the role that
            Native American gold and silver played in helping Europe to become a player in the global
            trade, by giving Europe with the purchasing power to purchase Chinese silks, tea,
            porcelain, and other goods, Indian cotton textiles, and South-East spices and gems, should
            be noted. Gunder Frank provides <b>ample proof in his arguments and successfully disproves
            long held Eurocentric ideas</b> about the origins of the modern economics, commerce, and
            industry. Gunder Frank's work is <b>an eye-opener to all</b>. This book should be read by
            every person, willing to learn about world history. I must also say that in the 1800's and
            1900's however, it was Europe which played the most significant role in moving the
            science, technology, industry, trade, and commerce of the world forward and to greater new
            heights, just as the other six regions of the world have done in the past.<br>

            <b>A fundamental book for the 21st century, December 3, 2000 <br>
            </b>Reviewer: Eric Vertommen (see more about me) from Brussels Belgium <br>
            <b>The revolution brought by Frank is to destroy Eurocentric views adopted since 1800 </b>bit
            by bit to reveal how the economic system has been working since the last 2000 years and
            especially the last 500 years. What it shows is that the global economy was centered
            around China until 1800 AD, that the main economic players of those 2 millennia were
            China, India and Japan assisted by Russia, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. The West was
            only minor and it is only because we achieved the conquest of the Americas and the
            exploitation of its silver deposits that we obtained a ticket in the global economy and
            gradually rose to proeminence. Britain was global hegemon from 1800 until 1914, displaced
            by the United States from then until present. Some forecasts predict that Chinese economy
            could outpace the US between 2013 and 2049.The book is fundamental because it <b>explains
            the basics of this Asian economic advantage,</b> how post-1800 Westerners could delude
            themselves while their ancestors (Adam Smith being the most famous) dedicated pages of
            study to record and analyse why Asia was so superior to the West in almost everything and
            why the West has risen and is maybe falling beyond again. <b>An essential book for anyone
            to understand the global economy</b>, to have an accurate look on current situation and
            evaluate the decisions made in the West <b>to face Asian return to global power</b>. A

            <b>Gunder Frank does it again</b>. He turns standard Eurocentric historiography and social
            theory upside down, as he did many years ago in exposing the facade of economic
            development. He challenges the experts again, but this time they are quite a different
            group at least in terms of theory, e.g., ranging <b>from Marx to Braudel.</b> <b>They all
            got it wrong </b>because they did not see the whole picture, especially how the whole is
            much more than the sum of its parts. Once again, his argument is clear, organized, and
            often exciting. <br>

            <b>I confess. I was Eurocentric</b>. Despite a degree in International Economics from an
            east coast school known for its School of Foreign Service, I firmly believed Max Weber
            that the Protestant work-ethic was the source of western prosperity. I also believed in
            American exceptionalism. Frank's book cured me of both those false notions. This book is <b>important
            for understanding the world's past as well as the contours of the future.</b> I wonder how
            long it will take for the pendulum to swing back to Asia. Chinese-US relations are getting

            Frank gained his world wide fame by making an argument that caused <b>a revolution in
            thinking </b>about Third World Development. Well, the same thing <b>is about to happen
            again</b>, except this time the stakes are much higher. Now it is the theories of the
            endogenous nature of change in the West that is being challenged. The Wallersteinian world
            economy did not give rise to the world-system, Frank argues, but the Afroeurasian world
            system gave rise to the European world economy. To correct the historical fact is to
            challenge the theoretical scaffolding of everyone from Marx to Weber to Braudel to
            Wallerstein. Frank shows how [they] got it all wrong. This book is conceptually that
            important. No other work both provides the exhaustive documentation and the theoretical
            clarity and conviction of thesis. You get the feel of the interconnectedness of the world
            in a way ... not felt before and the reminder that according to all received theory this
            is not supposed to be so. That is the power of this book. A <b>fundamental rethinking

            <b>Andre Gunder Frank is an icon and iconoclast </b>combined in one. With his new book,
            Re-Orient, Frank is again charting a new territory, this time challenging his friends and
            foes alike, including the former Frank himself, to think beyond narrow Eurocentric
            approaches to the vicissitudes of world economic change and continuity. The book is
            iconoclast to its core. It takes on the entire tradition of modern historiography, western
            and non-western, left and right, on the world economy. Among the revered he attempted to <b>knock
            down in his new book are Karl Marx, Max Weber, Polanyi, Talcott Parsons, Arnold Toynbee,</b>
            Charles <b>Kindleberger, Fernand Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein</b> and most other
            contemporary social theorists such as Perry Anderson and Benjamin Barber on the left and <b>W.
            W. Rostow, Samuel Huntington and Francis Fukuyama on the right.</b> The thesis of the
            Re-Orient is quite straightforward: a truly global perspective is needed in studying
            macro-historical changes in the world--the rise and fall of empires, the industrial
            revolution, the decline of the East and the corresponding rise of the West, colonialism in
            India and American revolution, etc. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, as
            Frank repeatedly tells us in his book, the parts can only be understood in relation to the
            whole. Adopting such a globalist perspective is no easy task, however, as most of our
            contemporary social science, history included, is trapped in an Eurocentric ideology
            masquarading as universal science. Frank sets out to debunk this Eurocentric myth by

            This <b>iconoclastic book</b> is the culmination of one of the most prolific social
            historian's life-long struggle to explain world development. A central idea put forward by
            the author is that in order to understand history one has to place the analysis squarely
            into a world-encompassing model of the global economy. Frank provides a much needed
            perspective that we are 'all in the same boat', that there is 'unity in diversity', and
            that ideas such as that of a 'clash of civilisations' are nonsense. It would be too easy
            to dismiss it as just 'politically correct'. To sum up, 'ReORIENT' is <b>a landmark</b>

            Frank's book makes two big arguments. The first <b>demolishes one of the pillars of
            Eurocentric </b>history: the false belief that Europe was more advanced or more rapidly
            advancing that Asia in early modern times. The second argument is a theory aiming to
            explain why Europe began to outpace Asia in economic development around 1750 and, more
            concretely, to explain why the industrial revolution took place in Europe and not in Asia.

            the main story of economic development is in Asia and not in the West. Frank pulls the rug

            all orthodoxies </b>that Europe discovered capitalism and industrialisation and that what
            followed and is happening and will happen is essentially a fallout of this European
            preeminence.. <br>

            Frank raises the following issue in this book: Can any theory or perspective (theoretical,
            analytical and empirical) which carries <b>the baggage of Eurocentric historiography and
            ideology </b>address the social and economic issues of the 21st century? Can it do so
            especially as it suffers from the drawback of not being able to answer various questions
            relating to the resurgence of the Asian economy without reorienting its analysis of world
            history and global political economy. <br>

            <br>
            This is <b>a bold new interpretation</b> that ... creates a distinctive argument to
            explain Europe's post-1800 successes. It departs from virtually all other 'global' or
            'world' system perspectives by arguing that Europe was not the central location of
            economic dynamism in the early modern world (1400-1800) and therefore that 'capitalism'
            was not a unique cultural phenomenon that can explain the differential economic success of
            Europe over Asia. The author redefines our baseline for assessing the 'rise' of Europe. I
            believe this book could become <b>a benchmark study</b>. BIN WONG University of California

            We have long been indebted to Andre Gunder Frank for giving us unforgettable concepts. He
            now gives us the brilliant &quot;Re-Orient&quot;, an incisive bon mot that not only steers
            us away from Eurocentric history but emphasizes even during the period of the so-called
            European hegemony, of Asia's vigor and significance. This book is written in the classic
            iconoclastic and synthetic style we expect from Frank. In support of this position he has
            assembled a prodigious amount of evidence. [His] strong and clear voice has always called
            upon us to revise. <b>No scholar can afford to ignore this serious book</b>. <br>

            <p>The <a href="reorient_intro.html">Preface</a> gives an account of the 40 years over
            which the ideas of this book have developed, from dependence theory, to world system
            theory to the present globalism. It refers specifically not only to the various stages of
            the work by Frank, but also its mutual interaction with that of other contemporary
            authors, such as Abu-Lughod, Amin, Arrighi, Bergesen, Blaut, Chase-Dunn, Chaudhuri, Chew,
            Denemark, Ekholm, Friedman, Gills, Hall, Hodgson, McNeill, Wallerstein, and Wolf. </p>
            <p>The Chapter 1 Introduction presents the 'unity in diversity' theme of this book and its
            general idea that the whole is more than the sum of, and also shapes, its parts and their
            relations. It applies this ground rule to the study of the global economy and world system
            between 1400 and 1800, which this book analyzes as an alternative to the past two
            centuries of Eurocentric historiography and social theory. The chapter contains very
            critical examinations of the work of classical authors such as Durkheim, Maine, Marx,
            Smith, Sombart, Toynbee, and Weber. It also reviews and challenges twentieth century
            economic historians and social theorists in general and in particular the resistance to
            the present thesis by Abu-Lughod, Amin, Arrighi, Bairoch, Blaut, Braudel, Brenner,
            Chase-Dunn and Hall, Chaudhuri, Cipolla, Gates, Jones, Landes, McNeill, Mann, Modelski and
            Thompson, North, O'Brien, Parsons, Polanyi, Redfield, Rostow, Sanderson, Wallerstein,
            White, and Wolf. On the other hand, the chapter recommends as complementary to the present
            book the recent and oft still unpublished work of Asiniero, Fletcher, Hodgson, Perlin,
            Pomeranz, and Wong. </p>
            <p>Chapter 2 examines the structure and flow of trade, starting in the Americas and going
            eastward literally around the globe. It examines the pattern of trade imbalances, and
            their settlement through payment in money, which also flowed predominantly eastward. A
            dozen regions and their relations with each other are examined, going from the Americas,
            via Africa and Europe, to and through West-, South-, and Southeast- Asia, to Japan and
            China and from there both across the Pacific and also back across Central Asia and Russia.
            This review reveals both information about the strength and growth of these
            &quot;regional&quot; economies and their trade and monetary relations with each other. It
            also shows, at least implicitly, what kind of a world economic division of labor existed,
            expanded, and changed in the early modern period from about 1400 to 1800. At the very
            least, this chapter demonstrates that there was such world-wide division of labor. It
            identifies many of the different products and services, sectors and regions, and of course
            enterprises and &quot;countries&quot; that effectively competed with each other in a
            single global economy. Thus, we will see that all received economic and social theory
            based on the neglect or outright denial of this world-wide division of labor is without
            historical foundation. </p>
            <p>Chapter 3 examines the role of money in the world economy as a whole and in shaping the
            relations among its regional parts. There is a large literature on the flow of money from
            the silver mines in the Americas to Europe, and there has been some concern also with its
            onward remittance to Asia. However, insufficient attention has been devoted to macro- and
            micro- economic analysis of why the specie was produced, transported, minted, re-minted,
            exchanged, etc. Beyond macro- and micro-economic analysis of this production and exchange
            of silver and other species as commodities, one section of this chapter also examines the
            very circulatory system through which the monetary blood flowed. Moreover, this monetary
            system is itself shown to have played an essential role in connecting and expanding the
            world economy. </p>
            <p>Thus, another section examines why and how this capillary monetary system, as well as
            the oxygen carrying monetary blood that flowed through it, penetrated and fuelled the
            economic body of the world economy. We examine how some of these monetary veins and
            arteries were bigger than others, and how smaller ones reached farther into, and even
            served to extend and stimulate production on, the outward reaches of the world economic
            body at this and that, but not every, frontier. The hoary myth about Asiatic
            &quot;hoarding&quot; of money is shown to be without foundation, especially in the
            &quot;sinks&quot; of the world monetary supply in India, and even more so in China. </p>
            <p>Chapter 4 examines some quantitative global economic dimensions. Although hard data are
            hard to come by, one section devotes some effort to assembling and comparing at least some
            world-wide and regional dimensions of population, production, trade, and consumption, as
            well as their respective rates of growth, especially in Asia and Europe. We will see that
            not only were various parts of Asia economically far more important in and to the world
            economy than all of Europe. The historical evidence also demonstrates unequivocally that
            Asia grew faster and more than Europe and maintained its economic lead over Europe in all
            these respects until at least 1750. If several parts of Asia were richer and more
            productive than Europe was, and moreover their economies were expanding and growing during
            this early modern period, how is it possible that the &quot;Asian Mode of Production&quot;
            under any of its European designations could have been as traditional, stationary,
            stagnant and generally uneconomic as Marx, Weber, Sombart et al alleged? It was not, and
            this also Eurocentric proposition should already appear as absurd as it is prima facie.
            Other sections also bring evidence and the judgements of authorities to bear on
            comparisons of productivity, technology as well as of economic and financial institutions
            in Europe and Asia, especially with India and China. These comparisons show that the
            European put-down of Asia is unfounded in fact; for Asia was not only economically and in
            many ways technologically ahead of Europe at the beginning but still also at the end of
            this period. However, this chapter also launches the argument that production, trade,
            their institutions and technology should not only be inter-nationally compared, but that
            they must also be seen as being mutually related and generated on a world economic level. </p>
            <p>Chapter 5 proposes and pursues a &quot;horizontally integrative macrohistory&quot; of
            the world, in which simultaneity of events and processes is no coincidence. Nor are
            simultaneous events here and there seen as differently caused by diverse local
            &quot;internal&quot; circumstances. Instead, one section after another inquires into
            common and connected causes of simultaneous occurrences around the world.
            Demographic/structural, monetary, Kondratieff and longer cycle analysis is brought to bear
            in different but complementary attempts to account for and explain what was happening here
            and there. Such cyclical and monetary analysis is used to help account in the 1640s for
            the simultaneous fall of the Ming in China and of revolution in England, rebellion in
            Spain and Japan, and other problems in Manila and elsewhere. The French, Dutch Batavian,
            American, and industrial revolutions in the late eighteenth century are also briefly
            examined in cyclical and related terms. Another section inquires whether the so-called
            &quot;seventeenth century crisis&quot; of Europe was world wide and included Asia; and I
            explore the important significance of a negative answer for world economic history.
            Observation of the continuation of the &quot;long sixteenth century&quot; expansion
            through the seventeenth and into part of the eighteenth century in much of Asia is used
            also to pose the question of whether there were very long, about 500 year long, world
            economic and political cycles. </p>
            <p>Chapter 6 opens with this question about very long cycles opens on how and why the West
            &quot;won&quot; in the nineteenth century, and whether this &quot;victory&quot; is likely
            to endure or to be only temporary. In previous works (Gills and Frank 1992, Frank and
            Gills 1993, Frank 1993), I claim to have identified half-millennium long world economic
            system wide cycles of expansive &quot;A&quot; and contractive &quot;B&quot; phases, which
            were some two-three hundred years long each. I traced these back to 3000 BC and up to
            about 1450 AD. Three separate test attempts by other scholars [cited below] offer some
            confirmatory evidence of the existence and my dating of these alleged cycles and their
            phases. Did this pattern of such long cycles continue into early modern times? That is the
            first question posed in this section. The second one is that, if they did, do they reflect
            and can they help account for the continued dominance of Asia in the world economy through
            the seventeenth and into the eighteenth century, as well as for its decline and Europe's
            rise thereafter? The chapter also culminates the book's historical account and theoretical
            analysis to argue how the &quot;Decline of the East&quot; and the &quot;Rise of the
            West&quot; may have been systemically related and mutually promoted. To do so, one section
            examines the unequal regional and sectoral structure and the uneven temporal or cyclical
            dynamic the growth of production and of population in the single global economy. The
            argument is that not Asia's alleged weakness and Europe's alleged strength in the period
            of early modern world history, but rather the effects of Asia's strength led to its
            decline after 1750 and that Europe's actions reflected the weakness of its perviously
            marginal position in the world economy and led to its ascendance after 1800. This
            development also took advantage of the &quot;Decline of Asia&quot; after 1750, whose roots
            and timing are also examined in a separate section of the chapter. Moreover, the
            suggestion is made that within the same still continuing process of global development, a
            possible twenty-first century reversion of the balance of economic, political and cultural
            power to Asia may already have begun again. &quot;The Rise of the West&quot; is also
            examined more concretely in the last section. My thesis - echoing but extending that of
            James Blaut - is that the West first bought itself a third class seat on the Asian
            economic train, then leased a whole railway carriage, and only in the nineteenth century
            managed to displace Asians from the locomotive. One section examines, and cites the
            analysis of Adam Smith about how the Europeans managed to do so with the use of American
            money. They used it not only to expand their own economies, but also or even especially to
            buy themselves into the expanding market in Asia. Thus, the industrial revolution and its
            eventual use by the Europeans to achieve a position of dominance in the world economy
            cannot be adequately explained on the basis only of factors &quot;internal&quot; to
            Europe, not even supplemented by colonially based accumulation of capital. We need a world
            economic accounting for and explanation of this world economic process and event. This
            section proposes and then examines a hypothesis based on world-wide and subsidiary
            regional demand-and-supply relations for labor-saving and power-producing technological
            innovation. </p>
            <p>Chapter 7, the conclusion, re-examines the implications of this need for holistic
            analysis and our derivative findings and hypotheses for further research about
            historiography, received theory and the possible and necessary reconstruction of both.
            That is, since the whole is more than the sum of its parts, each part is not only
            influenced by other parts, but by what happens in the whole world [system]. There is no
            way we can understand and account for what happened in Europe or America without taking
            account of what happened in Asia and Africa - and vice versa- nor what happened anywhere
            without identifying the influences that emanated from everywhere, that is from the
            structure and dynamic of the whole world [system] itself. In literally a word, we need a
            holistic analysis to explain any part of the system. The first part of the chapter
            summarizes the historiographic conclusions of what not to do, especially the divisionism
            of Fukujama's 'end of history,' Huntington's 'clash of civilizations,' and Barber's 'Jihad
            vs. McWorld.' The second part of the final chapter goes on to suggest better alternative
            theoretical directions for new historiogrpahy and theory to promote unity in diversity. <a

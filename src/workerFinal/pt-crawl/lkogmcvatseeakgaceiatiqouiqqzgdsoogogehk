<h2>Citation of electronic sources: the problems</h2>
<p>Electronic sources are new, and scholarly practice has not yet 
settled down. However, the basic principle of all citation 
applies: a citation is meant to be 
<strong><em>useful to the reader</em></strong>. A reader 
wants to know the source of information</p> 

<ol type="1">
<li> in order to make some assessment of its reliability</li>
<li> in some cases, in order to locate the source material</li>
</ol>

<p>The following are some suggestions.</p>

<p>As with any academic source, the standard details of author, 
title, and date are essential. However, decsribing the source 
is not quite so simple.</p>
 
<p><a name="ab_note_marker">The</a> URL (internet address) of any 
source cited should of course be given. URLs are generally 
cited in angle brackets 
<a href="#angle_bracket_note"><small>[see note]</small></a>, 
and should be complete, including the protocol (http, gopher etc). 
E.g. &lt;http://humanities.ub.bw/history/bw/bhp1.htm&gt; However, URLs 
keep changing as files are re-organized. Other information, 
such as the name of the site, can be used to search for the 
material using search-engines or directories.</p>

<p>A more serious problem is that on-line resources can disappear 
from the Web altogether. Where material is updated, the old version 
may or may not be preserved. 
</p>



<p>Where an on-line source is a reproduction of a source of another 
type, such as a printed book, this information should be included.</p>

<p>Dates: one should of course include any informative date given 
in the source (date of electronic publication, "last updated" date, 
etc.). The  original date of the document, if it is given, is important. 
However it is also recommended to include <em>the date on 
which the source was accessed</em>, as this can be useful if there have 
been differing versions of the same document. In particular, this information
may enable the document to be recovered from Internet archives such as the 
Wayback Machine (see above), which records what was on-line at a particular
date. (In some cases the publisher of the page might also have 
dated old versions of the page.)</p>


<hr>
<p><a name="1-Our-curren" href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<h2>Our current recommendation</h2>

<p>Our current recommendation is that the following should be
given for a web-page:<br>
<font color="#0000cc">Author (if given), title, web-site, URL, date of page, 
date of access.</font><br>
Note however that some pages may not fit this format well.
The essential thing is to make sure that the <em>document</em> and its
<em>location</em> are both specified. It will often be useful to 
add information which explains the nature of the document or the
web-site.</p>

<p>Thus, a reference to the Botswana History Pages might read:</p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">Neil Parsons, "Brief History of 
Botswana", Botswana History Pages no.&nbsp;1, University of Botswana 
History Department web-site, 
&lt;http://humanities.ub.bw/history/bw/bhp1.htm&gt;: 
dated "1999, last update 10 January 2000"; accessed 12 January 2000.</font></strong></p>

<p><small>[I.e., Author (if given), title, web-site, URL, date of page, 
date of access.]</small></p>

<p>This example illustrates, in fact, some of the potential problems
and why the citation should include these details. The URL
reference is to the now-extinct <i>humanities.ub.bw/history</i> version
of the site. This no longer exists and apparently was not recorded by the
Internet Archive. Of course, in this case the same page can now be found on
the <i>www.thuto.org</i> site. The information in the citation, such as 
"Neil Parsons", "Brief History of Botswana", "Botswana History Pages"
and "University of Botswana History Department web-site" would 
make it very easy to find this new site. If the citation had
only given the original URL, it would be quite difficult to
trace the reference by now. Note the importance of the <em>name</em>
of the web-site, here "University of Botswana History Department
web-site": this is much more stable than the URL. Our web-site
has already had three quite different URLs.</p>

<h3>Bibliography</h3>
<p>In a written essay, any electronic sources which were used
should of course be listed in the bibliography. In a bibliography
it is customary to give the <em>work</em> consulted - e.g. the
title of the book, rather than a page reference to the exact
pages used. Similarly, for electronic sources it is appropriate to
list the sites or resources used, rather than individual pages.</p>
<p>However, for web-sites it is not quite so obvious what 
constitutes the appropriate unit. Suppose you had used
Neil Parsons, "Brief History of 
Botswana", Botswana History Pages no.&nbsp;1.
If you only used this one page, it might be appropriate
to cite it in the bibliography as an item by itself. Thus:</p>
<p class="bib-ex"><small>Neil Parsons, "Brief History of 
Botswana", Botswana History Pages no.&nbsp;1, University of Botswana 
History Department web-site, 
&lt;http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/bhp1.htm&gt;: 
dated "1999, last update 10 January 2000",  
accessed 1 January 2003.</small></p>
<p>However if you had used the Botswana History Pages
as a whole, you might cite the Botswana History Pages as
the work:</p>
<p class="bib-ex"><small>Neil Parsons, "Botswana History Pages"
University of Botswana History Department web-site, 
&lt;http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/bhpindex.htm&gt;: 
dated 1999, accessed 1 January 2003.</small></p>
<p>(Note that the URL given here is the index page for the
Botswana History Pages.) Then again, if you had consulted material
from the University of Botswana History Department web-site
more widely, you might cite the site:</p>
<p class="bib-ex"><small>University of Botswana History 
Department web-site, 
&lt;http://www.thuto.org/ubh&gt;: 
accessed 1-10 January 2003.</small></p>

<h3>Sources whose locations are not simple URLs</h3>

<p>Sometimes you have to access information by going to a site
and then going through a series of menu options. In such cases
it may not be possible to give a simple URL. What to do? Remember
the basic principle - the citation is supposed to be <b>useful</b>,
to enable the reader (1) to find the source and (2) to know what
sort of source it is even without actually going to it. The solution
in this case is to give the URL of the page you go to, followed
by the menu path (e.g. <br>
"<b><span style="font-size: smaller"><font face="arial, sans-serif" color="#0000cc">menu path: Politicians -- 20th century -- K-M</font></span></b>")</p>

<h2>Other formats:</h2>

<p><a name="4-Guides-for" href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<h3>Guides for historical writing:</h3>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.h-net.msu.edu/about/citation/general.html">H-Net guide to citation of electronic sources</a> for a detailed discussion and some recommendations for citation in historical writing. The H-Net format is rather minimalist: for web-sites it includes only the author, date, title and URL. Thus:</p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">Neil Parsons, "Brief History of 
Botswana" (Botswana History Pages no.&nbsp;1), &lt;http://humanities.ub.bw/history/bw/bhp1.htm&gt; 1999.</font></strong></p>

<p>For the reasons given above, in the present state of the 
Internet it is probably safer to include other details. On the other 
hand the format suggested above may be considered too detailed.</p>


<p><a name="5-General-st" href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<h3>General style guides:</h3>

<p>The <cite>MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</cite>, 5th ed. 
(New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1999) includes 
some detailed prescriptions (4.9: pp.&nbsp;178-202), but 
these seem more geared to sources which have also been 
published apart from their on-line form. The sample reference 
above would be, assuming that it falls under 4.9.2.b 
("A Document within a Scholarly Project of Information Database") </p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">
Parsons, Neil. "Brief History of Botswana". <u>Botswana History 
ages no.&nbsp;1</u>. 1999. University of Botswana History 
Department. 12 Jan. 2000. &lt;http://humanities.ub.bw/history/bw/bhp1.htm&gt;.
</font></strong></p>

<p>(12 Jan. 2000 being the date of access.)</p>

<p>Notice that while a date is given in both the H-Net and MLA formats,
<strong>it is a different date</strong>. 
One is the date of the document, while
the other is the date of access. 
<strong>Neither format explicitly states
what the date means</strong>, 
which could cause confusion if the reader 
is unsure of the precise format being followed (or just assumes
one or the other meaning). This is one reason we have not followed
either of these formats but have made our own recommendation - 
we recommend that if you use such a 
format, you state somewhere what the dates mean.
Always remember: citation is supposed to be <em>useful</em>.

<h3>Addendum September 2003</h3>
<p>A very useful example is set by the online
<a href="http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/"><cite>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</cite></a>.
This ends each entry with a brief "How to cite this biography", as in
the following example:</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: smaller; background-color: #ffffcc; padding: 5px">
HOW TO CITE THIS BIOGRAPHY:<br>
Roth, Herbert. 'Parnell, Samuel Duncan 1810 - 1890'.  <i>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</i>, updated 31 July 2003<br> 
URL: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/
</p>
<p>This format does not give the exact URL (in this case<br>
http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=1P7&nbsp;)
but gives the site address and the date.</p>

<br>
<em>Note on angle-brackets:</em> the use of angle-brackets to enclose 
URLs has one curious drawback when creating web-pages. If you paste 
the text "&lt;http://www.ub.bw&gt;" into an HTML document, it will 
be interpreted as an unknown tag - anything in angle-brackets is a 
tag in HTML, such as &lt;font&gt; .. &lt;/font&gt; - and therefore 
will not appear on the page. To represent "&lt;" and "&gt;" on an 
HTML page you must use the escape sequences <font color="#FF0000">
<b>&amp;lt;</b></font> and <font color="#FF0000"><b>&amp;gt;</b></font>
<br>
(and to represent "&amp;" you have to use <font color="#FF0000">
<b>&amp;amp;</b></font>&nbsp;!)</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="http-note">

<i>Note on "<font color="#cc0000">http://</font></i>:</a> Note that a URL begins with
the <i>scheme</i> (such as <b><font color="#cc0000">http://</font></b>, 
<b><font color="#0000cc">mailto:</font></b>,
etc.) as in <font color="#cc0000">http://www.ub.bw</font>. In typing a URL into most
browsers, you can get away with omitting the http:// as this
is what the browser will assume. However it is important to
include the scheme in a citation, because a significant number
of electronic archives use the older 
<b><font color="#cc0000">gopher://</font></b> scheme.
"Gopher" was a predecessor of the Web. (The Web is not synonymous
with the Internet - the Internet is older, and the WWW is a 
way of using the Internet invented in the 1990s.)</p>

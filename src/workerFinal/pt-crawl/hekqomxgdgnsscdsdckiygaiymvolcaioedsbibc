/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 186]]</font> A paper 
        &quot;On reversed sexual characters in a butterfly, and its interpretation 
        on the theory of modification and adaptive mimicry,&quot; was read by Mr. Alfred 
        R. Wallace, as follows:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found an instance in which the usual external 
        sexual characters are reversed, and thinking that it may be well explained 
        by the principles of <em>natural selection</em> and <em>adaptive resemblance</em> 
        or <em>mimicry</em>, I wish to offer a few remarks to the Association, 
        as I look upon it as a kind of <em>crucial instance</em>, by which the 
        merits of <em>different</em> theories of the origin of species may be 
        tested.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In several groups of the higher animals, the 
        males differ from the females not only in the possession of weapons of 
        offence or defence and characteristic ornamental appendages, but also, 
        whenever a difference of colour exists in the sexes, in the males being 
        ornamented with more varied or richer hues. This is especially the case 
        in the great classes of <em>Birds</em> and <em>Insects</em>. I am not 
        aware of any case in which the female bird is more richly coloured than 
        the male, though in some cases she is adorned with more variegated colours. 
        From the fact that the males up to a certain age are like the females, 
        and also from the fact that the females of closely allied species are 
        often almost undistinguishable while the males are very distinct,--it 
        is considered that the male characters present an advance or higher development 
        of the characters common to the female and to the group.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly the same phenomena occur in Insects, 
        and especially in Butterflies, which in many respects are strikingly analogous 
        to Birds. The rule holds in all the families of the extensive group of 
        Diurnal Lepidoptera, with one or two very curious exceptions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In arranging my collection I found it necessary 
        to determine the sexes of all the species as accurately as possible, and 
        for this purpose had recourse to certain structural characters, in the 
        Papilionid&aelig; and Pierid&aelig;, the presence of abdominal valves 
        in the male. In the <em>Nymphalid&aelig;</em> and all other groups except 
        the Hesperid&aelig;, the difference in the structure of the fore legs, 
        which is readily observable and offers a sure means of separating the 
        sexes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On coming to the <em>Diadema antilope</em>, and 
        an allied species which had been confounded with it, I found to my surprise 
        that the individuals always hitherto considered as <em>males</em>, and 
        noted as such in Doub. and Hew. Gen. 1 Diur. Lepid., Sp., page 281, from 
        their bright <em>metallic blue lustre</em>, were <em>females</em>, while 
        the dull and obscure specimens were <em>males</em>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other species of the same <em>Genus Diadema</em> 
        have the same gloss of blue, but always in the <em>males</em>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to understand the cause of this anomaly we 
        must consider a little the theory of those external sexual characters 
        I have already pointed out in Birds and Insects.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only theory that attempts to account for 
        these by any natural law is that of Mr. Darwin, by what he terms sexual 
        selection. According to this view the greater strength and the weapons 
        of offence and defence possessed by the male, are due to the facts that 
        the males fight together for the females, and that therefore every slight 
        variation that gives some individuals the advantage in these struggles 
        is transmitted to their offspring. It is quite in harmony with this view 
        that such male characters are most developed in <em>polygamous species</em>--as 
        the spurs of the cock, the horns of the stag and the ram, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another kind of sexual selection, is when increased 
        beauty of colour or of voice <em>attracts the female</em>, and leads to 
        her <em>choice</em> of a favoured partner. Facts have been observed to 
        show that this really does take place, and it is the only hypothesis that 
        accounts for the very general superior beauty of colour and of voice in 
        the male over the female. This acts equally well in <em>monogamous</em> 
        as in <em>polygamous</em> species--as instanced in our song birds and 
        in diurnal lepidoptera.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of insects, and especially of butterflies, 
        I believe another principle has assisted in producing the diversity of 
        the sexes. It is necessary for the preservation of the race, that the 
        female insect should <em>live longer</em> than the male, because she has 
        to deposit her eggs in a proper situation, during which she is necessarily 
        exposed to the attacks of her enemies. She wants protection, therefore, 
        more than the male does, and anything that makes her less conspicuous 
        is an advantage. Gay colours will therefore be generally injurious, and 
        the inevitable &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; will prevent their development.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now another principle comes in. It is well 
        known that numbers of insects and some birds derive a great protection 
        from enemies by their colours assimilating with the ground colour of their 
        haunts. Many moths and beetles exactly resemble the bark of the trees 
        on which they usually repose; others closely imitate sticks or leaves, 
        or even the dung of birds. Now, in many cases, the same law of the greater 
        protection of the female applies here,--a striking example of which are 
        the wonderful leaf insects of the genus <em>Phyllium</em>, where the females 
        mimic leaves most accurately, while the males, which are smaller and more 
        active, have no such resemblance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been long known that certain insects strikingly 
        resembled other insects externally, although their structure and organization 
        showed them to belong to distinct genera or families, or even orders. 
        There are flies and moths which perfectly resemble stinging hymenoptera. 
        It was Mr. Bates who first investigated these with the view of discovering 
        the rationale of the phenomenon, in which, I think, he quite succeeded. 
        He showed reason for supposing that the species which resembled totally 
        distinct species of other groups, obtained an advantage by this resemblance, 
        just as did those which resembled vegetable or inanimate objects. The 
        most striking case which he brought forward was that of the <em>Heliconid&aelig;</em> 
        and <em>Danaid&aelig;</em>, two families of butterflies which are the 
        subject of close imitation by species of two distinct families, and in 
        every case the pairs of resembling species inhabit not only the same part 
        of the world, but the very same district and locality, have the same habits, 
        and may be taken flying together. In Africa, in America, and in Asia, 
        are many of these curious cases, species of other groups, always mimicing 
        the <em>Danaid&aelig;</em> and <em>Heliconid&aelig;</em>. Now, how do 
        these various species which resemble others gain anything by it? It can 
        only be because the insects they resemble are themselves saved from attack, 
        in some way or other, and the species that resemble them being mistaken 
        for them by their enemies, thus gain an advantage over their allies who 
        are not so mistaken. The nature of the protection of the <em>Danaid&aelig;</em> 
        and <em>Heliconid&aelig;</em> seems to be an odour and taste which is 
        disagreeable to insectivorous birds and insects. They all certainly have 
        a strange medicinal odour which is very powerful; they are excessively 
        abundant in species and individuals; they are generally conspicuous insects; 
        and every one of them--although they vary greatly in size and bulk--have 
        a very slow and weak flight. This combination of characters seems to render 
        it almost certain that they are distasteful to many enemies which check 
        the increase of other groups, and favour in them great powers of flight, 
        or habits which enable them to conceal themselves.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the species that mimic these groups we 
        find some in which both sexes are equally protected, while others have 
        only the females so guarded. A striking conformity with other cases in 
        which protection by mimicry is universally admitted, <em>Diadema bolina</em> 
        is a remarkable instance of this.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The species I propose to name, <em>Diadema anomala</em> 
        is another, for here the glossy blue strikingly resembles the common <em>Eupl&#156;a 
        midamus</em>, which inhabits the same countries, and thus the females 
        have acquired the colouring generally assumed by the <em>males</em>, because 
        each slight variation in that direction was advantageous to the female, 
        and therefore survived in that sex--in the male, from his more rapid flight, 
        and his importance for a shorter time in the economy of nature, the modification 
        has not been so rapid.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is the true explanation of the facts 
        is, I think, shown by their being an exactly analogous one in South America, 
        where several species of <em>Pieris</em>, <em>P. pyrrha</em>, <em>P. malenka</em>, 
        have the <em>females</em> bright <em>orange</em> and <em>red</em>, while 
        the <em>males</em> are <em>white</em>. Here, too, the females exactly 
        resemble <em>Heleconias</em>, with which they fly in the forest, and cannot 
        be distinguished from them. This case is however, not so remarkable because, 
        in it, the male departs from the general colouring of its immediate allies, 
        while in my <em>Diadema</em> the colouring is exactly that which is characteristic 
        of the <em>male sex</em> in the genus. It is an exact <font color="990000">[[p.187]] 
        </font>reversal of the usual sexual characters for a special purpose, 
        which we can distinctly trace, and as such is, I believe, unique. I may 
        state, also, that this species inhabits the same localities as the <em>Eupl&#156;a</em> 
        it resembles, and flies almost equally slowly, so as to deceive any collector, 
        and, therefore, most probably any insectivorous bird.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the soundness of a theory is to be tested 
        by the number and variety of the facts which it connects and explains, 
        I would submit that here we have a large number of very curious facts 
        which are explained on the theory of <em>favourable variations</em> increased 
        in definite directions by &quot;<em>survival of the fittest</em>.&quot; I will briefly 
        recapitulate these,</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st. There are numbers of insects which closely 
        resemble the inanimate objects, on or among which they rest.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd. There are species of Lepidoptera and flies 
        which resemble stinging hymenoptera.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3rd. There are many <em>Lepidoptera</em> which 
        resemble in all parts of the world--one particular group, the Danaoid 
        Butterflies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4th. This group is conspicuous in size and colour; 
        is very varied in form and markings; the species do not conceal themselves; 
        the individuals abound everywhere; and out of more than 20 genera and 
        near 1000 species, not one has a quick or powerful flight.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5th. All the species of this great group have 
        a strong and disagreeable odour, which is given out when the body is crushed 
        or wounded, and which occurs in no other group of butterflies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6th. Among the cases of mimicry of inanimate 
        objects, it is often the <em>females</em> that possess it most perfectly, 
        and sometimes exclusively.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7th. In the cases of mimicry of the <em>Danaoid</em> 
        butterflies the same thing occurs, the females alone in several instances 
        possessing the resemblance, and thus sometimes acquiring a colouration 
        like the <em>males</em> of other species.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8th. The <em>species</em>, and even the <em>entire 
        genus</em> in which these resemblances occur, is often very variable, 
        and transitional forms are often found showing the steps in the production 
        of these mimicing species.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a series of remarkable and undisputed 
        facts. Mr. Darwin's theory, as applied by Mr. Bates and myself, seems 
        to me to connect and explain them, and to clear up such an apparent anomaly 
        as that which has led me to make these remarks; and I am not aware that 
        any other theory or hypothesis has even attempted to do so.</p>

        *</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Huxley cautioned Mr. Wallace 
        against considering this as a decisive case. It was explained quite as 
        completely by the theological doctrine of the late Dr. Paley.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Herbert Spencer thought he could 
        show that the case described by Mr. Wallace could not be satisfactorily 
        explained by Dr. Paley's teaching. He understood Mr. Wallace that the 
        imitation was <em>not complete</em>, and varied in different individuals. 
        This incompleteness was not to be explained were we to assume that the 
        one butterfly was made in imitation of the other by the Creator; but it 
        was readily accounted for by the law of evolution.</p>

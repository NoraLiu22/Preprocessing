<P>Digital libraries require digital librarians. Digital librarians are required to select, acquire, organize, 
make accessible, and preserve digital collections. Digital services must be planned, implemented, and 
supported. Unfortunately, there are presently very few opportunities for librarians to receive training in the 
new tasks and responsibilities that digital libraries demand. To help meet the demand for retraining, the 
University of California (UC) Berkeley Library submitted a successful grant proposal to the Department of 
Education to support an <I>Institute on Digital Library Development</I>. The Institute trained thirty-six 
library, museum, and archive professionals in digital library issues and techniques. Major topic areas 
covered in the Institute included digital library theory and practice, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), 
imaging, optical character recognition, access and indexing, selection of materials for digitizing, and 
effective training techniques. Many of the instructional materials are available online.

<A NAME="Introduction"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>

<P>Digital libraries require digital librarians. Digital collections 
must be selected, acquired, organized, made accessible, and 
preserved. Digital services must be planned, implemented, and supported. 
Computers are certainly essential as the primary tools with which digital 
libraries are built, but people are required to put it all together and 
make it work. </P>

<P>Although the broad requirements of digital libraries may be 
the same as with non-digital collections, any similarity ends there. 
Organizing a digital collection has very little in common with 
organizing a print collection in terms of day-to-day work and individual 
tasks that must be accomplished. Present day digital librarians find 
themselves doing almost nothing they learned in graduate school 
and very little that is familiar. Furthermore, the technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that what is 
learned today will soon be outdated. Therefore, it is more important that 
digital librarians possess particular personal qualities (which are innate) 
rather than specific technical expertise (which can be learned).</P>
 
<P>Digital librarians must thrive on change. They should read constantly
(but selectively) and experiment endlessly. They need to love learning,
be able to self-teach, and be inclined to take risks. And they
must have a keen sense of both the potentials and pitfalls of
technology. </P>

<P>Any individual with those qualities (or some measure of them) is an
excellent candidate to forge new methods for accomplishing the age-old
mission of libraries to select, acquire, organize, provide access to, and
preserve the intellectual and artistic record of humanity. We are, after
all, making it up as we go along. We need professionals who don't need a
lot of guidance or hand-holding. We need individuals with imagination and
foresight and the ability to make their vision a reality.</P>

<P>Individuals with these qualities were who we targeted when the UC
Berkeley Library wrote a successful grant proposal for funding from the Department of
Education Higher Education Act, Title II-B. We understood the need to
retool the profession with the skills and experience required to build
libraries for the 21st century, since we were experiencing the struggle to
retool ourselves. We also realized that opportunities to acquire these new skills in a formal instructional 
environment (rather than learning on the job) were rare. This article describes our goals, how we planned 
the resulting <I>Institute on Digital Library Development</I>, 
what we taught Institute participants, and what we learned about training digital librarians.</P>

<A NAME="Accomplish"><H3>What We Set Out To Accomplish</H3></A>

<P>The grant proposal<SUP><A NAME="1return"><A HREF="#1">[1]</A></A></SUP>
states that "the Institute will train participants in mounting
electronic resources using the World-Wide Web, while also preparing them
to train others. A product of the Institute will be an electronic archive
of Institute materials that can be accessed over the Internet by both
Institute participants and the world at large. Therefore, besides having an
immediate impact on the attendees, this Institute has the potential for a
lasting impact on the ability of libraries around the world to utilize
existing technologies to expand access to electronic information." </P>

<P>Our primary goal was to train information professionals in practical 
techniques that they could use to create new kinds of collections and 
services using current technologies. Our belief is that massive digital 
libraries will be built through the cooperative activities of numerous 
institutions. We wanted to help "seed" such activities by providing some 
key training and instruction in current digital library practices. We 
decided that our basic format should be a mixture of lecture, 
demonstration, hands-on exercises, and open lab periods. Lecture material 
would introduce digital library principles and techniques. 
Demonstrations would illustrate the lecture as well as highlight specific 
tools and techniques. Hands-on exercises would take participants through 
tasks that would help them learn the tools and techniques that were 
demonstrated. Open lab periods would allow the instructors time to work with 
participants individually, and would give participants time to 
pursue their individual projects.</P>

<P>One of our requirements for a physical facility to host the
Institute was a dedicated workstation for each participant. Our premise was that the only way we could 
expect attendees
to learn the material was to let them do it
themselves while experts were present to help with questions
and problems. In the grant, we specified that we would train 36
individuals, which at the time would have required three separate
institutes of 12 participants each. In the intervening period between the
grant award and the Institute (over a year) the UCB Library created a new instructional
facility with 18 student workstations, thereby allowing us to train the
same number of librarians in two Institutes.</P>

<P>The Department of Education awarded us a grant of $49,918, which
comprised an estimated 87% of the total expense. The remaining 13% or
$7,530 was provided by the UC Berkeley Library. Since we wanted to attract
librarians from the entire spectrum of the profession, we requested
$10,000 to provide attendee scholarships. This allowed us to underwrite
the participation of librarians who would not have been able to attend
otherwise, and thereby guarantee participation of those who would benefit
most regardless of the amount of support their institutions could
provide.</P>

<P>The goal of creating "an electronic archive of Institute materials" 
has been fulfilled by the creation of the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/">Institute on Digital Library 
Development Web site</A>, which provides nearly all of the instructional 
materials developed for the Institute. Lecture material is available in 
both native Microsoft PowerPoint form as well as Adobe Acrobat. 
Instructor's notes and class exercises are available in Adobe Acrobat form. 
A complete list of documents handed out in class is there, with links 
to their electronic equivalents when available.</P>

<A NAME="Pre"><B>Pre-Institute</B><BR></A>

<P><I>The Announcement and Application Process</I><BR>
Given the nature of the Institute and the audience which we were 
targeting, we decided to only announce the Institute on electronic 
discussions appropriate to the type of training we were offering. We also specified 
that applicants must fill-out an application form on our Web site, 
thereby assuring that applicants would at least have some minimal 
familiarity with the basic tools we would be using in the Institute.</P>

<P>Prior to the announcement of the Institute, we created an 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/oldindex.html">Institute Web site</A>
on the <A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Digital Library
SunSITE</A> that provided basic information about the Institute, a draft
of the Institute syllabus, application information and form, and 
information about local arrangements.</A>

<P>At the end of April 1996 we posted an 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/announcement.txt">announcement</A> of 
the Institute on 
<A HREF="http://info.lib.uh.edu/pacsl.html">PACS-L</A>, <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Web4Lib/">Web4Lib</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/cgi-bin/ifla-lwgate/DIGLIB/">DIGLIB</A> 
electronic discussions. The application deadline was May 17, 1996. We 
received over 100 applications from professionals in the library, museum, 
and archive communities working at corporate, public, and non-profit 
institutions around the United States (participation was limited to U.S. 
residents).</P>

<P>We reviewed the applications and selected thirty-six participants and 
about half a dozen alternates in case of cancellation. In reviewing the 
applications, we realized that we had attracted a slightly different 
audience than we had originally envisioned. Most applicants had already 
used HTML to some degree, whereas we had thought that most would not yet 
have that experience. This information prompted us to revise the 
curriculum slightly. We decided to drop beginning HTML and send 
out a pre-Institute exercise to make sure that everyone would have the 
same base level of HTML knowledge. That allowed us to jump right into 
advanced HTML with a minimum of review.</P>

<P><I>Logistics</I><BR>
One of the UC Berkeley Library instructional rooms was scheduled for 
the entire week of each Institute. The room is equipped with eighteen 
student workstations (90Mz Pentium computers with 16MB RAM and a 17" 
monitor), and one similar 
instructor's workstation which is also attached to a projector. All 
workstations were running Windows 3.1 and application software included 
Adobe Photoshop (for image editing), OmniPage Professional (for optical 
character recognition), Netscape and NCSA Mosaic, and various Internet 
utilities (Telnet, FTP). All HTML editing was performed using a simple 
text editor (thereby allowing us to focus on the HTML rather than a 
particular software program).</P>

<P>Since one of our goals was to maximize hands-on time for the students, 
we also brought in two other workstations (one Macintosh and one Windows 
95 PC) and three scanners (attaching one scanner to the existing 
instructor's PC). We then had three scanning stations available 
throughout the week. To offer experience with digital cameras, we rented an Apple QuickTake digital 
camera during part of each Institute.</P>

<P>The instructional room has both an inside and outside entrance. 
The outside entrance opens onto a patio area, which we used for
serving break refreshments and lunch. This arrangement worked very well,
as we did not need to allow time for participants to travel to a lunch
location and back again. We could simply call everyone in from the patio
when we were ready to resume.</P>


<P><I>Instructional Aids</I><BR>
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/cover.jpg"><IMG ALT="Binder
cover" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=183
SRC="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/coversmall.jpg"></A>
As we developed the content for the course, we realized we needed to 
create a binder (see cover illustration) that would contain reference 
material for further study as well as exercises and other materials that 
we would hand out in class. The <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/handouts.html">Institute 
binder</A> contained printouts of Web accessible documentation, selected 
portions of books and journals, and material developed for specifically 
for the Institute. We also purchased copies of the excellent <CITE><A 
HREF="http://www.ahip.getty.edu/intro_imaging/0-Cover.html">Introduction to Imaging: Issues in 
Constructing an Image Database</A></CITE> published by the Getty Art History Information 
Program.</P>

<P>Also included in the binder were evaluation forms (one for each day 
and another for an overall evaluation), brief biographies of faculty, 
a list of Institute participants, and local information (restaurants, 
entertainment, etc.). </P>

<P>During the Institute, we also handed out exercises, slide thumbnails of lecture material, and other 
instructional aids. Participants would add these to their binders as we went along.</P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<A NAME="Institute"><B>The Institute</B><BR></A>

<P>The first Institute was held July 15-19, 1996 and the second followed two weeks later, July 29-August 
2, 1996. The content was equally divided between lecture, discussion, and hands-on
practice. It was <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/IDLD/managers.html">co-managed 
and taught</A> by Kirk Hastings and Roy 
Tennant. <A HREF="http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/IDLD/lecturers.html">Guest 
lecturers</A> 
included Howard Besser, John Ober, Barclay Ogden, and Ann Swartzell. 
Other library staff members provided logistical, organizational, and systems
assistance.</P>

<P><B>Day 1</B><BR>
We began the Institute with an informal meeting in the UC Berkeley Morrison
Library, which offered a comfortable and notably low-tech environment in which to begin. Participants 
were checked in and they
picked up their binders. Following self-introductions we talked about Institute logistics and what we 
intended to
accomplish in the coming week. We set a tone of practical informality to encourage a "roll up your sleeves" 
atmosphere.</P>

<P>We then made our way to the Instructional Computer Facility in Moffitt Library,
where participants would spend more than eight hours a day for the remainder of the week.
After a brief introduction to the workstations and the campus network, we
began with an <A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/digital.pdf">introduction to digital library 
development</A>.
<P>
<DL> 
<DT><I>TOPIC:</I> Introduction to Digital Library Development

<DD><P>Although most of the participants were professional librarians, they were mostly
unfamiliar with the major issues in digital library development and the
underlying structures and systems on which the digital library relies. We 
began with the difficult task of defining "digital library". By practical
example, we made it obvious how slippery a concept this can be and how it was
likely to continue to change and evolve until some basic standards are
developed.</P>

<P>The bulk of our comments were devoted to describing the primary activities of
selecting, acquiring, organizing, providing access to and preserving
information in the digital world. We covered both the broad issues involved and
the technical infrastructure necessary to accomplish these tasks.  We discussed how the practical skills 
taught in the Institute would help
participants in the development of their own specific digital library projects.</P>

<P>Also covered were the necessary physical components of a digital library,
including hardware, software, staff and appropriate collections. Many
participants were at the beginning of project development and were eager for 
practical advice in bringing together all these elements into a working
whole. As was frequently the case, we did not have as much time for discussion as we would have 
liked.</P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I> Introduction to Structured Text
<DD><P>It was not our intention to teach even basic SGML. However,
it was necessary for participants to understand the differences between SGML
and HTML and what the appropriate uses for each are. We covered descriptive
markup, document types, and data independence, and then went on to describe some of the
issues involved in implementing a project based on SGML. As an example, we used the quite successful <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/FindingAids/">Berkeley Finding Aids project</A>.</P>

<P>Although it was a requirement for the Institute that all participants be
familiar with the basics of HTML, we felt it would be a good idea to make sure
that everybody was in the same place. After describing the relationship of HTML
and SGML, we quickly covered the fundamentals of HTML markup and then reviewed
a pre-workshop HTML exercise that all the participants were required to
complete (or have equivalent experience).</P>


</DL>

<P><B>Day 2</B><BR>
Day 2 was devoted entirely to learning the more advanced features of
HTML. Roy Tennant has had considerable experience teaching HTML, and so had a series
of well-honed lectures and exercises he has developed for teaching tables,
forms, image mapping, and style and design. (Roy has collected these in a
recently published book: <A
HREF="http://www.library-solutions.com/phtml.html">Practical HTML: A
Self-Paced Tutorial</A>. The book versions of his presentations are
available at: 
<A HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~roy/">http://www.sonic.net/~roy/</A>.)
<P>
<DL>
<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>HTML Tables

<DD><P>Because of the limited provisions for text formatting in HTML, tables
have become the primary tool for changing the look and feel of web pages.
We went into considerable detail on how to use the table tags to bring
text and images into line. We then had the participants do a small
practical exercise, based on a now infamous and overly-maligned Lemon Chicken recipe. Despite
the careful selection of participants, it was inevitable that some would
have a lot more experience than others. While those fairly new to markup
struggled with this first attempt, the rest quickly elaborated on the
theme and committed all sorts of atrocities.</P>

<P>For the eighteen participants in each Institute, there were always two
or more instructors available for help. Often this was not enough, as the
questions came fast and furious.  It was encouraging to see that those who
finished easily, after a suitable period of creative expression, were soon
helping those to whom this was a new universe.</P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>HTML Forms

<DD><P>Near and dear to the hearts of front-line librarians is the idea that 
many of their most mundane tasks can be accomplished on-line. Many of the
participants were thirsting to create forms for book renewal, patron
complaint/suggestions, interlibrary lending, etc. After describing in detail the tags for creating forms,
and doing our best to make obvious the differences between POST and GET,
we turned them loose on an exercise to create a simple form. We
had set up a simple script ahead of time on a Web server so that anything submitted using
the exercise form would be posted on the instructor's workstation. For
many participants, it was hearing us read out loud their predictably playful
submissions that really brought home just how easy this all was.</P>

<P>At this point, a certain deficiency in the Institute began to
become obvious. Although it would be impossible to teach even the
rudiments of Perl or some other scripting language in such a short time,
it was obvious that we really needed to help them to gain a broad conceptual
understanding of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming. If the
Institute were to be repeated, we might include an exercise in creating a basic script along with enough of 
an overview
of UNIX to facilitate putting it in the right place and seeing how it all
works.</P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>HTML Image Mapping

<DD><P>There seems to be a great fascination with the idea of image mapping. 
Many of the participants were interested in creating large image maps for
navigating existing or potential sites. After introducing them to the
basic tags, we demonstrated methods for determining the correct
coordinates of image areas. As a segue to the next topic, we also
discussed how the use of such gaudy features should be limited to those
instances when they will be truly
useful to the user.</P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>HTML Style and Design
<DD><P>Anyone can throw together some HTML tags and stake their claim on 
a corner of the Web, but that doesn't make it right. Novice users of HTML 
often make flagrant design errors that can render their documents 
unusable if not downright annoying. To illustrate some important points 
about effective Web design, we used both participant- and instructor- identified Web sites as objects of 
ridicule or acclaim, as the individual case warranted.
</DL>

<P><B>Day 3</B><BR>
Days 3 and 4 were primarily devoted to the topic of digital imaging. By
necessity, this section heavily emphasized practical learning experiences as
there was much ground to cover. We also decided that the participants would get
the most out the digital imaging exercises if they were project-oriented. By
having a finite project to focus on, we felt that they would have an easier
time in seeing in how all these skills could be brought together to produce a
single product.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Preservation &amp; Access Criteria in Selection for Digitization

<DD><P>We began this part of the institute by having librarians from here at Berkeley
discuss the issues involved in selecting materials for digitization.
Both Barclay Ogden and Anne Swartzell are involved in the development of large
digital library projects. Their wealth of experience, combined with the fact
that they are engaging speakers, soon had the class involved in a lively
discussion of the issues that need consideration before a digital library
project is initiated.</P>
</DL>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%>
<TR><TD>
<DL>
<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Image Capture
<DD><P>We began this section by having the participants define a small project they
wished to work on for the remainder of the Institute. This was followed by a
general discussion of digital imaging and the processes on which it is based.
It proved very difficult to adequately explain resolution, dynamic range, file
and image size, and how they all interrelate. Despite carefully prepared
demonstration images, it was often only when we were working with people
individually that we were able to get these basics across.</P>

<P>After distilling these topics down into a few rules of thumb, we turned the
participants loose on the scanners. Three scanning workstations were set up in the front of the class, and 
there was soon a line at each. Most of them had brought materials from their libraries to work on, ranging 
from botanical prints to slides to old newspapers. This proved very instructive, as many unforeseen issues 
soon cropped up with regard to how to best deal with materials other than an 81/2 by 11 sheet of paper.</P>

</TABLE>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Basic Photoshop
<DD><P>Once we got through the trauma of transferring their multi-megabyte TIFF files from the
scanning workstations to their own, we moved on to some basic image
manipulation and enhancement skills. Almost none of the of the participants had
any experience with Photoshop. The approach we tried was to simply take an
image and run through as many features of the software as we possibly could in
the time allotted. We emphasized those tools that are most useful for improving
images without actually altering or losing any of the information contained in
them: cropping, sharpening, adjusting color and tone, etc.</P>

<P>Even before we had finished demonstrating, they were trying things out, often
with disastrous and yet entertaining results.  We were usually able to fix things, however, and soon 
everybody was mocking up web pages in which to place their images.</P>

<P>In retrospect, a better approach to teaching Photoshop may have been to
demonstrate the process of taking a raw TIFF format scan of a document or photograph
and demonstrate the sequence of steps required to produce an acceptable image.
By just dumping a bunch of tools in their laps, we left many
participants in doubt of where exactly to begin.</P>

<DT><I>Lab</I>
<DD><P>After class, many chose to spend most of the evening working on their projects.
Having the facilities available to participants for extended use allowed them
to make a lot of progress. </P>
</DL>

<P><B>Day 4</B><BR>
Day 4 was devoted to adding more tools to their repertoire. Besides additional
practice with Photoshop, participants were also introduced to optical character
recognition and some of the subtleties of creating efficient images for the
web.</P>

<DL>
<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Advanced Image Enhancement in Photoshop

<DD><P>Photoshop is one of those programs where there are at least a half dozen
different ways to do anything. During this section, we built on the basic skills
they had gained the previous day, by showing them more and increasingly
sophisticated ways to manipulate and enhance an image. We still did not leave
the realm of basic tools, preferring to leave such confusing issues as layers,
channels and masks well enough alone.</P>

<P>The participants were having none of it, however.  After repeatedly showing
people individually how to create things like drop shadows, we decided to at
least demonstrate the use of layers, which can be an essential tool for image editing. Such techniques may 
go beyond the strict needs of the digital librarian, but people
cannot resist the temptation to gussy things up. In the end, though, it helped the participants to better 
understand the software and what can be accomplished with it. <P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Creating Images for the Web
<DD><P>Many of the Institute participants had had prior frustrating experiences with
placing images on their web pages. Striking a  balance between image
clarity and file size can be difficult. We began by describing the
differences between the most useful file formats (TIFF, PhotoCD,  JPEG, and
GIF) and to what each was most suited. We then stepped them through the process
of taking their initial scans and creating images for use on the web. This is a
fairly simple process once you understand a few rules of thumb. We would also
have liked to demonstrate, using digital library projects we had worked on,
some of the choices we had made in particular situations, but at this point
we were running out of time.</P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
<DD><P>Unfortunately, OCR ended up being crammed into whatever remaining time we had. Given the 
nature of the technology, we felt it necessary to point out that despite its great potential, text
scanning is still a laborious and often frustrating experience. We
quickly demonstrated the OmniPage Software and let people give it a try during
the lab period. We would have liked to discuss some of the procedures we had
come up with to improve results, especially with archival materials, but time
did not permit.</P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Image Projects &amp; Issues

<DD><P>We are fortunate on the Berkeley campus to have Howard Besser as a 
visiting professor. After the previous two days of intensive nuts and bolts
work, participants were ready to sit back and have one of the field's heavy
hitters describe what was happening on the cutting edge. Howard took us on a
wide ranging tour, via the web, of some of the most innovative image database
projects presently under construction. He also discussed standards
development, ethical and legal issues, technical protection
schemes, and content based retrieval. All the sites he demonstrated are available from his rather massive 
Web page of 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Imaging/Databases">Image and Multimedia Database 
Resources</A>.</P>

<DT><I>Lab</I>
<DD><P>We offered another lab period at the end of Day 4. Again, many participants elected to stay and 
work on their projects during this period. Kirk Hastings staffed both labs and offered individual assistance. 
</P>

</DL>


<P><B>Day 5</B><BR>
The last day was devoted to a mix of topics and wrap-up activities.  In the morning, we covered proven 
techniques for teaching others, since one of the goals of the Institute was to have participants return to their 
organizations and spread what they learned among their colleagues. In the afternoon we presented material 
on access and indexing issues, and offered an open "show and tell" period in which participants could share 
what they accomplished during the course of the week. At the end of the day we allowed time to evaluate 
the day (as we had throughout the week) as well as the Institute overall. </P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Effective Training Techniques
<DD><P>John Ober modeled, demonstrated, and discussed training techniques that he has found to be 
effective in the many years in which he has been an instructor and trainer. He talked about why teaching 
technical topics is difficult and what training strategies can help. He discussed appropriate learning theories 
and how they can inform the decisions you make about what material to present and how to present it. </P>

<DT><I>TOPIC:</I>Digital Library Access, Indexing and Databases
<DD><P>In discussing digital library access issues, our essential point was "more is better." <I>One path 
to your information is two too few</I>. Think of the different audiences that your information may have and 
their particular needs. The good news is that the information itself (your digitized images, documents, etc.) 
need only exist once to be referenced from several different perspectives. We then demonstrated what we 
meant by using online examples of different paths to the same digital file.</A>

<DD><P>Our brief discussion of indexing focused on ways in which you could provide basic keyword 
searching of your files. As an example we discussed how we had used the free software SWISH (Simple 
WAIS Indexing System for Humans) to index some of our collections.</P>

<DD><P>Digital library databases are a complex topic, and unfortunately we did not have enough time to 
do the topic justice. We nonetheless spent some time discussing metadata and used existing library 
standards like AACR2 and MARC as well as emerging standards like the 
<A HREF="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core">Dublin Core</A>
as examples. We discussed, but did 
not demonstrate, various database software packages that could be used and how Web access is being 
provided to them.</P>

<DT><I>Show and Tell of Participant Projects</I>
<DD><P>One of the most enjoyable parts of the Institute for us was seeing the results of everyone's work 
over the course of the week. It was truly remarkable what participants had been able to accomplish with 
what they had learned. The show and tell period was voluntary, but we were not above using threats to spur 
participants to share their accomplishments. One of the benefits of learning with a diverse group of 
individuals is the awareness of different perspectives and ideas that such diversity brings. </P> 

</DL>

<P>The last part of the Institute was devoted to answering any lingering questions, assuring participants 
that despite their worst fears their heads had not, indeed, exploded, and collecting final <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/comments.html">evaluations</A>. We also discussed methods of 
keeping up with technology and digital library issues.</P>

<P>Following the second Institute, we mounted almost all of the Institute
instructional materials on the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/IDLD/">Institute Web site</A>. Among the
materials included are in-class handouts, Microsoft PowerPoint presentation files (in both native and Adobe 
Acrobat format), the lists of
participants, a complete listing of the binder contents (with links to
materials available online), and even instructor's notes (which were not
handed out to Institute participants).</P>

<P>Shortly after the Institute, Kathy McGreevy from Santa Rosa Community
College Library in California created a Web page "report" of her
experiences at the Institute she called "<A 
HREF="http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/IDLD/McGreevy/camp.html">Skills I 
Learned at Camp IDLD</A>". In this way, she not only reports on her 
experiences, but she also uses the techniques she learned at the 
Institute to create it (image editing, HTML tables, forms, etc.). </P>

<P>A number of people have contacted us about offering the Institute
again, but we have not yet made a decision. If we do offer the Institute
again, or something like it, we will announce it to the same electronic discussions as we announced this 
one.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the Institute materials are available online for anyone to 
use in similar efforts and we can be contacted for questions. We also started an electronic discussion,  
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/DigLibns/">DigLibns</A> to carry forward our efforts to focus on 
practical, day-to-day issues and problems facing today's digital 
librarians. Anyone is welcome to subscribe and participation in the discussion.</P>

<A NAME="Learned"><H3>What We Learned</H3></A>

<UL>
<LI><B>What <I>can</I> go wrong <I>will</I></B> - Any experienced computer or 
Internet trainer will tell you that you must be prepared for 
<I>anything</I>. We were reminded of this fact within hours of 
starting the first Institute. First the instructor's workstation was 
behaving strangely and not allowing us into MS Windows. We then 
switched to the Macintosh that we also had prepared to project onto a 
screen. Then the entire first row of student workstations as well as 
all of the instructor workstations shutdown. We had blown a fuse. We 
immediately (and calmly) asked everyone to refer to their handouts, which 
had thumbnails of the screens that we had planned to project. The lesson: 
be prepared and roll with the punches. Stay calm and no one will get hurt.

<LI><B>Be realistic 
about what you can cover well</B> - One of the most common mistakes we have 
seen instructors make is outlining more than can be profitably covered in 
the time allotted. We were determined not to do that, while also covering
what was necessary to give participants a solid grounding in both 
theoretical issues and practical techniques. While to a large degree we 
felt we met our goal, there were nonetheless a few topics that could have 
used more time. Techniques for indexing, database use, and metadata 
issues were all discussed, but not in great detail.

<LI><B>Experience is the best teacher</B> - Time set aside for participants to 
use the techniques we were teaching was essential to the success of the 
Institute. Besides planning guided exercises, we also encouraged 
participants to bring their own projects to the Institute. This allowed 
them to both learn and accomplish something of importance to them. The 
open lab periods gave them time to solidify their new knowledge in a more 
effective way than would be possible with only guided exercises.

</UL>

<P>We learned that teaching an institute is a great way to learn ourselves. There is no greater incentive to 
learn a topic 
thoroughly than having to teach it. We also learned a lot from 
interacting with all of the participants. Their needs, experiences, 
skills, and creativity were unique and added a great deal to the experience we have 
come to call "Camp IDLD".</P>

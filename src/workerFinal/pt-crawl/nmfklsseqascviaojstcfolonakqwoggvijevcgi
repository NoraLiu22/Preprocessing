/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 716]]</font> At 
          the last meeting of the Entomological Society, the subject of &quot;Mimicry,&quot; 
          or protective resemblances, was brought forward by Prof. Westwood<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
          and myself, and during the discussion that ensued some objections were 
          made to the explanation of the phenomena first given by Mr. Bates, and 
          adopted by me as the only sufficient one. Time did not permit of an 
          answer being made to those objections, and as they are at first sight 
          very plausible, and were brought forward not by one of Mr. Darwin's 
          opponents, but by a gentleman who fully admits the great principles 
          of evolution and development in organic nature, they may probably have 
          weight with some persons. Believing, however, that they are entirely 
          unsound, may I beg a little of your space to give my reasons for rejecting 
          them.</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Sharp<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> stated 

          that four different causes might be sufficient to produce the phenomena 

          of &quot;mimicry&quot; more or less completely, viz., first, accidental resemblances; 

          secondly, similar conditions of life; thirdly, heredity, or reversion 

          to a common ancestral type; and, fourthly, the preservation of useful 

          variations.</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the first, or accidental resemblances, 
          it was admitted that very few, if any, of the cases adduced by Mr. Bates 
          or myself could be due. The last is the one we adopt. The second and 
          third only remain, and these, Mr. Sharp argued, would account for most, 
          or perhaps all, of our cases without the agency of natural selection 
          at all. Now, all I can admit is, that in some cases of very closely 
          allied species of the same or of closely allied genera, an accurate 
          external resemblance, such as we term &quot;mimicry,&quot; might possibly be produced 
          either by &quot;heredity,&quot; or by the action of like conditions. But in all 
          the cases in which the insects resembling each other belong to distinct 
          <em>orders</em>, or distinct <em>families</em>, or to<em> genera</em> 
          not intimately allied, or even to well-marked <em>sections </em>of extensive 
          genera, I entirely deny <font color="990000">[[p. 717]]</font> that 
          either or both of these causes could have produced the whole series 
          of phenomena presented by <em>mimicking</em> insects, and for the following 
          reasons, which appear to me sufficiently conclusive:--</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In all cases of mimicry, the resemblance 

          of the one species to another in a different group is entirely superficial, 

          and is always strictly confined to those characters which cause the 

          one to<em> look like the other</em>. The structure, the habits, the 

          form of inconspicuous parts, the colour of inconspicuous parts, the 

          nature of the food, or the character of the larva and pupa, are not, 

          as far as we know, ever modified in a similar manner. But if such general 

          causes as &quot;heredity&quot; or &quot;similar conditions&quot; produced resemblances, 

          these resemblances should affect various parts of the organization, 

          not those conspicuous to the eye only. The effect being limited with 

          strict reference to external resemblance, seems to me a fatal objection 

          to referring it to any cause or causes of a general nature.</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. There are no grounds for believing that 

          minute details of colouration and marking are due to climatal conditions 

          at all, still less that they can be produced so identically alike in 

          species of groups widely differing in organization; neither is there 

          any evidence that such details are ever continued by heredity to one 

          species only in each of two distinct family groups which contain hundreds 

          of other variously-coloured species.</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. It is only a very few groups of insects 

          which are the subjects of imitation by many other groups. But &quot;heredity&quot; 

          should affect nearly all groups not too remotely allied; and &quot;common 

          conditions&quot; should affect all species inhabiting the same forests with 

          some approach to an average frequency. The fact that there is no such 

          miscellaneous character in the resemblances (the group of Danaioid butterflies 

          being the mimicked in the great majority of cases) tells us plainly 

          that no causes affecting all insects alike can be at the bottom of this 

          curious phenomenon.</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Protective resemblance to a species of 

          a distinct order sometimes occurs, as in the curious <em>Orthopterous</em> 

          insect adduced by Prof. Westwood, which had been always taken for a 

          <em>Coleopterous</em> insect that inhabits the same country (<em>Tricondyla</em> 

          sp.). Neither &quot;heredity&quot; nor &quot;like conditions&quot; can be called in here; 

          yet the phenomenon is so similar to that of the mimicking butterflies, 

          that the idea of a similar cause in both instances is irresistibly forced 

          upon us.</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Resemblances of the most perfect kind occur 

          between insects and inanimate objects. Phasmid&aelig; imitate sticks, 

          leaves, or moss most wonderfully. The larv&aelig; of Geometr&aelig; 

          also imitate sticks. Thousands of tropical Coleoptera imitate bark (and 

          it is always those that cling to bark); others that sit motionless on 

          leaves cannot be distinguished from the dung of birds dropped on a leaf. 

          These are most clearly <em>protective</em> <em>imitations</em>, and 

          they can none of them possibly be produced by &quot;heredity&quot; or &quot;similarity 

          of conditions,&quot; but, if produced at all by natural causes, seem clearly 

          due to the continued preservation of useful variations. The mimicry 

          of other insects is equally protective, and there is every probability 

          that both were produced in a similar manner.</p>

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. This is rendered still more certain by 

          the fact that in both classes of resemblance it is the female only that 

          is most frequently protected, for reasons which I have already explained, 

          but cannot now enter into. It is only the female &quot;leaf-insect&quot; that 

          is so wonderfully like a leaf; and in many species of Pieris and Diadema 

          it is the females only that mimic Heliconias and Eupl&aelig;as. This 

          fact alone renders it in the highest degree improbable that the two 

          groups of phenomena should have been due to distinct causes, even if 

          the preceding arguments had not shown us how impossible it was to explain 

          any of the main features of &quot;mimicry&quot; by such causes as &quot;heredity&quot; or 

          &quot;the action of like external conditions.&quot;</p>

        

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons it appears to me indisputable 

          that &quot;natural selection,&quot; or the continued survival of variations useful 

          to the possessor, is the only theory yet before us which is capable

  <strong><i><font color="993366">Comment by James Mallet, University College London 

          (pers. commun. 4/00):</font></i></strong></p>

        <p><i>Mimicry (naturally selected resemblance of an unprotected 

          &quot;mimic&quot; to another species protected by nauseous taste) was first proposed 

          by Bates in 1862. In the 1860s Wallace was a strong supporter, and in 

          1864 (in S96) presented the astonishing discovery that some papilionid 

          (swallowtail) butterflies have females that are Batesian mimics, while 

          their males, previously considered separate species, are non-mimetic. 

          In addition, females are often polymorphic, with several different forms 

          (also formerly described as species) each mimicking a separate nauseous 

          species, co-occurring in any one locality. Intermediates are rare or 

          absent, but Wallace argued that they are all members of the same species 

          because the brood of a single female may contain male as well as multiple 

          female forms. As a major player in mimicry theory, Wallace was well 

          equipped to deal with the critiques of mimicry mounted by Westwood and 

          others in the Entomological Society meeting rooms (as shown in S123 

          above).</i></p>

        <p><i>Although rarely cited, Wallace's 1864 paper (S96) is 

          almost certainly more influential today than Bates's. In December 1903, 

          Wallace presented a volume containing his own and Bates's paper to E. 

          B. Poulton, also an expert on Papilionidae and mimicry. It cannot be 

          a coincidence that Poulton gave a presidential address to the Entomological 

          Society of London, entitled &quot;What is a Species?&quot; in January 1904. In 

          the published version, Poulton cites Wallace's example of polymorphic 

          female and male forms of mimetic Papilionidae as evidence that reproductive 

          continuity is the real meaning of species: members of the same species 

          interbreed, while different species do not. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr, 

          recognized today as inventors of the influential reproductive isolation-based 

          &quot;biological species concept,&quot; cite Poulton's paper (or his 1908 book 

          containing it), but neither acknowledges Poulton's priority. Mayr even 

          uses Poulton's terminology: in &quot;sympatry&quot; (within the same locality), 

          members of the same species interbreed, while different species do not. 

          Wallace is not today well remembered for his discoveries about mimicry, 

          but his work on this topic has strongly affected our views of how species 

          evolve.</i></p>

    &nbsp;<font size=+1>T</font>here is no more interesting and inventive British 
    philosopher writing today than Colin McGinn, who is currently teaching at 
    Rutgers University. Recently he has begun to acquire a reputation for intellectual 
    raffishness, and some philosophers, having learned a great deal from him on 
    a very wide range of subjects for over 20 years, now like to put him down 
    as too careless, too breezy, too coarse. But they keep up with his views, 
    if they have any sense. He has a remarkable gift for developing new holds 
    on old problems by shifting arguments and thought-experiments familiar in 
    one area to another where nobody has thought of applying them. 
    <p>
    His new book on consciousness, ''The Mysterious Flame,'' seems in places designed 
    to annoy professional philosophers. But it was not written for them. It is 
    an introductory, popular work, and its looseness and dash are excellent teachers, 
    constantly provoking questions and objections. It is a fast, straight route 
    into the ''mind-body problem'' for beginners -- while also containing a number 
    of original ideas. 
    <p>
    McGinn's central thesis is that the existence of consciousness in a material 
    world is a deep mystery that we will never unravel. Consciousness, he says, 
    is an entirely natural phenomenon; it is wholly based or ''rooted'' in the 
    physical brain from which it ''emerges.'' The trouble is that we are incapable 
    of understanding how this can be so, given the senses and the intellect with 
    which evolution has equipped us. 
    <p>
    It's not just that we don't understand it at present. McGinn argues that we 
    never will. How can conscious experience -- sensation, emotion, thought -- 
    arise from or subsist in ''mere'' matter, even brain matter? We know what 
    it's like to have conscious experience; we have it all the time, and the having 
    is the knowing. We also know a lot about brains. We have many techniques, 
    such as magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), 
    for inspecting them, and neurosurgeons routinely see conscious brains with 
    their own eyes (brain surgery does not require a general anesthetic). You 
    could see your own brain through a craniotomy, given a suitably angled set 
    of mirrors. You could sit in on your own operation and experience the problem 
    of consciousness directly: How can this warm, soft, wet, pulsing, whitish-gray 
    stuff be the locus of my consciousness -- of me -- of the very being of my 
    mind? It's just ''a hunk of meat,'' as McGinn puts it. 
    <p>
    The intuitive puzzle is clear, and McGinn presents it with multilayered intensity. 
    He is right that we can never hope to understand how consciousness as we know 
    it in everyday life relates to the brain considered as a lump of matter. But 
    it doesn't follow that consciousness is a mystery -- except insofar as everything 
    is. This move rests on a large assumption that is almost universally held, 
    although it is certainly false. 
    <p>
    This is the assumption that we have a pretty good understanding of the nature 
    of matter -- of matter in space -- of the physical in general. It is only 
    relative to this assumption that the existence of consciousness in a material 
    world seems mystifying. For what exactly is puzzling about consciousness, 
    once we put the assumption aside? We know just what it is like. Suppose you 
    have an experience of redness, or pain, and consider it just as such. There 
    doesn't seem to be any room for anything that could be called failure to understand 
    what it is. You know what it is. 
    <p>
    It is not consciousness that is puzzling, then, but matter. What the existence 
    of consciousness shows is that we have a profoundly inadequate grasp on the 
    nature of matter. McGinn agrees with this last point, in fact: with considerable 
    speculative panache, he develops the idea that there must be something deficient 
    in our idea of space, as well as in our idea of matter. But he still wants 
    to stress the mysteriousness of consciousness; to which the reply, once again, 
    is that we find consciousness mysterious only because we have a bad picture 
    of matter. 
    <p>
    Can anything be done? I think physics can help, by undermining features of 
    our picture of matter that make it appear so totally different from consciousness. 
    The first step is very simple: to begin with, perhaps, one takes it that matter 
    is simply solid stuff, uniform, non-particulate (the ultimate Norwegian cheese). 
    Then one learns that it is composed of distinct atoms -- solid particles that 
    cohere closely together to make up objects, but that have empty space (roughly 
    speaking) between them. Then one learns that these atoms are themselves made 
    up of tiny, separate particles, and full of empty space themselves. One learns 
    that matter is not at all what one thought. 
    <p>
    Now one may accept this while retaining the idea that matter is at root solid, 
    dense lumpen stuff, utterly different from consciousness. For so far this 
    picture preserves the idea that there are true particles of matter: tiny grainy 
    bits of ultimate stuff that are in themselves truly solid. And one may say 
    that only these, strictly speaking, are matter -- matter as such. But it's 
    been a long time since the 18th-century philosopher-chemist Joseph Priestley 
    pointed out that there are no scientific grounds for supposing that the fundamental 
    constituents of matter have any truly solid central part, and the picture 
    of grainy, inert particles has effectively disappeared in the strangenesses 
    of modern quantum theory and superstring theory. 
    <p>
    Current physics, then, thinks of matter as a thing of forces, energy, fields. 
    And it can also seem natural to think of consciousness as a form or manifestation 
    of energy, as a kind of force, and even, perhaps, as a kind of field. You 
    may still feel the two things are deeply heterogeneous, but you really have 
    no good reason to believe this. You just don't know enough about matter. When 
    McGinn speaks of the ''squishy'' brain, he vividly expresses part of our ordinary 
    idea of matter. But when physics inspects the volume of space-time occupied 
    by a brain, what does it find? It finds a vibrant play of energy, an astonishingly 
    insubstantial, radiant form. 
    <p>
    All this being so, do we have any good reason to think that we know anything 
    about the physical that legitimates surprise at the thought that consciousness 
    is itself wholly physical? We do not. And that is the first, crucial step 
    that one must take when facing up to the problem of consciousness. 
    <p>
    I'm not sure how much further we can go -- McGinn is right about the limits 
    on our understanding -- but the main problem lies in our understanding of 
    matter. We have a lot of mathematical equations describing the behavior of 
    matter, but we don't really know anything more about its intrinsic nature. 
    The only other clue that we have about its intrinsic nature, in fact, is that 
    when you arrange it in the way that it is arranged in things like brains, 
    you get consciousness. Perhaps Bertrand Russell was right when he conjectured, 
    more than 70 years ago, that ''we know nothing about the intrinsic quality 
    of physical events except when these are mental events that we directly experience.'' 
    <p>
    It is not easy to hold onto this line of thought (it requires a kind of meditative 
    effort), but it's the way to go, and all the elements needed to take it further 
    are available in ''The Mysterious Flame.'' It shows that there is nothing 
    to be surprised about when it comes to consciousness, although there is a 
    very great deal we don't understand. It deepens one's feeling for the material 
    world -- the only world there is. 
    <p>
    McGinn makes a few errors. He locates David Hume in the wrong century, and 
    credits him with a dictum that Aquinas got from Aristotle. He falls 2,000 
    years short when citing the view that ''God created the physical universe 
    some 4,000 years ago,'' and is tripped from behind by Steven Pinker, who praises 
    him for an ''explanation of consciousness that is . . . endlessly thought-provoking'' 
    on the dust jacket of a book devoted to showing that we cannot explain consciousness. 
    I think his central notion of explanation is mistaken, and disagree with his 
    claim that the problems posed by the notions of self, death and free will 
    are as intractable as the problem of understanding the relation between consciousness 
    and matter. But I do not think that there is any better introduction to the 
    problem of consciousness than this.

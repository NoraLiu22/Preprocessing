With its slow pacing and striking symbolism, Andrei Tarkovsky’s morose blend of sci-fi, political allegory and philosophical rumination invites many interpretations; undoubtedly, however, it concerns the necessity and difficulty of faith in a damaged and repressive world.</p>

<p>“The film that has most insistently found its way into my dreams. That lengthy trolley-car ride early on is like a ferry across the River Styx, or the moment in sleep between the real world blurring away and the appearance of the counterfeit images that our brains manifest. Only a director like Tarkovsky could take this mysterious, slumbering landscape and fill it with metaphysical currents; the result is that every pebble, blade of grass, bridge and power line seem like the fingers and toes of a sleeping giant.” <strong>David Heslin</strong></p>

<p>“A masterwork of pacing, elemental precision and breathtaking patience. One of the most beautiful films ever made.” <strong>Akira Mizuta LipPit</strong></p>

<p>“I know of no better film about the human soul.” <strong>Andreas Kilb</strong></p>

This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors. This electorate spans experimental, arthouse, mainstream and genre filmmakers from around the world.

That lengthy trolley-car ride early on is like a ferry across the River Styx, or the moment in sleep between the real world blurring away and the appearance of the counterfeit images that our brains manifest. Only a director like Tarkovsky could take this mysterious, slumbering landscape and fill it with metaphysical currents; the result is that every pebble, blade of grass, bridge and power line seem like the fingers and toes of a sleeping giant.” <strong>David Heslin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A masterwork of pacing, elemental precision and breathtaking patience.

Is it an uncompromisingly filmy film, like Metropolis, The Red Shoes, Vertigo, Lawrence of Arabia, or 81/2? Is it an anti-film, like Pink Flamingos? An eye-smacking visual and visceral feast – a Greenaway, an Almodovar, a Julia Ducournu? Should it be philosophically or socially unsettling, like a Goddard or a Mike Leigh, or beautiful and humane like a Max Ophuls? Does the dialogue dazzle with crystaline wit, as in All About Eve? Is it psychologically subtle and tense, in ways that satisfy and surprise, like The Servant, or M, or an Orson Welles? As a critic championing the new and the diverse, am I not obliged to include those most brilliant recent debuts burrowing beneath the lies of art and politics, like Residue by Merawi Gerima, or I Am Not A Witch by Rungano Nyoni? As I drafted and rehashed my choices, over a month of teeth-grinding tension, I hated the thought of simply perpetuating the great white canon. As the producer and host of feminist, multi-cultural podcast, What Goddeses Watch, shouldn't my choices have included more non-English-language films and womxn directors, like Andrea Arnold, Clio Barnard, Cathy Yan, Lynne Ramsay, the Wachowski sisters? As a writer, I'm ravished above all by a penetrating script. And as a performer, I'm in love with intelligent actors.

At some point, as you wade through the crashing glories of decades, countries and genres to reduce fifty to twenty to ten, excellence becomes arbitrary. And many of my favourite directors aren’t even here: Ozu, Herzog, Ophuls, Cassavetes, Sally Potter, Jonathan Glazer, Steve McQueen, Goddard.

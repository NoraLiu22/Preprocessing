For commercial speech to come within the First Amendment, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. Next, it must be determined whether the asserted governmental interest to be served by the restriction on commercial speech is substantial. If both inquires yield positive answers, it must then be decided whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.

Nor is appellant electrical utility's promotional advertising unprotected commercial speech merely because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area. Since monopoly over the supply of a product provides no protection from competition with substitutes for that product, advertising by utilities is just as valuable to consumers as advertising by unregulated firms, and there is no indication that appellant's decision to advertise was not based on the belief that consumers were interested in the advertising.

The State's further interest in preventing inequities in appellant's rates &mdash; based on the assertion that successful promotion of consumption in "off-peak" periods would create extra costs that would, because of appellant's rate structure, be borne by all consumers through higher overall rates &mdash; is also substantial. The latter interest does not, however, provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech because the link between the advertising prohibition and appellant's rate structure is, at most, tenuous.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="20" id="pa20"> The case presents the question whether a regulation of the Public Service Commission of the state of New York violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it completely bans promotional advertising by an electrical utility. </p> <h3> I</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22"> In December 1973, the Commission, appeals here, ordered electric utilities in New York State to cease all advertising that "promot[es] the use of electricity." App. to Juris. <span page-number="559" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p559"></span> Statement 31a. The order was based on the Commission's finding that "the interconnected utility system in New York State does not have sufficient fuel stocks or sources of supply to continue furnishing all customer demands for the 1973-1974 winter." <i>Id.</i>, at 26a. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="23" id="pa23"> Three years later, when the fuel shortage had eased, the Commission requested comments from the public on its proposal to continue the ban on promotional advertising. Central Hudson Gas Electric Corp., the appellant in this case, opposed the ban on First Amendment grounds. App. A10. After reviewing the public comments, the Commission extended the prohibition in a Policy Statement issued on February 25, 1977. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="24" id="pa24"> The Policy Statement divided advertising expenses "into two broad categories: promotional &mdash; advertising intended to stimulate the purchase of utility services &mdash; and institutional and informational, a broad category inclusive of all advertising not clearly intended to promote sales."<a note-disclosure="1" href="#7c310546-ba7f-49e8-a78f-06de4c99519c-fn1"></a> App. to Juris. Statement 35a. The Commission declared all promotional advertising contrary to the national policy of conserving energy. It acknowledged that the ban is not a perfect vehicle for conserving energy. For example, the Commissioner's order prohibits promotional advertising to develop consumption during periods when demand for electricity is low. By limiting growth in "off-peak" consumption, the ban limits the "beneficial side effects" of such growth in terms of more efficient use of existing powerplants. <i>Id.</i>, at 37a. And since oil dealers are not under the Commissioner's jurisdiction and <span page-number="560" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p560"></span> thus remain free to advertise, it was recognized that the ban can achieve only "piecemeal conservationism." Still, the Commission adopted the restriction because it was deemed likely to "result in some dampening of unnecessary growth" in energy consumption. <i>Ibid</i>.  </p><div note-container="1" id="7c310546-ba7f-49e8-a78f-06de4c99519c-fn1"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="25" id="pa25"> The dissenting opinion attempts to construe the Policy Statement to authorize advertising that would result "in a net energy savings" even if the advertising encouraged consumption of additional electricity. <i>Post</i>, at 604-605. The attempted construction fails, however, since the Policy Statement is phrased only in terms of advertising that promotes "the purchase of utility services" and "sales" of electricity. Plainly, the Commission did not intend to permit advertising that would enhance net energy efficiency by increasing consumption of electrical services.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="26" id="pa26"> The Commission's order explicitly permitted "informational" advertising designed to encourage " <i>shifts</i> of consumption" from peak demand times to periods of low electricity demand. <i>Ibid</i>. (emphasis in original). Information advertising would not seek to increase aggregate consumption, but would invite a leveling of demand throughout any given 24-hour period. The agency offered to review "specific proposals by the companies for specifically described [advertising] programs that meet these criteria." <i>Id.</i>, at 38a. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="27" id="pa27"> When it rejected requests for rehearing on the Policy Statement, the Commission supplemented its rationale for the advertising ban. The agency observed that additional electricity probably would be more expensive to produce than existing output. Because electricity rates in New York were not then based on marginal cost,<a note-disclosure="2" href="#307428fb-a975-4c90-a5ad-ef9de32073b4-fn2"></a> the Commission feared that additional power would be priced below the actual cost of generation. The additional electricity would be subsidized by all consumers through generally higher rates. <i>Id.</i>, at 57a-58a. The state agency also thought that promotional advertising would give "misleading signals" to the public by appearing to encourage energy consumption at a time when conservation is needed. <i>Id.</i>, at 59a.  </p><div note-container="2" id="307428fb-a975-4c90-a5ad-ef9de32073b4-fn2"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="28" id="pa28"> "Marginal cost" has been defined as the " <i>extra</i> or incremental cost of producing an <i>extra</i> unit of output." P. Samuelson, Economics 463 (10th ed. 1976) (emphasis in original).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="29" id="pa29"> Appellant challenged the order in state court, arguing that the Commission had restrained commercial speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.<a note-disclosure="3" href="#e5e43284-b976-4743-a11d-9ac4e6854222-fn3"></a> The Commission's <span page-number="561" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p561"></span> order was upheld by the trial court and at the intermediate appellate level.<a note-disclosure="4" href="#656c483b-86e4-424b-b0c9-99d758b47dcc-fn4"></a> The New York Court of Appeals affirmed. It found little value to advertising in "the noncompetitive market in which electric corporations operate." <i>Consolidated Edison Co</i>. v. <i>Public Service Comm'n</i>, <a href="/case/con-ed-v-public-serv-comm#p110" class="raw-ref">47 N.Y.2d 94, 110</a>, <a href="/case/con-ed-v-public-serv-comm#p757" class="raw-ref">390 N.E.2d 749, 757</a> (1979). Since consumers "have no choice regarding the source of their electric power," the court denied that "promotional advertising of electricity might contribute to society's interest in 'informed and reliable' economic decisionmaking." <i>Ibid</i>. The court also observed that by encouraging consumption, promotional advertising would only exacerbate the current energy situation. <i>Id.</i>, at 110, <a href="/case/con-ed-v-public-serv-comm#p758" class="raw-ref">390 N.E.2d, at 758</a>.

JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that the Commission's order reaches beyond commercial speech to suppress expression that is entitled to the full protection of the First Amendment. See <i>post</i>, at 580-581. We find no support for this claim in the record of this case. The Commission's Policy Statement excluded "institutional and informational" messages from the advertising ban, which was restricted to all advertising "clearly intended to promote sales." App. to Juris. Statement 35a. The complaint alleged only that the "prohibition of promotional advertising by Petitioner is not reasonable regulation of Petitioner's commercial speech. . . ." <i>Id.</i>, at 70a. Moreover, the state-court opinions and the arguments of the parties before this Court also viewed this litigation as involving only commercial speech. Nevertheless, the concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEVENS views the Commission's order as suppressing more than commercial speech because it would out-law, for example, advertising that promoted electricity consumption by touting the environmental benefits of such uses. See <i>post</i>, at 581. Page 563 Apparently the opinion would accord full First Amendment protection to all promotional advertising that includes claims "relating to . . . questions frequently discussed and debated by our political leaders." <i>Ibid</i>. <br> Although this approach responds to the serious issues surrounding our national energy policy as raised in this case, we think it would blur further the line the Court has sought to draw in commercial speech cases. It would grant broad constitutional protection to any advertising that links a product to a current public debate. But many, if not most, products may be tied to public concerns with the environment, energy, economic policy, or individual health and safety. We rule today in <i>Consolidated Edison Co</i>. v. <i>Public Service Comm'n, ante</i>, p. 530, that utilities enjoy the full panoply of First Amendment protections for their direct comments on public issues. There is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made only in the context of commercial transactions. In that context, for example, the State retains the power to "insur[e] that the stream of commercial information flow[s] cleanly as well as freely." <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i> v. <i>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council</i>, <a href="/case/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council-inc#p772" class="raw-ref">425 U.S. 748, 772</a> (1975). This Court's decisions on commercial expression have rested on the premise that such speech, although meriting some protection, is of less constitutional moment than other forms of speech. As we stated in <i>Ohralik</i>, the failure to distinguish between commercial and noncommercial speech "could invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the [First] Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech." <a href="/case/ohralik-v-ohio-state-bar-association#p456" class="raw-ref">436 U.S., at 456</a>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="36" id="pa36"> The First Amendment's concern for commercial speech is based on the informational function of advertising.

Consequently, there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity. The government may ban forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it, <i>Friedman</i> v. <i>Rogers, supra</i>, at 13, 15-16; <i>Ohralik</i> v. <i>Ohio State Bar Assn., supra</i>, at 464-465, or <span page-number="564" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p564"></span> commercial speech related to illegal activity, <i>Pittsburgh Press Co</i>. v. <i>Human Relations Comm'n</i>, <a href="/case/pittsburgh-press-co-v-human-rel-commn#p388" class="raw-ref">413 U.S. 376, 388</a> (1973).<a note-disclosure="6" href="#c76b0a97-f1ff-46e3-9314-a6820f1e5168-fn6"></a>  </p><div note-container="6" id="c76b0a97-f1ff-46e3-9314-a6820f1e5168-fn6"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="37" id="pa37"> In most other contexts, the First Amendment prohibits regulation based on the content of the message. <i>Consolidated Edison Co</i>. v. <i>Public Service Comm'n, ante</i>, at 537-540. Two features of commercial speech permit regulation of its content. First, commercial speakers have extensive knowledge of both the market and their products. Thus, they are well situated to evaluate the accuracy of their messages and the lawfulness of the underlying activity. <i>Bates</i> v. <i>State Bar of Arizona</i>, <a href="/case/bates-v-state-bar-of-arizona#p381" class="raw-ref">433 U.S. 350, 381</a> (1977). In addition, commercial speech, the offspring of economic self-interest, is a hardy breed of expression that is not "particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation." <i>Ibid</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="38" id="pa38"> If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the government's power is more circumscribed. The State must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech. Moreover, the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest. The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal. Compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria. First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose. Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="39" id="pa39"> Under the first criterion, the Court has declined to uphold regulations that only indirectly advance the state interest involved. In both <i>Bates</i> and <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i>, the Court concluded that an advertising ban could not be imposed to protect the ethical or performance standards of a profession. The Court noted in <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i> that "[t]he advertising ban does not directly affect professional standards one way or the other." <a href="/case/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council-inc#p769" class="raw-ref">425 U.S., at 769</a>.

At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest. </p> <h3> III</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="46" id="pa46"> We now apply this four-step analysis for commercial speech to the Commission's arguments in support of its ban on promotional advertising. </p> <h3> A</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="48" id="pa48"> The Commission does not claim that the expression at issue either is inaccurate or relates to unlawful activity. Yet the New York court of Appeals questioned whether Central Hudson's advertising is protected commercial speech. Because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area, the state court suggested that the Commission's order restricts no commercial speech of any worth. The court stated that advertising in a "noncompetitive market" <span page-number="567" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p567"></span> could not improve the decisionmaking of consumers. <a href="/case/con-ed-v-public-serv-comm#p110" class="raw-ref">47 N.Y.2d, at 110</a>, <a href="/case/con-ed-v-public-serv-comm#p757" class="raw-ref">390 N.E.2d, at 757</a>. The court saw no constitutional problem with barring commercial speech that it viewed as conveying little useful information. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="49" id="pa49"> The reasoning falls short of establishing that appellant's advertising is not commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. Monopoly over the supply of a product provides no protection from competition with substitutes for that product. Electric utilities compete with suppliers of fuel oil land natural gas in several markets, such as those for home heating and industrial power. This Court noted the existence of interfuel competition 45 years ago, see <i>West Ohio Gas Co</i>. v. <i>Public Utilities Comm'n</i>, <a href="/case/west-ohio-gas-co-v-commn-no-1#p72" class="raw-ref">294 U.S. 63, 72</a> (1935). Each energy source continues to offer peculiar advantages and disadvantages that may influence consumer choice. For consumers in those competitive markets, advertising by utilities is just as valuable as advertising by unregulated firms.<a note-disclosure="10" href="#0345b400-026a-42c4-91cf-592aa70117b8-fn10"></a>  </p><div note-container="10" id="0345b400-026a-42c4-91cf-592aa70117b8-fn10"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="50" id="pa50"> Several commercial speech decision have involved enterprises subject to extensive state regulation. <i>E. g., Friedman</i> v. <i>Rogers</i>, <a href="/case/friedman-v-rogers#p4" class="raw-ref">440 U.S. 1, 4-5</a> (1979) (optometrists); <i>Bates</i> v. <i>State Bar of Arizona</i>, <a href="/case/bates-v-state-bar-of-arizona" class="raw-ref">433 U.S. 350</a> (1977) (lawyers); <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i> v. <i>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, supra</i>, at 750-752 (pharmacists).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="51" id="pa51"> Even in monopoly markets, the suppression of advertising reduces the information available for consumer decisions and thereby defeats the purpose of the First Amendment. The New York court's argument appears to assume that the providers of a monopoly service or product are willing to pay for wholly ineffective advertising. Most businesses &mdash; even regulated monopolies &mdash; are unlikely to underwrite promotional advertising that is of no interest or use to consumers. Indeed, a monopoly enterprise legitimately may wish to inform the public that it has developed new services or terms of doing business. A consumer may need information to aid his decision whether or not to use the monopoly services at all, or how much of the service he should purchase. In the absence of factors that would distort the decision to advertise, we <span page-number="568" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p568"></span> may assume that the willingness of a business to promote its products reflects a belief that consumers are interested in the advertising.<a note-disclosure="11" href="#e3e0ec23-e4fb-4edc-98c1-48045ea55387-fn11"></a> Since no such extraordinary conditions have been identified in this case, appellant's monopoly position does not alter the First Amendment's protection for its commercial speech.  </p><div note-container="11" id="e3e0ec23-e4fb-4edc-98c1-48045ea55387-fn11"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="52" id="pa52"> There may be a greater incentive for a utility to advertise if it can use promotional expenses in determining its rate of return, rather than pass those costs on solely to shareholders. That practice, however, hardly distorts the economic decision whether to advertise. Unregulated businesses pass on promotional costs to consumers, and this Court expressly approved the practice for utilities in <i>West Ohio Gas Co</i>. v. <i>Public Utilities Comm'n</i>, <a href="/case/west-ohio-gas-co-v-commn-no-1#p72" class="raw-ref">294 U.S. 63 72</a> (1935).</p> </div> <h3> B</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="54" id="pa54"> The Commission offers two state interests as justifications for the ban on promotional advertising. The first concerns energy conservation. Any increase in demand for electricity &mdash; during peak or off-peak periods &mdash; means greater consumption of energy. The Commission argues, and the New York court agreed, that the State's interest in conserving energy is sufficient to support suppression of advertising designed to increase consumption of electricity. In view of our country's dependence on energy resources beyond our control, no one can doubt the importance of energy conservation. Plainly, therefore, the state interest asserted is substantial. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="55" id="pa55"> The Commission also argues that promotional advertising will aggravate inequities caused by the failure to base the utilities' rates on marginal cost. The utilities argued to the Commission that if they could promote the use of electricity in periods of low demand, they would improve their utilization of generating capacity. The Commission responded that promotion of off-peak consumption also would increase consumption during peak periods. If peak demand were to rise, the absence of marginal cost rates would mean that the rates charged for the additional power would not reflect the true costs of expanding production. Instead, the extra costs would <span page-number="569" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p569"></span> be borne by all consumers through higher overall rates. Without promotional advertising, the Commission stated, this inequitable turn of events would be less likely to occur. The choice among rate structures involves difficult and important questions of economic supply and distributional fairness.<a note-disclosure="12" href="#68844b35-ad8d-4595-8526-6819868bb63f-fn12"></a> The State's concern that rates be fair and efficient represents a clear and substantial governmental interest.  </p><div note-container="12" id="68844b35-ad8d-4595-8526-6819868bb63f-fn12"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="56" id="pa56"> See W. Jones, Regulated Industries 191-287 (2d ed. 1976).</p> </div> <h3> C</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="58" id="pa58"> Next, we focus on the relationship between the State's interests and the advertising ban. Under this criterion, the Commission's laudable concern over the equity and efficiency of appellant's rates does not provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech. The link between the advertising prohibition and appellant's rate structure is, at most, tenuous. The impact of promotional advertising on the equity of appellant's rates is highly speculative. Advertising to increase off-peak usage would have to increase peak usage, while other factors that directly affect the fairness and efficiency of appellant's rates remained constant. Such conditional and remote eventualities simply cannot justify silencing appellant's promotional advertising. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="59" id="pa59"> In contrast, the State's interest in energy conservation is directly advanced by the Commission order at issue here. There is an immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity. Central Hudson would not contest the advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sales. Thus, we find a direct link between the state interest in conservation and the Commission's order. </p> <h3> D</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="61" id="pa61"> We come finally to the critical inquiry in this case: whether the Commission's complete suppression of speech ordinarily protected by the First Amendment is no more extensive than <span page-number="570" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p570"></span> necessary to further the State's interest in energy conservation. The Commission's order reaches all promotional advertising, regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use. But the energy conservation rationale, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase in total energy use. In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately the State's interests. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="62" id="pa62"> Appellant insists that but for the ban, it would advertise products and services that use energy efficiently. These include the "heat pump," which both parties acknowledge to be a major improvement in electric heating, and the use of electric heat as a "backup" to solar and other heat sources. Although the Commission has questioned the efficiency of electric heating before this Court, neither the Commission's Policy Statement nor its order denying rehearing made findings on this issue. In the absence of authoritative findings to the contrary, we must credit as within the realm of possibility the claim that electric heat can be an efficient alternative in some circumstances. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="63" id="pa63"> The Commission's order prevents appellant from promoting electric services that would reduce energy use by diverting demand from less efficient sources, or that would consume roughly the same amount of energy as do alternative sources. In neither situation would the utility's advertising endanger conservation or mislead the public. To the extent that the Commission's order suppresses speech that in no way impairs the State's interest in energy conservation, the Commission's order violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and must be invalidated. See <i>First National Bank of Boston</i> v. <i>Bellotti</i>, <a href="/case/first-national-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti" class="raw-ref">435 U.S. 765</a> (1978). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="64" id="pa64"> The Commission also has not demonstrated that its interest in conservation cannot be protected adequately by more limited regulation of appellant's commercial expression. To further <span page-number="571" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p571"></span> its policy of conservation, the Commission could attempt to restrict the format and content of Central Hudson's advertising.

I am inclined to think that MR.

But even on the assumption that the Court is correct that the Commission's order reaches only commercial speech, I agree with MR.

I concur only in the Court's judgment, however, because I believe the test now evolved and applied by the Court is not consistent with our prior cases and does not provide adequate protection for truthful, nonmisleading, noncoercive commercial speech. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="92" id="pa92"> The Court asserts, <i>ante</i>, at 566, that "a four-part analysis has developed" from our decisions concerning commercial speech. Under this four-part test a restraint on commercial "communication [that] is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity" is subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny, and suppression is permitted whenever it "directly advances" a "substantial" governmental interest and is "not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest." <i>Ante</i>, at 564 and 566. I agree with the Court that this level of intermediate scrutiny is appropriate for a restraint on commercial speech designed to protect consumers from misleading or coercive speech, or a regulation related to the time, place, or manner of commercial speech. I do not agree, however, that the Court's four-part test is the proper one to be applied when a State seeks to suppress information about a product in order to manipulate a private economic decision that the State cannot or has not regulated or outlawed directly. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="93" id="pa93"> Since the Court, without citing empirical data or other authority, finds a "direct link" between advertising and energy consumption, it leaves open the possibility that the State may suppress advertising of electricity in order to lessen demand for electricity. I, of course, agree with the Court that, <span page-number="574" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p574"></span> in today's world, energy conservation is a goal of paramount national and local importance. I disagree with the Court, however, when it says that suppression of speech may be a permissible means to achieve that goal. MR. JUSTICE STEVENS appropriately notes: "The justification for the regulation is nothing more than the expressed fear that the audience may find the utility's message persuasive. Without the aid of any coercion, deception, or misinformation, truthful communication may persuade some citizens to consume more electricity than they otherwise would." <i>Post</i>, at 581. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="94" id="pa94"> The Court recognizes that we have never held that commercial speech may be suppressed in order to further the State's interest in discouraging purchases of the underlying product that is advertised. <i>Ante</i>, at 566, n. 9.

As the Court recognizes, the State's policy choices are insulated from the visibility and scrutiny that direct regulation would entail and the conduct of citizens is molded by the information that government chooses to give them. <i>Ante</i>, at 566, n. 9 ("We review with special care regulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a nonspeech-related policy.

We have not suggested that the "commonsense differences" between commercial speech and other speech justify relaxed scrutiny of restraints that suppress truthful, nondeceptive, noncoercive commercial speech. The differences articulated by the Court, See <i>ante</i>, at 564, n. 6, justify a more permissive approach to regulation of the manner of commercial speech for the purpose of protecting consumers from deception or coercion, and these differences explain why doctrines designed to prevent "chilling" of protected speech are inapplicable to commercial speech.

The order was issued by the Commission in 1973 in response to the Mideastern oil embargo crisis. It prohibits electric corporations "from <i>promoting</i> the use of electricity through the use of advertising, subsidy payments . . ., or employee incentives." State of New York Public Service Commission, Case No. 26532 (Dec. 5, 1973), App. to Juris. Statement 31a (emphasis added). Although the immediate crisis created by the oil embargo has subsided, the ban on promotional advertising remains in effect. The regulation was re-examined by the New York Public Service Commission in 1977. Its constitutionality was subsequently upheld by the New York Court of Appeals, which concluded that the paramount national interest in energy conservation justified its retention.<a note-disclosure="1" href="#fcd60d7a-1b0c-4413-af4c-8ae5663ac112-fn1"></a> <span page-number="584" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p584"></span>  </p><div note-container="1" id="fcd60d7a-1b0c-4413-af4c-8ae5663ac112-fn1"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="139" id="pa139"> The New York Court of Appeals stated: <br> "In light of current exigencies, one of the policies of any public service legislation must be the conservation of our vital and irreplaceable resources. The Legislature has but recently imposed upon the commission a duty 'to encourage all persons and corporations . . . to formulate and carry out long-range programs . . . [for] the preservation of environmental values and the conservation of natural resources' (Public Service Law, &sect; 5, subd. 2). Implicit in this amendment is a legislative recognition of the serious situation which confronts our State and Nation. More important, conservation of resources has become an avowed legislative Page 584 policy embodied in the commission's enabling act (see also, <i>Matter of New York State Council of Retail Merchants</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm. of State of N.

See, <i>e. g., Breard</i> v. <i>Alexandria</i>, <a href="/case/breard-v-alexandria" class="raw-ref">341 U.S. 622</a> (1951); <i>Valentine</i> v. <i>Chrestensen</i>, <a href="/case/valentine-v-chrestensen" class="raw-ref">316 U.S. 52</a> (1942). Given what seems to me full recognition of the holding of <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i> that commercial speech is entitled to some degree of First Amendment protection, I think the Court is nonetheless incorrect in invalidating the carefully considered state ban on promotional advertising in light of pressing national and state energy needs. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="141" id="pa141"> The Court's analysis in my view is wrong in several respects. Initially, I disagree with the Court's conclusion that the speech of a state-created monopoly, which is the subject of a comprehensive regulatory scheme, is entitled to protection under the First Amendment. I also think that the Court errs here in failing to recognize that the state law is most accurately viewed as an economic regulation and that the speech involved (if it falls within the scope of the First Amendment at all) occupies a significantly more subordinate position in the hierarchy of First Amendment values than the Court gives it today. Finally, the Court in reaching its decision improperly substitutes its own judgment for that of the State in deciding how a proper ban on promotional advertising should be drafted. With regard to this latter point, the Court adopts as its final part of a four-part test a "no more <span page-number="585" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p585"></span> extensive than necessary" analysis that will unduly impair a state legislature's ability to adopt legislation reasonably designed to promote interests that have always been rightly thought to be of great importance to the State. </p> <h3> I</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="143" id="pa143"> In concluding that appellant's promotional advertising constitutes protected speech, the Court reasons that speech by electric utilities is valuable to consumers who must decide whether to use the monopoly service or turn to an alternative energy source, and if they decide to use the service how much of it to purchase. <i>Ante</i>, at 567. The Court in so doing "assume[s] that the willingness of a business to promote its products reflects a belief that consumers are interested in the advertising." <i>Ante</i>, at 568. The Court's analysis ignores the fact that the monopoly here is entirely state-created and subject to an extensive state regulatory scheme from which it derives benefits as well as burdens. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="144" id="pa144"> While this Court has stated that the "capacity [of speech] for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source," <i>First National Bank of Boston</i> v. <i>Bellotti</i>, <a href="/case/first-national-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti#p777" class="raw-ref">435 U.S. 765, 777</a> (1978), the source of the speech nevertheless may be relevant in determining whether a given message is protected under the First Amendment.<a note-disclosure="2" href="#842a87f5-c8b6-4c93-93c3-d944ffe573f3-fn2"></a> When the source of the speech is a state-created monopoly such as this, traditional First Amendment concerns, if they come into play at all, certainly do not justify the board interventionist role adopted by the Court today.

As recognized in <i>Cantor</i> v. <i>Detroit Edison Co.</i>, <a href="/case/cantor-v-detroit-edison-co#p595" class="raw-ref">428 U.S. 579, 595-596</a> (1976), "public utility regulation typically <span page-number="587" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p587"></span> assumes that the private firm is a natural monopoly and that public controls are necessary to protect the consumer from exploitation." The consequences of this natural monopoly in my view justify much more wide-ranging supervision and control of a utility under the First Amendment than this Court held in <i>Bellotti</i> to be permissible with regard to ordinary corporations. Corporate status is generally conferred as a result of a State's determination that the corporate characteristics "enhance its efficiency as an economic entity." <i>First National Bank of Boston</i> v. <i>Bellotti, supra</i>, at 825-826 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). A utility, by contrast, fulfills a function that serves special public interests as a result of the natural monopoly of the service provided. Indeed, the extensive regulations governing decisionmaking by public utilities suggest that for purposes of First Amendment analysis, a utility is far closer to a state-controlled enterprise than is an ordinary corporation.<a note-disclosure="3" href="#e0ce9518-74da-4a81-828e-6efcd6cfd836-fn3"></a> Accordingly, I think a State has broad discretion in determining the statements that a utility may make in that such statements emanate from the entity created by the State to provide important and unique public services. And a state regulatory body charged with the oversight of these types of services may reasonably decide to impose on the utility a special duty to conform its conduct to <span page-number="588" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p588"></span> the agency's conception of the public interest. Thus I think it is constitutionally permissible for it to decide that promotional advertising is inconsistent with the public interest in energy conservation. I also think New York's ban on such advertising falls within the scope of permissible state regulation of an economic activity by an entity that could not exist in corporate form, say nothing of enjoy monopoly status, were it not for the laws of New York.<a note-disclosure="4" href="#c8dd959a-037d-4616-b25a-c8d0090db65e-fn4"></a>   </p><div note-container="3" id="e0ce9518-74da-4a81-828e-6efcd6cfd836-fn3"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="152" id="pa152"> In this regard the New York Court of Appeals stated: <br> "Public utilities, from the earliest days in this State, have been regulated and franchised to serve the commonweal.

I think it has also, by labeling economic regulation of business conduct as a restraint on "free speech," gone far to resurrect the discredited doctrine of cases such as <i>Lochner</i> and <i>Tyson Brother</i> v. <i>Banton</i>, <a href="/case/tyson-bro-united-theatre-ticket-offices-v-banton" class="raw-ref">273 U.S. 418</a> (1927). New York's order here is in my view more akin to an economic regulation to which virtually complete deference should be accorded by this Court. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="169" id="pa169"> I doubt there would be any question as to the constitutionality of New York's conservation effort if the Public Service Commission had chosen to raise the price of electricity, see, <i>e. g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co</i>. v. <i>Adkins</i>, <a href="/case/sunshine-coal-co-v-adkins" class="raw-ref">310 U.S. 381</a> (1940); <i>Old Dearborn Distributing Co</i>. v. <i>Seagram-Distillers Corp.</i>, <a href="/case/old-dearborn-co-v-seagram-corp" class="raw-ref">299 U.S. 183</a> (1936), to condition its sale on specified terms, see, <i>e. g., Nebbia</i> v. <i>New York, supra</i>, at 527-528, or to restrict its production, see, <i>e. g., Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn</i>, <a href="/case/wickard-v-filburn" class="raw-ref">317 U.S. 111</a> (1942). In terms of constitutional values, I think that such controls are virtually indistinguishable from the State's ban on promotional advertising. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="170" id="pa170"> An ostensible justification for striking down New York's ban on promotional advertising is that this Court has previously "rejected the 'highly paternalistic' view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech. '[P]eople will perceive their own best interests if <span page-number="592" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p592"></span> only they are well enough informed and . . . the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication, rather than to close them. . . .'" <i>Ante</i>, at 562. Whatever the merits of this view, I think the Court has carried its logic too far here. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="171" id="pa171"> The view apparently derives from the Court's frequent reference to the "marketplace of ideas," which was deemed analogous to the commercial market in which a laissez-faire policy would lead to optimum economic decisionmaking under the guidance of the "invisible hand." See, <i>e. g.</i>, Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations (1776). This notion was expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissenting opinion in <i>Abrams</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a href="/case/abrams-v-united-states#p630" class="raw-ref">250 U.S. 616, 630</a> (1919), wherein he stated that "the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market. . . ." See also, <i>e. g., Consolidated Edison</i> v. <i>Public Service Comm'n, ante</i>, at 534; J. Mill, On Liberty (1858); J. Milton, Areopagitica, A Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing (1644). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="172" id="pa172"> While it is true that an important objective of the First Amendment is to foster the free flow of information, identification of speech that falls within its protection is not aided by the metaphorical reference to a "marketplace of ideas." There is no reason for believing that the marketplace of ideas is free from market imperfections any more than there is to believe that the invisible hand will always lead to optimum economic decisions in the commercial market. See, <i>e. g.</i>, Baker, Scope of the First Amendment, Freedom of Speech, 25 UCLA L. Rev. 964, 967-981 (1978). Indeed, many types of speech have been held to fall outside the scope of the First Amendment, thereby subject to governmental regulation, despite this Court's references to a marketplace of ideas. See, <i>e. g., Chaplinsky</i> v. <i>New Hampshire</i>, <a href="/case/chaplinsky-v-state-of-new-hampshire" class="raw-ref">315 U.S. 568</a> (1942) (fighting words); <i>Beauharnais</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>, <a href="/case/beauharnais-v-illinois" class="raw-ref">343 U.S. 250</a> (1952) (group libel); <i>Roth</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a href="/case/roth-v-united-states-alberts-v-state-of-california" class="raw-ref">354 U.S. 476</a> (1957) (obscenity). It also has been held that the government has <span page-number="593" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p593"></span> a greater interest in regulating some types of protected speech than others. See, <i>e. g., FCC</i> v. <i>Pacifica Foundation</i>, <a href="/case/federal-communications-commission-v-pacifica-foundation" class="raw-ref">438 U.S. 726</a> (1978) (indecent speech); <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i> v. <i>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, supra</i> (commercial speech). And as this Court stated in <i>Gertz</i> v. <i>Robert Welch, Inc.</i>, <a href="/case/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc-8212-617#p344" class="raw-ref">418 U.S. 323, 344</a>, n. 9 (1974): "Of course, an opportunity for rebuttal seldom suffices to undo [the] harm of a defamatory falsehood. Indeed the law of defamation is rooted in our experience that the truth rarely catches up with a lie." The Court similarly has recognized that false and misleading commercial speech is not entitled to any First Amendment protection. See, <i>e. g., ante</i>, at 566. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="173" id="pa173"> The above examples illustrate that in a number of instances government may constitutionally decide that societal interests justify the imposition of restrictions on the free flow of information. When the question is whether a given commercial message is protected, I do not think this Court's determination that the information will "assist" consumers justifies judicial invalidation of a reasonably drafted state restriction on such speech when the restriction is designed to promote a concededly substantial state interest. I consequently disagree with the Court's conclusion that the societal interest in the dissemination of commercial information is sufficient to justify a restriction on the State's authority to regulate promotional advertising by utilities; indeed, in the case of a regulated monopoly, it is difficult for me to distinguish "society" from the state legislature and the Public Service Commission. Nor do I think there is any basis for concluding that individual citizens of the State will recognize the need for and act to promote energy conservation to the extent the government deems appropriate, if only the channels of communication are left open.<a note-disclosure="5" href="#d49b0e83-4c51-4a5e-949d-3dc9af2e58a2-fn5"></a> Thus, even if I were <span page-number="594" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p594"></span> to agree that commercial speech is entitled to some First Amendment protection, I would hold here that the State's decision to ban promotional advertising, in light of the substantial state interest at stake, is a constitutionally permissible exercise of its power to adopt regulations designed to promote the interests of its citizens.  </p><div note-container="5" id="d49b0e83-4c51-4a5e-949d-3dc9af2e58a2-fn5"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="174" id="pa174"> Although the Constitution attaches great importance to freedom of speech under the First Amendment so that individuals will be better informed and their thoughts and ideas will be uninhibited, it does not follow that "people will perceive their own best interests," or that if they do Page 594 they will act to promote them. With respect to governmental policies that do not offer immediate tangible benefits and the success of which depends on incremental contributions by all members of society, such as would seem to be the case with energy conservation, a strong argument can be made that while a policy may be in the longrun interest of all members of society, some rational individuals will perceive it to their own shortrun advantage to not act in accordance with that policy. When the regulation of commercial speech is at issue, I think this is a consideration that the government may properly take into account. As was observed in <i>Townsend</i> v. <i>Yeomans</i>, <a href="/case/townsend-v-yeomans#p451" class="raw-ref">301 U.S. 441, 451</a> (1937), "the legislature, acting within its sphere, is presumed to know the needs of the people of the State." This observation in my view is applicable to the determination of the State Public Service Commission here.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="175" id="pa175"> The plethora of opinions filed in this case highlights the doctrinal difficulties that emerge from this Court's decisions granting First Amendment protection to commercial speech. My Brother STEVENS, quoting Mr. Justice Brandeis in <i>Whitney</i> v. <i>California</i>, <a href="/case/whitney-v-people-of-state-of-california#p376" class="raw-ref">274 U.S. 357, 376-377</a> (1927), includes Mr. Justice Brandeis' statement that "[t]hose who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They did not fear political change. They did not exalt order at the cost of liberty." <i>Ante</i>, at 582. MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, in his separate opinion, joins only in the Court's judgment because he believes that the Court's opinion "does not provide adequate protection for truthful, nonmisleading, noncoercive commercial speech." <i>Ante</i>, at 573. Both MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, <i>ante</i>, at 582, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, <i>ante</i>, at 577, would apply the following formulation by Mr. Justice Brandeis of the clear-and-present-danger test to the regulation of speech at issue in this case: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="176" id="pa176">  <blockquote id="bq177" bq-id="177"> "If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood <span page-number="595" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p595"></span> and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. Only an emergency can justify repression." <i>Whitney</i> v. <i>California, supra</i>, at 377 (concurring opinion).</blockquote>  </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="178" id="pa178"> Although the Court today does not go so far as to adopt this position, its reasons for invalidating New York's ban on promotional advertising make it quite difficult for a legislature to draft a statute regulating promotional advertising that will satisfy the First Amendment requirements established by the Court in this context. See Part III, <i>infra</i>. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="179" id="pa179"> Two ideas are here at war with one another, and their resolution, although it be on a judicial battlefield, will be a very difficult one. The sort of "advocacy" of which Mr. Justice Brandeis spoke was not the advocacy on the part of a utility to use more of its product. Nor do I think those who won our independence, while declining to "exalt order at the cost of liberty," would have viewed a merchant's unfettered freedom to advertise in hawking his wares as a "liberty" not subject to extensive regulation in light of the government's substantial interest in attaining "order" in the economic sphere. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="180" id="pa180"> While I agree that when the government attempts to regulate speech of those expressing views on public issues, the speech is protected by the First Amendment unless it presents "a clear and present danger" of a substantive evil that the government has a right to prohibit, see, <i>e. g., Schenck</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a href="/case/schenck-v-united-states-baer-v-same#p52" class="raw-ref">249 U.S. 47, 52</a> (1919), I think it is important to recognize that this test is appropriate in the political context in light of the central importance of such speech to our system of self-government. As observed in <i>Buckley</i> v. <i>Valeo</i>, <a href="/case/buckley-v-valeo#p14" class="raw-ref">424 U.S. 1, 14</a> (1976): </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="181" id="pa181">  <blockquote id="bq182" bq-id="182"> "Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution. The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to <span page-number="596" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p596"></span> such political expression in order 'to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.'"</blockquote>  </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="183" id="pa183"> And in <i>Garrison</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>, <a href="/case/garrison-v-louisiana#p74" class="raw-ref">379 U.S. 64, 74-75</a> (1964), this Court stated that "speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government." </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="184" id="pa184"> The First Amendment, however, does not always require a clear and present danger to be present before the government may regulate speech. Although First Amendment protection is not limited to the "exposition of ideas" on public issues, see, <i>e. g., Winters</i> v. <i>New York</i>, <a href="/case/winters-v-new-york#p510" class="raw-ref">333 U.S. 507, 510</a> (1948) &mdash; both because the line between the informing and the entertaining is elusive and because art, literature, and the like may contribute to important First Amendment interests of the individual in freedom of speech &mdash; it is well established that the government may regulate obscenity even though its does not present a clear and present danger. Compare, <i>e. g., Paris Adult Theatre I</i> v. <i>Slaton</i>, <a href="/case/paris-adult-theatre-i-v-slaton#p57" class="raw-ref">413 U.S. 49, 57-58</a> (1973), with <i>Brandenburg</i> v. <i>Ohio</i>, <a href="/case/brandenburg-v-ohio#p447" class="raw-ref">395 U.S. 444, 447</a> (1969). Indecent speech, at least when broadcast over the airwaves, also may be regulated absent a clear and present danger of the type described by Mr. Justice Brandeis and required by this Court in <i>Brandenburg. FCC</i> v. <i>Pacifica Foundation</i>, <a href="/case/federal-communications-commission-v-pacifica-foundation" class="raw-ref">438 U.S. 726</a> (1978). And in a slightly different context this Court declined to apply the clear-and-present-danger test to a conspiracy among members of the press in violation of the Sherman Act because to do so would "degrade" that doctrine. <i>Associated Press</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a href="/case/associated-press-v-united-states-tribune-co-v-same-united-states-v-associated-press#p7" class="raw-ref">326 U.S. 1, 7</a> (1945). Nor does the Court today apply the clear-and-present-danger test in invalidating New York's ban on promotional advertising. As noted above, in these and other contexts the Court has clearly rejected the notion that there must be a free "marketplace of ideas." </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="185" id="pa185"> If the complaint of those who feel the Court's opinion does not go far enough is that the "only test of truth is its ability <span page-number="597" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p597"></span> to get itself accepted in the marketplace of ideas" &mdash; the test advocated by Thomas Jefferson in his first inaugural address, and by Mr. Justice Holmes in <i>Abrams</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a href="/case/abrams-v-united-states#p630" class="raw-ref">250 U.S. 616, 630</a> (1919) (dissenting opinion) &mdash; there is no reason whatsoever to limit the protection accorded commercial speech to "truthful, nonmisleading, noncoercive" speech. See <i>ante</i>, at 573 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment). If the "commercial speech" is in fact misleading, the "marketplace of ideas" will in time reveal that fact. It may not reveal it sufficiently soon to avoid harm to numerous people, but if the reasoning of Brandeis and Holmes is applied in this context, that was one of the risks we took in protecting free speech in a democratic society. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="186" id="pa186"> Unfortunately, although the "marketplace of ideas" has a historically and sensibly defined context in the world of political speech, it has virtually none in the realm of business transactions. Even so staunch a defender of the First Amendment as Mr. Justice Black, in his dissent in <i>Breard</i> v. <i>Alexandria</i>, <a href="/case/breard-v-alexandria#p650" class="raw-ref">341 U.S., at 650</a>, n., stated: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="187" id="pa187">  <blockquote id="bq188" bq-id="188"> "Of course I believe that the present ordinance could constitutionally be applied to a 'merchant' who goes from door to door 'selling pots.'"</blockquote>  </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="189" id="pa189"> And yet, with the change in solicitation and advertising techniques, the line between what Central Hudson did here and the peddler selling pots in Alexandria a generation ago is difficult, if not impossible to fix. Doubtless that was why Mr. Justice Black joined the unanimous opinion of the Court in <i>Valentine</i> v. <i>Chrestensen</i>, <a href="/case/valentine-v-chrestensen#p54" class="raw-ref">316 U.S., at 54</a>, in which the Court stated: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="190" id="pa190">  <blockquote id="bq191" bq-id="191"> "This court has unequivocally held that the streets are proper places for the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion and that, though the states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest, they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in these public <span page-number="598" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p598"></span> thoroughfares. <i>We are equally clear that the Constitution</i> <i>imposes no such restraint on government as respects</i> <i>purely commercial advertising</i>. Whether, and to what extent, one may promote or pursue a gainful occupation in the streets, to what extent such activity shall be adjudged a derogation of the public right of user, are matters for legislative judgment." (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>  </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="192" id="pa192"> I remain of the view that the Court unlocked a Pandora's Box when it "elevated" commercial speech to the level of traditional political speech by according it First Amendment protection in <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i> v. <i>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council</i>, <a href="/case/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council-inc" class="raw-ref">425 U.S. 748</a> (1976). The line between "commercial speech," and the kind of speech that those who drafted the First Amendment had in mind, may not be a technically or intellectually easy one to draw, but it surely produced far fewer problems than has the development of judicial doctrine in this area since <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i>. For in the world of political advocacy and <i>its</i> marketplace of ideas, there is no such thing as a "fraudulent" idea: there may be useless proposals, totally unworkable schemes, as well as very sound proposals that will receive the imprimatur of the "marketplace of ideas" through our majoritarian system of election and representative government. The free flow of information is important in this context not because it will lead to the discovery of any objective "truth," but because it is essential to our system of self-government. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="193" id="pa193"> The notion that more speech is the remedy to expose falsehood and fallacies is wholly out of place in the commercial bazaar, where if applied logically the remedy of one who was defrauded would be merely a statement, available upon request, reciting the Latin maxim <i>"caveat emptor."</i> But since "fraudulent speech" in this area is to be remediable under <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board, supra</i>, the remedy of one defrauded is a lawsuit or an agency proceeding based on common-law notions of fraud that are separated by a world of difference <span page-number="599" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p599"></span> from the realm of politics and government. What time, legal decisions, and common sense have so widely severed, I declined to join in <i>Virginia Pharmacy Board</i>, and regret now to see the Court reaping the seeds that it there sowed. For in a democracy, the economic is subordinate to the political, a lesson that our ancestors learned long ago, and that our descendants will undoubtedly have to relearn many years hence. </p> <h3> III</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="195" id="pa195"> The Court concedes that the state interest in energy conservation is plainly substantial, <i>ante</i>, at 568, as is the State's concern that its rates be fair and efficient. <i>Ante</i>, at 569. It also concedes that there is a direct link between the Commission's ban on promotional advertising and the State's interest in conservation. <i>Ibid</i>. The Court nonetheless strikes down the ban on promotional advertising because the Commission has failed to demonstrate, under the final part of the Court's four-part test, that its regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve the State's interest. <i>Ante</i>, at 569-571. In reaching this conclusion, the Court conjures up potential advertisements that a utility might make that conceivably would result in net energy savings. The Court does not indicate that the New York Public Service Commission has in fact construed its ban on "promotional" advertising to preclude the dissemination of information that clearly would result in a net energy savings, nor does it even suggest that the Commission has been confronted with and rejected such an advertising proposal.<a note-disclosure="6" href="#e34cc828-c98e-42da-93c3-6d9cdfacd42c-fn6"></a> The final part of the Court's test <span page-number="600" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p600"></span> thus leaves room for so many hypothetical "better" ways that any ingenious lawyer will surely seize on one of them to secure the invalidation of what the state agency actually did. As MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN observed in <i>Illinois Elections Bd</i>. v. <i>Socialist Workers Party</i>, <a href="/case/illinois-state-board-of-elections-v-socialist-workers-party#p188" class="raw-ref">440 U.S. 173, 188-189</a> (1979) (concurring opinion):  </p><div note-container="6" id="e34cc828-c98e-42da-93c3-6d9cdfacd42c-fn6"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="196" id="pa196"> Indeed appellee in its brief states: <br> "[N]either Central Hudson nor any other party made an attempt before the Commission to demonstrate or argue for a specific advertising strategy that would avoid the difficulties that the Commission found inherent in electric utility promotional advertising.

More important, any increase in off-peak generation from most of the major companies producing electricity in this State would not, at this time, be produced from coal or nuclear resources, but would require the use of oil-fired generating facilities. The increased requirement for fuel oil to serve the incremental off-peak load created by promotional advertising would aggravate the nation's already unacceptably high level of dependence on foreign sources of supply and would, in addition, frustrate rather than encourage conservation efforts."

As we pointed out in our Policy Statement, increases in generation, even off-peak generation, at this time, requires the burning of scarce oil resources.

The Court's reasoning in this regard, however, is highly speculative. The Court provides two examples that it claims support its conclusion. It first states that both parties acknowledge that the "heat pump" will be "a major improvement in electric heating," and that but for the ban the utilities would advertise this type of "energy efficien[t]" product.<a note-disclosure="9" href="#a7c17ac7-bf33-4918-b779-4fff1ae312f5-fn9"></a> The New York Public Service Commission, however, considered the merits of the heat pump and concluded that it would most likely result in an overall increase in electric energy consumption.

The electric heat pump, he continued, "normally carr[ies] with it air conditioning in the summer, and the commission found that this would result in air conditioning that would not otherwise happen." <i>Id.</i>, at 33. This is but one example of the veritable Sargasso Sea of difficult nonlegal issues that we wade into by adopting a rule that requires judges to evaluate highly complex and often controversial questions arising in disciplines quite foreign to ours.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="210" id="pa210">  <blockquote id="bq211" bq-id="211"> "[I]nstallation of a heat pump means also installation of central air-conditioning.

And the price of electricity to most consumers in the State does not now fully reflect the much higher marginal costs of on-peak consumption in summer peaking markets. In these circumstances, there would be a subsidization of consumption on-peak, and consequently, higher rates for all consumers." App. to Juris.

The Court fails to establish, however, that an advertising proposal of this sort was properly presented to the Commission. Indeed, the Court's concession that the Commission did not make findings on this issue suggests that the Commission did not even consider it. Nor does the Court rely on any support for its assertion other than the assertion of appellant. Rather, it speculates that "[i]n the absence of authoritative findings to the contrary, we must credit as within the realm of possibility the claim that electric heat can be an efficient alternative in some circumstances." <i>Ibid</i>.<a note-disclosure="10" href="#be5c9abd-74ad-4396-9016-93089b8073d5-fn10"></a>  </p><div note-container="10" id="be5c9abd-74ad-4396-9016-93089b8073d5-fn10"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="214" id="pa214"> Even assuming the Court's speculation is correct, it has shown too little. For the regulation to truly be "no more extensive than necessary," it must be established that a more efficient energy source will serve only as a means for saving energy, rather than as an inducement to consume more energy because the cost has decreased or because other energy using products will be used in conjunction with the more efficient one.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="215" id="pa215"> Ordinarily it is the role of the State Public Service Commission to make factual determinations concerning whether a device or service will result in a net energy savings and, if so, whether and to what extent state law permits dissemination of information about the device or service. Otherwise, <span page-number="604" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p604"></span> as here, this Court will have no factual basis for its assertions. And the State will never have an opportunity to consider the issue and thus to construe its law in a manner consistent with the Federal Constitution. As stated in <i>Barrows</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>, <a href="/case/barrows-v-jackson-2#p256" class="raw-ref">346 U.S. 249, 256-257</a> (1953): </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="216" id="pa216">  <blockquote id="bq217" bq-id="217"> "It would indeed be undesirable for this Court to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.

The terms of the order of the New York Public Service Commission in my view indicate that advertising designed to promote net savings in energy use does not fall within the scope of the ban. The order prohibits electric corporations "from <i>promoting the use of electricity</i> through the use of advertising, subsidy payments . . ., or employee incentives." App. to Juris. Statement 31a (emphasis added). It is not clear to me that advertising that is likely to result in net savings of energy is advertising that "promot[es] the use of electricity," nor does the Court point to any language in the Commission order that suggests it has adopted this construction. Rather, it would seem more accurate to characterize such advertising as designed to "discourage" the use of electricity.<a note-disclosure="11" href="#94ce004a-d0dd-49ac-af22-ff2052c3d6fe-fn11"></a> Indeed, I think it is quite likely that the Commission <span page-number="605" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p605"></span> would view advertising that would clearly result in a net savings in energy as consistent with the objectives of its order and therefore permissible.<a note-disclosure="12" href="#2d24821d-df5c-4dca-8cac-fb67a0ca595f-fn12"></a> The Commission, for example, has authorized the dissemination of information that would result in <i>shifts</i> in electrical energy demand, thereby reducing the demand for electricity during peak periods. <i>Id.</i>, at 37a.<a note-disclosure="13" href="#2a7692f0-e567-4d8e-b35c-3722682135ef-fn13"></a> It has also indicated a willingness to consider at least some other types of "specific proposals" submitted by utilities. <i>Id.</i>, at 37a-38a. And it clearly permits informational as opposed to promotional dissemination of information. <i>Id.</i>, at 43a-46a. Even if the Commission were ultimately to reject the view that its ban on promotional advertising does not include advertising that results in net energy savings, I think the Commission should at least be given an opportunity to consider it.    </p><div note-container="11" id="94ce004a-d0dd-49ac-af22-ff2052c3d6fe-fn11"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="219" id="pa219"> This characterization is supported by the reasoning of the New York Court of Appeals, which stated: <br> "[P]romotional advertising . . . seeks . . . to encourage the increased consumption of electricity, whether during peak hours or off-peak hours. Thus, not only does such communication lack any beneficial informative content, but it may be affirmatively detrimental to the society. . . . Conserving diminishing resources is a matter of vital State concern and increased use of electrical energy is inimical to our interests. Promotional advertising, if permitted, would only serve to exacerbate the crisis." <a href="/case/con-ed-v-public-serv-comm#p110" class="raw-ref">47 N.Y.2d, at 110</a>, <a href="/case/con-ed-v-public-serv-comm#p757" class="raw-ref">390 N.E.2d, at 757-758</a>.</p> </div><div note-container="12" id="2d24821d-df5c-4dca-8cac-fb67a0ca595f-fn12"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="220" id="pa220"> At oral argument counsel for appellant conceded that the ban would not apply to utility advertising promoting the nonuse of electricity. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. Indeed, counsel stated: "If the use reduces the amount of electricity used, it is not within the ban. The promotional ban is defined as anything which might be expected to increase the use of electricity." <i>Ibid</i>. And counsel for appellee stated that "the only thing that is involved here is the promotion by advertising of electric usage." <i>Id.</i>, at 30. "And if a showing can be made that promotion in fact is going to conserve energy," counsel for appellee continued, "which . . . has never been made to us, the commission's order says we are ready to relax our ban, we're not interested in banning for the sake of banning it. We think that is basically a bad idea, if we can avoid it. In gas, we have been relaxing it as more gas has become available." <i>Id.</i>, at 40.</p> </div><div note-container="13" id="2a7692f0-e567-4d8e-b35c-3722682135ef-fn13"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="221" id="pa221"> By contrast, as previously discussed, the Public Service Commission does not permit the promotion of off-peak consumption alone. <i>Supra</i>, at 600-601, and n. 8.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="222" id="pa222"> It is in my view inappropriate for the Court to invalidate the State's ban on commercial advertising here, based on its speculation that in some cases the advertising may result in a net savings in electrical energy use, and in the cases in which it is clear a net energy savings would result from utility advertising, the Public Service Commission would apply its <span page-number="606" pagination-id="447 U.S. 557" id="p606"></span> ban so as to proscribe such advertising. Even assuming that the Court's speculation is correct, I do not think it follows that facial invalidation of the ban is the appropriate course. As stated in <i>Parker</i> v. <i>Levy</i>, <a href="/case/parker-v-levy#p760" class="raw-ref">417 U.S. 733, 760</a> (1974), "even if there are marginal applications in which a statute would infringe on First Amendment values, facial invalidation is inappropriate if the 'remainder of the statute . . . covers a whole range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable . . . conduct. . . .' <i>CSC</i> v. <i>Letter Carriers</i>, <a href="/case/csc-v-letter-carriers#p580" class="raw-ref">413 U.S. 548, 580-581</a> (1973)."

Extension offices across the country are dependent upon our volunteers. Volunteers allow extension offices to expand their outreach by bringing science-based recommendations into our community by supporting the county extension agents. Our volunteers primarily include 4-H Youth Development, Master Gardener, and Money Mentor Volunteers. In FY 22-23, Nassau County volunteers provided 6,271 volunteer hours to the community – that equates to a $165,052 value to Nassau County residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are undoubtedly grateful to every volunteer who helps support UF/IFAS Extension. Without them, our overall county impacts would be remarkably less. Are you interested in becoming an extension volunteer?

The main reason you will want to attend this program is to learn about the pros and cons of seven different varieties of forage clovers.

Extension offices across the country are dependent upon our volunteers. Volunteers allow extension offices to expand their outreach by bringing science-based recommendations into our community by supporting the county extension agents.

In FY 22-23, Nassau County volunteers provided 6,271 volunteer hours to the community – that equates to a $165,052 value to Nassau County residents.\nWe are undoubtedly grateful to every volunteer who helps support UF/IFAS Extension. Without them, our overall county impacts would be remarkably less. Are you interested in becoming an extension volunteer? If so, reach out to our office and we can help provide you with more information.\nSummertime is right around the corner.

The main reason you will want to attend this program is to learn about the pros and cons of seven different varieties of forage clovers. For the past two years, we have been testing these varieties and we are excited to share our results as well as summarize results from other producers in the area.

Learning showmanship helps young people communicate better, with clarity, engagement, and the ability to captivate an audience.\nEncouraging Creative Expression: Showmanship allows kids to express themselves creatively. Whether it’s acting, dancing, or singing, they can explore their talents and emotions in a supportive environment, fostering creativity and imagination.\nA young 4-H’er preparing to talk to the judge about her project.\nPromoting Teamwork: Many showmanship activities, like theater or musical performances, require teamwork. Youngsters learn to collaborate, compromise, and support each other, developing essential life skills such as leadership and cooperation.\nBuilding Resilience: Showmanship often involves facing challenges, like stage fright or criticism. By overcoming these obstacles, young people learn resilience, the value of hard work, and the importance of continuous improvement.\nFostering Cultural Understanding: Exposure to different forms of showmanship introduces youngsters to diverse cultures and perspectives, fostering empathy and respect for others.\nFacilitating Personal Growth: Showmanship provides opportunities for self-discovery. Young people learn about their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and passions as they explore different roles and performance styles.\nIn summary, teaching showmanship to young people offers numerous benefits that go beyond the stage, equipping them with essential skills and qualities for success in various aspects of life.\nFor more information about showmanship or any of our 4-H programs contact us at the extension office at telephone 321-633-1702.\nSources:\nMontana Extension Showmanship Guide: https://www.montana.edu/extension/dawson/documents/Small%20Animal%20Showmanship.pdf\n4-H Youth Poultry Showmanship video from Florida 4-H: https://youtu.be/FbNnNq0Crvs?si=iz-AxzlB0ckErYPm","dc:creator":"Gus Koerner","content":"A common theme or goal of all our 4-H youth development programs is to teach and reinforce skills in public speaking and showmanship.

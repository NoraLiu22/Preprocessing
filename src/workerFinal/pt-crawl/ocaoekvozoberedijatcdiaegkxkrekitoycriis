/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: An interview by Sarah 
          A. Tooley printed in the February 1894 number of <u>Humanitarian</u>. 
          Original pagination indicated within double brackets. To link directly

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 81]]</font> The great 
          scientist, Dr. Wallace, who as an original thinker on the subject of 
          natural selection stands unrivalled save by Darwin, lives in a charming 
          villa at Parkstone, near Bournemouth, the windows of which command a 
          lovely view across the sea to Corfe Castle and the distant Purbeck Hills. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One may claim to be excused a feeling of diffidence 
          in approaching a specialist upon so complex a subject as Heredity, but 
          like all truly great minds, Dr. Wallace is free of awe-inspiring attitudes, 
          and one falls quietly and naturally into the position of scholar at 
          the feet of a master. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;With regard to the subject of Heredity, Dr. Wallace, 
          would you explain, taking into consideration your contention that individually 
          acquired characters are not transmitted from parent to child, whether 
          the imitative faculty of children may not bring about the same result?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That is exactly our point. All that has been imputed 
          to the hereditary influences of acquired character is either the result 
          of imitation or it is the transmission of inherent idiosyncrasies. It 
          is first necessary to understand clearly what is meant by 'acquired 
          characters,' and the mistake must not be made of taking any peculiarity 
          that a person may exhibit during life to be an 'acquired character.' 
          Such peculiarities are usually inherited from some ancestor. Even those 
          peculiar tricks of motion or habits which are often adduced as proofs 
          of the transmission of an acquired character, are really only the transmission 
          of the minute peculiarities of physical structure, and nervous or cerebral 
          co-ordination, which led to the habit in question being acquired by 
          the parent or ancestor, and, under similar conditions, by his descendant. 
          Both Weismann and Mr. Francis Galton,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> through 
          their inquiries into the evidence for the transmission of acquired <font color="990000">[[p. 
          82]]</font> characters, have found that hardly any real evidence exists, 
          and that in most cases which appeared to prove it, either the facts 
          were not accurately stated, or another interpretation could be given 
          to them. It is only during the last ten years that this view has been 
          advanced. The transmission of acquired characters had hitherto been 
          assumed, because it appeared so natural and probable; but in science 
          we require not probability only, but proof.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You believe then, Dr. Wallace, that there is no 
          direct proof of individually acquired characters being inherited?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My conclusion is that no case has yet been made 
          out for this assumption, and that variation and natural selection are 
          fully adequate to account for the various modifications of organisms 
          which occur. The balance of opinion amongst physiologists now seems 
          to be against the heredity of any qualities acquired by the individual 
          after birth, notwithstanding that it is contrary to the theory of Pangenesis, 
          advanced by Darwin, and supported by his great reputation. The biologists 
          of Europe are now earnestly seeking for facts which shall serve as crucial 
          tests of the rival theories. Now, such an experiment as this might be 
          tried: bring up a number of dove-cote pigeons in a large area covered 
          in with wire netting, so low as to prevent flight, at the same time 
          encouraging running by placing food always at the two extremities of 
          the enclosure only, or in some way ensuring the greatest amount of use 
          of the legs. After two or three generations had been brought up this 
          way, the latest might be turned out among other dove-cote pigeons, at 
          the age when they would normally begin to fly, and it would then be 
          seen if the diminished wing-power and increased leg-power of the parents 
          were inherited.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But take examples which can be tested by general 
          knowledge and experience. If long continued exercise, in one direction, 
          leads to increased strength or skill in the parent, as in the case of 
          a blacksmith, a carpenter, or a watchmaker, we ought, supposing that 
          acquired characters can be transmitted, to see evidence of this in the 
          children of these mechanics, and the younger sons should have more strength 
          and skill in their father's business than the first-born; but so far 
          as I know, this has never been alleged.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So with men of genius, whose mental faculties have 
          been exercised in special directions; if not only the inherent faculty, 
          but also the increased power derived from its exercise be inherited, 
          then we ought frequently to see these faculties continuously increasing 
          during a series of generations, culminating in a star of the first magnitude. 
          But the very reverse of this is notoriously the case. Not only is it 
          the fact <font color="990000">[[p. 83]]</font> that men of genius do 
          not as a rule have adequate successors in their children, but it is 
          a remarkable circumstance that almost all our greatest inventors, and 
          scientific discoverers, the men whose originality and mental power have 
          created landmarks in the history of human progress, have been self-taught, 
          and have not derived anything from the training of their ancestors in 
          their several departments of knowledge. Watt, Brindley, Faraday, Sir 
          William Herschel, and George Stephenson, are cases in point: indeed, 
          one might fill a volume with examples to prove, what is indeed seldom 
          denied, that genius or super-excellence in any department of human faculty 
          tends to be sporadic--that is, it appears suddenly without any proportionate 
          development in the parents or immediate ancestors of the gifted individual.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But surely, Dr. Wallace, genius is inherited.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Certainly it is; but it rarely or never intensifies 
          after its first appearance, which it certainly would do if not only 
          the genius itself, but the increased mental power due to its exercise 
          were also inherited. If acquired characters are inherited, the <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic"><i>youngest</i> 
          </font>sons of every artist, musician or man of science should be the 
          greatest genius. The only prominent example that looks like a progressive 
          increase of faculty for three generations is that of Dr. Erasmus Darwin 
          and his grandson, Charles Darwin. But in this case the special faculties 
          displayed by the grandson were quite distinct from those of the grandfather 
          and father; while, if we consider the different state of knowledge at 
          the time when Erasmus Darwin lived, his occupation in a laborious profession, 
          and the absence of that stimulus to thought which the five years' voyage 
          round the world gave to his grandson, it is not at all certain that 
          in originality and mental powers, the former was not fully the equal 
          of the latter.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If we look through the copious roll of men of genius 
          in science, in literature and in art, we shall rarely find even two 
          of the same name and profession, and never three or four, rising progressively 
          to loftier heights of genius and fame. Note also that the highest water 
          mark reached by the ancients in art and philosophy has never been surpassed. 
          In art, the Greeks attained to a degree of beauty and harmony that has 
          never been equalled in modern times. In literature the 'Iliad' of Homer 
          and the writings of Plato will rank with the noblest work of modern 
          authors. All the accumulated effort of thousands of years has not made 
          us greater men, intellectually, than the ancients, clearly proving that 
          there has not been a continuously progressive development in the race.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But are not education and good environment, the 
          two things <font color="990000">[[p. 84]]</font> which all modern reformers 
          are seeking to give to every boy and girl, of incalculable benefit in 
          human progress? The influence of education and environment upon the 
          parent must affect the offspring?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, in this way, that the inherent faculty of 
          the child is aroused with good results. Environment simply develops 
          the inherent faculties of a child, it does not impart those faculties. 
          Good environment will enable such noble qualities as the child may possess 
          to develop advantageously, so also will education. In like manner, bad 
          environment will have a tendency to bring to light and strengthen the 
          baser elements of the child's nature. But the influence of environment 
          or of education upon the parent is not transmitted to the offspring, 
          as is clearly proved by cases where children, born of criminal and vicious 
          parents, become good and admirable characters when wholly removed from 
          the evil parental surroundings. Allowed to remain in those surroundings, 
          the children would, almost inevitably, by force of habit and the faculty 
          of imitation, have been as degraded as their parents. The waifs and 
          strays of Dr. Barnardo's<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Homes afford continual 
          and striking examples of this. These children, taken away from evil 
          influences, educated, placed in proper environment, become estimable 
          men and women. This is a very cheering fact. It proves that evil habits 
          are not hereditary.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But would not many of those rescued children fall 
          into evil habits if the restraint exercised by reformatory institutions 
          was removed?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That might be so, but it would not prove that they 
          had inherited the evil habits <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic"><i>acquired</i> 
          </font>by their parents, but that they had inherited the <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic"><i>evil 
          nature</i>, </font>either of their parents or some other progenitor. 
          It is impossible to tell where hereditary tendencies come from. Life 
          is like a kaleidoscope,&quot; and here Dr. Wallace rose, flushed with the 
          interest of his subject, and, advancing to the table, lifted an article, 
          and holding it in his hands, said: &quot;This might be a kaleidoscope representing 
          all the ancestors of some person, you turn it round, and, as in the 
          toy instrument, now one set of coloured glass and now another, comes 
          to the surface, so in the character of an individual, traits from this 
          or that ancestor display themselves promiscuously. How often in large 
          families there are children so opposite in nature and abilities, that 
          it is difficult to realize that they are born of the same parents. Such 
          differences are accounted for by the fact that one child takes after 
          its father, another after its grandmother, and so on. A child may not 
          resemble either of its parents, but present a character and appearance 
          exactly like that, say--of its great-uncle. <font color="990000">[[p. 
          85]]</font> Very curious instances of hereditary tendencies betray themselves 
          in people. Ladies, refined, and of good moral character in every other 
          respect, have been known to be incorrigible thieves. Society judges 
          them charitably, and says they are afflicted with kleptomania. The real 
          cause of the thievish habit is some remote and dishonest ancestor from 
          whom these ladies have inherited the evil propensity. So we frequently 
          find otherwise estimable characters, marred by some evil tendency which 
          is incompatible with their general disposition, and which, having lain 
          dormant in their immediate ancestors, has suddenly asserted itself in 
          them. This question of hereditary influences is a great and awful problem 
          to contemplate.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Does not the argument that acquired characters 
          cannot be transmitted make the outlook for human progress a gloomy one; 
          it seems to bar the way against any improvement of the race by means 
          of education?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If the theory is a true one, it certainly proves 
          that it is not by the direct road of education, as usually understood, 
          that humanity has advanced and must advance, although education may, 
          in an indirect manner, be an important factor of progress. If it is 
          thought that this non-inheritance of the results of education and training 
          is prejudicial to human progress, we must remember it also prevents 
          the continuous degradation of humanity by the inheritance of those vicious 
          practices and degrading habits which the deplorable conditions of our 
          modern social system undoubtedly foster in the bulk of mankind. Throughout 
          trade and commerce, lying and deceit abound to such an extent that it 
          has come to be considered essential to success. It is surely a blessing 
          if this kind of thing does not produce inherited deterioration in the 
          next generation. We have little to lose in not having the effects of 
          our present social system transmitted. Education has been so bad for 
          two thousand years that we should be a degraded race altogether, if 
          acquired character were inherited.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We need an ideal state such as Bellamy<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
          has depicted. Do you know,&quot; said Dr. Wallace with a laugh, &quot;I am completely 
          captivated with 'Looking Backward.'<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> There 
          are not many books that I care to read through more than twice, but 
          I have read every word of that book <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic"><i>three 
          times</i></font>. Some people may laugh at my infatuation, but I regard 
          it as a wonderful book.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point Dr. Wallace drifted into an animated 
          eulogy of the theories for regenerating society, put forward by Mr. 
          Bellamy, and led on to the question of the emancipation of women and 
          the results of the higher education. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 86]]</font> &quot;Do you not 
          think that the superior training and education now being given to women 
          will affect the succeeding generations of women, beneficially?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Indirectly,&quot; replied Dr. Wallace, &quot;undoubtedly; 
          but this matter of the education of women proves to me most conclusively 
          that we lose little by the non-transmission of acquired characters. 
          Think of the centuries of repression inflicted upon women educationally, 
          yet directly the chance is given to them they rise by leaps and bounds. 
          An Oxford Professor told me the other day that he was simply astonished 
          at the superior ability shown by the female students, when he considered 
          the state of ignorance in which women, as a class, had for generations 
          been kept. You see the inherent faculty has always been in woman, and 
          directly you place her in a proper environment, she, in most cases, 
          equals, and, in some cases, surpasses, the men who have enjoyed centuries 
          of educational training. Take another example. For many centuries, Oxford 
          and Cambridge were closed to Nonconformists, and their honours and rewards 
          were reserved for members of the Established Church, and very largely 
          for the families of the landed aristocracy. Yet, in the short period 
          that has elapsed since they were open to Dissenters, these latter have 
          shown themselves fully equal to the hereditarily trained Churchmen, 
          and have carried off the highest honours in as great, and, perhaps, 
          even in greater, proportion than their comparative numbers in the Universities.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is another curious fact. All our great musical 
          composers have been men; there is not a single woman who has achieved 
          high distinction in that capacity, yet when you compare the musical 
          education given respectively to boys and girls, it is found to be largely 
          in favour of girls. Every young lady in middle and upper class life 
          is taught to play one instrument, if not more, and this custom of imparting 
          musical training to women has existed for many generations. Yet, with 
          all their education, we have no woman composer.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A lady has lately composed a very fine oratorio, 
          Dr. Wallace.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Indeed? Well, she is an exception; but look at 
          boys, they are rarely taught music, yet it is from amongst them--the 
          uninstructed in the art--that our musical composers have arisen. I hope 
          I make it clear to you that this is a proof that education does not, 
          and cannot, impart inherent faculty; that is born in the child.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In view of the iron law of heredity, which, it 
          would appear, education has so little power to alter, Dr. Wallace, would 
          you not think it desirable, in the interests of humanity, that the criminal 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 87]]</font> classes, and diseased and deformed 
          persons, were prohibited from marrying?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am not in favor of any arbitrary law to regulate 
          the most sacred relationship of life.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> I do not see 
          how you could shut a reformed criminal, for example, out of social life. 
          The difficulties in the way of such legislation are simply incalculable. 
          And the same applies to weakly and diseased persons.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The latter may have great mental ability, may they 
          not?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Of course; they often have. No! What we need are 
          not prohibitory marriage laws, but a reformed society, an educated public 
          opinion which will teach individual duty in these matters. And it is 
          to the women of the future that I look for the needed reformation. Educate 
          and train women so that they are rendered independent of marriage as 
          a means of gaining a home and a living, and you will bring about natural 
          selection in marriage, which will operate most beneficially upon humanity. 
          When all women are placed in a position that they are independent of 
          marriage, I am inclined to think that large numbers will elect to remain 
          unmarried--in some cases, for life, in others, until they encounter 
          the man of their ideal. I want to see women the selective agents in 
          marriage; as things are, they have practically little choice. The only 
          basis for marriage should be a disinterested love. I believe that the 
          unfit will be gradually eliminated from the race, and human progress 
          secured, by giving to the pure instincts of women the selective power 
          in marriage. You can never have that so long as women are driven to 
          marry for a livelihood.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is another point, Dr. Wallace, which occurs 
          to me, and that is, whether a child, apart from hereditary tendencies, 
          is not affected by outside influences upon the mother previous to its 
          birth?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am seeking,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;for proofs regarding 
          this pre-natal theory. It opens up a most important and interesting 
          study. My attention was first drawn to it by a passage in <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic"><i>Chambers's 
          Encyclop&aelig;dia</i></font>, which related to the influence of mother 
          on child. But do not imagine,&quot; continued the Doctor, looking cautious 
          and alarmed &quot;that I accept all the old wives' fables about birth marks 
          and abnormal growths, because in large numbers of cases these peculiarities 
          have been traced to another cause altogether. It is impossible to say 
          how much is not the result of some hereditary influence, apart altogether 
          from the surroundings of the mother. Differences in children are not 
          always due to the parents, but frequently to the accidental mixture 
          of the ancestral germs. In my own family for example, my parents had 
          neither of them the usual tall and muscular development of Scotch <font color="990000">[[p. 
          88]]</font> people.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> They were, if anything, 
          below medium height, yet my brothers and I are tall men, above the average 
          height.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;With regard to pre-natal influences acting upon 
          the mental character of children, I cannot think it is more than very 
          occasional. It is a point of dispute amongst medical and scientific 
          men. Many deny it altogether. Darwin thought there was no positive evidence. 
          But a change is taking place, and it is now believed that there are 
          plenty of cases showing unmistakable evidence of pre-natal influence. 
          Now I will tell you the only really authenticated case which has come 
          under my notice, and it is a most striking one:--&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A gamekeeper met with an accident which obliged 
          him to have his right arm cut off. For various reasons his own wife 
          was unable to nurse him after the operation, and a friend, a young married 
          woman, undertook the duty. Six months afterwards she gave birth to a 
          child, and the right arm of that newly born child was only a stump. 
          It presented exactly the same appearance as that of the gamekeeper's. 
          There was nothing whatever in the families of either the father or the 
          mother of this child to lead to the conclusion that the deformity arose 
          from hereditary causes. I have read the written statements of those 
          concerned in the case, and I have seen photographs of the gamekeeper's 
          arm and of the child's, a boy, taken at the age of nine, and both present 
          an identical appearance. I accept this case as an authentic proof of 
          pre-natal influence. I have laid the subject before the British Association, 
          and it has led to the appointment of a committee to collect evidence. 
          A good deal of interesting information has been sent me by ladies who 
          think they can trace in the characters of their children a result of 
          the conditions of life in which they were placed, or the occupations 
          in which they were engaged prior to the birth of those children. This 
          may or may not be evidence of pre-natal influence; because the various 
          traits of character may have come from ancestral germs, quite independent 
          of any influence upon the mother. The case of the gamekeeper, however, 
          affords positive proof.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then, Dr. Wallace, if pre-natal influence can be 
          proved to act upon the characters, and even bodily formation, of children, 
          will it not rather upset the theory that acquired characters are not 
          inherited?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If it can be proved by a sufficient body of cases, 
          it will undoubtedly modify the views of physiologists altogether. But, 
          you understand we are only upon the threshold of the enquiry, and must 
          wait for results.&quot;</p>

<P>The deep and widespread resistance to a biological approach to human
cognition and behavior presents a delicate puzzle of its own: surely it
is more than obvious that human beings are biological organisms, and that
everything culture and civiluzation has accomplished has been made possible
by and mediated through our complex biological makeup. That an investigation
into the nature and structure of this makeup constitutes a vital part of
the humanities and social sciences cannot be considered a particularly
daring proposal--and yet, why is it that a slight but profound tremor still
registers that this is the room in Bluebeard's castle we have agreed, as
a culture, to keep the door closed and locked on, a place where fools rush
in, but angels fear to tread?

<P>This agreement is hinted at early on; in 1873, two years after the publication
of Darwin's <I>The Descent of Man</I>, John Stuart Mill points out that
oppression's favorite justification is that the current social order is
merely the natural one. "But was there every any domination which did not
appear natural to those who possessed it?", he asks rhetorically, citing
Aristotle's claim that the Thracians and Asiatics were of a slave nature,
Southern slave owners' fanatical affirmation of the equivalent doctrine,
as well as his proper subject matter, "one of the chief hindrances to human
improvement", the subjection of women to men.&nbsp;<A NAME="T1"></A>What
is argued to be natural, Mill concludes, is invariably no more than what
is customary; and change is held at bay by claiming that what is really
only unusual is unnatural <A HREF="#[1]">[1]</A>.

<P>The positive implication of this is that custom is man-made and subject
to our control, and locating social relations and differences in the sphere
of the man-made empowers us to begin to change it.&nbsp;<A NAME="T2"></A>In
<I>Beyond Good and Evil</I>, Friedrich Nietzsche makes this desideratum
explicit: we should preferentially explain social phenomena in terms of
cultural factors, since this will allow and encourage us to effect changes
<A HREF="#[2]">[2]</A>. The sentiment was elaborated into a full-blown
position at the beginning of the century by the founder of American anthropology,
Franz Boas, and his even more influential students, Margaret Mead and Ruth
Benedict.&nbsp;<A NAME="T3"></A>The thorough-going and dogmatic formulation
of cultural constructivism, epitomized in Boas' student Lowie's motto,
<I>omni cultura ex cultura,</I>&nbsp; <A HREF="#[3]">[3]</A> became the
credo of the humanities and social sciences for the rest of the century.

<P>The intentions behind this progam are easy to sympathize with. Boas'
position was a response to the early anthropological work of Lewis Henry
Morgan, who used the ethnographic material from his study of the Iroquois
to argue for a biological and racial origin of cultural differences--an
interpretation which seemed tailor-made to foster racial prejudice. History
has only too many examples of the dramatic and on the whole overwhelmingly
negative consequences on society of classifying people into biological
kinds, and Boas responded to these historical and contemporary facts. In
Medieval Europe, social status was thought to be a similar kind of difference
as the differences between animal species; according to the same logic,
identity was a function of office, and office was inherited from parent
to child.&nbsp;<A NAME="T4"></A>(When Hildegard von Bingen, the illustrious
twelfth-century Abbess of Thubingen, was asked why she would only accept
noble ladies, she replied, "Who, unless he courts ruin, puts all his farm-stock
into one shed: oxen, asses, sheep, and kids all together?" <A HREF="#[3]">[4]</A>)
We find very similar kinds of thinking in large parts of contemporary Indian
society: the caste system prescribes the inheritance of profession and
social status, and social mobility within this traditional system is severely
restricted. There is no way to advance, say, from a sudra to a brahmin.
It is as if each person had a hidden essence that is utterly immutable,
no more able to transform into another than a cat can be turned into a
zebra. As to the West, we need not and do not go back to the Middle Ages
for the most immediate source of our cultural trauma: the systematic genocide
of Jews and Gypsies, as well as the murder of tens of thousands of individuals
with mental and physical handicaps. The Nazi love-affair with organic and
essentialist notions of nation and race in the heartland of European culture
is one of the most recent incarnation of the heavy breathing we hear from
behind Bluebeard's bolted door. Slavery and segregationism is the other
shadow, mingling with essentialist definitions of the eternally feminine.
The danger, in brief, is very real.

<P>The cultural constructivist dogma holds, in contrast, that everything
in culture is but custom. But something jars--if everything is constructed,
why do we need the bolted door? There is a curious logic behind this position.
For on the one hand, history lends support to the contention of Mill, Nietzsche,
and Boas that it is a dangerous thing to do to locate cultural and social
differences in the domain of biology. But on the other hand--why is it
such a dangerous thing? Why cannot nature and biology be thought about
in ways that are non-racist and non-essentialist? Why this lack of faith
in our ability to think afresh? The urge to keep the door locked amounts
to a cognitive claim: if we do place society in the realm of biology, then
racism and essentialism follow as night follows day. This underlying assumption
is precisely the opposite of cultural constructivism: behind the facade
of constructivism lies an unspoken conviction of biological determinism.
The ground of cultural constructivism is essentialism.

<P>The biological understanding of essentialism, however, is constructivist.
It teaches that the logic of biological kinds evolved to classify animals,
and is well designed and functions well when applied to its proper domain.
Animals, as <I>Genesis</I> has it, come each according to their kind, and
it is generally accurate to say that we cannot change one into another.
Gelman and Wellman have shown that small children tend to think of animals
as having hidden essences; these remain constant even if the appearance
of the animal changes, and are stable predictors of behavior, feeding preferences,
mate choice, and offspring. Keil, in a series of ingenious experiments,
showed that children permit objects to change identity--a tray literally
becomes a hat if a string and some straw is added. Animals, however, do
not depend on their appearance for their identity: however much you make
the racoon look like a skunk, the children insist it remains a racoon.
The construction of the living-kinds module, with its conceptual primitives
of hidden "essences" and rigidly defined "kinds", is understandable as
the result of a historical process, without any appeal to essences.

<P>So are they right? Is it in fact the case that human beings--we--are
unable to think of biological systems in other than essentialist ways?
Clearly not: a consequence of this account of the resistance to a biological
approach to human cognition and behavior is that <I>human cognition is
more flexible than cultural constructivism allows</I>. The emerging cognitive
paradigm demonstrates in practice that people are perfectly capable of
thinking of biology in non-essentialist ways. Darwinism is a very coherent
way of thinking about biology, and it is strictly causal and historical,
with no appeal to hidden essences. It is true that it does not come naturally
to think in an evolutionary manner; it requires training, application,
and practice. But so does reading and writing, driving a car and using
a computer--humans are universally able to learn new skills that do not
come naturally. What is important is not taboos but education. The discovery
of a biologically and genetically panhuman mode of construing living kinds
in terms of essences do not condemn us, but on the contrary demonstrates
our cognitive flexibility.

<P>Unfortunately, it seems likely that a continual insistence on the motto
<I>omni cultura ex cultura</I>, because of its blatantly ideological flavor
and inherent unreasonableness, in an underhand manner ends up nourishing
a fashionably oppositional racism that claims to see the facts straight
in the eye. Cultural constructivism's fear of biology carries an implicit
belief in the irresistible force of essentialist thinking, and thus a tacit
endorsement of genetic determinism. A biological approach to human cognition,
on the other hand, can engage immediately with the inappropriateness of
essentialist thinking, in genetics as well as in the social order.

<P>The challenge facing us today is not to avert our eyes from the monstrous
face of essentialism, and to propound a doctrine of radical cultural constructivism
that we know to be false, but to develop ways of thinking about biology
that transcends our evolved inclinations. At issue is why people feel it
is dangerous to<I> think</I> genes when it comes to culture. The reason
seems to be that genes are taken to be the scientific counterpart of the
folk psychological notion of "essences", and essences belong to a biological
mode of classification into "kinds", each with its own ineluctable set
of "natural" needs and behaviors. If we think genes, we get determinism
and essentialism--a mode of thinking that, as Mill so eloquently points
out, can only serve to legitimate the status quo, and drive society in
the direction of a caste structure. But the conservatism is not in biology,
it is in our ways of thinking about biology. Cultural constructivism in
its radical form stems from the double bind of believing biology determines
us to think in certain ways about biology--an assumption we as multi-talented
human beings are perfectly at liberty to question.

<P>In questioning the false necessities of biology, we have already begun
the enquiry into the structure of our cognitive heritage. By teaching people
to think in ways that are unnatural or counterintuitive, but more coherent,
more in accord with the facts - surely an appropriate mandate for a university
- Bluebeard can be systematically deposed from his despotic office.

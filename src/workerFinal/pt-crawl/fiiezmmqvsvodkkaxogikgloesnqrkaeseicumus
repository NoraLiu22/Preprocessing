  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another well-known map - considered
      by Graham Hancock and other "mystery" fans as proof positive of Anctartica
      being already known and charted centuries before its exploration - is
    the one published in 1531 by <a href="http://www-groups.cs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Fine.html" target="_blank">Oronce 
    Fine</a> (called Oronzio Fineo, in Italian; or Orontius Finaeus, in Latin), 
    a renowned mathematician who also designed geographical maps based upon his 
    geometrical studies of the various spherical or cordiform projections.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This map represents a large continent
      called "Terra Australis" (land that lies to the south), around the South
      pole. But in this case, too - or, we ought to say, especially in this case
      - it
    is evident that the continent, clearly separated from the South America by
      the Magellan Straits, was not Anctarctica but the depiction of a mythical
      land, composed by mixing what few morsels of information were then available
    on the recently discovered lands at the extreme south of the known world.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>THE &quot;TERRA
    AUSTRALIS INCOGNITA&quot;</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is in fact
      many a map showing "<b>Terra Australis Incognita</b>" ("unknown land in the 
    south"), the continent that should have been there, according to the Greek
    philosophers from Pitagora onwards. They had figured out the Earth to be
    spherical,
    and had even calculated its diameter within a good degree of precision (Erathosthenes,
    in the III century b.C.), and thought that, being there lands in the northern
    hemisphere, there should be lands in the southern hemisphere too, lest the <a href="Austral.jpg" target="_blank">world</a> be
    unbalanced. On the myth of "<i><a href="#" target="_blank" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.70south.com/resources/history/chapters/chapter1','','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480')">Terra 
    Australis</a></i>" a great many books have been written, and in all the studies
    on the history of cartography maps will be found representing the fabulous
    continent; which is not an ice-free Anctartica, but an <a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.southpolerace.com/history.htm','','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480')">imaginary 
    land</a>.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After the first
      explorations following the discovery of Americas, sailors brought news
      of new lands being
    discovered farther and farther south, and this gave strength to the idea
      of the mythical continent really existing, to the point of it being actually
      included in many 16-th century maps. In those maps, as in many others,
      we
    see "<i>Terra Australis Incognita</i>", a myth not different from the one
    of the <i>Garden of Eden</i> (which, too, is often to be found in medioeval 
    maps), the<i> <a href="javascript:void(null)" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.saradouglass.com/prestjohn.html','','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480')">Prester 
    John</a> Reign</i> (usually placed in East Africa), or <i>El Dorado</i>.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="Finaeus-1r.jpg" width="350" height="326"></font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">...</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="Finaeus_antart.jpg" width="350" height="326"></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The great continent
      occupying great part of the southern hemisphere bears the name: "<b>Terra 
    Australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita</b>", which means "<b>Southern 
    land found recently but not fully known</b>". From this, too, we can see
    that it can't be (as mystery writers suggest) a representation of Anctarctica
    before
    the ice age, showing as it does mountains, valleys, and rivers, but of lands
    recently discovered and only partially explored.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="PoloSud.jpg" width="300" height="300"></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Moreover, the real 
    Anctarctica is not near South America, divided from it by the Magellan Straits. 
    Far from it, literally, the austral continent is much farther south, its northernmost 
    fringes being more than 1000 km from the Tierra do Fuego. Finaeus' world map 
    is then an approximate, idealised map where lands only half-seen or skirted 
    by sailors are knitted together to form a great austral continent.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And what might have
      been these lands, so "recenter inventae sed nondum plene cognitae"? Why,
      one is surely Tierra do Fuego itself, coasted by Magellan in 1520 and thought
      to be, through all of the 16-th century, the northern fringe of Terra Australis.
      In describing the region, Finaeus' map doesn't appear much different by
      so
    many others of the same period.</font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In Finaeus' map the islands
    of Java and Timor can be clearly seen, and that great continent dubbed "Terra 
  Australis" and thought to extend up to the Magellan Straits to South America
  might then comprise also Australia, which is just to south-east of Java and
  Timor. The great gulf depicted in Terra Australis could then be a sketchy layout
  of Carpentaria Gulf, in which the two islands of Groote and Wellesley are recognizable,
  or the Bonaparte Gulf, near Java and Timor.</font></blockquote>

      and in particular the region called "Regio Patalis" (the name comes from
      Marco Polo's writings), to the right of a great gulf, is recognizable also
      in other <a href="javascript:void(null)" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Paris1528.htm','','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480')">maps</a> 
    dating from the middle of the 16-th century and had been surely <a href="http://www.lexicon.net/world/tasman/bib2.html" target="_blank">reached 
    by the Portuguese</a> long before Tasman's travel in 1642 and the "official" 
    discovery by Capt. Cook. On this topic some studies have been recently published 
    among which the more widely known are: Roger Hervé, <i>Découverte fortuite 
    de l'Australie et de la Nouvelle-Zélande par des navigateurs portugais et
    espagnols entre 1521 et 1528</i>, Comité des travaux historiques et scientifiques, 
    Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, 1982; Kenneth Gordon McIntyre, "<i><a href="http://www.q-net.net.au/%7Elolita/contents.htm" target="_blank">The 
    Secret Discovery of Australia: Portuguese Ventures 250 Years before Capt. 
    Cook.</a></i>" Sydney, Pan, 1977. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even in maps from the end of 15-th 
    century we find the Indonesian islands (Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes), and 
    surely many travellers knew about a great unexplored land mass to the south, 
    known to the <a href="http://www.oceansonline.com/zheng.htm" target="_blank">Chinese</a> 
    and rich in gold and shells.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the beginning of the 16-th 
    century the Portuguese had begun colonizing those islands nearest Australia, 
    that resulted within their jurisdiction. They reached Java and Malacca (1511), 
    then Timor (1515), and probably had also reached the northern coast of a large, 
    and unknown, land. <a href="http://www.danbyrnes.com.au/merchants/merchants4.htm" target="_blank">Mendonca</a>'s
    expedition south of Timor dates back to 1522. The sailor left towards the
    India of the South, cited in many tales of european and chinese voyagers.
    Cristóvão de Mendonça came to shore in what at the beginning he though to
    be a very large island. Upon his return in Portugal, de Mendonca kept the
    discovery to himself, to avoid it to be exploited by the Spaniards, since
    the actual position of the border between Spanish and Portuguese areas in
    the Pacific was, at the time, quite controversial.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A large land mass, called "Greater 
    Java", placed south of Java and Sumatra, appears in many 16-th century <a href="Paris1528.htm" target="_blank">French 
    maps</a> which quote Portuguese landmarks. They might have been all copied 
    from the same original perhaps stolen from the Portuguese, by the bishop Miguel 
    de Silva. He was accused of illegally smuggling confidential documents: thus 
    maps were considered, since they could supply other nations with vital information 
    for colonial ventures.</font></p>

    map of 1567. The orientation is inverted: Nord is down.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At that time, travel and exploration
      weren't endeavored for sport, or for knowledge's sake. What really mattered
      was opening new routes and finding exploitable lands, spices, precious
      metals.
    But the "Terra australis", so "recenter inventa", long remained "paene cognita", 
    since it didn't offer, apparently, but "sterile coasts, inhabited by few savages 
    so primitive it wasn't possible to reach the vaguest understanding with" ("<i>History 
    of the Explorations</i>" by Ugo Dettore, Ist. Geogr. de Agostini). Australia
    clearly appears in the 1593 map by Cornelius de Jode, and in <a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/MapColl/globe20.gif" target="_blank">world 
    maps</a> dating at the beginning of the 17-th century, but it was only in 
    1642 that a Dutch, <a href="http://www.lexicon.net/world/tasman/bhouse.htm" target="_blank">Abel 
    Tasman</a>, sailed south of Tasmania and New Holland (now Australia) and discovered 
    that this land didn't belong to the mythic Southern Continent, but was really 
    a large island. </font></p>

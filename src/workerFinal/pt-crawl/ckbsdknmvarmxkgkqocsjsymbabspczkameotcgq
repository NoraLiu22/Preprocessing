/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: A letter to the Editor 
        printed on page 267 of the <u>Nature</u> of 20 July 1893. To link directly

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to call the attention and elicit the opinion 
        of naturalists as to the interpretation of certain facts bearing upon 
        this question.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my article in the <em>Fortnightly Review</em> 
        of May last, p. 664, I give what appears to be a new interpretation of 
        facts which have been often quoted, as to the change in the external characters 
        of a Texan species of Saturnia when the larv&aelig; were fed upon <em>Juglans 
        regia</em>, its native food-plant being <em>Juglans nigra</em>; and the 
        somewhat analogous facts as to <em>Artemia salina</em> being changed into 
        <em>A. Milhausenii</em> (the former living in brackish, the latter in 
        salt water) when the water became gradually more salt; the change in this 
        case being progressive, year by year, and proportionate to the change 
        in the saltness of the water. The reverse change was also effected by 
        gradually reducing the salinity of the water inhabited by<em> A. Milhausenii</em>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the former case I remarked in my 
        article as follows:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Prof. Lloyd Morgan (in his 'Animal Life and 
        Intelligence,' pp. 163-166) clearly sees that this and other cases do 
        not prove more than a modification of the individual; but it seems to 
        me to go further than this. For here we have a species the larv&aelig; 
        of which for thousands, perhaps millions, of generations have fed upon 
        one species of plant, and the perfect insect has a definite set of characters. 
        But when the larv&aelig; are fed on a distinct but allied species of plant, 
        the resulting perfect insect differs both in colouration and form. We 
        may conclude from this fact that some portion of the characters of the 
        species are dependent on the native food-plant, <em>Juglans nigra</em>, 
        and that this portion changed under the influence of the new food-plant. 
        Yet the influence of the native food-plant had been acting uninterruptedly 
        for unknown ages. Why then had the resulting characters not become fixed 
        and hereditary? The obvious conclusion is, that being a change produced 
        in the body only by the environment, it is not hereditary, no matter for 
        how many generations the agent continues at work; in Weismann's phraseology 
        it is a somatic variation, not a germ variation.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then referred to the marked difference between 
        somatic and germ variations in plants, the former disappearing at once, 
        the latter persisting, when cultivated under abnormal conditions; and 
        also to the cases of many closely allied species of animals and of the 
        races of mankind, which preserve their distinctive characteristics when 
        living and breeding under very different conditions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above seems to me a perfectly valid and 
        logical argument, and I was interested to see how it would be met by Lamarckians, 
        who have frequently referred to the same facts as being obviously in their 
        favour, though without any attempt to show how and why they are in their 
        favour. I was therefore rather surprised to read, in the July issue of 
        the <em>Contemporary Review</em>, a paper by Prof. Marcus Hartog, in which 
        he characterises my argument as a very bad kind of special pleading, and 
        adds that it amounts to this: &quot;Any change in the offspring produced by 
        altered conditions in the parent is limited to characters that are 'not 
        fixed and inherited'; for fixed and inherited characters cannot be altered 
        by changed conditions in the parent; therefore no experimental proof can 
        be given of the transmission of acquired characters.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is of course simple reasoning in a 
        circle, and I cannot recognise it as my reasoning. I have made no general 
        proposition that &quot;fixed and inherited characters cannot be altered by 
        changed conditions in the parent,&quot; or that &quot;no experimental proof can 
        be given of the transmission of acquired characters.&quot; But I argue that 
        when a decided character is immediately changed by changed conditions 
        of the individual, as in Saturnia, it is not &quot;fixed and inherited.&quot; The 
        experiment itself shows that it is not a fixed character, and there can 
        be no proof that it is inherited so long as it only appears under the 
        very same changed conditions that produced it in the parent.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to experimental proof I believe it to be 
        quite possible. There is one case, which I do not remember having seen 
        referred to, in which nature has tried an experiment for us. I was informed 
        by the President of the Deaf-Mute College at Washington that the male 
        and female students frequently marry after leaving the college, and that 
        their children are rarely deaf-mutes. But the point to which I wish to 
        call attention is the admitted fact that there is usually no disease or 
        malformation of the vocal organs in a deaf-mute. Now, before deaf-mutes 
        were taught to talk as they are now, they passed their whole lives without 
        using the complex muscles and motor-nerves by the accurate coordination 
        of which speech is effected. Here is a case of complete disuse, and there 
        must have been some consequent atrophy. Yet it has, I believe, never been 
        alleged that the children of deaf-mutes exhibited any unusual difficulty 
        in learning to speak, as they should do if the effects of disuse of the 
        organs of speech in their parents were inherited. Here is at all events 
        the material of an experiment ready to our hands. An experiment to show 
        whether the effects of use and disuse were inherited might also be tried 
        by bringing up a number of dove-cot pigeons in a large area covered in 
        with wire netting so low as to prevent flight, at the same time encouraging 
        running by placing food always at the two extremities of the enclosure 
        only, or in some other way ensuring the greatest amount of use of the 
        legs. After two or three generations had been brought up in this way, 
        the latest might be turned out among other dove-cot pigeons, at the age 
        when they would normally begin to fly, and it would then be seen if the 
        diminished wing-power and increased leg-power of the parents were inherited.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt many better experiments might be suggested; 
        but these are sufficient to indicate the character of such as do not require 
        that the offspring be submitted to the same conditions as those which 
        produced the change in the parents, and which thus enable us to discriminate 
        between effects due to inheritance and those due to a direct effect of 
        the conditions upon the individual. The cases of the Saturnia and the 
        shrimps are of the latter kind, and in their very nature can afford no 
        proof of heredity.</p>

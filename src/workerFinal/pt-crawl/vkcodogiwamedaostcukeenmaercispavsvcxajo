University of Chicago.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> I offer into evidence Plaintiffs' Exhibit Number 90,
Doctor Gilkey's resume.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> That will be received. (Thereupon, Plaintiffs' Exhibit

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Doctor Gilkey, can you give us some background on your area
of research and scholarship at the University of Chicago?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">173</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>My main responsibility is to teach protestant theology, but
I have taught the historical, that is to say, the history of Christian
theology. I teach a number of protestant theologians of various sorts,
both contemporary and ones who preceded us.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I teach a history of the development of modern theology since the middle
of the eighteenth century. I've been particularly interested in the relations
of religion and culture, not as a sociologist or historian, but as a theologian;
the relations of religion to science, the relations of religion to politics;
relations of religion or the Western religions to the ideas of history,
and so forth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I teach courses on those subjects, as well as courses on particular
theologians.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> Your Honor, I would offer Doctor Gilkey as an expert
in the field of theology.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Any voir dire?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. CAMPBELL:</u> No voir dire.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. SIANO: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Doctor Gilkey, did I engage your services in 1981 as an expert?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>With respect to what subject matter?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>With respect to, first of all, the Act 590 and to
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">174</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) the relation of that act to the general subject
matter of religion, and to the subject matter of Christian theology and
particularly the subject matter of the doctrine or idea of creation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Have you written any books or periodicals on the topic of creation?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>My thesis and my first book was on the subject of creation,
a book called <u>Maker of Heaven and Earth</u>. I have subsequently found
myself reinterested in that subject over and over again since creation
remains with us, fortunately. So it keeps arising.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the context of science it has come up repeatedly, needless to say.
And I have written some articles on that subject and now find myself involved
in it again.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Doctor Gilkey, getting to your area of expertise, would you
please describe for us what is religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Definitions of religion are famous for being difficult to produce.
That everybody will agree with. That is partly because of the wide variety
of religions and partly because, obviously, there is a certain perspective
on defining religion.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I will offer one here that is on the basis of my own study and reflection,
and I propose it as an adequate one. People may disagree with it but I
will be willing to discuss that matter.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">175</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) I will propose that religion involves three different
elements or aspects. First of all, in order for anything to be called a
religion has these three. Anything that we ordinarily call a religion does
illustrate these three. First of all, a view of reality, especially of
ultimate reality; a view that emphasizes, first, the basic problem of human
existence—for example, death or sin, or rebirth in some religions. Secondly,
and perhaps most important, has an answer to that fundamental problem,
an answer that is very clearly connected with what is regarded as ultimate
reality.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These answers are expressed in a number of ways, depending on the kind
of religion we are talking about. They can be expressed in myths or stories
at certain levels.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">They can be expressed in what are called truths, for example, in Buddhism.
They can be expressed in teaching, they can be expressed in doctrines,
and, finally, in dogmas.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>That is the first element?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>That is the first element. The second element is that there
is a way of life and then a mode of behavior that is involved. Generally,
it finds its source in what is regarded as ultimate reality, to which every
person in
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">176</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) the religion submits themselves, assents, promises
to participate in. Obviously, how much they do or how little is a different
matter, but that is part of it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Let me ask you, do creeds form a part of this ethic?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Some religions have creeds, some don't, but that's not universal.
I suggest that every religion has something like that. They may call it
teachings, truths, this, that and the other, and some religions will have
definite creeds. That comes more under Number 1, so to speak, with regard
to their view of reality.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>What is the third element?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>The third element is the community, a community structured
in a quite definite way with differences of authority, differences of responsibility,
a community that meets at particular times, and as a part of a way of life
comes into some kind of relationship with what is regarded as ultimate
reality.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This may be meditative; it may be esthetic; it may be what we call in
our tradition worship. It may be prayer; it may be this, that and the other.
There are all kinds of ways.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>You used the phrase "our tradition", I take it you are speaking
of Western religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I am speaking there of religions of the West and, in
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">177</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) particularly, of Christianity, though the word
`worship', of course, applies to many other types of religion, but if one
said, `What do we do to come into contact with God', we think immediately
of worship and prayer.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Is there an additional element to religion when you focus on
Western religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Well, one of the essential elements of Western religions, and
I am thinking here particularly of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, if
you wish to call that Western, is that they are monotheistic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The meaning, the functional meaning of monotheism is that everything
relative to the religion focuses on God.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Monotheistic is one god?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>One god, that's right, and focuses on God and one God. That
is to say, God is the ultimate reality; God is the source of the ethic;
God is that power that legitimates the community.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Could you describe for me in a little more detail how Western
religion is related to God and God related to Western religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Well, as I say, God here in Western religion is regarded as
the source of ultimate reality; that is, God dominates the view of reality
and of ultimate reality as the creator, as the divine source of all that
is.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">178</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) God is the source of the revelation on which the
religion is based; God is the source of the law which those within the
religion support or wish to follow; God is the source of the salvation
that is the answer to the deepest human problem.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And the deepest human problem in our tradition is regarded as separation
from God.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Would it be fair to say that in Western religions what has
to do with God is religions and all that has to do with religion has to
do with God?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes. All that is religious, the meaning on monotheism, `Thou
shalt worship no other God', all that is religious is related to God. Correspondingly,
what is related to God is religious.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, this includes not only the acts of God in revealing himself or
in saying, but also very specifically the acts of God in creating and preserving
the universe. For this reason, it is quite appropriate that the first book
of our scriptures has within it as its first part a story of the creation
of the whole visible universe by God. And the first article of the traditional
Christian creed, the Apostles Creed, reads, "I believe in God, the Father
Almighty, the maker of heaven and earth", stating this point as well.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>You described the first book of our scripture. Are
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">179</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(Continuing) you referring to the Genesis Book in the Old Testament?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I am referring to the Genesis Book in the Old Testament. It
is the first book of the Christian scripture and it is also the first book,
of course, of the Hebrew Scripture, the Torah.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Is it your testimony, sir, that a creative being is necessarily
a god in Western tradition?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Objection, your Honor. He is leading the witness.
He has not said that before. I don't think he has indicated or alluded
to that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> I will rephrase my question.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. SIANO: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Do you, sir, have an opinion, to a reasonable degree of professional
certainty, as to whether or not a creative being is necessarily a god?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>A creator is certainly a god; that is, a being that brings
the universe into existence.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Why, sir, is a proposition that relates to God or to creator
a religious concept?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Well, as I've said, in the Western tradition all that relates
to God has to do with religion and vice versa. Secondly, the idea of a
creator, that is, one who brings the world into existence, fashions it,
creates a system of causes within which we find ourselves, is a
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">180</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) being who transcends that system of cause, is
not a finite cause, is not merely a part of nature— This has been very
deep in the traditions of both Judaism and Christianity—transcends both
nature and the human society and human history, and as its founder, in
this sense this is a transcendent, a supernatural being, such a being is
God.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Would the source of our understanding of creator also relate
to this religious character?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>The idea of a creator, particularly the idea of a creator out
of nothing, has its source in the religious traditions of Judaism, subsequently
of Christianity, and then subsequently to that of Islam. And the form of
the concept has its source there.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, one might say this is where all of our ideas about what God
is or who God is comes from this book and subsequently from that to this
tradition.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Do Western notions of God differ significantly from anyone
else's, any other group's notion of God as the creator?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>They differ very significantly. of course, it is obvious and
we all know that the word `god', that is to say the words which we would
translate `god' into that English word are not confined to the Jewish,
Christian, Islamic traditions, the People of the Book. But the idea
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">181</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) of a creator out of nothing, the idea of a creator
at an absolute beginning is a unique conception confined to that tradition.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many creators. There are creators in Hindu mythology and religion.
There are creators in Chinese and Japanese traditions. There, of course,
were creators in the Babylonian tradition, the Greek tradition, and so
forth. None of them have quite that character. That is characteristic of
our tradition and has its ultimate source in Genesis.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Does whether or not this creator is named god, is that relevant
to whether it is a religious concept?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>No. As I say, if one specifies a creator being one who has
supernatural power, intelligence, will, and those are both involved in
the concept of design; that is, the power to bring it into being and the
will and the intelligence to shape it into our world, such a conception
is what we mean by god and a large part of what we mean by god. It is not
all of what we mean by god in our tradition, but if you say this much you
are talking about a deity and, therefore, this conception is that of a
deity.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Can you translate the meaning of the phrase "ex nihilo" for
me?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes. The phrase "ex nihilo" appeared in the first centuries—Actually,
as far as I know, at the end of the
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">182</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) second century—in the Christian tradition. It
came as an interpretation on the meaning or the implication of the Genesis
account, of a number of Psalms and some references in the New Testament
where the word `creation' was used and where the idea of making was used.
This was what it meant. It means that God created the world out of nothing,
not out of God, not out of matter, but out of nothing. That is to say,
everything was produced by God. That is the fundamental meaning. It means,
also, an absolute beginning.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Is it your opinion, sir, that the phrase "creatio ex nihilo"
is a religious concept?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes. In the first place because it refers to God. And I have
made that point as clearly as possible that what refers to God, particularly
in our tradition, is religious. Propositions of that sort are religious
propositions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, one might make the argument, and I am prepared to do so, that
of all statements about God, that is the most religious. What I mean by
that is that by various definitions there are not other actions there;
all other actors are brought into existence by this act. There are no other
forces at work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, in the concept of the incarnation, there is, let us say,
Mary present already; there is a needy
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">183</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) human race, and so forth and so on. God acts,
but there are other actors on the scene. The same with the Last Judgment,
the same with other doctrines 4 or teachings of the Christian religion.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">However, creator, God is the only actor. One is only talking about God
at this point. The only agent is the divine. In this sense it is the paradigmatic
religious statement.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I show you what has been previously admitted as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 29, Act 590 of 1981. I ask you, sir, have you ever seen that statute
before?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>In fact, I conveyed the statute to you?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>And asked you examine it; is that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I ask you, to a reasonable degree of professional certainty,
do you have an opinion as to whether the creation-science model as set
forth in Section 4 (a) of Act 590 is a statement of religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I find it unquestionably a statement of religion.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>What is the basis for that opinion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>The basis for that is that, with the possible exception of
Number 2, that is to say, the insufficiency of mutation in natural selection,
which is predominantly a
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">184</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) negative statement, the other statements, 1, 3,
4, 5, and 6, imply, entail, necessitate a deity as the agent involved in
what is being said. The sudden creation of the universe from nothing requires
there be a being there who preceives the universe, though the word `preceives'
is interesting at this point, who preceives the universe, who is self-sufficient,
who is necessary, who is eternal and who has a design, an intelligent design,
in mind and the power, above all, to do that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The conception of species, kinds of plants and animals created at the
beginning means that they were not evolved from anything else or created
from anything else but created by a precedent creator.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Separate ancestry of man and apes, as has been pointed out, has the
same implication.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If the Flood is regarded as the catastrophe referred to, the Flood has
a divine origin. That is to say, if the meaning of the word `catastrophe'
is forces and causes far beyond any normal, natural causes, then number
5 implies the same.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, mind you, that depends on what is meant by the word `catastrophism'.
We could talk about Saint Helens as a catastrophe. That is not what I'm
referring to. Something quite beyond the ordinary causality or the
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">185</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) recurring causality of our experience with the
universe.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>You don't find a definition of catastrophism anywhere in that
section, do you?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Right, but I suspect from the history of these ideas, that
it has the reference that I've implied, though I am not sure.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> relatively recent inception of the earth certainly requires a divine
creator.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Are you aware—Your testimony earlier was that a creative force
is necessarily a deity of some kind. Is that a fair statement?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I would think that the moment you say "force"—I think I said
"being"—I think that when you say "a creative force"—that I am not necessarily
maintaining that this involves a deity or is involved in religion, though
creative forces have the kind of attractiveness, let us say, that we begin
to get religious about. So I don't want to exclude creative forces from
religion. For example, in a good number of so-called primitive religions,
the creative force of fertility was certainly an object of very intent
religious belief and of religious interest.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>So you, are saying `a creative being' then?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I would rather put it this way. Not all creative

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) forces can be regarded as religious.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> good number of them, in fact, have been regarded as religious.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> creative being, that is, a being who brings things into being, who
shapes the universe as we know it, is a religious concept, has appeared
in that. And I might say that the reason the study by people, as has been
pointed out in this courtroom, in a religious context is that that is where
it is. It doesn't appear anywhere else.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It comes up in all kinds of ways in human history. Such kinds of concepts
always involve with deities, always involve with what we call religion.</font>

terms or concepts. In this sense, the term `creator' means only some entity
with power, intelligence and a sense of design."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"Creation science does not require a creator who has a personality,
who has the attributes of love, compassion, justice and so on which are

not require that the creator still be in existence."</font>

you aware of a concept—As a religious premise, are you aware of the concept

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Right. Well, I was going to back up just a moment. That is
to say, there are a number of polytheistic faiths which have spoken of
a creator deity, who may or may not be the deity who saves.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In a monotheistic faith, of course, this is impossible. Actually, it
is interesting to me that this conception of a creator being who is not
the god who saves—I would say the creator being is inevitably a deity—but
a creator being who is not the god who saves has appeared within Christian
history as its first and most dangerous major
<br>&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) heresy.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, I am hoping that was intended by counsel here, but this was the
Marcionic heresy and the Gnostic heresy, which the church with great vehemence
reacted against in the first two centuries.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Would you spell the names of them?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes. Marcion is Capital M-a-r-c-i-o-n. The Gnostic, capital
G-n-o-s-t-i-c. Both of them were not very friendly to the Old Testament
for various reasons, wished Christianity not be associated with it, presented
a picture of malevolent or, at least, not very benevolent, deity who created
the world and of another god who came in to save it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The main thrust of the earliest theology of the church and the source
of the so-called Apostles' Creed in a Hundred and Fifty, which is the first
example of it that is known, was to combat this and to say that the god
we worship is the maker of heaven and earth, and the god who made heaven
and earth is the father of the being who saved us, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Thus, comes out, "I believe in God, the Father, the maker of heaven and
earth and in his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>So what you are saying then, Doctor Gilkey, is that as a result
of these two heresies, Marcion and Gnostic heresies, the Christian church
developed what we now know

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>It is pretty clear that there was a teaching summary that was
used quite consistently, probably from Eighty, Ninety and so forth, on.
This became more and more consistent because there are hints of it in the
earliest documents at the turn of the century.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As far as we know, it was formulated into a creed at Rome against Marcions
to say, `No, we do not believe in two gods, a creator god is distinct from
a saving god. We do believe in one god.' They regarded that, of course,
as within the Jewish tradition. They regarded it as the Christian way of
speaking of that, and so that became the thrust of that creed. That is
the main article of the creed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Is it, none the less, your view, Doctor Gilkey, that the concept

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the plaintiffs' argument, your Honor, that the model of origins
being proposed as scientific creationism is, in fact, a religious model
from Genesis.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We propose to have the witness testify on whether or not this model
exists without the deity. And the witness has already testified that a

whether, without the deity, there is a model of any kind.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Model of religious origin, perhaps, but he is not
competent to testify as to whether it's a scientific model of origins because,
as I understand it, he has not been qualified as an expert on science.

origins. He needs to make clear whether he is talking scientific or religious.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">THE COURT: (Continuing) of origins?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> Let me ask a few more questions and see if it clears
up the problem.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Doctor Gilkey, Section 4 (a) sets forth what it describes as
a creation-science model. In your view, is that a religious model or a
scientific model?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>My view is that, for various reasons which I will be willing
to spell out, but as will quickly be pointed out, and which my expertise
is slightly less than what I like to talk about, this is not the scientific
model at all. I am willing to talk about that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As I have indicated, I think there is no question but that the model
in 4 (a) is a religious model. I have already testified to that effect.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The question as I understand it now is, is there a model there that
is not a religious model, and I think that is a legitimate question considering
what I have just said. It follows up from that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And I would like to argue that there is simply no idea there at all
without the figure and the agency of a supernatural being. - In this sense,
there is no explanation. There is a claim that it can be shown that the
universe appeared suddenly. There is the claim that species are fixed and
change only within those fixed limits.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">192</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) There is the claim for the separate ancestry of
man and of ape. There is the claim for the explanation of the earth formed
by catastrophism, and a relatively recent inception of the earth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These are all, so to speak, claims. I don't think they are true but
that's neither here nor there. They are claims, but they are not a theory.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order for there to be a theory, in each case, as I've said, there
must be an agent. The moment you have the agent, you have deity. If there
is no deity, there is no theory. If there is a theory, it is religious.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Doctor Gilkey, have you written on the topic of the difference

</b>I have.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Could you describe to me briefly what the nature of those writings
have been?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I have written several articles on this subject. I have written
a book called <u>Religion and the Scientific Future</u> on the interrelations
of religion and science.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Could you, therefore, state for me in your professional opinion
what the differences between religious theories and scientific theories
are?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Wait a second. I am making a couple of notes and I
would like to finish these before we go any further.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">193</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Doctor Gilkey, can you state for us, please, in your professional
opinion what the differences are between religions theories and scientific
theories?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, let me begin by saying that I think that all theories
which purport to explain or seek to explain, and that is he general use
of the word `theory' that I presume we are using here—all theories do have
certain things in common. They appeal to certain types of experiences and
certain kinds of facts. They ask certain types of questions and they appeal
to certain authorities or criteria.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, they have a certain structure. That is, they go by the rules of
the road. They have in what in some parlances are called canons. That is
to say, rules of procedure. I would like to suggest that while both religious
theories and scientific theories have this general structure in common,
they differ very much with regard to the experiences and facts that they
appeal to, to the kinds of questions they ask, the kinds of authorities
they appeal to and, therefore, to their own structure.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And I would like to make some comments at the end, the experiences and
facts that science has, so to speak, in its own consensus come to agree
this is what we appeal to are first of all, observations or sensory experiences.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">194</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) They are, therefore, repeatable and shareable.
They are in that sense quite public. Anybody who wishes to look at them
and has the ability and training so to do can do so. These are objective
facts in that sense, and experiences are somewhat the same.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I would say that most religions, and certainly our traditions, when
they appeal to those kinds of facts appeal to those facts rather as a whole
to the world as a whole, as illustrating order or seemingly to a purpose
or goodness, and so forth. So, they can appeal to those kinds of facts.
That isn't quite so public, because someone might say, "It's very disorderly
to me," and so on. It's not quite so public.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But also religions appeal to what we call inner facts, facts about experience
of guilt, facts of being, facts of anxiety, death, and the experience of
the release from those anxieties or miseries, or what have you.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">These are public in the sense that they are shared by the community
but they are not public at all in that sense. They are not objective in
that sense.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The kinds of questions that they ask are significantly different, it
seems to me. That is to say, science tends to ask `how' questions. What
kinds of things are there? What kinds of relations do they have? What sort
of processes are there? Can we find any laws within those
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">195</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) processes? Can we set up a set of invariable relations
if P then Q, if this, then that. This is the kind of question. These are
`how' questions, process questions, if you will.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Religion asks, might ask some of these questions, but basically it is
asking `why' questions. It is asking questions of meaning. Why is the world
here? Why am I here? Who am I? What am I called to do? What is it my task
in life to be? Where are we going? How are we to understand the presence
of evil? These are quite significantly different kinds of questions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Correspondingly, science appeals to the authority, and this is decisive,
of logical coherence and experimental adequacy. It also appeals through
coherence with other established views and to some things that are called
fruitlessnesses. There is also a sense of elegance. Now, when you work
that out in terms of its cash value, you have, as has been said before,
the consensus of the scientific community on these matters. And there almost
always is a consensus of the community making such a judgment.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is an earned authority. It is not granted by some other power.
It is earned by expertise, by training, by excellence at work. Religions
generally appeal to revelation of some sort, not always to the same sort,
but
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">196</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) some manifestation of the divine or some place
where the divine is encountered.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, in Buddhism, what is called the higher consciousness might
be a very important authority. Subsequently to that, of course, are those
who mediate that authority, to the interpreters of the Book, to the spokesman
for the church, for the community, to those who have an intimate and direct
and unique relationship to God. It can take all kinds of forms—To a particular
kind of religious experience and so on. Notice these are not in that way
public. They are not generally earned. They are given; they are granted.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>The authority in Christianity, is there one particular reference
or source of authority?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, of course, this has been the subject of a good deal of
friendly debate. That is to say, this was an issue with the Gnostics we
were speaking of, whether the apostolic churches—The scriptures were not
then canonized, but whether the apostolic churches were the authority or
just anybody.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Later it came to be agreed the scriptures, the apostolic scriptures,
and they were given authority because they were believed to be written
by the Apostles, the apostolic scriptures and the apostolic church were
the dual and not separable authorities.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">197</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">By the time one gets to the Reformation, there is a real argument over
this. Are both tradition and authority an ascription authority or solely
scriptural, that is, scripture alone, which, of course, was the Lutheran
and then the Calvinist position, and has been a basis for Protestantism.
So that in each case the authority appealed to is regarded as the place
where the divine is in some way manifesting itself or is speaking, and
that is the basis of the authority.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Does modern protestant Christianity include the Bible as the
scriptural source of authority?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I would say it better.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is that a yes answer?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>That is a yes answer.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>As a religious source of authority, do the concepts inspiration
and revelation also form a part of it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes, and there is a good deal of debate about what they mean.
Revelation is a fairly consistent word throughout the history of Christian,
and I think I could say Jewish, thinking.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The meaning of inspiration has varied a good deal. Now, we were talking
about the kinds of questions. I wanted to go on and talk about the kinds
of theories. In science, theories are generally laws; that is to say,
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">198</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) universal, necessary, automatic, impersonal, "if
P then Q&quot; kinds of statements. One of the most basic rules of scientific
inquiry is that no non-natural or historical cause, that is, no supernatural
cause, may be appealed to.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus one could say, I would rather take the canon as the scientific
inquiry. It's not a presupposition; it's a canon; it's a rule of the road.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Your Honor, I will have to interject an objection
on the grounds that this witness has not been qualified as an expert on
science. He is qualified as a theologian. His testimony has gone at some
length now, and I thought it was going to be brief. Therefore, I would
have to object to this line of testimony and move to strike the previous
testimony to the extent he is discussing what is science.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> Your Honor, the witness has written on the differences
between science and religion, and speaks as a philosopher on this topic.
His resume so reflects those topics.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> That's what I recall. I think he is qualified to offer
his opinion.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> He is offered only as a theologian, your Honor,
by the plaintiffs.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> I might broaden that offer if that
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">199</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. SIANO: (Continuing) might give Mr. Williams some comfort, your Honor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Go ahead.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. SIANO: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>You were taking about theories.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes. It reflects, as I said, a universal necessary concept
of law or separate and variable relations. It does not and cannot, and
I think this is also true in the discipline of history and, perhaps, of
the law, cannot appeal to a supernatural cause in its explanations. It
is verified by a particular shamble, objective, sensory kind of experiment
and has its origin in that, or as better put falsified. Non-falsifiable
by those. And where religious theories concern God in our tradition they
use a quite different kin of language, a symbolic language, about God.
They invoke personal causes, intentions, will. God created the world with
a design, God created the world in order that it be good, God created the
world out of compassion or out of love, and so forth and so on. These are
familiar ways of speaking of these kinds of acts.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Above all, perhaps most important, they have to do, religious theories
have to do with the relation of God to the finite world and to human beings.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If they specify only relations between persons or only
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">200</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) relations between forces of nature, they cease
being religious theories.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But when they specify the relationship to God, then they become religious
theories and obviously God is very much in the picture.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is very different from a scientific form of theory. They are testable,
if that's the right word, in terms of experience and, perhaps, in terms
of a new mode of living. That is to say, being released, being redeemed,
having a new kind of courage, a new kind of benevolence, and so forth and
so on. That is the kind of fruitfulness that religious ideas have where
it's quite different than anything scientific.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Now, are you, sir, aware of the field of religious apologetics?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I am.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Could you please state for me what your understanding of the
concept of religious apologetics is?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Apologetics has been used for a long time to describe certain
kinds of religious speaking and religious writing, or writing by religious
persons, with a religious purpose.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It refers to an argument by members of a community to those outside
the community, seeking to show the meaningfulness and the validity of the
doctrines, the
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">201</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) truths, the position of the community. This is
a very old tradition. One finds it, of course, in the earliest writings,
some of the earliest writings of the Christian church in a group who were,
in fact, called the apologists, and quite deliberately sought to speak
to the Roman empire and to argue for Christianity on the basis of what
Romans could accept.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One finds this in the medieval period. Saint Thomas Aquinas was probably
the great example of this in some of his documents. They are not theological
documents; they are arguments to the world about the truth of certain elements,
particularly the truth of the Creator. Certain elements, one finds them
in Jewish documents as well. You find them also in the modern world.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>The purpose of apologetics is that one purpose of it—to spread
the faith?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes, yes. I am not sure that `evangelize' is quite the right
word. Generally, we use the word `evangelize' with preaching. This is argument.
It is certainly to convince people, persuade people, and so forth, of the
validity of the faith, that one represents.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Does religious apologetics always speak with a religious framework
or does it use language and concepts from other fields?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, in seeking to speak to those without the

<P><font face="Times New Roman">202</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) faith it must find some kind of common ground.
This may be a common ground in morals; it may be in the customs of a community;
it may be in certain forms of philosophy; it may be—And in the scientific
age, this may be the best way to do it—It may be science. That is to say,
when it seeks the common ground of scientific facts in order to persuade
others of the validity of one's own idea.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In that case, one could say the ideas do not arise out of the facts,
but they are brought to them to show the ideas made more sense of the facts
than any other idea.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is what you are, saying, Doctor Gilkey, that even though a
religious apologist may speak in science, his purpose is religious?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>At this point, I would say the religious apologist probably
tends to disagree with some of the theories of science, seeks to except
the facts that science has developed and to show that his or her own idea
makes more sense of those facts.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>His or her own religious idea?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes, his or her own religious idea, correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you have a view, sir, an opinion, sir, to a reasonable degree
of professional certainty, as to whether creation-science is engaged in
religious apologetics?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I certainly do have such an idea. I look at the

<P><font face="Times New Roman">203</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) logic of it, and it seems to me precisely what
I have described. And there is a concept here of a sudden creation at the
beginning of separate kinds by a deity. That is an old traditional conception
within the Christian community, given here a particular interpretation,
I may say, which is presented as making more sense of the various facts
or some of the facts that are claimed to be scientific facts.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the structure, the logical structure, of apologetics. Now, let
me say there is nothing wrong with apologetics. I've done it, and I'm not
at all ashamed of that. I don't know how good it was but I have done it.
I think the only problem with apologetics is when you seek to dissemble
that you are doing apologetics, when you quote an authority, when one has
two hats on and hides one of them. This is what's the problem on it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Now, are you aware, sir, of whether or not —Strike the question.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Is the sectarian nature of the creation-science argument in any way
related to this opinion you have of its apologetic nature?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes, though let me say, apologetics are not necessarily sectarian.
That is to say, a good number of apologetics take the very general position
that is shared by all members of a particular religious tradition.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">204</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) In that sense one could say the tradition as a
whole is sectarian vis-a-vis other traditions, but that is not the usual
meaning of the word.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In this case I would say that is definitely the case. The apologetic
that is carried on here in the name of creation gives, and insists upon
giving, a particular interpretation of that concept of creation. In a sense
it is doubly particular, so to speak. It is particular to the Christian
tradition as opposed to others, though Jewish persons may agree with it
but on the whole they know this is a Christian idea. It is significantly
different from ideas in other religions, for example, Hindu ideas, Buddhist
ideas and, not least important, American Indian ideas. But also within
the Christian tradition it is particularistic, and that is why I am happy
to be a witness. It is particularistic in that it identifies the concept
of creation with a particular view, sets it over against evolution and
says, `This is what creation means.' And it is a very particular view.
It's been made evident here, a literal interpretation of creation, of creation
in recent time, of fixed species, and so forth and so on.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>In your examination of Act 590, Doctor Gilkey, are you aware
of whether or not the Act sets up a dualist

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) approach to origins?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>It seems to me it very definitely does. And that is to say,
I agree with the testimony that said its kind of neutrality presupposes
that there are only two views and these are mutually exclusive.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I think on both counts, that is to say that there are only two views
and on the account that they are mutually exclusive, are both factually
wrong.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">That is to say, there are many other views of origins than these two
views. There are other views within the history of religions; there are
other views within philosophical speculation, although those don't have
a deity, as I've said.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One could list any number of views of origins that are significantly
different than either one of these. This is simply wrong.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, the view that these two are mutually exclusive, it seems to
me, is, in fact, false. There are people who believe in God who also accept
evolution. Now, that possibility depends upon something that I think is
not evident in the document. That is to say, that science is our most reliable
way of publicly knowing. — I certainly believe that. I couldn't come by
airplane and leave by airplane if in some sense I didn't believe that.

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) On the other hand, it is a limited way of knowing,
and I am speaking here as a theologian, as well as a philosopher. That
is to say, it can't and doesn't wish to and doesn't purport to speak of
all things, of all the things that are.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is difficult for science to get at our inner-personal being, which
I firmly believe. It is, as I said, by its own rules, rules out discussions
of a deity. In this sense it is not at all saying, as a science, there
is no deity. It does not presuppose there is no creator. It presupposes
that a scientific statement cannot speak of such a thing. Now, that's a
quite different matter. Some may conclude that is no creator. That is a
religious or philosophical judgment, not a scientific judgment. The limitation
of science is very important in this whole case. One might say science
asks questions that can be measured, shared, mutually tested in certain
ways, but doesn't ask a number of important questions. Personally, those
are the questions that interest me. That is why I am a theologian.</font>

</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">BY MR. CAMPBELL:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Professor Gilkey, can you distinguish between primary causality
and secondary causality in discussing origins?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes. And I must say I am glad you brought that up. This is
a distinction that arose during the medieval period and was made particularly
prominent by St. Thomas</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Aquinas to distinguish between two different types of questions about
origins.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another important issue in this: Not all questions about origins are
religious questions; not all questions are about ultimate origins.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One could ask, `What is the origin of —Well, let's see— the city of
Chicago'? That is a profane question if there ever was one.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One can ask about the ultimate origins of the universe. That is a quite
different kind of question.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Let me ask you this. Scientists cannot talk about first causality,
can they?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, I was getting to your question. The first kind of question
is a typical question about secondary causality. That is to say, out of
what set of finite forces and causes of various sorts did something we
now
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><a name="Page208"><font face="Times New Roman">208</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) see around us arise?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a question of secondary causality. It appeals to no ultimate
supernatural kinds of causes. It stays within the world of finite or natural
historical causes. If one asks, `Where did that whole system come from'
one is asking the question not of particular origins but of ultimate origins.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a philosophical but primarily a religious question — and I will
be willing to say why I think that is; I think I already have —in which
one moves beyond the available system of experience to ask about its origin.
And that is what Thomas meant by first causality.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Scientists cannot talk about first causality, can they?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I, actually—I would like to appeal to the point that was made
that I don't want to pretend to say everything scientists do or don't talk
about. However, I think in obedience to their own canons, they, so to speak,
will not do. If they do they are straying a little bit, a good deal beyond
what it is intelligent for a scientist, any scientist to talk about. As
Aristotle said, `Nothing can come from nothing'.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, one always has to presuppose scientifically that is something
before what we are talking about. Science does talk only about secondary
causes.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">209</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And cannot talk about first causality without getting into
theology or philosophy; isn't that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I believe that is correct. That is right.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>The question of how a finite form of life arises out of secondary
causality could be secondary or could be a scientific question, couldn't
it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Precisely.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Secondary causality is what we would ordinarily call, and I
believe you referred to, as natural, historical and human causes?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Nodding affirmatively)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>In your opinion primary causality would always be divine cause,
wouldn't it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, I think that is pretty near a tautology. That is to say,
when you are talking about something quite beyond the system of causes
that are available to us that we would in our own day call natural, then
the minute one is talking that kind of thing one is talking about what
is generally agreed to be a divine figure, a deity.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And so long as we are talking about secondary causality, we
are talking about an area that can be dealt with in science; is that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Correct. Anytime that scientific inquiry leaves the area of
secondary causality and discusses ultimate origins, it has

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) left the laboratory and is entered into theology
and philosophy?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I would think so.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you think that primary and secondary causality are discussed
in the Bible?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Oh, no. No, no. Those are words that came—Actually, the word
`causality' probably has origins, I think one could say, in Aristotle.
It certainly came down into Roman philosophy and was a way that those of
a philosophical bent who were Christians who wished to express what <u>creatio
ex nihilo</u> meant made the distinction between primary and secondary
causality.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you think primary and secondary causality can be implied
from Genesis and Psalms?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, I would say that some authorities, for example, St. Thomas
Aquinas who certainly outranks me, would say that that is the case. Now,
that is obviously a controversial issue. Some people say it is not Biblical;
it has no place in Christianity, and so forth. Others would say that's
a pretty good shot at expressing what Genesis has in mind.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>It could be implied then?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Oh, yes, yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you see the Bible as a guide in your own life?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I certainly do.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">211</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Would you use the Bible as a guide to your understanding of
the world?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Myself understanding, being a theologian, would be yes. That
is what I meant by saying you had better have the Bible as a basis.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, there are other things, for example, the tradition of one's faith
to take into account, but the primary source for a Christian theologian
is the Scriptures.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>So your opinion of your own religion would also be influenced
by the Bible?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes. Let me qualify that to say that when I teach other religions
I seek to present the other religions as much in their own point of view
as I can. But I think it is useful to remind your students that you are
a white, male, Protestant character and that they had better watch it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Would your opinions on philosophy likewise be influenced by
the Bible?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Oh, yes, indeed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And your opinions on science?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes. I hope everything is.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you think the scientific community is the only body that
can tell us what is and what is not in science?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>No, no. There are historians of science who are doing a very
good job at the present of reminding
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">212</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) scientists of a lot of things they've sought to
forget.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you recall our discussion concerning whether or not the
scientific community could tell us what is and what is not science when
I took you deposition on the—</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, let me put it this way. I think —Let me back up a bit
if that is permissible —that any discipline or any community has the right
to seek to define itself and has a kind of authority in that definition.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So, myself, I would go, first of all, to the scientific community if
I were asking what is science. What do they think science is? Now, the
qualification to that is, to take an example of my own discipline, religion,
I think we've had revealed to us a good deal that we didn't want to study
about ourselves by others, by the sociologists, by the psychologists, by
the philosophers, and so forth and soon, and in many cases they were right.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So that I think that what a discipline is, for example, anthropology,
chemistry, and so forth, is, first of all, something in which the members
of the discipline and those who have studied it, philosophers and the historians
of the discipline, have sort of first rank. But I wouldn't leave it entirely
up to them because we always tend to look at our own discipline with a
more loving eye than other disciplines look at that discipline.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">213</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>So, then, the scientific discipline should decide what is and
what is not science?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>They should certainly make up their minds about it. I think
if they are unclear about it, then we are in real trouble.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But let me say, when I am asked, what is the relation between religion
and science, I would certainly like to talk with as loud a voice as scientists
would on that relation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>You mentioned a moment ago that scientists have tried to forget
certain things and historians have reminded them of them. What things are
you talking about?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, the relatedness of science to the culture as a whole,
the ways in which scientific ideas have developed, and that sort of thing.
The, how shall I put it, the cultural relatedness of scientific concepts.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Scientists had kind of gotten off path?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>No, not the scientists. This isn't really their business. One
could say the interpretation of science, and it was similar to the interpretation
of my own discipline where most theologians thought that everything that
we said came directly from on high. And it took some historians to point
out that there was influence, the medieval period, the Renaissance, and
so forth and so on.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>If the scientists-and this is a hypothetical

</b>(Continuing) question—felt that there was some evidence to
support creation or creation-science as it is spelled out in Act 590, do
you think he should be free to discuss that in the classroom?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>What classroom?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>In the classroom.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, I suppose he could only discuss it in the classroom he
found himself in, but I have already made clear that I don't think it is
merely evidence that makes something scientific.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I am not sure I understand what scientific evidence is. think I understand
what a scientific theory is, and my own view is that science is located
in its theories and not necessarily in its facts, which are quite public.
I would say that creation is not a scientific theory and cannot be taught
in that way, so—</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I understand your position. What I am asking is, if a scientist
felt that there was legitimate scientific evidence to support creation-science
as it is defined in Act 590, would you favor his being able to present
that in the classroom?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>If he or she felt and was prepared to argue that this was a
scientific theory under the rubrics of the general consensus of what a
scientific theory was, then I think they should make that argument.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">215</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) Now, they can make that public, the scientific
community, that it is a scientific theory.</font>

</b>And you think that he should be free to discuss that in the
classroom?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Whether that is a biological theory or not in the classroom
of biology, I am not sure. I think that-Well, it seems to me that one of
the important things is that a profession be able to determine what is
or what is not within its general bounds. The general association of biologists,
I would say, would be able to be the final authority as to whether something
is a biological theory or not. I think these certainly could be well discussed
in comparative world views or some other such course. I don't think there
is anything wrong with that at all.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">"Mr. Siano: And not as a scientist."</font>

</b>(Nodding affirmatively).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you think that science should be more interested in how
to think about an idea rather than trying to emphasize that a particular
idea is true?</font>

</b>As I understand the scientific method, the

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) concentration is almost entirely on the how to
think about an idea. That is to say, as the scientific movement developed,
the emphasis became more and more on methods rather than conclusions. Conclusions
were regarded as always hypothetical, approximate, to be criticized, to
be changed. What remained solid was the methods and, as I've said, the
canons that makes a theory legitimate and so on within the scientific world.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So I would say yes, as a method they do concentrate on the how.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And in teaching how to think about an idea, should alternative
viewpoints be considered?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Within the realm of that idea, yes, certainly. That is to say,
I think alternative scientific theories certainly should be created, be
discussed. And if this one can make a case—I don't think it can, but if
it can make a case that's another thing. Requiring that it be taught is
another issue.</font>

evidence to support one of those parts, should not it be discussed openly?</font>

</b>My point has been that, say, evidence, scientific or otherwise,
a common experience, supports an idea, notion, that's not science. That's,
I suppose one could say, only philosophy. This makes sense of this. This
makes it intelligent. That is not the scientific method. So that the conception,
scientific facts proving or making probable or simply an idea, is not an
example of scientific methods.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, `openly' I don't know just what that means. I think this is a concept
that certainly should be openly discussed. Whether it should appear as

have no business stating they believe. That it came out of the Jewish scriptures,
there was little question. That is probably the meaning of what I meant,
but I don't wish to state what the beliefs of the various synagogues of
our country are or should be.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is creation a part of Greek religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Ideas of creation are there. They are significantly different
ideas about creation. They usually picture one god, for example, Zeus,
as arising out of other gods. In fact, he was regarded as one of the children
of a former god and winning a victory over other gods and, perhaps, establishing
order, and so forth and so

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) on. This is not the conception of absolute beginning.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>So the concept of creation as it is known in the western religious
circles would be different than that concept of creation in Greek religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Very significantly, and this is the thrust of a good number
of the early arguments of the church, as I indicated.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Likewise, would Western religious views of creation differ
from the Buddhist religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Oh, very definitely.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And, likewise, would the Western view of creation differ from
Babylonian religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes. Not as much as with Buddhist.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>So if creation-science were taught to a Greek, a Buddhist or
a Babylonian student, that student would not view it as inherently religious,
would he?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Oh, he would. They would view it as a Christian view. That
is very specifically what they would view it as.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>They would not view it as religious in their own—</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Oh, they wouldn't view it as Buddhism, certainly. They would
view it as simply wrong. They would have no question about that. In fact,
if you go to Japan, and China and talk with Buddhists, you will find this
is one

<P><font face="Times New Roman">221</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) of the points they really will tackle you on.
"This is an absurd idea", they would say. There is no question of its Christian
character when it appears within another context. They would regard it
as religious but not as true. And mind you, not everything religious is
true.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>They would only view it as religion if we were talking about
ultimate origins, wouldn't they?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>No. I haven't said that everything religious has to do with
ultimate origin, but then everything having to do with ultimate origin
is religious, which is a quite different statement.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>If there are empirical scientific evidences which support a
science or a theory of science, it would not matter if it were religious
apologetics or not, would it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, that is a pretty hypothetical case because I can't, at
the moment, think of a genuinely scientific theory which remaining a scientific
theory becomes a part of religious apologetics.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>But if there were?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, give me an example.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I am just asking you a hypothetical.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, I don't understand. I've got a blank in my mind. You
cannot help me out?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>You cannot answer that question?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">222</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I cannot conceive of a case in which a theory in science that
remains a theory in science—Now, there are many which might be regarded
as excluding certain religious theories, but I can't conceive of a case
which would become, remaining a theory in science, an aspect of religious
apologetics.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>If there were scientific evidence to the view that the earth
was less than four billion years old, that scientific evidence would not
be religious apologetics, would it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>No. It would lead the scientists to ask, how are we going to
understand this. Now, they might pop up with the idea of an absolute beginning.
Then they are not submitting a scientific explanation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I am not saying there aren't explanations. I think none of us know what
possible kinds of explanations. I would say that would be an interesting
event which would call for a total reworking of all scientific theories
that I know anything about and the production of other scientific theories
giving it in terms precisely of secondary causality.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Can there be such a thing as atheistic apologetics?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes. Of course, Bertrand Russell was a very good example of
that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I believe you mentioned that scientists ask `how'

<P><font face="Times New Roman">223</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) questions; is that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And scientist are interested in observable processes?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes, they are. Yes, we all are, but they use those as testing
devices in quite particular ways. That doesn't mean they are confined to
observable processes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>You stated that religion asks `why' questions?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Among other questions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And you opined, I believe, that the definition of creation-science
as it appears in Section 4 (a) of Act 590 was inherently religious; isn't
that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I would like a little heavier word than `opine'.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, is it your opinion—That's got more letters.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Okay, I'll settle for that. I would assert that. That would
be a better way of putting it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>In looking at the definition of creation-science as it appears
in Section 4 (a), there are six parts of that definition. I would like
for you to review that with me, and tell me where the `why' question is
in the definition of creation-science as it appears in Section 4 (a). In
other words, where is the `why' question in "sudden creation of universe,
energy and life from nothing"?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, as I say, there are other questions in religion than
`why' questions.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">224</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I understand, but you did say that religion asks `why' questions
primarily?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes, but that is not the only kind of question. `Where did
it all come from' is also a religious question, as I have stated, I think,
as clearly as I could. Where did it all come from, and that is number one.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Where are the `why' questions, though, in the definition of
creation-science as it is defined in Section 4(a) of Act 590?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Well, there are all kinds of answers to `why' questions in
number 1, inclusively in number 1, and that's why—</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I didn't ask where the answer are. I asked where the question
was.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In other words, aren't you assuming in making your assertion that the
definition of creation-science in Section 4 (a) is religious? Aren't you
assuming that your definition of creation-science is actually answering
`why' questions?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I said it was answering them, so I don't find the question
in any religious doctrine.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>You do not find a question asked in the definition of creation-science?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I haven't claimed that in a statement of a creed you find the
question to which the creed is the answer.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">225</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) What you find in statements of religious belief
are answers. Now, I said you can get at the meaning of those answers by
asking kinds of questions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, I said that, number one, states an answer.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I understand, but we talked about the `why' questions that
religion asks. Can you testify that there are no `why' questions -</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I can testify there aren't any questions at all there, and
I would say in any statement of a creed there aren't questions; there are
answers. And I tried to make that quite clear.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Theology is not, thank the good Lord, confined to questions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is it your opinion that science cannot answer the `why' questions?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>It depends on what you mean by `why'. There has been general
agreement since—and I think I am right—the seventeenth century, at least
since the impact of Galileo and the reinterpretation of that by Descartes,
an agreement that purpose kinds of causes, causes that appeal to purpose—What
Aristotle called final causes—Why is this going on—were not relevant to
scientific inquiry. And I take it that this has been generally agreed.
If you mean why did this happen—If you mean by that question
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">226</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) `what forces brought it about' and one could use
that, in ordinary speech, then, of course, `why are we having rain today',
well, the answer is because of a cold pressure front and so forth and so
on. That kind of `why' question, but the kind of `why' question that is
quite different, `why did it happen to rain on my wedding', is not the
kind of question the weatherman will be able to answer.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is there such a thing as religious humanists?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Yes, there certainly is. At least, there is a group that calls
themselves humanists that has written a couple of manifestoes in my lifetime,
I think, and a group called the Ethical Culture Society and perhaps some
other groups that are exclusively humanist and that also are happy to claim
the word `religious' connected with them, and I suppose the great founder
of positivism, Auguste Comte, sought to found a humanistic or positivistic
religion in the nineteenth century.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Once evolution begins to examine ultimate origins, it is not
within science, is it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>I would say so.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Are you saying it is not or it is?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>It is not within science. Yes, I am agreeing with a portion
of your question, it has moved out of science into a wider arena.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">227</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Into the area of theology and philosophy?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Right, correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>As one who has studied religions, are there any religions which
have taken evolution from its original scientific state and adopted it
as part of their belief system?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>They have taken evolution—Yes, I would say so, and I would
say some of the forms in the nineteenth and twentieth century of what you
would call, although they may or may not have liked that word, religious
humanism, have taken that form.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the great formulator of this was Herbert Spencer, though he
wouldn't have, wanted to be called religious, and he said he was an agnostic.
Nevertheless, here was a picture of the whole of the universe, and so forth
and so on, and there have been a number of evolutionists, Julian Huxley,
that was appealed to here and who is a good example of that. A good number
of them have taken that position.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is perfectly possible for this idea. There is a number of ideas
to leave its particular residence, so to speak, within a particular discipline,
subject to its canons and to expand out to doing the job of a religious
idea.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>In some sense, is evolution atheistic?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">228</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>No. That is to say, I would say any scientific method—This
is not a presupposition; this is a canon. It does not talk about God.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the same way history is atheistic. That is to say, a historical account
of he Second World War won't talk about the judgment of God.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I suppose law is atheistic in exactly that sense. An account of a murder
which explained the murder by an act by God, by God rubbing this fellow
out, let's say, is not an admissible theory.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In this sense, these are what we mean by secular disciplines. That is
to say, they do not bring in a divine cause as an explanatory factor in
what they are trying to explain.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This does not mean, and I think the example of the history of law made
perfectly clear, this sort of factor is not there. This is not a presupposition.
It is a rule of the road, a rule of that kind of talking.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is evolution consistent with Buddhism?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Now, there I will have to speculate on that. I don't put myself
forward as an expert on Buddhism. I would say no, not consistent with historic
Buddhism in the sense that historic Buddhism has held to the set of ideas
that are also true of historic Hinduism, namely, that time goes in a circle.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">229</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) Now, that is a significantly different idea than
nineteenth century and twentieth century evolution where time is lineated
and there is no set cyclical. Within those concepts, one cay say that both
Hindu and Buddhist conceptions state of the world as coming to be in the
cycle and then going out of existence again, and then coming in.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is not evolution. That is not at all the same idea. Now, the main
problem with Buddhism is they are convinced of the unreality of things
rather than the reality of things. Now, if you want to discuss that, we
can do it but I think that would try the patience of everybody in the room.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>You mentioned that evolution is not consistent with historical
Buddhism, but would it be with contemporary Buddhist beliefs?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>As somebody said, almost anything is possible. People in the
history of religion have put the two most seemingly antithetical ideas
together to create theory that one beforehand could have believe they were
going to do it. I would say this would take an awful lot of work on the
part of some enthusiastic Buddhist to put the two together, but it could
be done.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is evolution consistent with Taoism?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">230</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>My answer would be substantially the same. That is to say,
Taoism and Buddhism and Hinduism are forms of— Well, I am risky here—Pantheism,
Monism, where each have a cyclical view of time, insofar as they have any
view, and probably you have very much the same situation there.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>If evolution is expanded into a world view, will we get into
metaphysics?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>It depends on how it's done. That is to say, a metaphysical
idea is partly determined not by what it talks about but the way it does
about constructing itself. And those within the philosophical community
who still think metaphysics interesting and possible, and they are not
everybody, would probably be very much interested in the grounds, the warrants,
the reasons why an idea was advanced as being.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So, it isn't so much the content of the idea as its method or I should
say both of them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Insofar as you mean by metaphysics a view of a whole and a recent view
of a whole, I would say say. Yes, that is exactly what, for example, the
great philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead is. One could say it is an expansion
of some evolutionary idea into a total view of the universe.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>And once evolution is discussed in terms of metaphysics, it
is no longer science, is it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>It has a cousin once removed relation to science.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">231</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) Let's put it that way. It is certainly not at
that point dependent upon science.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is scientific inquiry generally set within a framework of presupposition?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Again, I am glad you asked that question because I think it
is good to try to clarify that point. I'd say there are two different kinds
of presuppositions we are talking about here.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One of them is that set of presuppositions, and it would be rather hard
quickly to state them accurately so that there's no disagreement, that
having characteristic of Western culture, arising out of the Jewish and
the Greek-Roman background.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, these are genuine presuppositions of the scientific method, it
seems to me, and that is quite rightly used. There was a very well known
book by E. Burt, <u>The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Empirical Science</u>,
which I think stated the point very well.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The puzzle would be the reality of the empirical world. The reality,
therefore, — The cognitive value of sense experience. The fact that the
world involves, we don't know what kind, but some sort of order. These
are presuppositions of the scientific method. There are other things that
I call canons or rules of the road that are really quite different.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">232</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) They themselves, perhaps, have presuppositions,
but they are not quite presuppositions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Is falsification a presupposition?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>No, that's an aspect of method, I would say. That is what is
meant by testing. That is not a presupposition; this is a canon. Every
idea that is scientific must be tested, and what we mean by that is, it
is not falsified. Or, at least, that's Popper's theory of that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you recall your deposition when I asked you questions concerning
presuppositions, beginning on page 135 of your deposition, I asked this
question: "Assuming a scientific inquiry is based on some, within a framework,
of presupposition, could a theory ever be truly falsified?"</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Siano interjected, "And that's a hypothetical question", which I
responded, "Do you understand what I am asking?"</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Siano again interjected his comments, "you started out assuming,
and that is what I asked, if it is a hypothetical question. Is it a hypothetical
question?" I responded, "Yes, it can be a hypothetical question. Actually,
it is a philosophical question."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Siano: "It may be a philosophy of science question."

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) This is your answer: "Falsification itself has
presuppositions, which is your answer. Without presuppositions that lie
in the back of scientific methods, there is no meaning to the word `falsification'.
You have to agree to having a mode of falsifying what kind of data are
relevant, what kinds of experience gets us in touch with those data, what
type of methods are relevant. What have to agree on that."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. CAMPBELL:</u> Mr. Siano, this answer goes on for two and a half

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> Your Honor, since the only appropriate use of this

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. CAMPBELL:</u> I am certainly not trying to impeach the witness,
your Honor. I am just trying to refresh his memory with regard to this
area of falsification.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> Your Honor, I haven't heard anything —</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. CAMPBELL: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you remember making that statement?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Well, let him answer —I mean, whatever point you are
making, why don't you just ask the question without referring to the deposition?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS:</u> I remember making that statement. I am under the
impression that I have just repeated it, but I may be wrong.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>So falsification does have some presuppositions?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Oh, yes, yes, and I have tried to make clear that those general
presuppositions that I spoke of first, lie back not only of, let's say,
the conclusions of science but the method of science. That is to say that
sensory experience places into touch with what we wish to find out about.
This is not a universally held view. In many cultures sensory experience
is regarded as the pathway to illusion.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, that presupposition is there if you and I are going to agree that
a sensory observable experiment will falsify an idea. We have got to agree
on that point. That is what I meant by the terms of falsification or in
the other side verification. They have got to be agreed on, and I think
has been becoming increasingly clear to the scientific community since
the rise of the empirical sense as to meaning what we mean, that some kind

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Does the history of science reveal that in actual practice
science is based upon creative leaps of imaginative vision?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I would certainly say so, though as I said to you in the deposition,
that takes a certain knowledge of the biography of great scientists that
I don't pretend to have within my—Well, I hesitate to say educated guess,
but my somewhat educated guess is, of course.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Weren't these creative leaps of imaginative vision, from an
historical standpoint, considered unscientific and illogical at the time
that they were being taken?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Correct in many cases; not in all, many.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Were the men and women who have taken creative leaps of imaginative
vision in science, to your knowledge, generally considered to be in the
mainstream of the scientific community in their times?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>When they took the leap, to use your phrasing, I would say
no. Shortly after they landed, yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Professor Gilkey, isn't the phrase, "creative leap of imaginative
vision" actually your phrase?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I don't know whether I ought to claim it or not. I don't remember.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Do you recall writing an article on the "Religious

<P><font face="Times New Roman">226</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>(Continuing) Convention of Scientific Inquiry", which appeared
in Volume 50, Number 2, of the Journal of Religion, July, 1970? Do you
recall whether or not you used the phrase, "creative leaps of imaginative
vision" in that article?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Yes. I am just wondering whether I thought it up myself or
picked it up somewhere else. I am not sure about that. It's a rather catchy
phrase, so I suspect I got it from somebody else.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Was Copernicus within the mainstream of the scientific thinking
of his day?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>That's a very touchy question. There was certainly— He didn't
arise like the universe, <u>ex nihilo</u>. Let's make that clear. There
were things that lay back, in my view. I am no expert on this. There are
many people who are. I think that there were many ideas, many possibilities,
Aristotelian, Platonic, Ptolemaic, and so forth that lay back of those.
He certainly rearranged things in a new way and this was, with some qualification,
a quite new set of ideas. It certainly appeared in his time as a new set
of ideas. It was not completely new under the sun, however.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Likewise, was Galileo in the mainstream of scientific thinking
in his day?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>By that time, much more, though the mainstream is a
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">227</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) very small river at that point. We mustn't think
of it in terms of the present. That is, the number of scientists who were
coming in that tradition is really minimal. We now think of science as
a very large part of the intellectual community. That was not so then.
So, within that Galileo certainly builds on foundations it seems to me
more than Copernicus did. Newton much more than Galileo.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Would it be fair to say that Copernicus, Galileo and Newton
all were somewhat outside the contemporary scientific community at their
time?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Well, I hate to bring up an old word, but one is almost saying
with figures like that, a chronological statement. That is to say, each
one of those is producing a really quite new synthesis of what was known
and, of course, giving new elements to it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why they are so important. This is why we know their names.
This is why Newton was such a transcendent figure really in the seventeenth
and especially, perhaps, the eighteenth century.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So that creative leap, imagination, everything, are completely appropriate.
This doesn't mean, as I say, they arrived <u>de novo</u>. Newton built
on Galileo; Galileo built on names that preceded him, including some Roman
philosophers, and so forth and so on, and lots of things

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) that had been going on. But I will be quite happy
to talk about the creative leaps of imagination. Now, the issue of testing
is a little different than a leaping, let's say.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">BY MR. SIANO:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Doctor Gilkey, what is your understanding of the meaning of
the word `secular'?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Objection, your Honor. That's not in the scope
of direct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> That's overruled.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> It's not outside the scope of cross. Let me rephrase
the question.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
</b>Because a concept is secular, is it necessarily atheistic?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Not at all, not at all. The separation of church and state
legally specifies what one might call the secular world. It is a world
of the law, a world of government, a world of our vocations that are not
grounded in, established by authoritatively ruled by in any way religious
doctrines or religious authority. Now, that world is a world of American
experience generally since the founding of the Constitution and by no
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">229</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>(Continuing) means is it irreligious. So, that, now, I've testified
and I've got to emphasize the fact that inherently science has a secular
character. It cannot be appealed to a supernatural cause.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In this sense it is a secular endeavor. Now, that doesn't mean it is
atheistic, and that is why empirically there are scientists who are believers
in God and there are scientists who are not believers in God. I suspect,
though this is speculating, that those believing or not believing is based
on other grounds than their science. In this sense if evolution is a secular
theory, and I believe it is, this doesn't mean at all and historically
it has not meant, that it was an atheistic theory. In fact, two of the
closest friends of Darwin argue with him at this point, Asa Gray and Wallace
did. And there have been a number of theistic evolutionists.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. SIANO:</u> No further questions, your Honor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> May this witness be excused?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">(9:00 AM.)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Mr. Williams, I have gone over the Motion in Limine
and the brief. Do you have anything else you'd like to say in connection
with that?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Your Honor, I think the Motion is largely self-explanatory.
I would just reiterate that the legislature has not seen fit to try to
define what a scientific theory is. Therefore, it does not fall to this
Court to have to find that either. And on this ground we think that the
evidence on that point should be properly excluded.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Perhaps you are right about that, that I won't be
called upon to decide whether or not this is science, but as I understand
the thrust of the plaintiffs' case, they first undertake to try to prove
the</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Act is, or the definitions in the Act, what is set out in Section 4(a),
is not science but religion. And I can't very well tell them they can't
put on evidence of that. I don't know whether they can actually sustained
that position or not.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> The point that I wanted to make in the Motion in
Limine is that what the Act says, that the scientific evidence for both
creation-science and evolution-science are to be taught, it never tries
to
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">243</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: (Continuing) elevate or state that either is a scientific
theory, as such. So that really is the only purview of the issue in this
case, and it really is irrelevant.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Okay. Well, I will deny the Motion in Limine.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Your Honor, one other preliminary matter that I
would like to bring up now. Yesterday— This may already be in the record,
but to make sure that it is, I want to move into the record those portions
of Mrs. Nelkin's deposition that I quoted to her yesterday to the degree
that they were inconsistent with her earlier testimony.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is pursuant to Rule 33 of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule
801 of the Rules of Evidence.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Okay, sir. Do you— I don't quite understand. Did you
read the parts that you wanted to yesterday?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Yes. The parts which I read into the record.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Well, they will be in the record anyway.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Well, I want to make sure they are going in as
evidence and simply not for the purpose of impeachment.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Counsel for plaintiffs yesterday made an assertion at
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">244</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: (Continuing) one time that some of the quotes being read
from the deposition could only go to impeach the witness.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> I think he was complaining about the method of using
the deposition and not whether or not it— Once it's in the record, it's
in there.</font>

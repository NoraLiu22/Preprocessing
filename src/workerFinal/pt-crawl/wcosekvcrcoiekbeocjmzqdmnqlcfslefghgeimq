<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>We made progress while responding to new challenges and tests during the past year. Some new problems have emerged in China's economic activities over the last two years, mainly tight grain supply, overheated investment in fixed assets, excessive money and credit, and shortages of coal, electricity, petroleum and transportation. If allowed to grow unchecked, these isolated problems could have had an overall impact. After sizing up the situation, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council promptly made decisions and arrangements for strengthening macro regulation. Acting on the principles of adopting resolute and effective measures, taking timely and appropriate steps, dealing with problems individually and stressing practical results, they worked to solve prominent problems threatening steady and rapid economic development through a combination of economic and legal means, plus administrative means when necessary. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the whole nation, their macro regulation achieved significant results. Destabilizing, unsound factors threatening economic performance were contained, weak links were strengthened, and large economic fluctuations were avoided.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>The main achievements over the past year were: the economy maintained steady and rapid development, overall national strength increased, significant progress was made in our reform, breakthroughs were achieved in opening up, social development was accelerated, and people's lives improved. China's GDP in 2004 reached 13.65 trillion yuan, an increase of 9.5 percent over the previous year. Government revenue came to 2.63 trillion yuan, up 21.4 percent. Retail sales of consumer goods totaled 5.4 trillion yuan, up 13.3 percent. The volume of imports and exports totaled US$1.15 trillion, an increase of 35.7 percent, moving China up to third place in the world from fourth in the previous year. Some 9.8 million urban residents entered the workforce for the first time, a figure that exceeded the target. Urban per capita disposable income was 9,422 yuan, an increase of 7.7 percent in real terms after allowing for price factors, and rural per capita net income was 2,936 yuan, up 6.8 percent in real terms after allowing for price factors. All of the above shows that China has taken another solid step forward on the road of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.</SPAN></P>

The basic ideas for the work of the government this year are: to take Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents as our guide; to conscientiously put into practice the guidelines of the Sixteenth National Congress of the Party and the Third and Fourth Plenary Sessions of its Sixteenth Central Committee; to continue to guide overall economic and social development by a scientific outlook on development; to strengthen and improve macro regulation; to make reform and opening up the driving force for all our work; to build a harmonious socialist society; and to promote the simultaneous progress of socialist material, political and spiritual civilization.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Taking all domestic and international factors into account, we have set our main targets for this year's economic and social development as follows: GDP growth around 8 percent, 9 million new jobs for urban residents, registered urban unemployment rate within 4.6 percent, rise in the consumer price index of no more than 4 percent, and basic balance in international payments. </SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Maintaining steady and rapid economic development is an important issue that the government must successfully handle. This is a period of important strategic opportunities for China, and the economy should grow rapidly, but not be allowed to overheat. Both drastic upturns and downturns in economic growth are bad for economic development, reform and opening up, and social stability. In setting the target for this year's economic growth at around 8 percent, the Central Committee took into consideration both what is necessary and what is feasible, as well as what will be needed to meet employment, price and other targets to ensure that the growth target accords with actual conditions. Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, targets are only guidelines for economic and social development and can be adjusted in line with economic changes. All localities should set their targets for economic and social development in line with local conditions and focus on improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth. They should not blindly compete with each other for the fastest pace of economic growth.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>To ensure completion of all the tasks for economic and social development for 2005, we will pay particular attention to the following three aspects in our guidance and planning work. First, we will concentrate on doing our macro regulatory work well. We will continue to eliminate destabilizing and unsound factors in our economic activities, promote economic restructuring and transformation of the pattern of economic growth, maintain steady and rapid economic growth, and keep overall price levels basically stable. Second, we will press ahead with reform and opening up. We will make reform the driving force behind all aspects of our work, integrate efforts to deepen reform with efforts to implement a scientific outlook on development and to tighten and improve macro regulation, and use reform to solve institutional problems in our development. We will open to the outside world more fully and make better use of both domestic and international markets and resources. Third, we will build a harmonious society. To build a socialist society that is democratic and law-based, fair and just, trustworthy and friendly, full of vigor and vitality, secure and orderly, and in which man and nature are in harmony, we need to unite all forces that can be united, bring all positive factors into full play and stimulate the creativity of the entire society. We need to properly balance the interests of all quarters and ensure that everyone shares the fruits of reform and development. We also need to balance reform, development and stability and strive to create favorable conditions and a good climate for sustained economic and social development. </SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>We need to focus on accomplishing the following four tasks for this year's economic development. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>1. Continuing to strengthen and improve macro regulation. In the present state of economic activities, we cannot slacken our macro regulation. We need to follow prudent fiscal and monetary policies and better coordinate our macroeconomic policies this year. We must adhere more closely to the principle of dealing with different sectors individually and expanding some of them while contracting others, and emphasize the role of market forces and economic and legal methods in consolidating and building on our achievements in macro regulation. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Following a prudent fiscal policy. The central government has followed a proactive fiscal policy since 1998 to counteract the impact of the Asian financial crisis and boost weak domestic demand. Time has proven that this policy is correct and that it has produced remarkable results. However, the scale of investment in China is now quite large and the amount of funds in the hands of the general public has increased substantially, making it necessary and possible for us to shift from an expansive proactive fiscal policy to an appropriately tight fiscal policy. We will appropriately cut the budget deficit and the quantity of long-term treasury bonds for development this year. The deficit in the central budget for 2005 will be 300 billion yuan, 19.8 billion yuan less than was budgeted in 2004. The central government plans to issue 80 billion yuan worth of long-term treasury bonds, 30 billion yuan less than last year, while allocations from the 2005 central budget for investment in regular development project s will be increased by 10 billion yuan. The long-term treasury bonds issued this year will be used mainly to increase investment in weak links such as agriculture, rural areas and farmers; social development; and ecological conservation and environmental protection. The funds will also be used to develop the western region and rejuvenate Northeast China and other old industrial bases; to support accelerated development in old revolutionary base areas, ethnic minority areas, border areas, and poverty-stricken areas; and to continue support for some on-going bond-financed projects. We need to do our fiscal and tax work conscientiously. Tax collection and management need to be tightened in accordance with the law by screening and standardizing all preferential tax policies and strictly controlling tax reductions and exemptions to ensure that government revenue rises steadily. Increases in general spending must be strictly held in check to ensure funding for key projects. We need to practice frugality and eliminate waste in all our work. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Continuing to follow a prudent monetary policy. We will appropriately control the supply of money and credit in order to support economic development while guarding against inflation and financial risks. We will improve financial regulation by flexibly using a variety of monetary policy instruments. We will guide financial institutions to optimize their credit structure, to improve their services, to provide working capital to enterprises that are profitable and have a ready market for their products, to provide more loans for small and medium-sized enterprises and for rural areas, and to maintain the amount of medium- and long-term loans at an appropriate level. To ensure safe, efficient and stable financial operations, we must enhance supervision of financial enterprises, vigorously yet prudently deal with all types of financial hazards and crack down on illegal and criminal financial activities.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Reining in the scale of fixed asset investment. We will continue to closely monitor the two valves of approval for land use and availability of credit. We will maintain the strictest land management system by improving policies and intensifying law enforcement. We will improve city planning and land management, further rectify the land market, strictly limit transformation of farmland for use in development projects and appropriately control the scale of urban development. We will accelerate our work of improving the policies and plans for key industries and the criteria for their market access. We will work hard to improve the distribution of investment and guide non-government investment into areas that are developing poorly. We will continue to regulate economic activities to further alleviate tight supplies of coal, electricity, petroleum and transportation. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Vigorously expanding consumer demand. We will implement fiscal, tax, financial and industrial policies that encourage consumption. Consumption on credit and other new forms of consumption will be developed steadily. We will improve the consumption environment, paying particular attention to strengthening the rural infrastructure, expanding rural markets and stimulating the distribution of agricultural products. New areas of consumption will be fostered by such means as expanding the consumption of services. We will guide consumer expectations and enhance consumer confidence to increase immediate consumption. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Keeping the overall price level basically stable. We will work hard to keep the prices of grain and other primary farm products basically stable at a reasonable level, focusing on curbing the excessively rapid rise in the prices of the real estate and means of production and appropriately handling the timing and magnitude of price adjustments for public goods and services. Supervision of markets and prices will be improved to resolutely put an end to price gouging.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>2. Improving our work relating to agriculture, rural areas and farmers. Solving the problems facing agriculture, rural areas and farmers remains a top priority of all our work. To adapt to the needs of the new stage of our economic development, we will implement the principle of industry nurturing agriculture and cities supporting the countryside and rationally redirect the distribution of national revenue toward the development of agriculture and rural areas. We will expand support for this development in a number of ways, with the focus on expanding overall agricultural production capacity, steadily improving grain production and constantly increasing rural incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>First, we will maintain, improve and strengthen policies to support agriculture. The process of reducing or exempting the agricultural tax will be accelerated. This tax will be substantially reduced or exempted on a broad scale throughout the country, and it will be exempted in 592 key counties included in the national plan for poverty alleviation through development. The livestock tax will be exempted throughout the country. Revenue decreases in local budgets brought about by reduced or exempted taxes on agriculture and livestock will be offset principally by transfer payments from the central government. Additional expenditures of 14 billion yuan from the central budget will be needed for this purpose this year, raising the total expenditures to 66.4 billion yuan. The agricultural tax will be exempted throughout the country next year, which means that what had been targeted for five years will be achieved in three. We will continue to directly subsidize grain producers, increase subsidies to farmers to purchase improved crop strains and agricultural machinery and tools, and continue to follow a policy of minimum purchase prices for key grain varieties. Comprehensive measures will be adopted to halt the steep price increases for the means of agricultural production. The central government will allocate an additional 15 billion yuan to increase transfer payments to major grain-producing counties and to counties with financial difficulties. This policy is of great importance for developing primary-level governments and all undertakings in rural areas in these regions. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Second, we will continue to make structural adjustments in agriculture and the rural economy. We will further develop grain production by stabilizing and increasing the acreage sown to grain, strengthening development of grain production bases and strictly protecting arable land, especially primary farmland. We will improve the geographical distribution of agriculture, promote its specialized production and industrial management, and develop distinctive agricultural undertakings. Development of farm product processing industries will be accelerated. We will energetically develop forestry, animal husbandry and aquaculture. Township and village enterprises and intra-county economies will be expanded.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Third, we will intensify development of irrigation and water conservancy projects and the rural infrastructure. Funding from state investment in capital construction and the sale of treasury bonds will be focused on developing irrigation and water conservancy projects, improving the eco-system, upgrading low- and medium-yield farmland, developing six categories of small rural projects [water-efficient irrigation, potable water supplies, road building, methane production facilities, hydroelectric plants, and pasture enclosure, tr.], expanding dry and water-efficient farming, and constructing roads linking townships to county seats. Greater priority will be given to major grain-producing areas in distributing funds for overall agricultural development. We will encourage and guide farmers to volunteer to work on small infrastructure projects that will benefit them directly. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Fourth, we will accelerate innovation in agricultural science and technology and spread of the use of agricultural technology. We will greatly increase investment in agricultural science and technology, raise innovativeness in them, and further improve the system for expanding the use of agricultural technology. Subsidies will be increased for expanding the use of important agricultural technologies.

We will intensify efforts to collect social security contributions and gradually turn over management to higher-level authorities. We will work out a plan for reforming the retirement pension system in government bodies and institutions. We will improve the system of subsistence allowances for urban residents, and areas where conditions permit may establish a system of subsistence allowances for rural residents. We will take good care of those injured and the families of those killed in the service of their country. We will also support the development of charities. </SPAN></P>

We will do our legislative work well, focusing on strengthening legislation to improve macro regulatory mechanisms, to respond to emergencies and to protect workers' legitimate rights and interests. We will press ahead with reform of the judicial system and safeguard judicial impartiality. Governments at all levels must support judicial and procuratorial organs in exercising their respective power independently in accordance with the law.

We will develop a sound mechanism for mediating and settling social conflicts and disputes, improve the system of early warning and the mechanism for prompt response to emergencies to ensure social stability, and work vigorously to forestall and properly deal with mass disturbances. We will improve all facets of public security and vigorously carry forward the development of a crime prevention and control system. We will severely crack down on all kinds of crime in accordance with the law, in particular crimes threatening state security, violent crimes, crimes committed by Mafia-like gangs, drug-related crimes and frequently occurring crimes against property to give people a stronger sense of security. We will improve our ability to safeguard public security and deal with emergencies to reduce losses caused by natural disasters, disastrous accidents and other emergencies.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>Since last year many catastrophic accidents have occurred in some areas and industries. These resulted in heavy loss of life and property. We must draw on the bitter lesson they taught us and adopt still more effective measures to improve our work to ensure production safety. We must strictly enforce the system of responsibility for production safety, strengthen safety supervision, and intensify inspection and law enforcement related to production safety to remove all kinds of hazards and prevent and minimize the occurrence of catastrophic accidents. We should now give top priority to coalmining safety by improving the systems and mechanisms for ensuring coalmining safety, giving more play to the role of workers in overseeing production safety, investing more in coalmining safety facilities and improving coalmining safety technology. The State Council has decided to spend 3 billion yuan this year to help state-owned coalmines upgrade their safety technologies. Local governments and coalmines must also invest more in coalmining safety. We must have a strong sense of responsibility to the people and truly make coalmining safer. </SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>1. Deepening the restructuring of government bodies. To make government bodies more streamlined, unified and efficient and meet the requirements for better coordination in making and implementing policies and doing oversight work, we will improve the structure of government bodies, clarify their functions and bring their staff sizes under strict control. This should put the responsibilities, organizational structure and size of the government on a scientific, standard and legal basis. We must solidify the achievements that have been made in government restructuring and solve new problems promptly. We will speed up restructuring of town and township governments, focusing on rationally defining their functions, simplifying their structure and reducing the number of their employees. We will energetically yet prudently press ahead with the reform of institutions on a type-by-type basis and standardize the way they are granted powers in accordance with the law. </SPAN></P>

We will further separate the functions of government from those of enterprises, state assets management authorities and institutions. We will resolutely transfer responsibility for activities that the government should not be engaged in to enterprises, the market or civic organizations, and maximize the role of civic organizations, industrial associations, chambers of commerce and intermediary agencies. The work that the government should do, it should do well. While effectively regulating the economy and overseeing the market, we need to pay closer attention to social management and public services by shifting more financial, material and other public resources to these areas and having leaders devote more energy to developing social undertakings and building a harmonious society. We will conscientiously implement the Administrative Permission Law. We will continue to deepen the reform of the system of administrative approval, further reduce the number of items requiring administrative approval, and standardize approval procedures.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>3. Improving the methods and means of economic management. We must thoroughly change the traditional ideas and practices of the planned economy. In pursuing economic development, governments at all levels must concentrate on serving market players and creating an environment favorable to their development. They must not make decisions or work to attract business and investment on behalf of enterprises, or directly intervene in their production and business operations. Leading cadres at all levels must enhance their awareness of the importance of guiding and their ability to guide economic work in accordance with the principles of the market economy, to act in accordance with international practices and to regulate economic activities mainly through economic and legal means.</SPAN></P>

We need to make innovations in our style of government and focus management on providing services to lower-level governments, enterprises and the general public. Administrative resources need to be better integrated and administrative costs lowered to improve administrative efficiency and the level of services. Government departments should not only strive to do their own work well but also improve coordination and cooperation with each other. We will improve the systems of public notifications and public hearings to expand participation of the general public in the management of public affairs.

We will conscientiously implement the basic policy of governing the country by law and the Program on Performing Official Duties in Accordance with the Law promulgated by the State Council, and speed up work to build a law-based government. Governments at all levels and their departments must strictly abide by the Constitution and laws, exercise their powers and perform their duties within their stipulated scope of authority and on the basis of the procedures defined by laws, and accept oversight. We will implement a responsibility system for enforcement of administrative laws and put a stop to overlapping jurisdiction and unfair practices in law enforcement. We will strengthen the administrative accountability system and investigate and prosecute administrative improprieties in accordance with the law. All departments must strengthen their internal management, actively cooperate with and support auditing offices and supervision departments in the performance of their duties in accordance with the law, and conscientiously correct any problems discovered in the process.

We will work to establish a scientific system for evaluating government performance and a system for comprehensively evaluating economic and social development. We must resolutely oppose formalism and the practices of falsifying reports. We cannot build any more "image projects" or "vanity projects" that waste both money and manpower. We will reduce the number of meetings and documents and improve their style. We should strictly standardize and regulate all kinds of inspections, evaluations and all other activities to determine compliance with standards. We should conscientiously follow the guiding principles of the State Council's Third Conference on Clean Government and intensify our efforts to build a clean government and combat corruption, focusing on reforms and institutional development. In conjunction with the Education Campaign to Preserve the Advanced Nature of Party Members, we will strengthen the education, management and oversight of public servants and work hard to turn them into a contingent of public servants with whom the people are satisfied.</SPAN></P>

We will enable our army to fulfill its historic mission for the new century and new period, focusing on the two historic objectives of ensuring that the army is capable of winning any war it fights and that it never degenerates. We will always assign paramount importance to the ideological and political development of our army to ensure that the orientation of its development is correct.

We will improve the army's logistics to strengthen its support capability. The army must be run strictly in accordance with the law and made more standardized. We will make the People's Armed Police more proficient and more capable of responding to emergencies. We will raise the people's awareness of the importance of national defense, improve the national defense mobilization system and strengthen the army reserves.

<BR><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3 COLOR="#AC5300"><B>Introduction</B></FONT>

<BR><BR> Fungi need protection just as much as animals and plants. If your country signed up to the <A HREF="https://www.cbd.int" TARGET="_blank">Rio Convention</A> [<B>CBD</B>] then your government has promised to deliver that protection. The <I>Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation</I> tells you how well your government is living up to that promise.

<BR><BR>Countries which have signed up to the <B>CBD</B> produce national action plans and reports saying in their own words what they are doing to protect nature. The <I>Micheli Guide</I> uses a few simple objective criteria to evaluate those documents from the point of view of fungi. The aim is to applaud governments which are achieving excellence in fungal conservation, and encourage improvement in those which are not. One mark is awarded for each criterion satisfied. Scores are given out of ten as follows: 10 (excellent); 9 (very good); 8 (good); 7 (quite good); 6 (better than adequate); 5 (adequate); 4 (nearly adequate); 3 (poor); 2 (deficient); 1 (seriously deficient); zero (totally deficient).

<BR><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3 COLOR="#AC5300"><B>Summary of findings</B></FONT>

<BR><BR><B>No action plans or reports were evaluated as excellent, very good, good, quite good, better than adequate, or even adequate</B>. Out of 324 action plans and reports examined, 43% (140) were totally deficient, 36% (116) were seriously deficient, 15% (50) were deficient, 4% (12) were poor, and 2% (6) were nearly adequate. This is compelling evidence that the Rio Convention is failing to protect Fungi, even though they constitute one of the biggest kingdoms of life. During evaluation, a similar neglect of chromistans, protists and prokaryotes was impossible to miss. The picture is bleak.

</TABLE>

<BR>Documents which are excellent need to contain: at least one separate section explicitly devoted to fungi, including a detailed review of their diversity within the country; a list of important fungus areas / fungal biodiversity hotspots; a review of the country's legal protection for fungi (including plans to rectify any deficiencies); consideration of all of the following fungal habitats / roles present in the country: decomposers, dung fungi, endobionts, freshwater fungi, fungi on man-made products (agents of biodegradation and biodeterioration), fungi on naturally occurring inanimate substrata (peat, rock, soil etc.), lichen-forming fungi, marine fungi, mycorrhizal fungi, parasitic fungi (agents of animal diseases, fungicolous fungi, plant pathogens); plans to rectify the knowledge gap for fungi, including raising awareness through, for example, inclusion in education programmes.

<BR><BR>In the tables below, each country is awarded an overall performance score with some weighting given to the assessment of its most recently published CBD document. To date no document examined has satisfied more than four criteria. There have thus been no action plans or reports which can even be considered as <B>Adequate</B>. Marks for individual documents are displayed to the left of each entry.

<BR>This guide to fungal conservation is named in honour of Pier Antonio Micheli (1679-1737), an Italian who was one of the earliest scientists to study fungi, and discovered that fungi produce spores.

<BR><BR><B>About the guide</B>. Countries which have signed up to the <A HREF="https://www.cbd.int" TARGET="_blank">Rio Convention on Biological Diversity</A> [<B>CBD</B>] prepare national biodiversity action plans and reports. Most countries have published several. There are already more than one thousand, and they are openly available on the Internet [<A HREF="https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/search" TARGET="_blank">CBD National Action Plans and Reports</A>]. Fungi form a major part of the biodiversity of every country of the world. The action plans and reports therefore need to be checked to make sure that fungi are getting proper recognition as part of each nation’s biodiversity, and that the conservation needs of fungi are being taken addressed. <B>You can help</B>. To date, only a few of the action plans and reports have been evaluated. Please download an <A HREF="http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli/cbd-report-form.doc" TARGET="_blank">evaluation form</A> and contribute an assessment. To help make the evaluation, you can also download an <A HREF="http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli/micheli_report_sr-nbsap-v2-en.pdf" TARGET="_blank">example of a completed form</A>.

<P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Commentary</B>

<BR><BR>This rating system is a blunt tool. It makes no effort, for example, to evaluate coverage of chromistan and protozoan fungal analogues, nor does it evaluate any proposed actions for fungi: it simply notes whether or not they exist. The review is, nevertheless, very revealing. Of 324 documents evaluated, only the six which were rated <B>Nearly adequate</B> could be described as doing anything positive at all for conservation of fungi in their countries and, in every one of them, there was enormous room for improvement. Over one hundred and ten reports (about 36% of all evaluated) mentioned fungi but did not clearly recognize them as belonging in a separate biological kingdom. One hundred and forty reports (about 43% of all evaluated) failed to mention fungi at all.

<BR><BR>From a fungal perspective, there is clearly an enormous need for countries to &#34;clean up their act&#34; in respect of fungal conservation. It is, for example, deeply depressing that a country such as Australia, which takes pride in its efforts to protect its biodiversity, can issue a twenty-year biodiversity conservation strategy where the only mention of fungi is in the caption of a single illustration. The situation is not, however, totally hopeless. Although no document was evaluated as adequate, the review shows that some countries are producing action plans and reports which could, with a little more effort, achieve the basic level necessary for fungal conservation. Reports from six countries were evaluated as <B>Nearly adequate</B> - the best among those reviewed to date, and another twelve reports were merely <B>Poor</B>. The countries responsible for all of the other action plans and reports reviewed were <B>Deficient</B>, <B>Seriously deficient</B> or <B>Totally deficient</B>.

<BR><BR>This review is ongoing, and constructive contributions are welcome. There are many action plans and reports available from the CBD website which still need evaluation. Members of the <B>ISFC</B> are encouraged to visit the <B>CBD</B> website, and study the action plans and reports of their own and other countries. In the cases of action plans and reports which do not mention fungi, or where coverage is poor, Members may wish to encourage and help those responsible for the documents to introduce or improve the mycological aspects. To do that, it is necessary to establish a dialogue. A good place to start is the National <B>CBD</B> Focal Point Contact for the country. The <B>CBD</B> website includes a <A HREF="https://www.cbd.int/countries/contacts.shtml" TARGET="_blank">list of names, addresses and e-mail addresses of those national focal point contacts</A>.

<BR><BR>Suggestions for improving the rating system used here would be appreciated, as would evaluations of other national action plans and reports from a fungal perspective using the same criteria. Please send any such suggestions or evaluations to Dr D.W. Minter [e-mail: d.minter&lt;at&gt;cabi.org], who maintains this web page. As new action plans and reports are submitted, they will be reviewed and added to this website. Monitoring the ratings for individual countries could be used to show whether or not change (and hopefully improvement) is occurring in coverage of the fungi.

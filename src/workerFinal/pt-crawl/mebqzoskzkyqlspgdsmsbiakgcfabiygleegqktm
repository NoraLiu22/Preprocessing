1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

      <p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 33]]</font> One of 
        the most interesting branches of modern geology, and that on which recent 
        researches have thrown most light, is the inquiry into the exact modes 
        by which the present surface of the earth has been produced. When we see 
        a vertical precipice, a deep chasm, or huge masses of shattered rock, 
        our first impression is to impute these effects to some violent convulsions 
        of nature, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or floods. It is, 
        however, now generally admitted that such causes have had, for the most 
        part, little if any effect in modifying the surface, except when many 
        times repeated during long periods of time; and it is every day <font color="990000">[[p. 
        34]] </font>becoming more certain that even the grandest and most romantic 
        scenery of mountainous countries has been produced by the slow but long-continued 
        action of those natural causes which we see daily at work, but whose effects 
        during the few years that we can observe them are almost imperceptible. 
        These causes are, the ocean waves, running water, rain and frost; which, 
        if acting for long periods during which subterranean forces are also at 
        work slowly elevating and depressing large tracts of country and to some 
        extent fracturing and loosening the rocky strata, seem capable of producing 
        all the chief features which the surface of the earth now presents in 
        non-volcanic regions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a considerable number of 
        very remarkable phenomena which none of these causes will account for, 
        and which appear to have been overlooked or thought unimportant till about 
        twenty-five years ago, when the celebrated naturalist Agassiz visited 
        this country after having carefully studied the effects of modern glaciers 
        in the Alps. He it was who first showed that they could be all explained 
        to the minutest detail by the hypothesis of a recent &quot;glacial period,&quot; 
        during the continuance of which the mountains of Wales, Cumberland, and 
        Scotland were covered with perpetual snow, and sent down glaciers into 
        most of the valleys, and sometimes even into the sea. At first this hypothesis 
        was received with incredulity and derision, since it completely contradicted 
        the almost universal belief of scientific men that the earth had been 
        for ages cooling, and that all preceding epochs had been warmer than the 
        present one; but it very soon worked its way even among the most sceptical 
        inquirers, till at the present day there cannot be found a geologist who 
        denies the reality of the &quot;glacial epoch,&quot; or the correctness of that 
        interpretation which explains many peculiar features of our own mountain 
        scenery by the agency of ice.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal has since been written by geologists 
        and physicists on the effects of ice-work, but comparatively little has 
        been given to the general public; and as the subject is at this time again 
        attracting much attention, owing to new applications of the theory which 
        have given rise to much discussion and are greatly stimulating inquiry, 
        and as it requires little or no previous knowledge of geology to understand 
        either its facts or its theory, I have thought that a popular account 
        of such prominent glacial phenomena as are observable in all our chief 
        mountain districts would be acceptable to many readers of this periodical.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may conveniently consider the chief evidences 
        of a glacial period under the following heads: 1st, The drift; 2nd, Moraines; 
        3rd, 'Roches moutonn&eacute;es'; 4th, Grooved and striated rocks; 5th, 
        Boulders and perched blocks; 6th, Alpine lakes;--and in this order I propose 
        to record the few observations I have made during a month spent near Snowdon 
        and Cader Idris last autumn, <font color="990000">[[p. 35]]</font> incorporating 
        briefly what has been observed elsewhere, and adding some account of the 
        more interesting problems and discussions to which they have given rise.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st. The Glacial or Northern Drift.--This is 
        a layer of loose materials--gravel, clay, mud, pebbles, and angular stones--which 
        is found spread at intervals all over Northern Europe, and is very common 
        in the valleys and upland slopes of North Wales. It is very abundant all 
        round the town of Dolgelly, where it forms undulating slopes, mounds, 
        and hummocks in most of the valleys, filling up the space between the 
        flat alluvial meadows on the river side, and the steep rocky slopes of 
        the adjacent mountains. Wherever this is cut through in making roads or 
        railways, it is seen to be full of blocks of stone, pebbles, and large 
        masses of rock, distributed through it without any order or arrangement, 
        the top, middle, and bottom being alike in composition. From the contour 
        of the surrounding mountains it can be often seen that this deposit is 
        of great though very variable thickness, probably often exceeding a hundred 
        feet, and it certainly covers many hundred square miles of country in 
        North Wales alone. On ascending the mountains it is often found on their 
        less precipitous slopes and in the upland valleys, at more than a thousand 
        feet elevation; and it has even been traced around Snowdon by Professor 
        Ramsay to a height of more than two thousand feet. The materials of which 
        the drift is composed are various. Sometimes the rocks are nearly all 
        those of the surrounding mountains, at other times they are such as must 
        have been brought from a great distance. The geological age of the drift 
        is determined by its overlying all, even the most recent formations, and 
        by its containing occasionally marine shells of an arctic type and of 
        species which are all now living.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have materials of a loose and miscellaneous 
        nature which were deposited <em>in</em> the sea but not <em>by</em> the 
        sea. That the drift was deposited in the sea is proved by the marine shells 
        which have been found in it up to the height of 1,300 feet on some mountains 
        of Carnarvonshire; and we have thus a proof that North Wales was at a 
        very recent epoch sunk to at least that depth beneath the ocean. The presence 
        of the drift itself, however, at a height of more than 2,000 feet, would 
        prove a much greater submergence. That the deposit could not have been 
        made by the sea, is shown by the want of arrangement of the materials 
        and the abundance of large angular fragments of rock. Water always sorts 
        the materials it deposits. The rocks, the pebbles, the shingle, the sand, 
        the mud, are carried different distances, and deposited in different places 
        or in different layers. Water deposits are stratified. Neither can rocks 
        be carried far by water and retain their angles and clean fractured surfaces. 
        They get rounded into boulders or <font color="990000">[[p. 36]] </font>pebbles, 
        whereas many of the rocks and stones found in the drift are as sharp, 
        angular, and irregular as the blocks and masses which are detached by 
        the winter's frost, and lie under an inland precipice.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution of this curious problem of the origin 
        of the drift, is to be found in the history of glaciers and icebergs. 
        When a valley is filled with ice, the rocky <em>d&eacute;bris</em> from 
        its slopes and precipices fall upon the surface of the glacier. A quantity 
        of the earth and stones of the bottom of the valley is also forced into 
        the crevices or frozen to the bottom of the icy mass. Now when the ice-filled 
        valley terminates in the sea, large fragments of the glacier break off 
        and become icebergs, and floating away carry with them their load of earth 
        and rocks, which are deposited where they melt, or topple over, or are 
        stranded. In the North Atlantic as far as icebergs float, there must be 
        an annual deposit of matter on its bottom exactly of the same nature as 
        the drift, while in Hudson's Bay and the Gulf of St. Lawrence it must 
        be accumulating still more rapidly. When North Wales was one or two thousand 
        feet lower than at present, it must have formed a group of islands, among 
        which icebergs would frequently become entangled and deposit their loads 
        of foreign matter. At the same time Snowdon and Cader Idris would have 
        been sending down glaciers into the sea, which would spread the <em>d&eacute;bris</em> 
        of their precipices and valley bottoms on what are now the upland slopes 
        and low valleys, but which then were submerged banks and ocean straits. 
        As the land rose above the sea to its present elevation, rivers, floods, 
        and glaciers would more or less furrow and clear away the drift from the 
        valleys, and leave it distributed in the irregular manner in which we 
        now find it. The mere presence, therefore, of this unstratified mass of 
        earth, rocks, and boulders would of itself prove a recent glacial period; 
        since it clearly indicates the existence of icebergs and glaciers in seas 
        and countries where they are now never found.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd. Moraines.--Every modern glacier carries 
        upon its surface more or less of the <em>d&eacute;bris</em> of the rocky 
        valleys through which it passes. As the glacier moves downwards, these 
        are carried with it, and at its termination, where its waste by melting 
        exactly balances its downward progress, this <em>d&eacute;bris</em> must 
        necessarily be deposited, and form a more or less regular heap of rock 
        and earth called the terminal moraine. These moraines are sometimes destroyed 
        almost as fast as they are formed by the streams which issue from the 
        glacier itself or by torrents from the adjacent mountains, but under favourable 
        conditions they remain, and long after the glacier has entirely disappeared 
        tell the tale of its former existence. If owing to a steady change of 
        climate a glacier retires regularly, the moraine-heaps will be distributed 
        over the whole surface <font color="990000">[[p. 37]]</font> its terminal 
        ice-cliff has successively occupied; when on the other hand it is stationary 
        for a considerable time, the <em>d&eacute;bris</em> accumulates to some 
        height, and forms a well-defined terminal moraine. Some of the moraines 
        formed by the old Swiss glaciers, when they stretched far down into the 
        plains, are enormous. That of Ivrea in North Italy is many miles in extent, 
        and 1,500 feet high--a mountain of <em>d&eacute;bris</em> brought down 
        by a glacier which was sixty miles long. There is no other natural agent 
        which can form on level ground such regular mounds as these moraines, 
        many of which resemble artificial earthworks. Their presence becomes therefore 
        a very certain indication of the former existence of glaciers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In North Wales many very perfect moraines may 
        be observed. Around Snowdon in particular they are very abundant, every 
        one of the valleys which radiate from the central peak of the mountain 
        exhibiting them more or less distinctly. These are all described in Professor 
        Ramsay's little work on the Old Glaciers of Switzerland and North Wales; 
        and I can bear witness that, far from exaggerating, he has hardly dwelt 
        sufficiently on the wonderful clearness and well-marked character of this 
        phenomenon. The most striking of all are perhaps these of the Cwm Glass 
        Valley, which descends from the north of Snowdon to the pass of Llanberis. 
        At the mouth of this valley, close above the road which ascends the pass, 
        is what seems to the passer-by a steep rocky hill, but on viewing it from 
        an elevation about a quarter of a mile lower down, it is seen to be a 
        huge longitudinal roof-shaped mound of almost perfect regularity, scattered 
        over with angular blocks of rock; and whose position, with regard to the 
        sides and bottom of the valley, shows it to be an addition--something 
        put there--and having no relation to the proper contours of the surface. 
        Higher up the valley is a small but wonderfully perfect moraine, which 
        stretches across in a regular curve, and of almost uniform size and height, 
        so that when standing on it one can hardly help believing it to be an 
        artificial fortification. But the huge angular blocks of rocks scattered 
        about it, and the other signs of ice-work all around, with the wild loneliness 
        of the situation, and its inferiority as a defensive position to many 
        other points near it, utterly forbid this supposition. The best example 
        of the wide-spreading of rocky <em>d&eacute;bris</em> by the gradual retreat 
        of a glacier, is to be seen in Cwm Brwynog. Under one of the blackest 
        precipices of Snowdon lies the little green lake Llyn dur Arddu, on the 
        other side of which rises a steep ridge, most likely partly rock and partly 
        moraine. Beyond this ridge extends for nearly a mile a gradually-sloping 
        upland, so thickly covered with blocks of rock, often of large size, that 
        from a distance the herbage can rarely be seen between them. In this case 
        every one of these rocks must have been carried across the valley of the 
        lake and deposited where it now lies, and no other natural agent can be 
        found or imagined <font color="990000">[[p. 38]]</font> capable of doing 
        this but ice. Lower down this same valley, on the spur which separates 
        it from Llyn dwythwch, are portions of moraines deposited by the glacier 
        when, during its greatest extension, it descended to join that of the 
        vale of Llanberis. The moraines around Cader Idris are not so numerous 
        nor so well marked as those of Snowdon. There is, however, a very fine 
        one circling round Llyn y gader, under the highest peak; and lower down, 
        below Llyn y Gafer, is a rock-strewn slope, even more thickly covered 
        than that of Cwm Brwynog. Llyn Cai, situated in the tremendous chasm on 
        the south of Cader Idris, has also a small but very perfect moraine at 
        its extremity, through an opening in which its waters escape. I believe 
        that the existence of moraines and moraine matter, when as well marked 
        as those of North Wales, is of itself sufficient to prove that there has 
        been a glacial period. There is, however, much other confirmatory evidence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3rd. Roches Moutonn&eacute;es.--Glaciers are 
        often many hundred or even several thousand feet thick, and as they move 
        slowly over the surface their enormous weight, assisted by the gravel, 
        pebbles, and boulders frozen or imbedded in them, grinds down all sharp 
        angles, peaks, and jagged edges of the rocks, giving to them a more or 
        less blunted or rounded outline. The degree to which this grinding away 
        takes place must depend on many causes, such as the weight of the glacier, 
        its rate of motion, the material it carries with it, the time it continues 
        in action, and the hardness, toughness, and original form of the rock 
        itself. This peculiar effect of the passage of a glacier is very easily 
        recognized when once seen, especially if one studies the forms that the 
        rock assumes by natural weathering or by the action of water, both of 
        which will be seen to be very different from that produced by ice. In 
        the valleys around Snowdon and Cader Idris this form of rock-surface is 
        continually to be seen, and when, as is frequently the case, the comparatively 
        soft, slaty rocks can be compared side by side with hard greenstone or 
        grit, the first is found to be ground down to a smooth surface, gently 
        curved or rounded, while the second is left in irregular bosses and lumps, 
        all their asperities smoothed and rounded off, but not ground down to 
        an even surface. This can be well seen on the banks of Llyn Padarn, near 
        Llanberis. It is upon these <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es</em> that are 
        often found the peculiar markings we have next to consider.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4th. Grooved and Striated Rocks.--During the 
        process just described, it frequently happens that grooves or scratches 
        are made upon the rocks by the hard materials imbedded in the bottom or 
        sides of the glacier. Owing to the enormous weight and slow motion of 
        glaciers, they move with great steadiness, and thus the markings <font color="990000">[[p. 
        39]]</font> on rock-surfaces are almost straight lines parallel to each 
        other, and show the direction in which the glacier moved. Nothing is more 
        striking than to trace for the first time over miles of country these 
        mysterious lines, ruled upon the hardest rocks, and always pointing in 
        the same direction. In the neighbourhood of Llanberis they are so abundant, 
        that it seems strange they were not observed, compared, and speculated 
        on long before their true nature was known. The lines vary from fine scratches 
        to grooves in which one's finger may lie, and even to troughs a foot or 
        more in diameter. Sometimes on very hard rock the grooves are polished 
        by the intense pressure of a hard smooth pebble. On the east side of Llyn 
        y gader is an even slope of near a thousand feet at an angle of about 
        45º called the Fox's Path, and covered with loose fragments of rock which 
        roll away under one's feet at every step. It descends from a saddle between 
        two eminences of Cader Idris, and was probably long the path of avalanches 
        or small glaciers. In the bed of a torrent which descends this slope I 
        found, recently exposed, a large piece of yellowish porphyry, one surface 
        of which (about 5 in. by 3 in.) was slightly ridged and furrowed, and 
        highly polished. The rock is very heavy and excessively hard, and this 
        fragment is of itself a striking proof both of the presence of ice and 
        of its power as a grinding and polishing agent. I presume that the piece 
        formed part of the rocky bed over which the ice once slid, that it had 
        been split and loosened by atmospheric action and then covered up and 
        preserved by sediment and stones, till the torrent exposed it again, and 
        would soon have destroyed its polished surface had I not been lucky enough 
        to hit upon it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not only the surface of rocks <em>in 
        situ</em> that are thus marked. The pebbles, boulders, and fragments embedded 
        in the glacier are themselves equally scratched, but as they are capable 
        of shifting their position the grooves and stri&aelig; on them are not 
        always parallel to each other. It is this kind of material that contributes 
        largely to form the drift, and in some localities almost every boulder 
        and pebble is more or less marked. On close examination we can often find 
        proof that the grooves are really ancient markings by their correspondence 
        in appearance with old surfaces of the stone, although this is sufficiently 
        evident to anyone who sees their number, and the variety of rude masses 
        which bear them. These various classes of markings are all found abundantly 
        wherever glaciers now exist, and as no other mode of explaining their 
        occurrence has ever been suggested, they may be considered to form the 
        best and most convincing of all the various proofs of the former existence 
        of glaciers and icebergs in places where they are not now found.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5th. Boulders and Perched Blocks.--As a glacier 
        in its passage down a valley covers many irregularities of ground, <font color="990000">[[p. 
        40]]</font> sometimes passing over lateral spurs or rocky eminences, so 
        during its retreat the ice-cliff which terminates it will pass over each 
        of these in succession, and will deposit on many of them some of the blocks 
        which form its moraines or the boulders it has brought down with it. When 
        the glacier has finally retreated, many of these blocks and boulders will 
        remain in positions where neither simple gravitation nor the action of 
        floods of water, nor the shocks of earthquakes could have placed them. 
        Very similar phenomena have been produced by the icebergs which deposited 
        the drift, large masses of rock having been carried and dropped on eminences 
        as well as in valleys. Not unfrequently these blocks rest upon rock of 
        a different kind from that of which they are themselves composed, and 
        they often rest on ice-worn surfaces marked by grooves and scratches, 
        showing plainly that the face of the country has undergone little or no 
        change since the ice left it. Many of them occur on the edge of precipices 
        and ravines, as is particularly the case at the torrent walk near Dolgelly, 
        the sides of which on nearly level ground are thickly strewn with large 
        angular blocks and boulders. One of these is 15 feet square and 9 feet 
        high, and has lower ground all around it. It is when they stand upon the 
        summit of conspicuous eminences, as they often do about Snowdon and Cader 
        Idris, that they attract most attention, while when thickly strewn over 
        level ground or on slight hillocks and ridges they are passed over by 
        the tourist as too common a phenomenon of mountainous countries to deserve 
        attention. Yet it is really as difficult to account for their presence 
        in the one case as in the other, without the agency of ice. Neither do 
        they form a universal feature of mountainous regions, as many suppose, 
        for, as far as my memory serves me, they do not occur on mountains of 
        moderate heights in the tropics. I have ascended many mountains in the 
        Malayan Archipelago about the same height as Snowdon, and on calling to 
        mind all the places where large blocks of rock were scattered about, I 
        cannot remember any that were not at the foot of steep declivities to 
        which they might easily have rolled. I much regret that I was not then 
        aware of the importance of minute observations of the kind. It appears 
        certain, however, that in hot countries and where there is no reason to 
        believe that glaciers have ever existed, this phenomenon of the wide distribution 
        of angular blocks of rock over slight slopes, level ground, and eminences, 
        does not occur, otherwise it would have been brought forward long ago, 
        as a complete disproof of the glacial hypothesis. In South America, however, 
        I did meet with one remarkable perched block, a tabular mass from 20 to 
        30 feet in diameter supported on two points of rock only, and as far as 
        I can recollect situated on a slight eminence, certainly not under a steep 
        slope from which it could have fallen. Its position was exactly such as 
        might be produced if it had been deposited by a grounded iceberg, but 
        hardly by any other means. <font color="990000">[[p. 41]]</font> It was 
        about half-a-mile from an isolated granite mountain in lat. 0º 30' N., 
        long. 68º 50' W.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This observation becomes of considerable importance 
        now that Professor Agassiz tells us that he has found plain traces of 
        glacial action in the valley of the Amazon. That glaciers have ever descended 
        from the Andes to the Atlantic ocean, a distance of more than 2,000 miles, 
        will hardly be credited except on such overwhelming evidence as even Professor 
        Agassiz does not pretend exists. There are not, however, the same difficulties 
        in the way of the supposition that icebergs once floated over what is 
        now the great Amazonian plain. A depression of 1,000 feet would sink the 
        whole of that plain deep under the ocean, and that such a depression has 
        occurred is rendered probable by the great extent and almost perfect level 
        of its alluvial deposits. Neither is it unreasonable to suppose that during 
        the glacial epoch of Europe and North America the temperature of South 
        America was so much lowered as to bring the line of perpetual snow down 
        to 12,000 or 13,000 feet. This would cause a wide extent of the plateaux 
        in South Peru and Bolivia to become the feeders of glaciers, which might 
        have been as much larger than those of the Alps, as the comparative height 
        and extent of the two mountain systems would lead us to expect. Such glaciers 
        descending the highly inclined Andean valleys would move with proportionate 
        rapidity, and might not improbably reach down into an almost tropical 
        climate and send off rock-laden icebergs into the warm inland sea that 
        then washed the base of the Andes. This, however, is quite a digression 
        from our present subject.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the very summit of Cader Idris there are several 
        detached eminences formed of large square and polygonal blocks, which 
        in some places stream down the slopes of the undulating surface of the 
        mountain top. Were they lower down we should at once pronounce them to 
        be moraines, but in their present position they are somewhat difficult 
        to account for. I think, however, there can be little doubt but that they 
        are due to the action of the snow and frost during the last portion of 
        the glacial period. As soon as the perpetual snow line reached the top 
        of the mountain, and the permanent glaciers below had all melted away, 
        there must have been a long period during which the rocks on the summit 
        were subjected to the alternate action of ice, snow, and water. During 
        the winter they would be buried under many feet of snow, which would be 
        forced into every crevice in the form of compact ice. During the short 
        summer the snow would melt from the surface, but the water in the fissures 
        would be probably frozen every night, leading to the further fracture 
        and displacement of the rocks. The pressure of the snow and ice in the 
        succeeding winter would force these always <font color="990000">[[p. 42]]</font> 
        a little downward in the direction of least resistance, and this alternate 
        action, combined with the character of the rock, which is here chiefly 
        basaltic and splits into rude tabular and columnar masses, seems sufficient 
        to have produced that mass of blocks heaped confusedly on the very summit 
        of the mountain, which almost always suggests to the mind of the non-geological 
        visitor some tremendous convulsion of nature, and makes him readily accept 
        the popular theory that the vast hollow of Llyn Cai is a volcanic crater.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 'Geological Magazine' for September, 1866, 
        Mr. Macintosh maintains that the action of the sea has had most to do 
        with the formation of the valleys, cwms, and rocky surfaces of the Welsh 
        mountains; and he particularly instances Mynydd y Gader, a rounded rocky 
        mountain between Cader Idris and the town of Dolgelly, as offering unmistakable 
        evidence of a &quot;seaworn summit.&quot; I therefore devoted an afternoon to an 
        examination of this mountain, and was much surprised to find all over 
        it what appeared to me the most unmistakable evidences of &quot;ice-work.&quot; 
        The mountain is composed of greenstone and lower Silurian flags, with 
        veins and masses of quartz. It is very rugged and uneven, consisting of 
        rounded lumps and knolls with numberless hollows and little valleys between 
        them. These are all more or less thickly covered with angular blocks, 
        slabs, and columnar masses, some standing on the very summits of the knolls, 
        others lying on steep slopes; but there is no arrangement of them in lines 
        or layers, there are no water-worn pebbles or boulders, no sand or shingle, 
        nor, as far as I could see, any sign whatever of the action of the sea. 
        On the other hand, the whole mountain offered the finest possible examples 
        of <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es</em>, the smooth slopes always facing 
        Cader Idris, from which the glacier had come. Some of these ice-ground 
        surfaces were as smooth as a pavement although formed on the outcropping 
        edges of the hard Silurian rocks, an effect which the sea <em>never</em> 
        produces. There is an angular block containing about twenty cubic yards 
        of stone, standing on the slope of one of the highest bosses of the mountain, 
        with no precipice from which it could have come nearer than Cader Idris, 
        more than a mile off, with a valley between. Owing to the exposed situation 
        of the <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es</em>, their surfaces have been much 
        weathered, and I did not succeed in finding good groovings or scratches, 
        though I have no doubt such could be found by a more careful search. With 
        this exception, the evidences of recent glacial action are seldom to be 
        seen more plainly than upon this mountain.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phenomena of existing glaciers and icebergs 
        have been now so carefully studied, and the various effects which they 
        produce are for the most part so well known, that there is no longer any 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 43]]</font> difference of opinion among geologists 
        about referring such phenomena as I have hitherto been considering to 
        the action of ice, even though the countries where they occur no longer 
        produce glaciers. But on the question of the origin of Alpine Lakes, which 
        we have now to consider, there is no such unanimity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6th. Alpine Lakes.--It is only about five years 
        since Professor Ramsay propounded the startling theory that almost all 
        the lakes which form one of the greatest charms of our mountain districts, 
        were actually produced by that comparatively recent irruption of thick-ribbed 
        ice over a great part of the temperate zone, which we can hardly contemplate 
        without a thrill of horror; and that during the preceding warm tertiary 
        epochs they were so scarce as to form no important feature in the scenery 
        of Europe. A short and simple statement of this theory is as follows. 
        In all districts where glaciers have been proved to exist there are numerous 
        lakes. In exactly similar districts where there is no trace of there having 
        ever been glaciers, there are few or no lakes. This holds good all over 
        the globe. Glaciers wear away their beds, as proved,--first, by the immense 
        quantity of sediment in all glacial streams; secondly, by the existence 
        of &quot;roches moutonn&eacute;es&quot; wherever glaciers have passed. It can almost 
        always be shown that the old glaciers have passed over the exact spots 
        where the lakes now are, and the size of the lakes bears a general proportion 
        to the proved size of the old glaciers. This theory of the glacial origin 
        of Alpine lakes is now the great battle-ground of physical geologists. 
        In this country Ramsay, Jukes, Geikie, and Tyndall are its chief supporters; 
        Sir Roderick Murchison and Sir Charles Lyell, its chief opponents. Every 
        year brings fresh evidence and new combatants; and as it is a question 
        of such great interest, and at the same time one rather of physical than 
        of purely geological science, I shall endeavour to give such an outline 
        of the subject as may enable the general reader to understand the question 
        at issue and form his own judgment upon it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point to be considered in explaining 
        the origin of lakes, is to form such a theory as shall not only show how 
        such and such particular lakes were or might have been formed, but shall 
        also account for their present actual distribution over the surface of 
        the earth. This may be learnt from good maps as well as by personal observation, 
        and is highly peculiar. In our own island we all know that it is only 
        in three mountainous districts that lakes abound; in Wales, in Scotland, 
        and in Cumberland. The lakes of these districts amount to some hundreds. 
        In Europe the best known lake district is that of the Alps, which contains 
        hundreds of lakes and many of very large size. In the Scandinavian <font color="990000">[[p. 
        44]]</font> peninsula lakes are still more numerous, abounding not only 
        in the mountain valleys but also out in the low flat country, which, as 
        well as all Finland and wide districts of North Russia, are literally 
        studded with thousands of lakes. In North America, while the middle and 
        Southern United States have scarcely any lakes, all the North-eastern 
        States, Canada, Nova Scotia, Labrador, and in fact all the northern part 
        of the continent, although much of it is level ground, is absolutely strewn 
        broadcast with lakes, which must number very many thousands of every size, 
        from the great inland seas like Lake Superior down to small tarns and 
        ponds. In British Columbia, Oregon, and North California there are also 
        abundance of lakes. In the great plateau of Asia there are lakes in plenty 
        in Mongolia, in Tartary, and in Thibet, and all along the northern side 
        of the Himalayas. But on going south from all these countries, the lakes 
        in most cases abruptly cease. On carefully examining the best maps of 
        Spain, a country of immense extent and highly diversified both geographically 
        and geologically, I can find not a lake marked upon them. The fine island 
        of Sardinia contains groups of mountains rising to 3,000 and 6,000 feet 
        high. It has a varied geology, presenting abundance of granitic, metamorphic, 
        tertiary, and volcanic rocks, and yet, according to a large Italian Government 
        map, it contains not a single mountain lake. The Atlas range of mountains 
        in North Africa presents us with no lakes. In America, the great West 
        India Islands, Cuba, Jamaica, and Haiti, appear to have no lakes. Further 
        south, the immense empire of Brazil, with its vast mountain ranges, its 
        plains, savannas, and innumerable rivers, is almost destitute of lakes, 
        except a few small ones near the sources of some of its southern rivers. 
        In Asia the immense peninsula of India and the fine island of Ceylon seem 
        to have hardly a true inland lake. In Africa, the Cape district and Natal 
        have plenty of mountains but no lakes. Central Africa, it is true, has 
        lakes, few in number but of large size. They are not, however, accompanied 
        by the immense number of smaller ones which occur in every one of the 
        before-mentioned &quot;lake-districts,&quot; and probably come under a distinct 
        category, as lakes formed by unequal subsidence and upheaval. Australia 
        possesses a few lakes; Van Diemen's Land, several; while in New Zealand 
        they abound, especially in the southern districts where large glaciers 
        still exist, and where there is a true lake-district very similar to that 
        of the European Alps.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here we have a most remarkable fact,--<em>the 
        fact</em> which must be considered in dealing with this question,--namely, 
        that in all countries and districts of the globe where the universally-admitted 
        evidence of extensive glacial action exists, lakes abound, and form one 
        of the great features of the country; while wherever <font color="990000">[[p. 
        45]]</font> there are no signs of ancient glaciers, or no reason to believe 
        that the country has in recent geological times been subjected to the 
        action of ice, these lakes are either very few, or (much more frequently) 
        entirely absent. So vast is the disproportion, that if we leave out such 
        lakes as are near the sea-coast, or in alluvial plains where they may 
        have been easily formed by changes in the course of rivers, and such as 
        in volcanic countries are formed in the craters of old volcanos, it is 
        probable that for every <em>thousand</em> lakes that exist in glaciated 
        districts, not <em>one</em> can be counted in all the rest of the globe! 
        There is, therefore, a strong <em>prim&acirc; facie</em> case in favour 
        of a theory which directly connects glaciers and lakes as cause and effect; 
        and the opponents of that theory, if they cannot absolutely prove it to 
        be false in a good many cases, should be prepared with some plausible 
        hypothesis which will equally well explain this prominent fact. Yet, strange 
        to say, I have been unable to find that any such hypothesis has been yet 
        put forth. Professor Ramsay's opponents all confine themselves to pointing 
        out the difficulties of his theory in particular cases. They say that 
        ice cannot travel up a long slope from a depth of more than 2,000 feet; 
        that it would remain immovable at such depths, the upper layers sliding 
        over the lower; that a glacier's power of erosion is very slight; that 
        the ends of some existing glaciers are seen to rest on loose moraine matter 
        without even disturbing it; and other arguments of a similar nature.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
        These arguments may be good or bad, and Professor Ramsay has answered 
        them all himself <font color="990000">[[p. 46]]</font> in the 'Philosophical 
        Magazine.' What I particularly wish to call attention to is the fact, 
        that the only theory put forward even by the most eminent of his opponents 
        is, that the depressions in which lakes lie (when they are bounded by 
        rocky strata and not merely dammed up by moraines) have been formed by 
        unequal disturbances of the crust of the earth or upheavals of valley 
        bottoms, and that the ice during the glacial period may have filled up 
        and slightly modified these basins, and also have prevented them from 
        being silted up, but did not form them. In no one case that I am aware 
        of has it been shown that the strata are thus tilted in opposite directions 
        so as to produce a lake basin, nor is any hint given why these tiltings 
        and depressions should have occurred in the proportion of a thousand times 
        in glaciated districts to once in countries that have not been ice-ground.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that lakes, however numerous, 
        formed beyond the limits of the ancient glaciers, may have been all silted 
        up and converted into alluvial plains while those filled by ice have alone 
        been preserved, seems at first sight to meet the case, but a little consideration 
        shows that it is quite inadequate to solve the problem. First, we have 
        no right to start with any other assumption than that lakes before the 
        commencement of the glacial period were distributed with some average 
        regularity over the different regions of the globe, if causes so universal 
        as tiltings and depressions of strata were the chief causes that produced 
        them. Secondly, if the present disproportion in the distribution of lakes 
        was caused by those not preserved by ice being silted up, it would show 
        that the process of filling up lakes is almost always very rapid, and 
        therefore that no lakes can be very old. The ten thousands of existing 
        lakes must therefore all have been originally formed just before the commencement 
        of the glacial epoch, and in a time not so long as has since elapsed; 
        and yet, during the whole time that has since elapsed, the process of 
        lake forming must have entirely ceased over more than one half of the 
        globe! Another, though a minor difficulty, is that it is necessary on 
        this hypothesis to suppose that the time the glacial epoch lasted was 
        many times longer than the time which has elapsed since the ice left the 
        lake basins, for we see that the existing lakes have been only to a very 
        small extent silted up, whereas the supposition is that ninety-nine hundredths 
        of the lakes of all the rest of the world were silted up during that period. 
        I have gone a little into this general argument of distribution, because 
        it is one that a man who knows very little either of geology or glaciers 
        may put forward without presumption, and also because it seems to me to 
        have been very much lost sight of in the discussion of this question. 
        We can all see that a true account of the origin of lakes must explain 
        their present most remarkable distribution, <font color="990000">[[p. 
        47]]</font> although very few of us may be able to form any sound judgment 
        as to what angle will stop a glacier's motion up hill.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, then, that there is at all events 
        a strong case in favour of glaciers having had something to do with the 
        formation of lakes. I therefore examined with much interest into the peculiar 
        arrangement and position of the small lakes of North Wales, to see if 
        they gave any support to Professor Ramsay's theory or seemed inconsistent 
        with it. We may conveniently group most of these lakes into:--1st, such 
        as lie in more or less regular bowl-shaped hollows of the mountains; and 
        2nd, those situated in longitudinal valleys. Immediately beneath the peak 
        of Snowdon are three great chasms, which contain small lakes at an average 
        elevation of 2,000 feet above the sea. On the east is Glas llyn, on the 
        north are the two small lakes of Cwm glas, and on the west are the three 
        little lakes of Cwm Clogwyn. All these lie in irregularly bowl-shaped 
        valleys with a comparatively narrow opening; they all spread out and are 
        larger within than the entrance to them would lead one to expect. Another 
        feature they have in common is a comparative flatness of bottom. From 
        below you have to climb a steep ascent or even a precipice to reach them, 
        but when you have surmounted this you find a rugged undulating surface 
        spreading out to the foot of the precipices which every where surround 
        it. Cader Idris has two somewhat similar chasms containing lakes, and 
        on carefully examining the Ordnance maps we see that there are numbers 
        of such lakes around the higher mountains, occupying lofty bowl-shaped 
        chasms with a more or less narrow exit. One of the largest of this class 
        of lakes is Llyn Llydaw, which is more than a mile long and lies right 
        across between two spurs of Snowdon, which close round it so as to leave 
        a very narrow entrance. How these valleys were originally formed it is 
        not very easy to understand, unless they can be connected with varying 
        texture and resistance of the rocks. The symmetry of their arrangement 
        around or on each side of lofty mountains is against this supposition, 
        and I have been often inclined to think that they must owe their peculiar 
        form to marine action during the various submergences the country has 
        undergone. However this may be, it is evident that such a form of ground 
        being already in existence when the glacial period came on, the ice must 
        have accumulated in these crater-like hollows to a great height, and pressing 
        forcibly on a nearly flat or undulated bottom while in slow but continued 
        motion outwards, could hardly fail to deepen the basin here and there 
        and thus form the little lakes we now see.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second class of lakes or those in longitudinal 
        valleys are generally situated at a much lower level, and are as a rule 
        larger than the mountain tarns just described. The two lakes of Llanberis, 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 48]] </font>together more than three miles long, 
        are good examples of this class, and illustrate very clearly their characteristic 
        peculiarities. There is a drainage into these lakes of about twenty square 
        miles of country, bounded on both sides by mountain ranges over 3,000 
        feet high. The whole of the glaciers from these had to pass out between 
        the ridge of the Clegr and that which descends from Cefn du, forming a 
        pass about half-a-mile wide, while the shores of the lakes are all along 
        bounded by steep and lofty slopes which would throw the whole weight of 
        the accumulated ice into the nearly level trough between them. That the 
        grinding power here was very great is evidenced by the fact of the shores 
        of these lakes presenting finer cases of striation and grooving, of mamellation, 
        and of complete planing off of the softer rocks, than are perhaps to be 
        found any where else in Wales. Now most of the other lakes show exactly 
        the same arrangement,--wide upland valleys with many tributaries above 
        them, and below them a sudden narrowing of the valley by projecting spurs. 
        This can in most cases be sufficiently seen on the Ordnance maps, but 
        it is still more striking to look down at the lakes themselves from a 
        moderate elevation. Look at the two ridges that meet together at an angle 
        and shut in the valley at the lower end of Llyn Ogwen, or the precipitous 
        slopes that confine Llyn Cwellyn, west of Snowdon, and Talyllyn, south 
        of Cader Idris. In these and most other cases the valleys containing lakes 
        are of very moderate inclination or nearly flat, so that the motion of 
        the glacier would be slow and would chiefly arise from pressure. When 
        therefore a sudden narrowing of the channel occurred, the ice would necessarily 
        accumulate just above the obstruction, and thus give that increased weight 
        and grinding power which are exactly the conditions said to have produced 
        lake basins. Without going any further into particulars, I may state generally 
        that the situation and surroundings of many of the lakes of North Wales 
        are just such as ought to exist if Professor Ramsay's theory be the true 
        one.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a glacier can only be now grinding out a lake 
        basin in the very thickest part of its course, it is very difficult to 
        see the operation going on. At the same time so much is known about glaciers, 
        and so many of the facts bearing upon this question are admitted by all, 
        that some conclusions seem quite clear. For example, all admit that glaciers 
        do (or once did) grind down the rocks over which they pass, to some extent. 
        The grinding is caused chiefly by the weight of the glacier, and therefore 
        where the glacier is thickest the grinding will be the greatest. Glaciers 
        behave like a very thick semi-fluid mass, flowing and filling up channels 
        of varying widths, and therefore accumulating where there are obstructions 
        to their free passage. Now where such an accumulation takes place in a 
        valley of tolerably uniform slope, there will be more weight <font color="990000">[[p. 
        49]]</font> and more grinding power than elsewhere, and thus hollows must 
        be formed. And a hollow once formed the ice is there so much thicker and 
        the pressure so much greater, and thus the hollow <em>may</em> increase 
        more rapidly the deeper it goes. Then there comes the objection, that 
        when the hollow is deep the ice at its bottom will be motionless, the 
        upper layers sliding over the lower ones.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who really knows this? It is a pure supposition; 
        and there seem to be as good arguments on one side as on the other. And 
        who, of all our philosophers previous to direct observation, would have 
        supposed that glaciers could flow at all, and retain their form and continuity? 
        The fact seems to be, that these huge ancient glaciers, spreading over 
        hundreds of miles of flat country half-a-mile thick, are too vast for 
        us to say what they could have or could not have done.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proverbially hard to prove a negative, 
        and at present there is really no positive theory before the world, except 
        Professor Ramsay's, that in any way explains either the overwhelming proportion 
        of lakes situated in glaciated regions--or the fact that so many of the 
        great lakes of Switzerland and Italy are situated exactly where they should 
        be if they were ground out by glaciers,--or that the size and depth of 
        the lakes correspond to the admitted size and thickness of the ancient 
        glaciers. Many who oppose this theory will perhaps say that they admit 
        it to be good as regards the smaller lakes and tarns, but uphold the elevation 
        and subsidence theory for the larger ones. But this will in no way avoid 
        the difficulties of distribution I have already pointed out, since the 
        large lakes are very numerous and, as well as the small ones, abruptly 
        cease before reaching the limits of the ancient glaciers,--limits, it 
        must be remembered, traced before this theory was enunciated, and by men 
        who even now do not all adopt it. Again the lakes form such a continuous 
        series in position, form, and magnitude, that the presumption is against 
        their having been formed by two quite distinct processes. Lakes have, 
        no doubt, been sometimes formed by disturbance, tilting, or subsidence; 
        but these are evidently exceptional causes, and are not to be assumed 
        in any particular case unless they can be proved.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with this subject, I may allude 
        to one main point of difference which has existed among geologists almost 
        since the subject first attracted attention, and which still exists. It 
        is the question whether the glacial phenomena, so abundant over the whole 
        of the northern half of North America, have been produced by enormous 
        a&euml;rial glacial masses, covering at once or at different times the 
        whole country,--or by icebergs floating down over it and grating along 
        a shallow sea-bottom. Agassiz first propounded the &quot;glacier&quot; theory, and 
        still upholds it. Sir W. Logan supports the same theory, and Professor 
        Ramsay of course considers <font color="990000">[[p. 50]]</font> that 
        the vast American lakes are to some extent a proof of it. On the other 
        hand Sir Roderick Murchison, Sir Charles Lyell, and Mr. Dawson, all geologists 
        of the greatest eminence, maintain the &quot;iceberg&quot; theory. Exactly the same 
        difference of opinion occurs as to many other countries, such as North 
        Russia, Finland, and even Scotland, but we will now consider America only, 
        because I wish to state one difficulty which I cannot find alluded to 
        in all that has been written on the subject in this country. The iceberg 
        theory supposes that all the lake regions of North America were about 
        a thousand feet under the sea at a very recent period, that the country 
        was then ground and striated by icebergs, and has since risen to its present 
        level. Now the great lakes, Michigan and Huron, are a thousand feet deep, 
        their bottoms being about four hundred feet below the sea-level. When 
        the land rose up these vast basins must have been full of salt water. 
        What has become of it? No doubt it would soon run off at the surface, 
        and be replaced by fresh, but as a mere physical problem, would <em>all</em> 
        the salt water from a thousand feet deep be carried off by the influx 
        and efflux of fresh water? Has water ever been brought up from the bottom 
        of these lakes, and is it as fresh as that of the surface?<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if no trace is or ought to be found 
        of the salt-water lakes that must so recently have existed, a difficulty 
        of a totally different nature arises. These lakes and all the lakes and 
        rivers north of them to the Arctic ocean now contain great abundance and 
        variety of fresh-water fishes, and among them are many found in the lakes 
        only and some entirely confined to single lakes. There are about twenty-two 
        of these American lake-fishes described by ichthyologists, most of them 
        quite distinct and well-marked species, found nowhere else in the world. 
        About twelve are confined to the group of the Great lakes, and there is 
        one distinct genus of the perch family (established by Cuvier) which has 
        never been found except in Lake Huron. Now the glacial epoch is post-pliocene; 
        that is, it is within the period of existing species. The mollusca were 
        all identical with those now living; the vertebrates have been changed 
        a little, but chiefly by the extinction of some species. How then are 
        we to explain the occurrence of so many peculiar species and one <em>peculiar 
        genus</em> in fresh-water, lakes the whole district around which was so 
        recently under the sea? It may be said that the same difficulty affects 
        the glacier theory, for if that be true, the lakes were only made by the 
        ice and were not in existence till it left them. To this it may be answered 
        that the country round the lakes in every direction was in existence though 
        the lakes were not, and we need not suppose the whole land to have been 
        covered with ice at once. It probably took different directions<font color="990000"> 
        [[p. 51]]</font> at different times, according to slight changes of climate 
        and slow movements of the surface, and it is in accordance with all we 
        know of the laws that have determined the distribution of animals, that 
        so striking a modification of the physical geography of a country as the 
        formation of thousands of lakes should lead to many changes and restrictions 
        of the ranges of all animals, and especially of the fishes. The lakes 
        may have proved more congenial to some which had hitherto been confined 
        to one or two streams only, and may have preserved others from extinction 
        which were just dying out. But on the iceberg theory the difficulty is 
        immensely greater; for all the country north of the lakes (and much also 
        south of them) as well as westward, almost to the bases of the rocky mountains, 
        is so level that it must have been all under the ocean together; and it 
        becomes difficult to understand where the great variety of fishes now 
        inhabiting the streams and lakes of these regions can have come from, 
        or how in so comparatively short a time they can have become modified 
        into distinct local species. I leave this interesting ice-problem to those 
        among my readers who take an interest in the great case of &quot;Glacier <em>v.</em> 
        Iceberg,&quot; now being argued in the High Court of Physical Science.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><a name="2" id="2">2.</a> It appears 
        to have escaped the notice, both of Professor Ramsay and of his opponents, 
        that in the paper which immediately precedes that on the &quot;Glacial Origin 
        of Lakes&quot; in the Geological Society's Journal of August 1st, 1862, Mr. 
        Jamieson adduces evidence of the very fact which has so repeatedly been 
        denied in reference to Professor Ramsay's theory, namely, <em>that a glacier 
        can move bodily for a considerable distance up a slope</em>. Mr. Jamieson 
        states, that from the point where the gorge below Loch Treig opens into 
        Glen Spean, all the ice-marks indicate that the glacier had parted in 
        two directions, flowing both down the valley to the west, and <em>up the 
        valley to the east</em>, along Loch Laggan and over the pass of Makoul 
        into the valley of the Spey. This is proved by the lower side of the rocks 
        being abraded and smoothed above the entrance to Loch Treig, while lower 
        down it is the upper sides that are ice-worn. In Glen Roy also the same 
        thing has occurred, the glacier having moved up it instead of down it, 
        and discharged itself over the water-shed into another valley instead 
        of by what now appears its natural outlet into Glen Spean. A sufficient 
        cause for this extraordinary phenomenon seems to be found in the former 
        immense accumulation of ice in Glen Spean, rising far up above both these 
        low passes, as proved by plain ice-marks to the height of more than 2,000 
        feet. It would be very important to have an accurate survey made of this 
        district, with all the heights well determined, and a thorough examination 
        of the glacial phenomena it presents. These, as described by Mr. Jamieson, 
        clearly indicate that in two separate cases glaciers about twelve miles 
        long have been forced to move up hill, and to empty themselves over the 
        passes at the heads of their respective valleys; and that in so doing 
        they have abraded rocks at the sides and bottoms of the valleys, showing 
        that the ice could not have remained stationary below while it was flowing 
        on above. <font color="990000">[[on p. 45]]</font></font></p>

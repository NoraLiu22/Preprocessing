It is located in the heart of the Perigord, between Bergerac and Sarlat in the Dordogne region. The site has more than 250 etchings, line drawings and cave paintings dating from the Upper Paleolithic (Magdalenian, more than 13 000 years BP). With a length of over eight kilometres, this cave is one of the largest painted caves in Europe. Visitors use an electric railway to gain access to the cave. Research has identified numerous traces of claws and lairs left by the cave bear before human intervention. These galleries were decorated with 158 mammoths associated with woolly rhinoceroses, bison, horses and ibex. The figures are deeply engraved or painted black. Tectiform signs and four human figures are also present."><META Name="keywords" Content="cave, ice age, paintings, Rouffignac, Grotte, Belleforest, Perigord, Bergerac, Sarlat, Dordogne, etchings, drawings, Upper Paleolithic, painted, Europe, electric railway, claws, cave bear, mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, bison, horses, ibex, human, tectiform, Magdalenian"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="window-target" content="_top" ><meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> </HEAD><BODY><!-- this file started 19th September 2010--><br><br><h2><A HREF ="index.html#sites">Back to Don's Maps</A></h2><br><center><A HREF ="indexsites.html"><IMG SRC = "images6/wallsrectsm.jpg"alt="walls of china" border = 0 align=middle width="100" height="50"></A><A HREF ="indexsites.html"> Back to Archaeological Sites</A> </center><br><br><br><center><h2><b><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A></b></h2></center><center><br /><!-- CSS file for site and menu --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/layout.css" /><link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" href="https://www.donsmaps.com/favicon.ico"></center><center><script type="text/javascript"><!--//--></script></center><!-- Menu down Left Hand Side --><div class="left_menu">Navigation<ul ><li><a class="normal" href="abeltasmantrack.html">Abel Tasman Track in New Zealand</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="kimberleyart.html">Aboriginal Art of the Kimberleys</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginalrockart.html">Aboriginal art on the Northern Tablelands of NSW</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginals.html">Aborigines of Australia</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="pataudtools.html">Abri Pataud Tools</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="raymonden.html">Abri de Raymonden</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="mihisalisburyaccess.html">Access to Mihi Gorge and to Salisbury Waters below the junction with  Mihi Creek </a></li><li><a class="normal" href="loess.html">Achenheim -

La Grotte de Rouffignac, ice age art</h1><big><b>The cave of Rouffignac, La Grotte de Rouffignac, containing ice age art  has been known for centuries and was described in 1575 by Francois de Belleforest. It is located in the heart of the Perigord, between Bergerac and Sarlat in the Dordogne region. The site has more than 250 etchings, line drawings and cave paintings dating from the Upper Paleolithic (Magdalenian, more than 13 000 years BP). With a length of over eight kilometres, this cave is one of the largest painted caves in Europe. <br><br>Visitors use an electric railway to gain access to the cave. Research has identified numerous traces of claws and lairs left by the cave bear before human intervention. These galleries were decorated with 158 mammoths associated with woolly rhinoceroses, bison, horses and ibex. The figures are deeply engraved or painted black. Tectiform signs and four human figures are also present.</big></b><br><br>Text above translated from the French version of Wikipedia. <br><br><center><a href="images19/rouffignacIMG_1087wide.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/rouffignacIMG_1087widesm.jpg" alt = "Rouffignac" width="1000" height="404" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br>La Grotte de Rouffignac is set up very well for the tourist trade, yet manages to preserve the original feeling of the cave during the actual visit, paradoxically by the use of an electric train. <br><br>Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008<br></center><br><br><p><a href="images19/rouffignacIMG_1085.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/rouffignacIMG_1085sm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="527" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br><br>The cave is an extremely popular tourist destination, and has been set up in a very professional manner.

While the figures elsewhere are usually isolated or aligned in friezes on the walls and ceilings, here is an important set of figures, the largest in number, 66, in an apparently chaotic swirling pattern, in a particular topographical situation, that is, over a large funnel leading to a suction pit giving access to the second floor of the cave, a difficulty which is nonexistent a few metres before or after.

Of course, here we find the ubiquitous mammoth, the rhinoceros,  bison and horses, but:<br><br>- The drawings are often the largest and finest specimens of the cave, or more numerous: 11 out of 14 horses are here, with the largest and best painted specimens, as well as half the Bisons, including the largest.<br><br>- And especially the Great Ceiling accounts for all the ibex, which are absent from the rest of the cave.

It follows an arrangement of opposite sizes and opposite directions.<br><br>Inside this circle,  other animals of different species are distributed in the following way, also arranged  as a semi-circle, but less clear:<br><br>Compared to  Horses, the Mammoth dominates by number (ten times the number of  Horses and Bison) and size (large Mammoth). The Great Mammoth corresponds to small horses and goes in the same direction, only one small Mammoth corresponds to the large horse.<br><br>Compared to  ibex, bison dominate mainly by size: the great bison here corresponding to the large ibex but in the reverse direction, which is in every sense the opposite of the mammoths.<br><br>Going more to the centre, the two rhinoceroses, one on each side, in the same direction, on the largest side the great horse, on the smallest side the small Ibex.<br><br>The centre of this set is empty of animals, with, however, almost at the geometric centre, an almond shaped design looking exactly  like a large eye.<br><br>This set is complemented by:<br><br>Coming from the far end of the cave (thus towards the entrance), a group composed solely of mammoths, and joining the ends of the semicircles a large Ibex and a large Bison. <br><br>- Coming from the entrance of the cave, there is a complex group of bison (either entering or leaving), dominant by  number and size, and Mammoths (all entering).<br><br>This Scheme is not, in fact, totally correct. <br><br>Some figures do not conform to this plan. But then, we should note that it is most often only parts of animals which we see:  simple sketches of the back of a Mammoth, the nose of a Horse, as if the artist, realising his mistake, abandoned his design. <br><br>Five figures are in the gap of this composition: three mammoths, a horse and a rhinoceros (in quite different styles), pointed to the exit in inconsistent directions. <br><br>Note: <br><br>This has not taken into account that some of the figures have feet pointing to the inside of the circle and others outward: this is the result of  a flat projection on a half spherical surface. In fact, at the site, the observer sees the  animals standing on their feet. <br><br>This disposition  in half or quarter circles with  alternating directions sometimes leads  to confrontational positions, head to head. These are perhaps the mere consequence of the device, without being  conscious and meaningful. However, note that all three cases of confrontation apply only to the Bisons, as the group that entered the inner circle in groups where there are dominant Bison, either by number or by  size.<br><br>Finally, it follows from this general scheme that the animals are in groups, sometimes going to the well, sometimes leaving the well.<br><br>It might be considered that this organisation of the Grand Ceiling may be the result of chance or  just the simple disposition of artwork on the periphery of the well. <br><br>However the alternations and distributions are too systematic not to conclude that they the arrangement was purposeful.  The Grand  Plafond is a composition involving a prior design, but which does not completely rule out contributions more or less spontaneous and anarchic, either before or after the execution,  or execution errors that alter slightly the scheme of the director of the exercise. <br><br>Le Grand Plafond de Rouffignac, even if its meaning or details of its organisation may give rise to debate, is  indisputable evidence that some prehistoric caves give rise to a thematic organisation based on the idea but not on the scheme proposed by Professor Leroi-Gourhan.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Barrière (1980)</span></a><br><br><p><a href="images19/rouffrhinos.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/rouffrhinossm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="736" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br>Line of rhinoceros, painted in single file.

Robert, gave an initial inventory of works of the Great Ceiling and the  Breuil Gallery.  <br>The second, published in 1982, is the work of C. Barrier and is an exhaustive treatment of  what was then known.<br><br>Every census of the decorations of a cave stops at the date of its publication. It is inevitable that more discoveries will be made to add to the original census. <br><br>New discoveries have been made, with a not inconsiderable number discovered under recent graffiti, with the original paintings and engravings painfully teased out from the obscuring overlay of modern graffiti.<br><br>This process has identified several new paintings and engravings. <br><br> The surveying of the Rouffignac figures faces several problems. Firstly, the fragility of the underlying rock prohibits all contact with the figures. Then the relatively large dimensions of the works and the  large area of the supporting structures leads to deformations when one tries to photograph the images. Finally it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between natural marks on the wall and the trace of the lines made by the artists.  <br><br>So the approach had to be varied to best adapt to the imperatives dictated by the topography, the quality of the drawings, the techniques used by the artists, and the dimensions of the images. <br><br>Thus the drawings of the rhinoceros 259, the mammoths 175 (two), 180 (two) 261, 265, 268, the bison 267 and the tectiforme 262 are based on photographs which have been checked and corrected on the spot. <br><br>In contrast, the horse 260, the mammoth 190 (two) and 266, records were made in situ by preparing a panel of Perspex covered with plastic wrap, and  moved as close as possible to the wall without actually touching it. The image was then drawn on the plastic wrap, with the plexiglass used only as a work support. <br><br>Finally when the figures already studied by C. Barri&egrave;re were recorded, his statements served as a basis for their interpretation. <br><br>It should also be noted that given the importance attached to the site, certain lines appearing on the photo have been removed from the final image because they are recent in origin. <br><br>This is obviously the case with modern inscriptions, but also numerous other marks resulting from sticks or pen knives drawn across the surface, as well as marks traced by fingers were removed. <br><br><p><a href="images20/breuiltracing.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images20/breuiltracingsm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="314" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br>Abbé Henri Breuil tracing a design on a wall with a pencil on translucent paper.

The absence of a nuchal (back of the neck) groove and a hump above the eye, the non convergence towards the mouth of these apparent tusks as well as the low height of the brow counts against its identification as a mammoth. <br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a><br><br><br><br>The drawing of these two curves as an extension of the front of the drawing, and not, as is customary, starting from further back on the head, the difference in length of the two horns and finally the orientation of hatching on the brow suggesting a shaggy coat, shown this way several times in the cave when depicting rhinoceroses, act against the identification as a mammoth. <br><br>This rhinoceros differs from the others in the cave by the treatment of the horns as a single stroke, and not as two lines which is usual, thus depriving them of the sense of volume. <br><br><i>(Note, despite the above, it looks more like a mammoth than a rhinoceros to me. The head of a rhinoceros is commonly drooping down, not held high as in this case, and the interpretation of the  horns as those of a rhinoceros drawn as a single line for each I find unconvincing - Don</i>)<br><br>Beyond the description of this figure, its  integration  into the parietal art of the cave system needs little description. Indeed, to date, the Salon Rouge was regarded as a homogenous set of figures,  both technically and thematically.  This work breaks the thematic unity and increases the complexity of the decoration. Located on the fringes of the principal  frieze  but between it and two representations of  mammoths which complete the decoration of this chamber, it is integrated completely into the ceiling and makes  a single and elaborate panel.<br><br>However, the technical homogeneity is preserved since the implementation uses the same technique as the other representations of this chamber, that is to say hatching incising the clay coating on  the ceiling and exposing the  white chalk beneath. <br><br>  This technical aspect is important because it reinforces the coherence of this panel. Moreover, in the absence of formal proof, it gives credence to the idea that the whole setting of this gallery is the result of an  overall design and a probable simultaneous execution of the works. <br><br><b>Mammoth 175 bis</b><br><br><p><a href="images19/roufftectiformesmtest.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/roufftectiformesmtestsm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="416" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br>False colour image of the engraving known as Mammoth 175 bis. <a href="images19/roufftectiforme.jpg">The original image in black and white may be seen here.  </a><br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br><p><a href="images19/tectiformedrawingmammoth.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/tectiformedrawingmammothsm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="355" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br>Drawing of the image known as Mammoth 175 bis. <br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br><b>Mammoth 175 bis</b><br><br>This mammoth  is in gallery E.

The latter is superimposed on the schematic engraving of a mammoth. <br><br>The medium for the artworks is a wall covered with a coating of  clay, which allows etching without special tools.<br><br>In this case, the clay surface is less coherent and more powdery than the ceiling of the Salon Rouge.

The main interest in this drawing  lies in its association with tectiforms.

Two have been already published (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference"> Barrière, 1982) </span></a> and are depicted face-to-face; the back of the one treated in right profile intersects,  above the bulge of the brow, the shape of the mammoth 180 bis.<br><br>Drawn on chalk hardened  by a thin layer of calcite, it was drawn with a very sharp flint tool, producing a line whose thickness and depth are 0.2 to 0.3  mm. <br><br> Because the shallow penetration of the tool into  the rock beneath prohibited continuity of gesture, the line is divided into fourteen segments. The result is nevertheless excellent and the subject is in all other respects identical to its two companions.<br clear = "all"><br><br><br><br><b>Cheval 260</b><br><br>Among the unpublished figures, the most interesting is without doubt this engraving of the head and shoulders of a horse.<br><br>At 583 metres from the entrance, a large sinkhole near a drawing of a mammoth opens on the right edge of Gallery G. <br><br>A 50 cm wide crack in the rock opens at the bottom of this cavity. The work is situated about ten metres from the entrance to this narrow passage. <br><br>It consists of the right profile of a horse, 52 cm long and 32 cm high. It is drawn on the right wall in the narrowest part of the passage, only 48 cm wide at this location. <p><a href="images19/rouffhorse2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/rouffhorse2sm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="414" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br>False colour image of the engraving known as Cheval 260. <a href="images19/rouffhorse1.jpg">The original image in black and white may be seen here.  </a><br><br>The oblique angle of view of the photograph here, necessary because of the 48 cm wide passage the horse has been created in,  translates as a distortion in the proportions of the head and neck. These distortions disappear once the drawing/tracing on a transparent medium has been made. <br><br>As referred to previously, a transparent piece of perspex covered with plastic film was placed in front of those images which were either too large or too difficult of access (as in this case) to obtain a true representation by ordinary photography. The image was then traced onto the transparent film, which was then brought out into a suitable area for an accurate, distortion free copy to be made. <br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br><p><a href="images19/cheval260drawing.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/cheval260drawingsm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="458" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br>Drawing of Cheval 260, done on plastic film over a clear Perspex sheet. <br><br><br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br>The wall at that point is relatively hard,  and presents a surface which consists of an ensemble of shallow wells. The artist had freedom to choose any medium for his work, and chose to use engraving. <br><br>The depiction of the animal is limited to the head, the chest, the mane and half the dorsal line. The continuity of the line representing the ear, jaw and breast, the treatment of the lower jaw, and the indication of a forelock makes a face that fits perfectly into the stylistic conventions of the site. <br><br>Yet, despite these restrictions, this work is remarkable for several  original techniques.   This is particularly true of the mane in which there is an irregular 'rhythm.' It is  composed of five groups of hatch marks, with one for the forelock. Each group is characterised by its own profile of characteristics and dissociates itself from its neighbours by a shift in height. It is plausible that this fractionation results from the inability to stand facing the work, the artist then being positioned obliquely to his subject was forced to move several times during the progress of his work. This resulted in changes in the position of his hand against the wall, which changed the angle of the tool, causing the the five different profile features.<br><br>Perhaps it is also the reason for the set of  graphics governing the location of the eye. Without human intervention, a cupule or a shell could replace the eye. According to the observation point, forward or rear, each of these natural features can play this role in succession. Note however that it is  now impossible to say that the artist  deliberately kept this ambiguity.<br><br> The ultimate originality of this discovery lies in its location. The horse was hitherto at  Rouffignac regarded as restricted to certain areas only, namely the  Breuil gallery, where only two horses are known, the Grand ceiling, which contains a dozen horses, and the well of the Grand ceiling where we know of only one representation of a horse. The representation which interests us here, by its marginal position, leads  us to admit that the disposition of parietal art is more complex than was previously considered the case. <br><br>  <br><br><br><br><b>Mammoth 261</b><br><br><p><a href="images19/mammoth261falsecolour.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/mammoth261falsecoloursm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="476" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>False colour image of the engraving known as Mammoth 261. <a href="images19/mammoth261.jpg">The original image in black and white may be seen here.  </a><br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br><p><a href="images19/mammoth261drawing.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/mammoth261drawingsm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="577" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br>Drawing of Mammoth 261. <br><br>Although drawn with the fingers only, the line is deeply inscribed in the chalk powder of the ceiling, and the image features Palaeolithic traits easily distinguished from the other historical age marks (graffiti) on the surface. <br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br>This mammoth is at the beginning of the  Breuil gallery on the left edge of the ceiling. Like several other figures on the ceiling of this part of the cave, this figure is relatively high: 1.44 m. This is a figure constructed by finger marks in  five movements. The first step involves the evocation of the crown of the head and the nape.  From there, one line traces the forehead while the second shows the orbital bulge and the trunk  bent slightly forward. <br><br>The dorsal line of the back is also made in two strokes, the first of the  backbone while the second represents the rump  and the beginning of the tail. Note that while at the front of the figure three fingers were used, only two were used to the rear.<br><br>The discovery of this figure throws a new light on the construction of the decorations in this part of the cave. We shall return later to this new figure. Indeed, on the one hand, by its location, the figure shows that contrary to an old idea, one is not able to consider the Breuil Gallery as two long walls each supporting a string of two dozen  art works, and on the other hand, by its position, this image has left to the bear nearby on the wall its role as the main representative of this grand assemblage, which alters the interpretation made by A.

The decoration of this area begins with the frieze of three rhinos, immediately followed by three engraved mammoth silhouettes.<br><br>The decor is then interrupted  1.70m further on by the appearance   of a very clear arc of a circle. Such a line should not go unnoticed. It was, however, routinely neglected until now. We have therefore decided to use this forum to publish the discovery.  During  the process of the study of this image,  we realised that this a more elaborate ensemble than it appears.<br><br>Indeed, it appears that the curve is extended to the left by a horizontal segment of 12 cm referring to the beginning of a dorsal line. Furthermore, at the other end, a line less heavily drawn, an 's' shaped counter-curve, descends vertically by thirty centimetres, forming a frontal line.<br><br> Finally, a few centimetres to the rear of this frontal line, there are three short segments whose location corresponds to the location of a horn. The entire drawing has been made by fingers. The arc forming the top of the skull is strengthened and doubled along two thirds of its length, while the frontal line and the three small neighbouring segments are only barely indicated.  <br><br>The attribution of the image to a Bison may seem subjective, however, several arguments lead us to this conclusion. The first of these is the  absence of a nuchal (back of the neck) groove which is so characteristic of mammoths. The second aspect is the relatively low profile of the arc forming the neck. The third is the presence of three short segments located at the rear of the forehead; their location corresponds to the point of implantation of a buffalo horn. We will see later that the presence of bison in this area is in compliance with the disposition of the parietal art  of the cave.<br><br><br><br>  <b> Mammoth 190</b>   <p><a href="images19/mammoth190.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/mammoth190sm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="497" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br>Mammoths 190 et 190 bis.

The figure is limited to the depiction of the top of the head and the back. Like the mammoth 180 bis  previously discussed, we are dealing with an outline on a hard wall engraved with a cutting tool having produced a line consisting of many chips, each a few tenths of a millimetre in size.<br><br>The engraving is to some extent overdrawn by another work. However, it should be noted that, in this case, the two subjects are barely shifted laterally and vertically from each other. <br><br> The great similarity of the base or medium, the resemblance of the tools used and the  identical movements of the tools suggest that we are, in this case as in the other, observing an answer to a technical problem. <br><br>In addition, careful observation of other animals in the frieze has not resulted in the identification of any other figures of this type. We do not consider that this figure is merely a preliminary sketch. <br><br>On the other hand  reading this panel for understanding  is less complicated than  for the mammoth 180 bis because this engraving does not add to or subtract from  the rest of the frieze. <br><br>It seems that the hypothesis of simple abandonment of one technique in favour of another can be accepted.<br><br>Before concluding this section, we wish to emphasise that certain additions, at the trunk and legs, were made to record the mammoth 190, in order to correct damage by modern graffiti in order to allow a better reading of this work. <br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Tectiforme 262</b><br><br> <p><a href="images19/tectiform262insitu.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/tectiform262insitusm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="512" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images19/tectiform262.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/tectiform262.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="472" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br>Tectiforme 262 in situ (left) and alone (right). <br><br>  <br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br>This is the 14th tectiform of the cave, discovered in company with A. and D.

This unpublished tectiform is the first and smallest of the group. Despite its schematics, it fits perfectly within the framework of a group which we consider to be 'plumed' tectiforms. Indeed, amongst the characteristics of the tectiforms of this cave, this is a feature already recognised for eight of these signs, which is the marked prolongation of the 'mast' above the figure. <br><br>Some of these extensions are even accentuated by a repetition, as is the case with this 9th example of the  series and is a strong argument for attributing this work to the category of tectiforms.<br><br>  <br><br>  <b>Mammoth 268</b><br><br><br><br>   <p><a href="images19/mammoth268.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/mammoth268sm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="729" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br>Mammoth 268.<br><br>Here we can see that some lines are drawn as grooves by the finger in softer material, while others are drawn as solid clay lines with the excess material built up on the tip of the finger when harder surfaces are encountered.

The gallery to the right  contains  mammoths 252 and 253 which are the last graphical manifestations in this part of the cave. The mammoth 268 is located three metres further on, on the ceiling. At this point, the ceiling is 150  cm  high, and is pierced by a dome of about one metre in diameter. It is in this dome that the artist has put his work. <br><br>It consists of a finger drawing showing a silhouette and two tusks, the whole measuring 80 cm across. <br><br>Four strokes were sufficient to complete the figure. Starting at the bottom of the neck groove, a line is drawn to show the head and the trunk, while another represents the dorsal line, stopping at the start of the tail. The remaining two lines show the two tusks. <br><br>Despite this simplicity, which is customary with the Rouffignac artists, the work is well made; one can note the head held high, the bone of the supraorbital ridge above the eye is well marked, and the tusks are in proportion. <br><br>It is rather the structure of the lines of this work that is unexpected. Indeed, at this point, the presence of glauconite in the sediment leads to small sections of the surface being soft, succeeded by harder zones. <br><br>(<i>Glauconite is an iron potassium phyllosilicate (mica group) mineral of characteristic green colour with very low weathering resistance and very friable.  Its name is derived from the Greek "glaucos" meaning 'gleaming' or 'silvery', to describe the shining appearance of the blue-green color. Its colour ranges from olive green, blackish green, to bluish green. - Don, from Wikipedia</i>)<br><br>This discontinuity in the softness of the surface has caused irregularities in the trace left by the finger of the artist. <br><br>Where the surface was soft with glauconite, the finger has dug a relatively deep groove in the surface, while the excess clay was accumulating at the end of the finger. <br><br>When the surface became hard, the material gathered in the previous section was deposited as a drawn line. Thus the back, head, and almost all of the trunk are relatively deeply etched, while the rump, the end of the trunk and the tusks are drawn with the excess clay.  <br><br><br><br><b>Mammoth 263</b><br><br><p><a href="images19/mammoth263.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/mammoth263sm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="466" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br>Mammoth 263.<br><br>Although schematic, it retains the bump of the bone over the eye, (the orbital hump), and the   marked downward gradient of the dorsal line from front to back, typical of mammoths. <br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Plassard et Plassard  (2000)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br>Measuring 50 cm, this drawing of a mammoth is the first work on the right wall of the gallery called the Sacred Way.

Results showed that though there were no significant differences in measures of adults and adolescents across cultures, there was a significant difference in the measure of a child's hand as opposed to an adult's. No adult/adolescent hands were recorded at a measure of 30 mm or smaller and very few were recorded below 34 mm. Experiments with young children suggested that children at age 3 were able to have the motor control to do small stream flutings, however by age 5 they were capable of far more significant capacity to create and sustain the drawing of longer and more complex lines.<br><br>In the finer tuning of a method to determine individuals through flutings, when the fingers are designated as F2 (index), F3 (middle), F4 (fourth), the research points to findings showing that F2/F4&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1 suggests a male and F2/F4&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1 suggests a female. <br><br>Early references to finger flutings in archaeological literature used often meaning-laden language which the researchers found impeded a clear understanding of the flutings themselves. The literature referred to them as 'serpentines', 'meanders',  'macaroni' and 'water signs'.<br><br>A working vocabulary was established and has been used consistently throughout the work in the hope that it would become the standard language for the discussion of flutings. <br><br>As such, a <b>fluter</b> makes a <b>fluting</b> by sweeping his or her fingers across a soft surface; <br><br>a <b>unit</b> comprises flutings drawn with one sweep of one hand or finger;<br><br>the <b>profile</b> of a unit or a fluter comprises the silhouette of the finger tops left in the medium from the fluting;<br><br>a <b>cluster</b> comprises an isolatable group of units that exhibit a unity, for instance because they overlay each other; <br><br>and a <b>panel</b> comprises a collection of clusters that appears geographically or otherwise distant from other clusters or on a surface of reasonably uniform orientation<br><br>Four forms of flutings were named based on whether or not the fluter used one finger or multiple fingers, and whether or not the fluting was the product of lower body motion or standing still. Names which had no conventional meanings were chosen purposefully to remove the past tradition of using meaning-laden language for description.<p><a href="images19/kyrian.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/kyriansm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="268" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br>Thus, <b>Kirian</b> lines describe lines made with a single finger and no lower body movement.<br><br>Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Van Gelder (2010)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br><br><p><a href="images19/evylinian.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/evyliniansm.jpg" alt = "Grotte de Rouffignac" width="303" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br><br><br><br><b>Evelynian</b> lines  describe lines made with a single finger and show lower body movement.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 44 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/rouffignac.html responseCode 3 200

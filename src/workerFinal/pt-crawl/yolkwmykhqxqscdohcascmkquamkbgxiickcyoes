1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 309]]</font> Mr. Croll's 
        papers on Ocean Currents are a powerful application of the modern theory 
        of heat and force, to show the fallacy of Captain Maury's explanation 
        of the causes of oceanic circulation. They also discuss other matters 
        of great interest, but as the concluding part is not yet published, we 
        shall say no more about them at present, but that they well deserve careful 
        study.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other paper is a criticism of the Rev. Canon 
        Moseley's supposed proof that glaciers do not descend by the force of 
        gravity, and of the arguments of Messrs. Ball and Matthews on the other 
        side. It will be remembered, that Canon Moseley determined by experiment 
        the &quot;shearing&quot; force of ice, that is, the force required to fracture it 
        by parallel pressure. A plug of ice of known cross-section is fitted into 
        a hole through two smooth boards, and the force required to break the 
        ice by sliding the boards over each other is the &quot;shearing&quot; force. Increasing 
        this in proportion to the dimensions of a glacier, or of any large portion 
        of one, it was calculated that the force required to cause the different 
        parts of a glacier to slide over each other (as they must do in descending 
        a valley of constantly varying form and size) was at least thirty times 
        greater than the force of gravity on a slope such as glaciers easily descend. 
        Canon Moseley came to the conclusion that expansion and contraction of 
        the ice by heat and cold was the moving power; and the fact that the glaciers 
        move slower by night than by day, and in winter than in summer, was supposed 
        to prove conclusively that heat is the cause of motion.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Croll believes that Canon Moseley has demonstrated 
        that gravity alone does not cause glaciers to descend, but he completely 
        demolishes the theory of contraction and expansion. He admits that heat 
        aids the motion, but maintains that it does so by acting on the molecules 
        of <font color="990000">[[p. 310]]</font> the ice, which it loosens momentarily 
        from their mutual cohesion, and allows to be re-arranged under the influence 
        of gravity. Heat, he says, is the <em>condition</em>, gravity the <em>cause</em> 
        of the motion which takes place, molecule by molecule rather than in masses. 
        It seems very doubtful, however, if this theory is more tenable than the 
        one it is intended to supersede. If heat entering the glacier loosens 
        the molecules in its passage and enables them to move insensibly into 
        new positions, it is difficult to understand what causes the numerous 
        longitudinal and transverse fissures of a glacier, the production of which 
        is often attended by loud reports, and which indicate movements of masses, 
        not of molecules. And how could molecular motion lead to that heavy grinding 
        of the ice over its bed, which scores and wears down the hardest rocks, 
        and whitens great rivers with the finely triturated mud?</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the opponents of Canon Moseley have 
        noticed what seems to the present writer to be a radical fallacy in his 
        argument about &quot;shearing force.&quot; He assumes that, whatever the bulk or 
        weight of the glacier, or of any portion of it to which the formula of 
        the shearing force may be applied, the whole mass shears at once by the 
        action of gravity on the same mass, and does not recognise the possibility 
        of one portion of a glacier acting by its weight to shear another and 
        much smaller portion. But this must inevitably occur; for, owing to the 
        excessive irregularity of the bed in which every glacier moves, the mass 
        must be every where in varying states of tension and compression, and 
        must contain at each instant certain lines and planes of least resistance, 
        the extent of which lines and surfaces may be very small compared with 
        the dimensions of the glacier itself. At any moment, therefore, the whole 
        descending weight of a portion of the glacier containing perhaps thousands 
        of cubic yards of ice, may act so as to cause the shearing of a few superficial 
        feet where the tension is greatest. This being effected, a partial equilibrium 
        is produced there; but the points or surfaces of greatest tension are 
        shifted, and another small shear or fracture occurs; and by this process 
        and the continued regelation of fractured surfaces brought into contact, 
        it may easily be seen that the glacier as a whole would be gradually moulded 
        to its bed, which it would descend as surely as if it were a viscous mass. 
        Another source of motion not taken into account either by Canon Moseley 
        or Mr. Croll is the irregular melting away of the under surface of the 
        glacier by terrestrial heat, which would often form unsupported hollows 
        till a fracture occurred, and every such fracture must result in a downward 
        motion of a portion of the glacier. The observed difference of the rate 
        of motion between winter and summer, day and night, is more probably due 
        to the different quantities of water which descend the crevasses into 
        the bed of the glacier at those periods, than to any direct action of 
        the heat. It is well known that in the higher portions of a glacier the 
        supply of water from melting snow diminishes during the night, as it does 
        in a still greater degree during the winter; and the large quantity of 
        water that flows beneath every glacier in the summer must greatly assist 
        its motion, both by melting away its lower surface, and by, to some extent, 
        buoying it up.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Matthews's important experiment of the bar 
        of ice which gradually curved by its own weight, should be tried again 
        in an atmosphere kept at the freezing point. This would settle the question 
        whether heat is an essential condition for the curvature or motion of 
        ice by gravitation; but so far as the facts lead us at present, the arguments 
        of Canon Moseley and Mr. Croll by no means <em>prove</em> that glaciers 
        do not descend by the force of gravity alone.</p>

  <strong><em><font color="993366">Comment by Doug Benn, University of St. Andrews, Scotland 
        (pers. commun. 12/00):</font></em></strong></p>
      <p><em>The debate on the causes of glacier motion lasted for many years 
        during the 19th Century. Major sticking points were (1) the fact that 
        ice appears to be a rigid, brittle material, yet the large-scale motion 
        of glaciers requires that the ice flows as a continuous mass; and (2) 
        a mass under a constant force (gravity) should be expected to accelerate 
        downhill (as all falling objects do) whereas glaciers exhibit periodic, 
        often annual, fluctuations in speed. Wallace's note covers a range of 
        issues connected with these problems. He correctly dismisses some of the 
        fallacies current at the time, giving reasons why ice motion cannot be 
        due to freeze-thaw action or &quot;molecular adjustment.&quot; His own preferred 
        mechanism, of localised fracture and regelation (healing of fractures 
        by refreezing) is closer to the mark, but still not complete. In fact, 
        the correct mechanisms of ice flow--involving visco-plastic deformation 
        in response to gravity--had been recognised by James David Forbes some 
        years previously, although serious problems remained with ice flow theory 
        that were not really addressed until the 1950s.</em></p>
      <p><em>Where Wallace does hit true, however, is his recognition of basal 
        sliding as the main mechanism by which Alpine glaciers move. His comments 
        that meltwater reaching the bed will encourage motion by &quot;melting away 
        its lower surface, and . . . to some extent, buoying it up&quot; are exactly 
        correct. This is indeed the reason why Alpine glaciers flow more rapidly 
        during the day and in summer, when meltwater fluxes are highest. Confirmation 
        of this fact had to await the development of drilling equipment, allowing 
        the real-time measurement of subglacial water pressures simultaneously 
        with accurate velocity measurement.</em></p>
      <p><i>Wallace was not the first scientist to emphasise basal sliding (de Saussure 
      has this honour), but he certainly had a more lucid view of the problem 
      than many of his contemporaries. Forbes, an otherwise perceptive field worker 
      and theorist, had dismissed sliding as unimportant.</i></p>

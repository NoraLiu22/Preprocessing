/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 172]]</font> Having 
        been for three months the sole European inhabitant of the vast island 
        of New Guinea, I trust a few notes of my visit may prove interesting, 
        in the absence of much definite information as to that remote and imperfectly 
        known country. Even at Macassar, Amboyna, and Ternate, whence a considerable 
        trade is carried on with the north-western coasts and adjacent islands, 
        I could learn nothing, except about one or two spots which had been visited 
        by my informants; and even as regards them, the points on which I was 
        most interested had seldom been inquired into. I was led to believe there 
        were <em>several</em> places where the natives had been sufficiently in 
        communication with Mahommedan and European traders to render it safe to 
        reside among them. I have now ascertained, however, that there is on the 
        main land only <em>one</em> such place, viz., <em>Dorey</em>; where more 
        than thirty years ago the inhabitants were found by Lesson and Duperrey 
        to be quiet and inoffensive. According to the best information I have 
        been able to obtain, there are at the present time absolutely no other 
        inhabitants than the native Papuans over the whole of this great island. 
        Not a single Malay, or Bugis, or Ceramese settlement exists, though several 
        are scattered over the outlying islands; the principal being at Salwatty, 
        a large island, forming the apparent north-west extremity of New Guinea, 
        from which it is separated by a very narrow strait. The statement often 
        found on maps that New Guinea is &quot;inhabited by Papuans and Malays,&quot; is 
        therefore incorrect.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole northern peninsula of New Guinea, 
        as well as the islands of Wagion, Salwatty, and Balauta, are exceedingly 
        rugged and mountainous. There is a continued succession of jagged and 
        angular ranges of hills, and everywhere behind them, ridge beyond ridge 
        stretch far away into the interior. Over the whole country spreads an 
        unvarying forest, of a somewhat stunted appearance, broken only by the 
        very widely-scattered clearings of the natives on the lower slopes. Near 
        Dorey the loftier mountains retire a little backward, and seem to reach 
        their greatest altitude in the Arfak range, which the officers of the 
        <em>Coquille</em> ascertained to have an elevation of 9500 feet. Dorey 
        harbour, or bay, is formed by a long, low promontory, curving round towards 
        the Arfak range, which rises abruptly from the opposite side of the bay. 
        Towards the extremity of this promontory is situated the village of Dorey, 
        and opposite, at about a mile, is the inhabited island of Mansinam, and 
        a smaller one uninhabited. At the village of Dorey I built a rough jungle-house, 
        in which I resided for three months, <font color="990000">[[p. 173]]</font> 
        occupying myself (in the intervals of fever) with exploring the natural 
        history of the surrounding district.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dorey promontory is a raised coral reef, 
        and, geologically speaking, a very recent one. The beach is a mass of 
        dead and broken coral, not yet ground into sand, and quite impracticable 
        for walking; and from this beach up into the jungle, and even on to the 
        hill, to the height of 200 or 300 feet, there is scarcely a perceptible 
        change in the coral rock, and the masses of coral and shells that everywhere 
        strew the surface. In some of the gulleys, however, I found traces of 
        a core of stratified rock. During my whole stay at this place rain was 
        the rule, sunshine the exception. On half the days there was heavy rain, 
        on half the remainder a continual drizzle, or intermitting showers, while 
        even on fine days there was often a dull haziness in the atmosphere, very 
        different from our usual notions of the sunshine of the tropics. The last 
        month of my stay should have been the dry season, but, if there was any 
        difference, it was rather wetter and cloudier than before. Neither were 
        the winds any more to be depended on than the weather. According to <em>theory</em>, 
        we went in the west monsoon and came back in the east; but we found the 
        winds directly opposite in both cases, whenever it was not a dead calm, 
        and thus made seventeen and sixteen days' passages of a distance of 500 
        miles.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inhabitants of Dorey live always on the 
        coast, or more properly in the sea, as they always build their houses 
        at or below low-water mark, raised on posts, and reached by a rough and 
        tottering causeway from the beach. Of all houses I have yet met with, 
        these are the most wretched. They are very low and long, and the roof 
        is shaped like the bottom of a boat. Old mats, cocoa-nut leaves, broken 
        boats, and bits of board, make a dwelling such as some shipwrecked sailors 
        might hastily set up for a temporary night's shelter, but which it seems 
        hardly credible that any people should contentedly live in. The natives 
        of the interior do not differ perceptibly in physical character, but have 
        a distinct language, and are called &quot;Arfaki&quot; by the Doreyans. Their houses 
        are very similar, but are raised 12 or 15 feet high, on a perfect forest 
        of thin poles, a few of which are put diagonally, and prevent the whole 
        from falling with the first wind. It is singular that these people know 
        the use of diagonal struts, whereas the comparatively civilized Bugis 
        and Macassar-men are quite ignorant of it, their houses being invariably 
        inclined to one side by the prevalent winds, and only kept from falling 
        by the posts being pretty firmly set in the ground, and the building connected 
        with them framed strongly of bamboos. The Doreyans are fishers and traders, 
        the Arfakis are agriculturists. The former catch turtle and tripang, which 
        they sell for beads, knives, and cloth, and purchase of the Arfakis their 
        rice and yams, plantains and bread- <font color="990000">[[p. 174]]</font> 
        fruits, and numbers of tame cockatoos and lories, which they sell again 
        to the Ternate and Tidore traders. All these natives have the characters 
        of the Papuan race very strongly marked;--the flat forehead, heavy brows, 
        and large nose, with the apex bent downwards, are almost universal, as 
        well as the harsh curly hair, which often forms an enormous stiff mop, 
        and is then highly esteemed. It has, in fact, a very grand and imposing 
        effect. The colour of the skin varies greatly. In general it is a dirty 
        black, or sooty colour, but varies to a fine brown, which is often quite 
        as light as that of the pure Malay races. Skin disease is very common, 
        and in the children scrofulous diseases abound, which are seldom seen 
        in adults; it is probable, therefore, that the former die from neglect. 
        The men wear the ordinary strip of bark cloth, the women generally a Bugis 
        sarong, or any piece of cloth or matting they can obtain. Tattooing is 
        generally practised; slightly by the men, but much more extensively by 
        the women, who usually have the whole chest covered with elegant tracery, 
        following the curves of the bosom. The females, however, are, without 
        exception, the least engaging specimens of the fair sex it has yet been 
        my fortune to meet.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mental and moral characteristics the Papuans 
        differ remarkably from the Malay races. They are much more impulsive, 
        and do not conceal their emotions and passions. They are inquisitive, 
        talk much and loudly, and laugh boisterously; reminding one of the negro 
        character, as much as of the negro form and aspect. The natives of Dorey 
        are not to be trusted in anything where payment is concerned. If they 
        do not actually steal, it is, I am inclined to think, only from fear of 
        consequences. They are, however, not a fair sample of the New Guinea tribes, 
        having been too much in contact with the lowest class of Mahommedan traders, 
        with whom they find it necessary to take every advantage in self-defence. 
        They possess the rude artistic genius of so many of the Oceanic tribes, 
        decorating their household utensils and the prows of their canoes with 
        elaborate carving, and the posts of their council-house with obscene caryatides.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of the Doreyans resembles that 
        of the Aru and Ke Islands in containing a large number of monosyllabic 
        words, as well as others excessively polysyllabic, offering a remarkable 
        contrast to the striking dissyllabic character of the whole Malayan group 
        of languages. It exhibits also the Polynesian characteristic of several 
        distinct terms for certain objects according to the prefixed pronoun; 
        thus, &quot;my head,&quot; &quot;your head,&quot; &quot;his head,&quot; are expressed by three distinct 
        words. This language, or mutually intelligible forms of it, is spoken 
        by the coast-dwellers over an extensive area--at Amberbaki, 100 miles 
        west, in the islands of Wagion, Myfor, Jobie, and Mysory--and at Amberpoea 
        and some <font color="990000">[[p. 175]]</font> other islands in the great 
        bay, the natives can converse with those of Dorey, and seem very similar 
        to them in appearance and habits. They are evidently a wandering race, 
        answering to the Bajees, or sea gipsies, of the Indian Archipelago.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found Dorey very unhealthy, and altogether 
        a very disagreeable place to stay at, but I was obliged to remain till 
        a schooner trading farther east returned to Ternate. Fevers, remittent 
        and intermittent, with dysentery, were very prevalent, and after the first 
        fortnight I generally had two and often three of my servants ill at the 
        same time. One died of dysentery, and I was myself ill at least half the 
        time of my residence in New Guinea. Neither was I rewarded by great success 
        in my researches; on the contrary I found Dorey a very bad locality; the 
        low grounds a quagmire, the hills rugged and impracticable, while the 
        principal objects of my search, the rarer species of Paradise-birds, were 
        not to be found. M. Lesson had obtained quantities of native specimens, 
        but now even of these none were to be obtained.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal article of trade on the northern 
        coast of New Guinea is a fragrant aromatic bark, called <em>mussoey</em>, 
        which is carried to Java, where the natives extract an oil of great reputed 
        efficacy as a remedy for various disorders. This is obtained only at one 
        locality, Wandammen, deep in the great bay. Besides this, tortoise-shell 
        is an important article of trade, with a small quantity of beche-de-mer 
        and sago. Wild nutmegs are also plentiful, and in the district about Macluer 
        Inlet a small schooner obtains an annual cargo.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dutch Government have taken possession of 
        New Guinea up to the meridian of 141&deg; east of Greenwich. This claim is 
        often looked upon in England as a kind of usurpation, but persons so viewing 
        it are not probably aware, that along nearly the whole of the coasts included 
        within the northern and southern extremities of this line, an extensive 
        trade is carried on exclusively in vessels sailing from various ports 
        of the Moluccas and carrying the Dutch flag. Considerable portions also 
        of this extensive line of coast have been, or are being, surveyed by the 
        Dutch Government; and instead of cavilling at their claiming so much, 
        it seems more reasonable to admire their moderation in not claiming the 
        whole of a country with which they are so intimately connected. Should 
        the Royal Geographical Society's collection not yet contain them, I may 
        take this opportunity of calling attention to a very beautiful series 
        of maps of the Dutch possessions in the East, by Baron Melvill van Carnb&eacute;e.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the small island of Mansinaru, opposite Dorey, 
        have been residing for about three years two German missionaries. I fear, 
        however, that in the Doreyans they have very impracticable materials to 
        work on, and I am afraid they neither have made nor <font color="990000">[[p. 
        176]]</font> will make much impression. From the little I have seen of 
        the Dutch missionary system in these countries, I am bound to declare 
        my opinion that it is altogether wrong in principle. I allude to the custom 
        of the missionaries being also <em>traders</em>. In the island of Lombock, 
        during my stay there, two gentlemen were employed in winding up the affairs 
        of one of these trading missionaries, who had failed to the amount of 
        some 20,000 dollars. He was despised for his ignorance and incapacity 
        in business by the acute Chinese and native traders, and was therefore 
        in a decidedly false position when attempting to teach them. It seems 
        to me that a man in trade (especially in these countries) attempting to 
        teach Christianity is in a terrible dilemma. To make his trade profitable, 
        he must drive hard bargains, he must take little advantages even of the 
        necessities of his customers and disciples, and thereby stultifies his 
        own teaching of unselfishness and charity. If he does not do this, he 
        cannot live. The best and most effective missionary system I have seen 
        is certainly that of the French Jesuits in the Straits, in Siam and in 
        China, because by living in poverty, and establishing an almost entire 
        community of property between the teacher and his disciples, they prove 
        convincingly that their sole object is the benefit of their flock. Whatever 
        the doctrines taught may be, the method of teaching is certainly admirable.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in Amboyna, in January last, I heard that 
        an exploring expedition was decided on to fix upon some place on the coast 
        of New Guinea for a settlement. A war steamer and a sailing vessel, carrying 
        troops and stores, left that port in March, and commenced their exploration 
        on the south-west coast, near the Utanata River, from which place to the 
        island of Lakahia they made a detailed survey. They then came round to 
        Dorey, where they arrived on the 5th of May. A few days before a coal-ship 
        from Banjarmassin, in Borneo, had left for Amboyna, having stayed in Dorey 
        harbour two months, waiting for the steamer's arrival. The captain told 
        us his agreement was to return on a fixed day, which was some days past 
        when he left. The steamer was nearly out of coal, and could neither go 
        on nor go back. It lay a month in Dorey, and the soldiers, firemen, &amp;c., 
        were kept hard at work cutting down and sawing up huge trees for fire-wood. 
        This was all done and all got on board, and the steamer was to leave for 
        Amboyna the next day, when back came the coal-ship. Now out went the wood 
        again, and the coal being taken in, the steamer went off to Humboldt Bay, 
        where they stayed a few days, opening a communication with the natives, 
        who are quite unsophisticated, but superior morally and physically to 
        the Doreyans. The plan of the original expedition was to explore the whole 
        coast on their return, but they were short of provisions, and went straight 
        back to Amboyna. The results of this voyage were not very great, and <font color="990000">[[p. 
        177]]</font> it may probably be resumed next year. The captain informed 
        me that a recommendation would be given to establish a military post at 
        Dorey, which he had no doubt would be done. As a place for a settlement 
        it is in every respect bad; the soil is not good, there is little water, 
        and the natives of the interior are few, scattered, and hostile. It is, 
        however, the only harbour for whalers or China ships after passing Pitt 
        Straits into the Pacific, and it is this circumstance which decided the 
        recommendation for an establishment.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the latest news from New Guinea. I shall 
        not probably myself visit the main land again, but hope in the next year 
        or two to be able to reach Wagion, Salwatty, and the little-known island 
        of Mysool.</p>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

  &#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        347]]</font> In pursuance of my plan of exploring the Zoology of the Malayan 
        Archipelago, I have just completed a three-and-a-half months' residence 
        at Delli, in the eastern part of the island of Timor, and have devoted 
        myself principally to the Birds, every other class of animals being very 
        poorly represented in this barren island.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing 
        to ill-health, the wet season, and a rebellion of the native tribes, I 
        was unable to extend my excursions far from the town of Delli. I resided, 
        however, in one of the most fertile valleys, about two miles from the 
        town, and spent two weeks on the mountains at an elevation of 2000 feet. 
        I was accompanied on this excursion by Mr. Geach, a mining engineer, who 
        has been engaged here for more than two years in search of minerals, during 
        which time he has traversed the island in several places from sea to sea, 
        and who is altogether better acquainted than any person living with the 
        eastern half of Timor.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 
        this gentleman I obtained much information as to the character of the 
        country, which seems to be very uniform, and not likely to be more productive 
        in any other parts than in those that I have explored.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timor 
        seems to consist entirely of a range of mountains, rising in the central 
        range to 5000 and 6000 feet, and near either coast to about 3000. In only 
        two or three places in the island are there any level plains, the rest 
        being a succession of mountainous ridges and precipitous ravines. Nowhere 
        in the island are there any forests comparable with those of the other 
        parts of the Archipelago, all the lower hills being covered with an open 
        growth of more or less scrubby <i>Eucalypti</i>, and anything like a lofty 
        or luxuriant vegetation being confined to those places in the ravines 
        or on the mountain spurs where a little rich soil has been accumulated. 
        At a height of above 4000 feet even this vegetation disappears, and a 
        scanty herbage of coarse grasses alone covers the higher ridges. Fruit-bearing 
        trees are comparatively <font color="990000">[[p. 348]]</font> scarce, 
        and in the dry season extensive tracts of country are destitute of water, 
        circumstances not likely to be favourable to bird-life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding 
        these disadvantages, however, I have obtained upwards of a hundred species 
        of birds, about two-thirds or perhaps three-fourths of which number are 
        altogether peculiar to the island of Timor, although closely allied to 
        those of the surrounding countries. Australian forms are, as might be 
        expected, the most numerous, and it is from that country that Timor has 
        evidently derived the greater portion of its birds. Even where the genus 
        is widely distributed we can often see that the particular species has 
        been derived from Australia, as <i>Artamus perspicillatus</i> and <i>Aprosmictus 
        vulneratus</i>, which are slight modifications of Australian species; 
        while others, as <i>Amadina castanotis</i>, have remained altogether unchanged. 
        On the other hand, the resemblance to the Moluccas is very slight. <i>Lorius</i>, 
        <i>Eos</i>, and all the characteristic forms of New Guinea, are quite 
        wanting; and there are only three birds that seem to have been derived 
        from the Moluccan or Papuan faunas--viz. <i>Geoffroius jukesii</i>, <i>Ptilonopus 
        flavicollis</i>, and <i>Ianth&aelig;nas metallica</i>. The relation is 
        equally slight to Celebes, and is shown only by the <i>Turac&#156;na modesta</i>, 
        closely allied to the <i>T. manadensis</i>, Q. &amp; G., of Celebes, and 
        the <i>Ptilonopus cinctus</i>, forming, with the <i>P. gularis</i> of 
        Celebes, the subgenus <i>Leucotreron</i>, Bp. I very much regret not having 
        obtained the other species of this interesting group, which my friend 
        Mr. Geach assures me are found in the interior of the island. In particular 
        he mentioned a species resembling the <i>P. cinctus</i>, but in which 
        the white forms a ring round the neck, and his opinion was that there 
        existed in Timor three or four species of the same group having the colours 
        differently distributed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides 
        the birds already mentioned, and which are all more or less characteristic 
        of the Australian region, Timor contains an important Indian element, 
        consisting of Javan species or their representatives. The genera <i>Lanius</i>, 
        <i>Cyornis</i>, <i>Treron</i>, <i>Gallus</i>, and <i>Estrelda</i> occur 
        here, but are not found in any part of the Moluccas, and only one or two 
        of them in Celebes. About thirty species thus appear to have been derived 
        from Java, which, <font color="990000">[[p. 349]]</font> though 600 miles 
        distant from Timor, is connected with it by a chain of islands; and between 
        these more than twenty miles of sea nowhere intervenes, so that the passage 
        across might have been easily effected by the progenitors of these birds, 
        which are all capable of greater powers of flight than the circumstances 
        would require.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        absence of <i>Megapodius</i> from Timor--a fact already noticed by the 
        Dutch naturalists, and which all my inquiries tend to confirm--is a very 
        singular one, because the genus exists in every other island of the Australian 
        region, and even in the little island of Semao, at the west end of Timor. 
        I can only conjecture that it may have been exterminated by the Tiger-cat, 
        said to exist in the interior. Taking into consideration the absence of 
        such characteristic Australian birds as <i>Dacelo</i>, <i>Malurus</i>, 
        <i>Cracticus</i>, and <i>Casuarius</i>, together with the non-existence 
        of a single Australian genus of Mammals, I cannot believe that Timor has 
        ever been actually connected with Australia, though the sea which separates 
        them has probably been much narrower than at present, as is indicated 
        by the great Sahul bank, which now extends from the shores of Northern 
        Australia to within twenty miles of the south coast of Timor.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        may therefore, I think, fairly look upon the fauna of Timor as almost 
        entirely derived by immigration from the surrounding countries, and subsequently 
        modified by the reciprocal action of the species on each other and by 
        the influence of a new vegetation. In accordance with this view we find 
        the external relations of the genera and species of which it is composed 
        varying in degree with the varying distances of the surrounding lands, 
        and the probability of the reception of immigrants from them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        Dutch naturalists who explored the interior of the west part of Timor 
        seem to have collected a great many birds, and some French expeditions 
        have also visited it. It thus happens that most of the species are already 
        known, though I suppose many of them are rare in collections. I have 10 
        species of Pigeons; and there is still <i>one</i>, mentioned in Bonaparte's 
        'Conspectus' as <i>Ptilonopus viridissimus</i>, which I have not met with. 
        <i>Trichoglossus euteles</i> was very abundant on the flowers of the <i>Eucalypti</i>; 
        a smaller red-capped species (<i>T. iris</i>?) also occurred; <font color="990000">[[p. 
        350]]</font> but the beautiful <i>T. h&aelig;matodus</i> seems rare, as 
        I never saw a specimen, and with difficulty obtained two live ones in 
        the town. I observed it in the island of Semao two years ago, but could 
        not obtain an example. There are said to be one or two more <i>Psittaci</i> 
        in the island, but I could see nothing of them. I obtained 3 Ducks, 5 
        or 6 Herons and Egrets, and a fine <i>Himantopus</i> (perhaps the <i>H. 
        leucocephalus</i> of Australia), and that is all worth mentioning. I was 
        much disappointed in not finding the beautiful <i>Pitta irena</i>, but 
        presume it inhabits the interior only.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
        have long been of opinion that there is no foundation whatever for the 
        very prevalent idea that tropical heat and light have some direct or specific 
        effect in producing the brilliant colours that adorn birds, or insects, 
        or flowers. Here, in Timor, the birds are remarkably dull in colour; and 
        I think a fair average comparison will show that even chilly England possesses 
        more beauty among the common birds that give the character to the ornithology 
        of the country than this tropical island. Out of the 100 species of birds 
        I have collected here at Delli, I only find four that are at all brilliant 
        in colour--viz. <i>Cinnyris solaris</i>, <i>Chalcophaps</i>, sp., <i>Estrelda</i>, 
        sp., and <i>Ianth&aelig;nas metallica</i>; and I think I am correct in 
        saying, that in any part of England we could find in the same time a larger 
        number of species more or less adorned with brilliant colours, and at 
        least as many which might be called pretty or ornamental.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 
        the larger number by far of brilliant birds do exist in the tropics cannot 
        be disputed; but that climatal or solar influence has anything to do with 
        the fact there is not the slightest evidence, while there is much that 
        contradicts the supposition. And first, why does this supposed influence 
        never act on those families and genera which are equally abundant in the 
        temperate and tropical regions? Why are not tropical Ducks and Accipitres, 
        Larks, Crows, Warblers, Goat-suckers, and Finches, much more brilliant 
        on the average than those of temperate and northern regions? Again, when 
        stragglers from purely tropical families occur in the north and south, 
        why are they not the dullest-coloured of their group? Instead of being 
        so, they are fully up to the average of beauty. Our Kingfisher, Roller, 
        and Bee-eater, the northern and southern Humming-birds, the <i>Psittaci</i> 
        of <font color="990000">[[p. 351]]</font> Temperate Australia, are rather 
        above than below the average brilliancy of their tropical allies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        must remember that the tropical fauna almost always extends <i>beyond</i> 
        the geographical tropic, and thus comprehends the largest part of the 
        earth habitable all the year by birds. Moreover it is one mass, while 
        the temperate regions are divided; and most important of all, owing to 
        the perennial presence of fruits and insects, a far greater number and 
        variety of birds can exist there than in the colder parts of the earth. 
        It follows, therefore, that if the proportion of bright- to obscure-coloured 
        birds is the same everywhere, yet the tropics must produce the largest 
        actual number, and it has yet to be shown that this proportion is greater 
        in the tropics. Such extensive tropical families as the <i>Trochilid&aelig;</i>, 
        <i>Trogonid&aelig;</i>, <i>Cotingid&aelig;</i>, and <i>Tanagrid&aelig;</i>, 
        consisting almost entirely of gay-coloured birds, will immediately occur 
        to every one; but on the other side may be set the <i>Todid&aelig;</i>, 
        Bp., <i>Thamnophilid&aelig;</i>, <i>Anabatid&aelig;</i>, <i>Dendrocolaptid&aelig;</i>, 
        <i>Capitonid&aelig;</i>, and others equally tropical and as remarkable 
        for their generally obscure coloration.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here 
        the amount of colour would almost seem to be in inverse proportion to 
        the amount of solar light; for while no island has more clear sky and 
        bright sunshine than Timor, its birds are far less brilliant than those 
        which dwell amid the gloomy forests and ever-cloudy sky of the Moluccas 
        and New Guinea.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 
        the whole, therefore, I cannot but believe that a careful investigation 
        of the facts will show that there exists no immediate connexion between 
        tropical heat and light and brilliancy of colour in any department of 
        nature; and I am sure that on no subject does a greater amount of misconception 
        prevail than on the relative beauty of nature and display of colour in 
        temperate and tropical regions.</p>

        <meta name="description" content="LM: De Gruyter has always been invested in the scholarly publishing community. Over 15 years ago, three granddaughters of Walter de Gruyter in Berlin co-founded the Walter de Gruyter Foundation. The majority of the foundation’s endowment comes from a 10% share in the Walter de Gruyter company that is given back to the scholarly publishing community through funding research projects, providing scholarships for young professionals in publishing, and awarding prizes for outstanding academic achievement. Ten years ago, we’ve launched our Publisher Partner Program which has given De Gruyter the opportunity to engage with the academic library community as both a scholarly publisher and a service provider. And with this engagement have come various opportunities, largely in the U.S. and Canada, for us to fill gaps in the academic library acquisition ecosystem through our University Press Library (UPL) business model. Library participation in our UPL product directly supports university press sustainability. While we are excited about our accomplishments on behalf of our partners as a for-profit service provider, we also wanted to do our part as a scholarly publisher and add to the work of the Walter de Gruyter foundation with a North American not-for profit arm focusing on providing funding opportunities for publishers that are looking for support. Through the Partner Program, we came to understand that sustainability does not happen without community, and a like-minded community is not dependent upon corporate status. With both our Partner Program and De Gruyter eBound, we are living up to that maxim. And the best time to launch it was now.">

The majority of the foundation’s endowment comes from a 10% share in the Walter de Gruyter company that is given back to the scholarly publishing community through funding research projects, providing scholarships for young professionals in publishing, and awarding prizes for outstanding academic achievement. Ten years ago, we’ve launched our Publisher Partner Program which has given De Gruyter the opportunity to engage with the academic library community as both a scholarly publisher and a service provider. And with this engagement have come various opportunities, largely in the U.S. and Canada, for us to fill gaps in the academic library acquisition ecosystem through our University Press Library (UPL) business model. Library participation in our UPL product directly supports university press sustainability. While we are excited about our accomplishments on behalf of our partners as a for-profit service provider, we also wanted to do our part as a scholarly publisher and add to the work of the Walter de Gruyter foundation with a North American not-for profit arm focusing on providing funding opportunities for publishers that are looking for support. Through the Partner Program, we came to understand that sustainability does not happen without community, and a like-minded community is not dependent upon corporate status. With both our Partner Program and De Gruyter eBound, we are living up to that maxim. And the best time to launch it was now.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-1__iuZHe__0-0-2595"><h3 class="ProductHeading__product-heading__wGhnq__0-0-2595 ProductHeading__product-heading--xs__8Y-ve__0-0-2595">ATG: According to what we’ve read, De Gruyter eBound’s goal is “to support the publishing, sustainability, and accessibility of mission-driven scholarly monographs for not-forprofit and Open Access publishers.” What does that mean exactly? What is mission-driven scholarly publishing? And why just not-for-profit and open access publishers?</h3></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">LM: At our annual meeting with our university press partners in September of 2021, we asked twentynine participants “What percentage of your scholarly monographs cost more to produce than your net sales received?” See the chart below for the answers we received.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">These texts are what we refer to as mission-driven scholarly monographs: the peer-reviewed research monographs that perform as “low-use” in an acquisition system based on usage metrics and are not purchased.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">These numbers are not sustainable. 25% of our respondents think that 50-75% of their scholarly monographs lose money. In addition, just earlier this year, at one of our Meet the Press webinars, we had a director from a university press talk about how the press has consolidated its publishing to core disciplines only, which has led to a noticeable reduction in the number of titles they publish per year due to this trend.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">Due to the unique position of being a scholarly publisher first, and a service provider second, we have a front-row seat to the challenges our university press partners face when publishing scholarly monographs. The challenges have to do with the dependency on third parties for distribution, the lack of owning a proprietary hosting platform with a sales team, and the proliferation of evidence-based and demand-driven models.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">De Gruyter eBound will address these challenges head-on and focus on efforts to support the publishing, sustainability, and accessibility of scholarly monographs. By narrowing down our mission to not-for-profit and open access publishers, we hope that we can send a signal to these publishers that we’re here to work together on solutions.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-1__iuZHe__0-0-2595"><h3 class="ProductHeading__product-heading__wGhnq__0-0-2595 ProductHeading__product-heading--xs__8Y-ve__0-0-2595">ATG: Linda, you’ve said that “Mission-driven scholarly publishing comes with its own challenges and there are many open questions around how to solve them.” Can you elaborate and tell us more about these challenges and open questions?</h3></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">LM: As I’ve just explained, a good percentage of scholarly monographs lose money. We see publishers experimenting with various business models, namely in open access like MIT Press’s D20 initiative, Central European University Press’ Opening the Future model with their promising dynamic scaling approach, and the University of Michigan Presses Fund to Mission Open Access Monograph Model. Each of these models are fundamentally different, yet they are all trying to accomplish the same goal of sustainable, accessible, and open scholarly monograph publishing. In two of these examples, MIT and Michigan each have their own platform and sales teams — the presses we work with do not have that important infrastructure. CEUP’s model works for the 30 plus titles they publish per year. Most of our partners have a much larger catalog. Yet, they meet the same challenges with scholarly mission driven monographs as MIT, Michigan and CEUP despite their different profile.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">So, how can we overcome those challenges? Based on the resources and limitations we experience with our university press partners, open access is of course one of the means to get there, but it is not the only means. De Gruyter eBound’s goal is to support comprehensive, sustainable, and accessible scholarly monograph publishing. That support can come in different ways, and we will explore them together with our advisory board.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-1__iuZHe__0-0-2595"><h3 class="ProductHeading__product-heading__wGhnq__0-0-2595 ProductHeading__product-heading--xs__8Y-ve__0-0-2595">ATG: What role does De Gruyter eBound hope to play in dealing with these challenges and questions?</h3></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">LM: There are different aspects to our role as we see it. Firstly, we are receiving funding from De Gruyter Inc, as a direct result of libraries’ annual investment in our University Press Library business model. We want to put these funds to good use. Secondly, we are going to secure outside funding through public donations and grant writing — this will be project-based and maximize the impact of our support. Thirdly, we will remain engaged in the marketplace, and expand the relationship we’ve made through the University Press Library business model that brings together all stakeholders who collaborate on our likeminded community-based approach: library, presses, consortia, and De Gruyter. Finally, we are going to coordinate, plan and execute initiatives in consultation with our esteemed advisory board.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-1__iuZHe__0-0-2595"><h3 class="ProductHeading__product-heading__wGhnq__0-0-2595 ProductHeading__product-heading--xs__8Y-ve__0-0-2595">ATG: We understand De Gruyter eBound will be providing grants for new publications and funding original studies.

De Gruyter has just made its first donation of $50,000 to eBound. We are now asking ourselves questions like: how can we maximize the impact of our funding? How do we identify the most suitable projects, and what criteria do we use to evaluate them? Currently, we are working on the application process — from how to solicit project proposals to how to decide what projects will receive funding. We will share the information on our website once it is finalized.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-1__iuZHe__0-0-2595"><h3 class="ProductHeading__product-heading__wGhnq__0-0-2595 ProductHeading__product-heading--xs__8Y-ve__0-0-2595">ATG: Recently the advisory board held its initial meeting.

They share our values and vision, and through this like-mindedness we understand the need for De Gruyter eBound. Our initial advisory board meeting took place at the beginning of the year. The expertise of our advisory board has already proved incredibly helpful in that first meeting in which they helped to collaboratively flesh out our mission.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-2__OQ-jA__0-0-2595"><p class="ProductParagraph__product-paragraph__GMmH0__0-0-2595 ProductParagraph__product-paragraph--lg__47dLF__0-0-2595">After receiving our initial funds, we now need to decide on how to spend the money De Gruyter has donated — that’s what our recent meeting was all about. We can use our funds in multiple ways, and it’s great to have such a diverse range of opinions from representatives of various types of university presses and libraries. We identified avenues to pursue our mission and we will decide how to utilize our first round of funding by our 3rd advisory board meeting this fall.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-1__iuZHe__0-0-2595"><h3 class="ProductHeading__product-heading__wGhnq__0-0-2595 ProductHeading__product-heading--xs__8Y-ve__0-0-2595">ATG: The advisory board consists of leading figures in the academic library and scholarly publishing community.

As such, we are excited to have on our advisory board two library partners from Iowa State and NYU who inform, represent, and advocate on behalf of our academic library partners. The main audience for De Gruyter eBound are the various stakeholders in our like-minded community, for which libraries are the backbone. Libraries have always played a critical role in supporting scholarly research both in STEM and the Humanities, and their continuous commitment to strengthening the research community is crucial for the sustainable future of scholarly monograph publishing.</p></div><div class="Spacing__spacing--margin-top-2__YQFc-__0-0-2595 Spacing__spacing--margin-bottom-1__iuZHe__0-0-2595"><h3

Why a not-for-profit foundation and why now?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: De Gruyter has always been invested in the scholarly publishing community. Over 15 years ago, three granddaughters of Walter de Gruyter in Berlin co-founded the Walter de Gruyter Foundation. The majority of the foundation’s endowment comes from a 10% share in the Walter de Gruyter company that is given back to the scholarly publishing community through funding research projects, providing scholarships for young professionals in publishing, and awarding prizes for outstanding academic achievement. Ten years ago, we’ve launched our Publisher Partner Program which has given De Gruyter the opportunity to engage with the academic library community as both a scholarly publisher and a service provider. And with this engagement have come various opportunities, largely in the U.S. and Canada, for us to fill gaps in the academic library acquisition ecosystem through our University Press Library (UPL) business model. Library participation in our UPL product directly supports university press sustainability. While we are excited about our accomplishments on behalf of our partners as a for-profit service provider, we also wanted to do our part as a scholarly publisher and add to the work of the Walter de Gruyter foundation with a North American not-for profit arm focusing on providing funding opportunities for publishers that are looking for support. Through the Partner Program, we came to understand that sustainability does not happen without community, and a like-minded community is not dependent upon corporate status. With both our Partner Program and De Gruyter eBound, we are living up to that maxim. And the best time to launch it was now."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: According to what we’ve read, De Gruyter eBound’s goal is “to support the publishing, sustainability, and accessibility of mission-driven scholarly monographs for not-forprofit and Open Access publishers.” What does that mean exactly? What is mission-driven scholarly publishing? And why just not-for-profit and open access publishers?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: At our annual meeting with our university press partners in September of 2021, we asked twentynine participants “What percentage of your scholarly monographs cost more to produce than your net sales received?” See the chart below for the answers we received."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"These texts are what we refer to as mission-driven scholarly monographs: the peer-reviewed research monographs that perform as “low-use” in an acquisition system based on usage metrics and are not purchased."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"These numbers are not sustainable. 25% of our respondents think that 50-75% of their scholarly monographs lose money. In addition, just earlier this year, at one of our Meet the Press webinars, we had a director from a university press talk about how the press has consolidated its publishing to core disciplines only, which has led to a noticeable reduction in the number of titles they publish per year due to this trend."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Due to the unique position of being a scholarly publisher first, and a service provider second, we have a front-row seat to the challenges our university press partners face when publishing scholarly monographs. The challenges have to do with the dependency on third parties for distribution, the lack of owning a proprietary hosting platform with a sales team, and the proliferation of evidence-based and demand-driven models."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"De Gruyter eBound will address these challenges head-on and focus on efforts to support the publishing, sustainability, and accessibility of scholarly monographs. By narrowing down our mission to not-for-profit and open access publishers, we hope that we can send a signal to these publishers that we’re here to work together on solutions."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: Linda, you’ve said that “Mission-driven scholarly publishing comes with its own challenges and there are many open questions around how to solve them.” Can you elaborate and tell us more about these challenges and open questions?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: As I’ve just explained, a good percentage of scholarly monographs lose money. We see publishers experimenting with various business models, namely in open access like MIT Press’s D20 initiative, Central European University Press’ Opening the Future model with their promising dynamic scaling approach, and the University of Michigan Presses Fund to Mission Open Access Monograph Model. Each of these models are fundamentally different, yet they are all trying to accomplish the same goal of sustainable, accessible, and open scholarly monograph publishing. In two of these examples, MIT and Michigan each have their own platform and sales teams — the presses we work with do not have that important infrastructure. CEUP’s model works for the 30 plus titles they publish per year. Most of our partners have a much larger catalog. Yet, they meet the same challenges with scholarly mission driven monographs as MIT, Michigan and CEUP despite their different profile."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"So, how can we overcome those challenges? Based on the resources and limitations we experience with our university press partners, open access is of course one of the means to get there, but it is not the only means. De Gruyter eBound’s goal is to support comprehensive, sustainable, and accessible scholarly monograph publishing. That support can come in different ways, and we will explore them together with our advisory board."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: What role does De Gruyter eBound hope to play in dealing with these challenges and questions?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: There are different aspects to our role as we see it. Firstly, we are receiving funding from De Gruyter Inc, as a direct result of libraries’ annual investment in our University Press Library business model. We want to put these funds to good use. Secondly, we are going to secure outside funding through public donations and grant writing — this will be project-based and maximize the impact of our support. Thirdly, we will remain engaged in the marketplace, and expand the relationship we’ve made through the University Press Library business model that brings together all stakeholders who collaborate on our likeminded community-based approach: library, presses, consortia, and De Gruyter. Finally, we are going to coordinate, plan and execute initiatives in consultation with our esteemed advisory board."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: We understand De Gruyter eBound will be providing grants for new publications and funding original studies. Who will qualify for getting assistance from the foundation? How will those interested apply?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: We are still in the early steps with De Gruyter eBound, and we are currently exploring different ways to use our resources. De Gruyter has just made its first donation of $50,000 to eBound. We are now asking ourselves questions like: how can we maximize the impact of our funding? How do we identify the most suitable projects, and what criteria do we use to evaluate them? Currently, we are working on the application process — from how to solicit project proposals to how to decide what projects will receive funding. We will share the information on our website once it is finalized."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: Recently the advisory board held its initial meeting. What were the first orders of business for the board at that meeting? Any inside scoop or news coming out of that meeting that you can share with our readers?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: We’re honored that a group of highly accomplished industry leaders have agreed to join our board. They share our values and vision, and through this like-mindedness we understand the need for De Gruyter eBound. Our initial advisory board meeting took place at the beginning of the year. The expertise of our advisory board has already proved incredibly helpful in that first meeting in which they helped to collaboratively flesh out our mission."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"After receiving our initial funds, we now need to decide on how to spend the money De Gruyter has donated — that’s what our recent meeting was all about. We can use our funds in multiple ways, and it’s great to have such a diverse range of opinions from representatives of various types of university presses and libraries. We identified avenues to pursue our mission and we will decide how to utilize our first round of funding by our 3rd advisory board meeting this fall."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: The advisory board consists of leading figures in the academic library and scholarly publishing community. What role do you see libraries playing in the foundation’s activities and goals? Or is the main audience for your foundation only publishers?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: De Gruyter eBound would not be here if it weren’t for our academic library partners and their commitment to our University Press Library business model. As such, we are excited to have on our advisory board two library partners from Iowa State and NYU who inform, represent, and advocate on behalf of our academic library partners. The main audience for De Gruyter eBound are the various stakeholders in our like-minded community, for which libraries are the backbone. Libraries have always played a critical role in supporting scholarly research both in STEM and the Humanities, and their continuous commitment to strengthening the research community is crucial for the sustainable future of scholarly monograph publishing."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: Linda, before we let you go, is there anything that we’ve missed, or anything that you would like to add?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"LM: I’d like to come back to our maxim and emphasize that “sustainability does not happen without community, and a likeminded community is not dependent upon corporate status.” De Gruyter eBound believes that like-minded communities such as this one has the power to sustain the valuable work of scholarly monograph publishing."}}]},"displayName":"against-the-grain","documentId":"220915234415-b36e27ce57f3c9692c78938ae9c97f5c","documentLinks":{"path":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F47","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fissuu.com\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F47"},"isAdSafe":true,"isExplicit":false,"isTeamsOwned":false,"ownerId":32012799,"profileUrl":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain","summary":"LM: De Gruyter has always been invested in the scholarly publishing community.

What are your responsibilities as Managing Director of Adam Matthew (AM)?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: Hi, Tom and Katina, thank you for inviting me to this conversation! I joined Adam Matthew — then still largely a microfilm publisher — in 2004, having previously trained as a librarian. As soon as I walked in the door on my first day, I knew I’d found my home. Initially I worked as a Project Editor, developing some of AM’s earliest digital products including Mass Observation Online. As the company grew, I became Publishing Director, and joined the board of directors in 2014. It’s tremendously exciting and a huge honour to have become AM’s Managing Director this year, taking over the role from Khal Rudin, who has moved to an Executive Chair position, and working closely with Jennifer Kemp as our Chief Operating Officer. As you’d expect, the role is very varied — primarily, I work closely with my co-directors to set our strategic direction, achieve continued growth, and ensure everyone at the company, and all our customers, understand our vision to reimagine primary sources. I know that this role, like every job I’ve done at AM, will be a joy because I really believe in the work we do, and find my wonderful colleagues deeply inspiring."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: The AM mission statement references a belief that at the heart of education is the freedom to think critically. Can you expand on what that means to AM and to your colleagues?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: In an age of increasingly overwhelming, confusing and contradictory information, the role of libraries, publishers, and educators in teaching students how to think critically has never been more important. Digital technology has given us an unbelievable wealth of data, but being “digitally native” does not mean that today’s students have necessarily acquired the skills to critically interrogate, effectively search, or understand the sources of their data. The teaching of history, particularly through the use of primary sources, is an essential way of equipping these students with such skills. Our mission statement also specifically describes our desire to encourage current and future generations to “challenge, analyse and debate.” Working with primary sources can be an uncomfortable experience, forcing us to confront the past and how it influences our present; but we passionately believe that honest and measured conversations, based on engagement with real evidence, are the key to addressing problems and creating positive change. These ideas are foundations of everything we do at AM, not just in terms of our publishing, but also our company culture and values. We encourage everyone at AM to continually challenge ideas and ways of doing things — we never want to stand still."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: So when it comes to never standing still, what’s next for AM?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: There are so many exciting things I could talk about, and many more that I can’t quite mention yet. But a key focus area for us right now is Quartex, our SaaS platform designed to help libraries, archives, and other heritage institutions create their own digital collections. What’s really exciting about Quartex is that it shares the platform we use for our own AM collections, so alongside our own publishing programme we have a growing community of users who are building their own digital archives using the same technology. It’s been really rewarding to see our Quartex customers showcase compelling and engaging material using the technology we’ve worked so hard to create, and working with them to see how they use the platform in different and interesting ways. We’re learning a great deal that we bring back to our work across the entire AM portfolio."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: You’ve said that you yourself are driven by “a passionate belief in the importance of primary sources to multidisciplinary teaching and research.” From your perspective, what makes AM products so suited to enabling the linkage between primary sources and teaching\u002Fresearch? What unique qualities do they bring to the table?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: All of our products are designed very carefully as multi-layered experiences, offering pathways to users with different needs, from undergraduates who are embarking on independent research for the first time, to seasoned scholars, to educators looking for engaging materials to add to their teaching programmes. We put a lot of thought into the UX design of our platform and the ways that we organize and arrange the materials for ease of use. We have a fantastic reputation for adding a lot of value to our digitized materials, and for our considered approach to the selection and curation of material. A lot of editorial expertise and investment goes into creating really good indexing and metadata, so that all users can quickly find sources. We also allow data-mining of our full text and metadata; we are really excited by the possibilities of Digital Humanities and enjoy working with scholars who are transforming the nature of historical research."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: Speaking of primary sources, how does Adam Matthew define a primary source?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: That’s a very knotty question! Often when people think of primary sources, they are focused on the written record, whether that’s printed or manuscript. And of course, much of our source content does take that form. But there’s so much more than that in our collections, and having a more expansive view about what primary sources are really increases opportunities for a broader, more diverse representation of the historic record. For example, Ethnomusicology draws on audio recordings, video, objects, and ephemera to explore the cultural and social lives of global communities (often those without traditional written records) through their musical traditions. Objects and ephemera feature in many of our collections, and are very engaging when used alongside written records, giving a really tangible sense of the lived experience. It really can be anything — one of the more outlandish things we have digitized is a lock of “intimate” hair sent to Lord Byron by a female fan!"}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: In your experience, do many students know what primary sources are? Do they use primary sources without being assigned them? How does this impact the use of AM databases?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: It really varies, but many undergraduates will not have used primary sources in either a digital or physical setting before starting university. Embedding primary sources into course reading lists or the classroom is therefore really important at this level. By the end of undergraduate study, and in postgraduate research, students should be making use of primary source databases independently, but still need a lot of support to find content and expand their skills to use it effectively. To help with this, we launched a new flagship resource last year, Research Methods Primary Sources. This unique online learning tool promotes primary source literacy through how-to guides, peerreviewed essays, videos and case studies, and can be used in the classroom or for independent study. It includes hundreds of “practice sources” from our partner archives for students to test out their newly-developed primary source research skills and develop comfort with using historical materials in their work."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: We understand from your website that one of AM’s core missions is “to increase the diversity of voices we present, and to address silences and inequities in the historical record.” How do you make that happen, given that these voices are usually silent in primary sources?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: First and foremost, we hold ourselves accountable for our editorial decisions, and we are tremendously fortunate in our editorial team, who are passionately engaged with the subject of diversity and representation, and who have led the way in making real changes to the way we put our collections together in order to make them more transparent, equitable, and diverse."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"There is certainly more we hope to do to expand our global reach and use technology, such as language tools, to broaden the range of archival content that we publish. A crucial part of this goal is to engage and connect with communities in the representation of their histories."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"There is unfortunately no way to alter the bias of the historical record itself, or historic choices made about what materials to collect in archives, museums, and libraries. However, we continue to increase our efforts to commission essays and features within our collections, which contextualise problematic terminology, highlight archival silences, discuss some of the complexities of historic archival practice and shed light on tools that students can use to overcome these challenges."}},{"subhead":{"text":"ATG: In this issue of Against the Grain the authors have focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion in primary sources. In doing so, they are highlighting the “hidden narratives” they have uncovered in various primary sources. Can you tell us about that? How are such “hidden narratives” discovered?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"MF: We’re particularly excited about the role that technology can play in redressing the historic imbalance of representation in archives. For example, we were the first publisher to apply AI-driven Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) software to our products, allowing scholars to search manuscripts freely. While we cannot redress the biases held within sources themselves, the ability to search in this way can remove any historic or unintended biases existing in the catalogue data and improve the discoverability of underrepresented narratives. Through the application of searching software, we also aim to improve our metadata creation processes, actively seeking out voices which may have been obscured."}}]},"summary":"MF: Hi, Tom and Katina, thank you for inviting me to this conversation!

I know that this role, like every job I’ve done at AM, will be a joy because I really believe in the work we do, and find my wonderful colleagues deeply inspiring.","articleLinks":{"path":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002Fs\u002F16853481","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fissuu.com\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002Fs\u002F16853481"},"avatarFallbackUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fphoto.isu.pub\u002Fdefault_user\u002Fphoto_large.png","documentLinks":{"path":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F45","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fissuu.com\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F45"},"documentTitle":"Against the Grain V34#4, September, 2022 Full Issue","uri":"sept_2022_v34-4_hr","username":"against-the-grain","ownerId":32012799,"isTeamsOwned":false,"teamData":{}},{"id":"16853480","userId":"32891271","revisionId":"7377840","documentSlotId":"93707709","title":"The Digital Toolbox","description":"","coverImageUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.isu.pub\u002Fdocument-structure\u002F220915234415-b36e27ce57f3c9692c78938ae9c97f5c\u002Fv1\u002F63b7180d78334d9ccbe1c280a81ceb97.jpeg","startPage":41,"readTime":360,"createdAt":"2022-09-16T01:41:17.000Z","pages":[41,42],"content":{"version":2,"json":[{"header":{"headline":{"text":"The Digital Toolbox"},"photo":{"dimensions":{"height":538,"width":742},"imageUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.isu.pub\u002Fdocument-structure\u002F220915234415-b36e27ce57f3c9692c78938ae9c97f5c\u002Fv1\u002F63b7180d78334d9ccbe1c280a81ceb97.jpeg"}}},{"subhead":{"text":"Academic Librarians and Publishers are the Vanguard of Critical DEI Content"}},{"byline":{"text":"Column Editor: Steve Rosato (Director and Business Development Executive, OverDrive Professional, Cleveland, OH 44125) \u003Csrosato@overdrive.com\u003E"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"An issue that’s been exacerbated by COVID-19 is the increasingly polarized political climate’s impact on how academic libraries and publishers operate.

My wife points out that I probably have attended more trade shows than have had hot meals."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"At those shows, I have functioned as an organizer, planner, participant, sales rep, and consultant. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a library trade show on behalf of a client and given what I saw there as represented by the association, the attendees, and the vendors caused me to write down my thoughts for this column. Much like in past shows that I have attended, I saw sales reps at their booths talking amongst themselves as people walked by. In addition, there were booth personnel on their cell phones not paying attention to the traffic on the exhibit floor. Clearly, the topic “lack of booth interaction with attendees” was not covered in the pre-show orientation for these folks."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"It was always fascinating to me that when an association was trying to interest my company to consider exhibiting at their upcoming meeting, they stressed all the many ways they could help us to spend our marketing budget in pursuit of new sales. Items of cost were introduced: such as prime location, platinum\u002F gold\u002Fsilver sponsorship of the event, an ad in the meeting program, underwriting the cost of an author session, coffee break and\u002For lunch, etc. These were some of the possibilities that in their opinion would guarantee us more sales. Many more such opportunities were available for the asking."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Every vendor will most assuredly say that they would be happy to spend whatever the cost asked by the association if it guaranteed that attendees would visit the booth and then listen to what the company sales reps have to offer. Sadly, there always seemed to be a disconnect between the time the money for these “opportunities” was sent to the association and the frequency by which a significant number of attendees visited the vendors. Increased spending by the vendor does not guarantee increased booth traffic. That outcome is most surprising since it is within the power of the association to greatly influence that a maximum number of their attendees could and should visit every relevant vendor. Let’s count the ways an association\u002Forganization can follow to make the meeting experience a more profitable one for the vendors and attendees alike."}},{"subhead":{"text":"How the Trade show Contributes to the Success of the Vendors"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Let’s be very clear. An industry trade show is the best place for a vendor to see a maximum number of sales prospects in the shortest period of time. Furthermore, attendance at a trade show is a very cost-effective way of conducting business. It is therefore in everyone’s best interest to make sure that attendees and vendors meet under the best set of circumstances to ensure success."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The goal of the organization is to create an environment where most of the attendees over the course of days spent at the trade show try to visit with as many of the vendors of their choice as possible. There is no set number on how many vendors an attendee should see but suffice it to say that an effort needs to be made to see as many vendors as possible whose products are relevant to the library. Avoiding the exhibition hall is not an option. The first step is education. Each attendee needs to know that a significant reason for the meeting even taking place is due to the monetary support of the vendors in keeping the association on firm financial ground. Members need to know that vendors have devoted significant sums of money and time so that they can interest those attendees in the products and services being presented at the show. Prior to every trade show, it is suggested that a note be distributed to all members of the association indicating how important every vendor is not only due to their products but also recognizing the costs associated with exhibiting and publicly thanking them for their support."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The second step is getting the attendees to visit the exhibit area. This is the easiest part of the equation. Here are some of the ways to ensure that attendees visit vendors at least once during the meeting. "}},{"paragraph":{"text":"1. Create a “passport” booklet that needs to be stamped by each vendor for every attendee visit to the booth. Perhaps a prize (donated by the vendors) could be awarded to the attendee with the most stamps in their passport. "}},{"paragraph":{"text":"2. Schedule breakfasts, mid-day breaks, and lunches in the exhibit hall. Attendees to these shows always follow the food. And when the food is presented at different times of the day, it brings them into the exhibit area multiple times. The association should use different locations in the exhibit hall for serving the food so that ALL vendors have an opportunity to be near the food service. "}},{"paragraph":{"text":"3. At a recent trade show I attended, the educational sessions were given far away from the exhibit hall. As a result, when those sessions were over, rather than go back to the exhibit hall, most attendees went out to lunch with their colleagues or took in some sightseeing or went back to the hotel for a nap or watch daytime television. None of the choices listed involved speaking to a vendor. Educational sessions need to be scheduled in rooms close to the exhibit area so that it is easy to travel from the sessions to the exhibit hall. "}},{"paragraph":{"text":"4. Make it comfortable for the attendees to roam the exhibit hall. Provide benches throughout the exhibit area so that people can rest, collect their thoughts, meet a friend, or sip some iced tea. After resting for a short time, the attendee can resume activities. "}},{"paragraph":{"text":"5. Create areas where a vendor can quietly meet with a prospect\u002Fcustomer away from the sometimes-noisy booth. In addition, create a “vendor only area” where the company representatives can sit down on a comfortable chair, have a cup of coffee and a snack away from the crowd. Both suggested areas need to be equipped with efficient Internet connections."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"6. Visibility of the Executive Director and\u002For Association Management to be always at the exhibit hall fielding questions from vendors and attendees alike. The show is a commitment to education and excellence on the part of the organization. They should show that they are interested in everyone’s opinion and that they are taking those comments seriously so that the following year’s meeting will be better than the current one. "}},{"paragraph":{"text":"7. Create a “check-list” for the attendees that includes every vendor’s booth number with a map on where each is located. Make it easy to identify and find every vendor. And by the way, such a map is good place to sell ads for additional association revenue opportunities. "}},{"paragraph":{"text":"8. Serving of “fun” food at various times of the day in the exhibit area. Did someone say ice cream? Kit\u002FKats, etc. Or how about popcorn? The reality is that these eight steps are not difficult to do, although they require some work to carry them through. The organization owes it to their members and vendors to make the effort to improve the quality of the current and future meetings."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"And what should the attendees know about the vendors who line the aisles in the exhibit hall at their annual meeting? What do they have in common?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Firstly, every attendee and every vendor has invested significant time and money to attend the meeting. Both the attendees and the vendors have at some point driven their cars to the airport nearest their homes, checked their baggage, stood in an endless line at airport security, took off their shoes, probably had their plane delayed due to some unforeseen emergency, found every seat on the plane filled with all different types of people; young, old, and now often, furry (comfort dogs and cats). Upon arrival at the destination airport, waited for their checked bags, then squeezed into a cab to be transported to the hotel where their room was not yet ready upon arrival and then had a marginal dinner at a restaurant near the hotel. I call it “expected discomfort” all in the hopes of having productive meetings over the following days. At the very least, each attendee needs to visit every vendor that has relevant products for their organization. Attendees who avoid the exhibit hall are cheating themselves, their organization, their employer and literally biting the hand that feeds them."}},{"subhead":{"text":"What A Trade Show Should Be"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The primary role of a Trade show for any industry is simply to bring the buyer and seller together in a congenial setting. Additionally, the role of the Trade show is to educate their attendees on the latest developments within their industry by bringing in experts to educate about new products and industry trends. And finally, it is the role of the association trade show to make sure that as many people as possible like the meeting so much, that they sign up for next years’ meeting."}},{"subhead":{"text":"What A Trade Show Should Not Be"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Travelling to cities is always fascinating and exciting. A trade show is not designed to be just a travel destination. Organizers try to schedule these meetings in cities where there are interesting attractions to visit, but the show is designed to get people together to conduct business and education. In the past, a trade show served three specific purposes. 1. It was a place to look for a job. Still relevant and perhaps needed more by an unemployed person, but the trade show does not promise employment to those out of work. And now there are on-line services that do a great job finding suitable employment. 2. It was a place to network amongst friends. Now more than ever before, jobs in an industry are being filled at organizations in every corner of the world. As a result, colleagues who worked near one another use the trade show as a meeting place to renew friendships. Still a relevant reason to attend the trade show, but not the main reason. Still relevant, but the Internet has taken over the role of networking between friends and business opportunities. 3. And thirdly, many vendors in the information industry used to use the trade show to sell books. Today, very few vendors sell books at trade shows."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The bottom line is that the trade show is a great place to meet and greet, but its main purpose is to prepare an environment that is conducive to buying and selling activities."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Mike is currently the Managing Partner of Gruenberg Consulting, LLC, a firm he founded in January 2012 after a successful career as a senior sales executive in the information industry.

Our consortium administers a single Sierra system with shared bibliographic records. In 2019, the WNCLN Technical Services Committee, which manages network-level cataloging policies and workflows, raised the idea of changing the unethical Library of Congress Subject Heading (LCSH) Illegal aliens based on the 2016 ALA Resolution. 1 From there, our work toward building a more inclusive catalog began."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Disruptions from COVID-19 and staffing shortages delayed the project until the summer of 2020, when a small group of WNCLN librarians began investigating how other libraries were updating and maintaining replacements for unethical and inaccurate headings that the Library of Congress was slow to change. Work began with an article review, consultation with vendors, and emails with colleagues at other institutions about their methods for changing and maintaining headings. The working group brainstormed about the process, and the Network Librarian began to explore feasible workflows in Sierra."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"To coordinate subject heading replacements with similar work being done in other libraries, we use the Cataloging Lab project as a resource for identifying problematic subject headings and proposed replacement terms. 2 We began to seek input from library faculty at our institutions and affected members of our broader communities, and we explored alternative vocabularies, such as the Homosaurus, the Disability Language Style Guide, among others. 3, 4 We have found that with the multitude of problematic headings that are in use, it can become difficult to choose which terms to prioritize for replacement. We decided to prioritize terms for replacement based on their frequency of use in our shared catalog, including the number of additional entries that each subject has, such as related headings and See Also tracings."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Our workflow was initially drafted by the WNCLN Network Librarian and has continually undergone refinement with input from the WCU Cataloging and Metadata Librarian and other members of the working group. The workflow for replacing a problematic subject heading with local terms includes three main facets: authority record replacement, global updates for holdover headings, and global updates for See Also tracings. In addition to these three processes that must be run for each term that is replaced, strategies for ongoing review and maintenance must be budgeted into the overarching project plan."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The first and most essential step of the replacement workflow is to replace the subject authority record. In Sierra, we do this by first duplicating the authority record for the problematic subject heading in our system and then suppressing the original problematic record. This action removes the authority record from display in the public catalog. It is important to have the ability to trace suppressed problematic records with their replacement records, and one way that we do this is by adding a 590 note to the suppressed record with standardized language that references the new replacement record number."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Once the original record is suppressed and its 590 note is added, we save and close it and move on to editing the new authority record for the replacement term. In the replacement record, we first enter the original problematic heading into a 450 See From tracing so that catalog searches for this offensive heading will direct users to the new preferred term. Next, we edit the topical term in the record’s 150 field to the desired replacement heading so that the preferred term is active in our system. Finally, we edit the control number in the replacement record’s 001 and 010 fields with a note using a specific convention. This update prevents a duplicated control number from overlaying the authority records in our authority record updates from MARCIVE and traces the new replacement record back to the original suppressed record."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Once the 150 field is updated in the replacement record, the system will begin the overnight authority process of replacing 650 subject fields that contained the original problematic headings in bibliographic records. The authority record changes do not replace all instances of the problematic heading in bibliographic records, however. From the authority record replacements that we have made so far, an average of 4.4% of the problematic headings remain in bibliographic records after the overnight authority record process has made its changes. Some remaining headings are easy to explain–for example, the authority record changes often do not apply to anything that does not use the second indicator 0 in a 650, such as juvenile and FAST headings. Furthermore, subject headings that are used heavily as topical subdivisions will not be replaced by the authority record changes, either."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Mysteriously, some LCSH headings that are coded normally as 650_0 |a also remain after authority record changes. These stragglers, along with the remaining juvenile and FAST headings and topical subdivisions, require the second step of the replacement workflow in Sierra: global updates for holdover headings. We first run a list in Sierra to find all the lingering problematic headings. The parameters for this list query are bibliographic records that have the exact problematic heading phrase in their 650_0|a or |x, 650_1|a or |x, or 650_7|a or |x subfields. Depending on the semantics of a given subject heading, these parameters may need to be adjusted, and you can always expand the search on second and further passes."}},{"photo":{"dimensions":{"height":544,"width":697},"imageUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fstories.isu.pub\u002F100847570\u002Fimages\u002F39_original_file_I0.jpg"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Once we have our set list of remaining problematic headings in bibliographic records, we search this list in the Global Updates function of Sierra and load a command input template that we have reserved for this project.

Running the global updates is a straightforward process, but list parameters, input commands, and change previews must be reviewed carefully at every step to ensure that unwanted changes are not implemented."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The final phase of our LCSH replacement workflow in Sierra requires running a second global update to replace the problematic heading in 550 See Also tracings. This step ensures that tracings to related headings are carried over to replacement headings. This process is like the global updates for replacing holdovers from the authority record replacement, except it is more straightforward since there are fewer parameters to set. First, we create a list of authority records that exactly match the problematic heading in their 550 fields, review the returns on that search, and run a global update with a command update that changes the problematic heading to the replacement heading in the 550."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Just like that, after working through these three processes in the workflow, the catalog no longer returns anything for a search for the problematic heading except “See [replacement heading]” ... that is, not until the next time a large eBook record load is performed. Periodic global updates do have to be run to catch the small percentage of headings that are not incorporated into the automatic authority record changes. We have also found that there are a few manual fixes that will have to be made for some headings that are misspelled or that have MARC encoding errors that do not get incorporated even into global updates, and these types of errors are more readily found when searching the OPAC instead of within the ILS. Currently, we are exploring more streamlined options that will minimize ongoing maintenance of replacement terms, such as adjusting our load table profile with Innovative. Additionally, we have explored the option of using MARCIVE services to achieve these ends but found that their services are still too limited for effectively replacing these problematic headings."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Outside the mechanics of this workflow, one of our biggest takeaways from delving into problematic LCSH replacement work is that documentation and communication are paramount. Careful internal documentation enables you to walk back any missteps, keep statistics, and undo changes to authority records when appropriate. Different approaches to communicating with your consortium, your colleagues, and your broader community are essential for getting approval and feedback for the changes you wish to undertake in your catalog. It is also crucial to keep librarians who work in research support and bibliographic instruction apprised of changes to the authorized headings that they are accustomed to using."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Looking to the future, we plan to contribute to advocacy for changes to LCSHs at the national level and undo our replacement work when authorized subject headings are eventually replaced with ones that are more modern, equitable, and representative. We will continue to refine our replacement workflow so that it can be implemented and maintained efficiently. Our other concerns moving forward include a planned migration from Sierra, more exploration of how these changes can affect our discovery layer, and the potential for advocacy among vendors."}},{"subhead":{"text":"References"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"“Disability Language Style Guide.” National Center on Disability and Journalism.

The CCB was intended to offer a “small claims” process for low-dollar copyright lawsuits and includes the ability for individuals and libraries to opt out. Several legal scholars and library copyright experts have followed the CCB closely including my friend Katie Fortney, the Copyright Policy & Education Officer at the California Digital Library, who has regularly shared data on the CCB. In addition, Professor Eric Goldman blogged about the initial round of CCB claims, offering a snapshot as well as his full data set here: https:\u002F\u002Fblog.ericgoldman.org\u002F archives\u002F2022\u002F07\u002Fa-first-look-at-copyright-claims-board-ccbfilings.htm. According to Goldman, in the first month the CCB received 58 filings which puts it on pace for about 700 filings annually. The initial set of claims included a lot of the usual suspects — photographers objecting to unauthorized use of their images, disputes about songwriting and sampling, and so forth. Indeed, early filings included claims dealing with works by singersongwriter Michelle Schocked and the rap group the Wu Tang Clan along with whimsical works such as Halloween masks and fairy wings. The first set of claims dealing directly with academic works included a filing over American University’s Action Learning for Federal Agencies (ALFA) program, which author Robert Kramer claims borrows from his article “From Skillset to Mindset: A New Paradigm for Leader Development.” This claim, which implicates both individual authors of articles and university programs, will be closely-watched."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"One other claim that did impact higher education and may signal more activity to come was a professor’s claim against a site called EssayZoo for hosting a student’s posting of instructions and paper prompts from the professor’s course. Frustration with students sharing unauthorized copies of course materials is an ongoing issue for many faculty and it remains to be seen whether others will look to the CCB to address these issues."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Several organizations also launched resources to support those with claims before the CCB. In a previous column, I shared the ARL’s toolkit for libraries responding to the CCB (https:\u002F\u002Fwww.arl.org\u002Fcase-act-toolkit\u002F). The Library of Congress also shared a new blog post over the summer introducing the program, which some critics felt painted an overly-sunny view of the process for defendants. Indeed, the Author’s Alliance shared a statement indicating “authors should be cautious about staying in the CCB if they receive a claim.” The Copyright Alliance also announced their Small Claims Opt-Out Protection (SCOOP) Program designed to encourage use of the CCB by reimbursing the $40 filing fee in cases where a defendant does opt out. We are still in the early days of the program, but it has been interesting to see how various communities have used and encouraged others to engage with the CCB."}},{"subhead":{"text":"QUESTION: A professor asks, “What license should I choose when creating open materials?”"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"ANSWER: While the academy is moving towards a clear recognition of the value of open access to published research findings, open educational materials, and so forth, there is an active and ongoing conversation about what makes a resource truly “open.” In addition to robust discussions about facilitating technical and social access and inclusion in scholarly communication, there is a legal question about how to license materials so they are openly available for access and reuse. Various definitions of “openness” have been promulgated by different organizations and most of them focus on providing materials freely on the open web with a specific license that permits access and some form of reuse. With the exception of open source computer code (which is supported by a huge set of code-specific licenses) most open materials are legally defined by a Creative Commons license. At one point there was a rough consensus (or at least a series of aspirational statements from leaders in the field) that the preferred CC license for open materials was CC BY (permitting reuse as long as attribution is provided) because it permitted the widest reuse and was more likely to be compatible with the licenses applied to other works."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"In recent years however, there is a growing recognition that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to open licenses. While there are still very good reasons to choose a CC BY license that permits most uses as long as attribution is provided, different types of materials have proved to be better-served by other licenses. For example, open data sets can raise complicated questions about ownership of materials that may be unprotected by copyright and about international issues with database rights. As a result, most open data communities, including the Creative Commons itself, recommend using the CC0 public domain dedication to maximize the re-use of data and databases. Likewise, for open monographs some scholars report that they are more comfortable applying the more restrictive CC BYNC-ND license that limits commercial reuse and the creation of derivative works. Many creators in the open education community have also embraced CC BY-NC as a way to push back on for-profit free-riders who scoop up openly-licensed materials and bundle them in commercial products. Perhaps most of all, the open knowledge community is increasingly sensitive to the fact that every author may have their own individual reason for choosing a license. A simple statement that one license is preferred as the “most open” risks harming the needs of those creators. If there is a north star in the field today, it is probably the idea that materials should be “as open as possible, as closed as necessary.”"}},{"subhead":{"text":"QUESTION: A music librarian asks, “What’s going on with that lawsuit about the Bridgerton Musical?”"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"ANSWER: The Netflix show Bridgerton, which followed the love lives of the Regency-era Bridgerton family, was a phenomenon in 2021 and fans of the show have created a huge body of fan works including fan art, fan fiction, and so forth celebrating and building on the show. One striking example is “The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical” project which began with a January 2021 video posted to songwriter Abigail Barlow’s TikTok account. What began as a single song quickly went viral and,"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"with support from fans around the world, became a full album that topped iTunes’ U.S. pop charts in September. The album became such a phenomenon that it went on to win a Grammy award and Barlow, along with her writing partner, composer Emily Bear, was invited to perform the Musical at the Kennedy Center’s 50th Anniversary Celebration Concert. Of course, copyright in Bridgerton belongs to Netflix, who was initially supportive of the project, permitting Barlow and Bear to create, share, and even sell the album and a related songbook. In contrast, Netflix drew a clear line at the idea of live performances of the work, sending a message that “Netflix would not authorize and did not want them to engage in any live performances (e.g., performances of “The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical”) or other derivative works that might compete with Netflix’s own planned live events,” including the multi-city “Bridgerton Experience.”"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Despite this message, Barlow and Bear decided to go ahead with the Kennedy Center performance as well as subsequent dates at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Netflix attempted to negotiate a license for these performances but Barlow and Bear refused, and Netflix filed a lawsuit against Barlow and Bear in July of 2022. The case itself is relatively straightforward — the Musical is clearly a derivative work and it would be difficult to make a compelling fair use argument for a presentation of basically the same characters in the same story without any parodic elements, especially given that the Musical is in direct competition with Netflix own live events. It remains to be seen whether the parties will settle and whether the public will get a chance to enjoy live performances of this popular musical."}},{"subhead":{"text":"QUESTION: The director of a university press asks, “I heard that the EU offers special copyright protections for news organizations when their content is used by aggregators. Has the U.S. ever considered any similar rules?”"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"ANSWER: This is a timely question. The EU’s Copyright Directive does establish “ancillary copyright” protections for press publishers to enable them to obtain compensation from online news aggregators who use their content. This is still in early stages and has drawn a fair amount of criticism from copyright scholars. In 2021, the Copyright Office announced a public study on the need for similar legislation in the U.S., soliciting comments and holding a roundtable on the issue. Based on the nearly fifty comments it received, the Copyright Office issued a final report in June 2022. The report “recognizes that adequate funding for journalism may currently be at risk and that there are implications for the press’s essential role in our system of government.” Nevertheless, the Office also recognized that U.S. law already grants significant protections to press publishers and that the core challenges to funding for news organizations is not directly related to copyright law itself. As a result, the Office concluded that it “does not believe it has been established that any shortcomings in copyright law pose an obstacle to incentivizing journalism or that new copyright-like protections would solve the problems that press publishers face.” In light of this evidence, the Office did not recommend adopting a new ancillary copyright to bolster press publishers’ protections."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"While it is possible that Congress will still take up the issue, the relatively low level of engagement with the initial study and the Copyright Office’s clear recommendation suggests that copyright-like protections of the kind being developed in the EU are unlikely to be developed in the U.S. You can read the full report here: https:\u002F\u002Fcopyright.gov\u002Fpolicy\u002F publishersprotections\u002F."}}]},"summary":"Column Editor: Will Cross (Director of the Open Knowledge Center and Head of Information Policy, NC State University Libraries) \u003Cwmcross@ncsu.edu\u003E ORCID: 0000-0003-1287-1156","articleLinks":{"path":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002Fs\u002F16853477","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fissuu.com\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002Fs\u002F16853477"},"avatarFallbackUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fphoto.isu.pub\u002Fdefault_user\u002Fphoto_large.png","documentLinks":{"path":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F33","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fissuu.com\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F33"},"documentTitle":"Against the Grain V34#4, September, 2022 Full Issue","uri":"sept_2022_v34-4_hr","username":"against-the-grain","ownerId":32012799,"isTeamsOwned":false,"teamData":{}},{"id":"16853476","userId":"32891271","revisionId":"7377820","documentSlotId":"93707709","title":"Learning Belongs in the Library","description":"","coverImageUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fstories.isu.pub\u002F100847570\u002Fimages\u002F37_original_file_I0.jpg?crop=824%2C618%2Cx0%2Cy59&originalHeight=737&originalWidth=824&zoom=1","startPage":35,"readTime":720,"createdAt":"2022-09-16T01:29:38.000Z","pages":[35,36,37],"content":{"version":2,"json":[{"header":{"headline":{"text":"Learning Belongs in the Library"},"photo":{"dimensions":{"height":737,"width":824},"imageUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fstories.isu.pub\u002F100847570\u002Fimages\u002F37_original_file_I0.jpg?crop=824%2C618%2Cx0%2Cy59&originalHeight=737&originalWidth=824&zoom=1"}}},{"subhead":{"text":"Perspectives on Post-Pandemic Library Provisioning of Course Reading and Textbook Material"}},{"subhead":{"text":"An Interview with Dominic Broadhurst of the University of Salford in the UK"}},{"byline":{"text":"Column Editor: David Parker (Director of Product Management Underline Science & Founder Lived Places Publishing; Phone: 201-673-8784) \u003Cdavid@parkerthepublisher.com\u003E parkerthepublisher.com"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The pandemic may be largely behind us in terms of its impact on universities and libraries being physically open, but there have been lasting effects on textbook and course reading fulfilment. My specific curiosities, as concerns the lasting impact of the pandemic and the library, is the transition from print to digital, the place of the library in the acquisition and delivery of textbooks, and the rise of new providers and new business models. This set of questions led me recently to consider how the landscape has shifted in UK libraries and what this might mean for North American libraries. The UK library is a special case in regard to the role of the library in textbook delivery as the UK university library has largely replaced the bookstore as the central actor in collecting faculty reading list requirements and then acquiring and delivering materials to students. What follows is an interview with Dominic Broadhurst, Head of Content and Discovery at the University of Salford. Dominic is active on many advisory boards across the industry and is an ever-present voice in the ongoing discussion concerning textbook pricing and library access. My questions are in bold and Dominic’s answer follows:"}},{"subhead":{"text":"Is the impact of the pandemic over as concerns the libraries provisioning of textbooks to support course reading lists?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"It would seem that the immediate impact of the pandemic is probably now over in terms of textbooks support in the fact that most libraries have re-opened their doors after being forced to shut, which of course does allow access to print again. However, it has left several legacy issues and indeed opportunities which also coincides with how many libraries really want to push forward their digital first policies. What has remained and is just, if not more, prevalent is the desire to provide equitable and workable solutions around textbooks for our students, which meet institutional goals of positively impacting upon teaching and learning. Issues around affordability, equitable access, and sustainability remain."}},{"subhead":{"text":"How has the print versus digital distribution in textbook delivery for students shifted: pre-pandemic, pandemic, postpandemic?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"In many ways, these changes were already taking place as many libraries were looking at digital solutions for textbook provision before the pandemic. Obviously, during the pandemic, the issue became more prevalent in a short space of time and libraries had to move rapidly to enable all our students to access textbooks they needed, when, as mentioned, the physical libraries were closed. This had implications for affordability for libraries, often having to repurpose budgets quickly to ensure our students could use the digital textbook that they needed for their studies. Post pandemic I think there will still be a market for print, but this will be reducing and possibly will only occur when the digital solutions are either unaffordable or simply not available to libraries. It’s fair to say some students still prefer print, but the advantages of digital, especially with textbooks, are taking priority."}},{"subhead":{"text":"Has the place of reading list solutions like Talis and Leganto changed in any fundamental way because of the pandemic? For example, have any new providers emerged? Have any new features of high value emerged?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"I don’t think these solutions have changed in any fundamental way because of the pandemic, except to bring their value to the fore more. It’s a similar tale as regards digital with textbooks in that the rationale underpinning their value and functionality in terms of supporting blended learning and giving students access to resources seamlessly and quickly has just made these solutions even more relevant. In particular as they are combined with and linked seamlessly within the Virtual Learning Environments every institution uses. In terms of high value, what we’re looking at is increasing the range of resource we are both integrating with and are embedded within these reading lists solutions. This, in essence, means increasing the range of resources both provided and linked beyond the traditional options such as books (“e” and print) and e-journals to include a greater range of multimedia formats and new content solutions. We are also interrogating the analytics more to gauge value and drive engagement and intervention with certain class cohorts about increasing resource usage."}},{"subhead":{"text":"How has your budget changed, if at all, in any longlasting way, in supporting textbook acquisition?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"In terms of academic libraries, I would say several options are now on the table. Some academic libraries managed to leverage additional resource from the parent institution, especially during the pandemic, but the issue of whether or if this can and should be sustained over a long period is still up for debate. With some libraries, they have had to or wanted to reposition or reshape their existing budgets to cater to the e-textbook need, which again raises issues of sustainability and whether the spend is showing sufficient return on investment. Its fair to say that opinions and experiences are mixed on this, and many libraries are revaluating this spend. Finally, for some libraries, they cannot support significant e-textbook acquisition, especially as there is a real debate concerning issues around affordability and accessibility for textbooks for their students and the role of libraries being constrained in their mission to provide all the resources their students need."}},{"subhead":{"text":"Considering the entrenched, large providers like Pearson, McGraw Hill, and Cengage, what have you seen in terms of moving toward or away from supporting the library? For example, new access models, or policy shifts on digital rights management."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"In many ways it’s been a mixed bag from traditional providers, but it’s fair to say many publishers are seeing the library as one of their sales channels, which was not always the case, especially in markets such as the USA. This can either take the form of delivering their titles through an aggregator, such as an established library eBook provider (though of course not all textbooks are often available via this channel), or from one of the new e-textbook focused aggregators, that have come to the market in recent years. Some of the publishers are also looking to target and sell directly to academic libraries through their own platforms. All this can lead to a fragmented and confusing marketplace, which is an issue for libraries and the students and faculty they serve. Paradoxically many traditional providers are also looking at delivering a direct to student model, often on an annual subscription basis in addition to direct sales of copies to students. Pearson and Cengage have recently done this and it clearly benefits them if they can scale up, though of course students often need access to textbooks from a range of publishers."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"In many ways, providers are looking to both maximise all the opportunities and new sales channels created by digital but, in my view, they are not quite sure which is the most optimal solution, so they are spreading their bets. As mentioned, this does lead to a fragmented and confusing marketplace and libraries are often squeezed in terms of time and resources to fully evaluate all available business model options. Publishers want the institutional sales from universities and hope to benefit from scale, but not via a traditional library sales model. They are also somewhat caught between the twin poles of maximising current revenues whilst achieving long term sustainable solutions from the shift to digital, thus experimenting with various models."}},{"subhead":{"text":"New providers gained significant traction during the pandemic, such as Perlego and BibliU. What is your perspective on the impact of these new entrants? Were they a force for productive change or disruption? Did they improve the available options for libraries in the UK accessing textbooks for students?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"It’s certainly true to say these new providers have provided both innovation and disruption to the traditional market, which has meant that traditional publishers have also had to look at their offerings and how they package their textbooks for both libraries and students. This could be seen as a force for positive change and more choice, which means more options but the inherent problem for these new providers is that they don’t own the content and the content is still owned and provided by the publishers. Therefore, the prices they can offer through their various access methods are still inextricably tied to the price the publisher sets, factoring in any discounts they can leverage from the publishers. It’s certainly true to say that the publishers have bought into new models, such as the student direct consumer model, and new demand driven models for libraries which are being quite well received. So, in summary, yes, the options have increased but many of the similar restrictions and issues around access to content and publisher pricing controls still exist."}},{"subhead":{"text":"For North American librarians, can you describe the role the library plays in textbook fulfilment in the UK?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"UK Libraries are much more involved in the provision of textbooks to students as opposed to U.S. libraries, where this was traditionally undertaken by the campus bookstore. In the past, before the digital age, this usually meant stocking numerous copies of print textbooks both in high demand collections and on the “normal” shelves. Many libraries had purchasing ratios whereby they acquired and provided print textbooks based on student enrollment numbers, e.g., 1 textbook for every 20 students in a course. And this was especially so for courses where textbooks are fundamental aspects of the teaching, e.g., law, accountancy, medicine etc. Obviously, this provisioning of print still faced many challenges regarding access and our ability to provide our students with enough copies and it was therefore quite an unwieldy and inflexible solution."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Therefore, even in pre-pandemic days, many academic libraries were looking at how they could provide digital copies of textbooks to their students, often negotiating on a 1 to 1 student basis whereby they would provide targeted access to targeted courses or, if possible, sourcing from a traditional library eBook aggregator. The librarian was at the centre of negotiations within their institutions around the provision of textbooks for the students as opposed to the U.S. model where this was normally left to the bookstore to deal directly with publishers."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Of course, the issue of affordability still exists and the ability of libraries to purchase textbooks beyond the 1 to 1 model. But it’s fair to say there is a much greater willingness of libraries and librarians in the UK to deal with textbook provisioning as we are the resource centre the students look to for their studies."}},{"subhead":{"text":"Perlego and BibliU both announced this past spring large series A funding raises of many millions of pounds\u002Fdollars with the express intent of achieving growth in North America. Perlego will need to compete\u002Fcomplement direct-to-student models from Pearson and Cengage and BibliU will need to focus on inclusive access solutions and its relationship with libraries, although the library is far less central to textbook acquisition in North America as compared to the UK. How do you see Perlego and BibliU evolving?"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"I think it’s fair to say that both will probably have more traction and potential to grow in the U.S. market. As already discussed, the direct 1 to 1 student acquisition model is much more entrenched within the U.S. education system. BibliU is also making advances in their bespoke provision to college libraries, often replacing the campus bookstore and essentially tying in their offer with the inclusive access model, which is under great debate in the U.S. Although this is still related to the student’s ability to pay, provisioning can be subsidised by the student’s institutions and this model is growing. Whilst tending to be more individual student focused, as opposed to institution focused, Perlego can take advantage of the student 1-1 purchase model so prevalent in the U.S. Their advantage over the comparable subscription models offered by individual publishers is that they can offer the students a greater range of content from a broad set of publishers, making the appeal of their subscriptions more extensive to a wider range of students.

My specific curiosities, as concerns the lasting impact of the pandemic and the library, is the transition from print to digital, the place of the library in the acquisition and delivery of textbooks, and the rise of new providers and new business models. This set of questions led me recently to consider how the landscape has shifted in UK libraries and what this might mean for North American libraries. The UK library is a special case in regard to the role of the library in textbook delivery as the UK university library has largely replaced the bookstore as the central actor in collecting faculty reading list requirements and then acquiring and delivering materials to students. What follows is an interview with Dominic Broadhurst, Head of Content and Discovery at the University of Salford. Dominic is active on many advisory boards across the industry and is an ever-present voice in the ongoing discussion concerning textbook pricing and library access. My questions are in bold and Dominic’s answer follows:","articleLinks":{"path":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002Fs\u002F16853476","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fissuu.com\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002Fs\u002F16853476"},"avatarFallbackUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fphoto.isu.pub\u002Fdefault_user\u002Fphoto_large.png","documentLinks":{"path":"\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F35","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fissuu.com\u002Fagainst-the-grain\u002Fdocs\u002Fsept_2022_v34-4_hr\u002F35"},"documentTitle":"Against the Grain V34#4, September, 2022 Full Issue","uri":"sept_2022_v34-4_hr","username":"against-the-grain","ownerId":32012799,"isTeamsOwned":false,"teamData":{}},{"id":"16853475","userId":"32891271","revisionId":"7377311","documentSlotId":"93707709","title":"Legally Speaking","description":"","coverImageUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.isu.pub\u002Fdocument-structure\u002F220915234415-b36e27ce57f3c9692c78938ae9c97f5c\u002Fv1\u002Fa0fb2b6c8937ce25e446aa041e6b185d.jpeg","startPage":31,"readTime":501,"createdAt":"2022-09-15T23:44:31.000Z","pages":[31,32],"content":{"version":2,"json":[{"header":{"headline":{"text":"Legally Speaking"},"photo":{"dimensions":{"height":686,"width":888},"imageUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.isu.pub\u002Fdocument-structure\u002F220915234415-b36e27ce57f3c9692c78938ae9c97f5c\u002Fv1\u002Fa0fb2b6c8937ce25e446aa041e6b185d.jpeg"}}},{"headline":{"text":"LEGAL ISSUES"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Section Editors: Bruce Strauch (Retired, The Citadel) \u003Cbruce.strauch@gmail.com\u003E Jack Montgomery (Georgia Southern University) \u003Cjmontgomery@georgiasouthern.edu\u003E"}},{"headline":{"text":"Legally Speaking — Antitrust"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Column Editor: Ashley Krenelka Chase (Assistant Professor of Law, Stetson University College of Law) \u003Cakrenelk@law.stetson.edu\u003E"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Editor’s Note: ATG is pleased to welcome a new column editor for “Legally Speaking!” Ashley Krenelka Chase is currently an Assistant Professor of Law at Stetson University College of Law, where she teaches legal research and writing.

When it was first passed by Congress, antitrust laws were drafted “to preserve free and unfettered competition.” Today, antitrust laws continue to have the same goal: “to protect the process of competition for the benefit of consumers, making sure there are strong incentives for businesses to operate efficiently, keep prices down, and keep quality up.”1 Typically when we hear about antitrust laws in the news or online, it is with regard to anti-competitive conduct like monopolization. Monopolies come to exist when a single market force (like Meta) tries to take over an entire industry and erase all competition. Antitrust is arguably one of the most interesting areas of the law (or perhaps that’s just me), but cases rarely move forward; there’s too much money in maintaining the status quo. The United States does like to allow mega corporations to maintain their chokehold on individual industries, and libraries are not immune. Instead, we see companies merging with very little outcry from either the public or regulatory agencies. In libraries, these acquisitions often happen without any forewarning. When I worked as a librarian, I received the notification that Innovative Interfaces was acquired by ProQuest. While I was not surprised by that acquisition, I was surprised when ProQuest was quickly acquired by Clarivate, leaving my (and many other librarians’) head spinning. RELX, the corporate giant that owns the Lexis legal research platform, routinely purchases small legal research or analytics start-ups that threaten the market (LexMachina and Ravel come immediately to mind)."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Recently, however, a small research platform has successfully moved forward with an antitrust claim that seems to have momentum, and it all started as a copyright case. In 2020, Thomson Reuters (parent company of Westlaw) filed a suit against ROSS Intelligence for copyright infringement (Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbH v. ROSS Intelligence, Inc., 20-cv-00613). Thomson Reuters alleged that ROSS obtained copyrighted legal content from two types of parties, a business with whom Westlaw contracted and current law students who accessed their academic Westlaw research accounts while in the employ of ROSS Intelligence; Thomson Reuters alleged that ROSS Intelligence used copyrighted content acquired from those two types of parties to build their own legal research product. Thomson Reuters made additional claims about unlawful interference with contracts and business dealings (similar to those claims made in the OCLC\u002FClarivate suit) and those claims are moving forward, as well, but we will save all discussion of business torts for a future column. As is often the case in this type of litigation, ROSS filed a motion to dismiss Thomson Reuters’ copyright claims. In addition to the motion to dismiss, ROSS countersued using claims based on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, alleging that Thomson Reuters unlawfully tied two unrelated products together and required customers to license both. This case is one to watch because, while ROSS failed to have Thomson Reuters’s copyright claims against them dismissed, they have thus far been successful in arguing that Westlaw’s legal search tool is unlawfully tied to their public law database. ROSS argues that the coupling of the research function and the legal content it searches has led to Westlaw’s dominance in the legal research marketplace, which amounts to anticompetitive conduct. Antitrust is not usually an area where we see a lot of movement, and ROSS being allowed to move forward with these claims may have noteworthy implications for libraries. Tying is an interesting concept in antitrust and it is particularly interesting when it is considered alongside the way our research platforms operate. Under a tying arrangement, consumers looking to buy a product may only do so if they purchase a different product they don’t want from the same seller. The tying of the two products, in and of itself, is not enough for a valid claim; as with any consumer-related claim, the tying has to have a substantial effect on trade or commerce. Because of the requirement that trade or commerce be effected, these cases"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"typically only move forward against large sellers with substantial power in the market, and only when cases are brought by parties who have a large market share, themselves. As an example, if you want to buy a book from me, but I won’t allow you to buy the book from me unless you also by a DVD from me, that is likely not unlawful tying. I am, after all, a lowly individual trying to make a buck and, on my own, have no ability to significantly impact the book and\u002For DVD market. But if a vendor like EBSCO tells the New York Public Library it can buy access to a religion database that the library requests, but only if they buy a science database that they don’t want and has no value to your library, that is likely tying that would be prohibited by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 2"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Here, the tying concept is even more interesting because it’s not two completely distinct products being tied together, at least not in the eyes of an average user who is accustomed to researching online. In Thomson Reuters v. ROSS Intelligence the tying being alleged is, essentially, between a search bar and the Internet; imagine if you had to pay for Google and alleging that Google is unlawfully tying use of its search bar to the rest of the Internet! Seems crazy, right? Based on the filings in this case, though, it doesn’t seem so crazy. Thomson Reuters attempted to argue that their legal research tool hasn’t ever been sold separately from the database of public law it searches; they argued that the products, therefore, are the same. The trick, however, is that for decades the database of law upon which the legal research tool relies was published in print! Without an electronic search tool! And other companies have successfully sold databases of law products without a related search tool."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"ROSS Intelligence also alleged that Thomson Reuters’ licensing agreements with customers is restrictive because the research tool and the collection can’t be unbundled. That, they said, also amounts to tying, and the judge agreed that claim could move forward, as well."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"But lest we assume ROSS was going to be able to move forward with all their counterclaims, it’s important to note that ROSS brought an additional claim, alleging that the initial copyright infringement suit brought by Thomson Reuters against ROSS was “shame litigation” brought exclusively for anti-competitive purposes. As a librarian (who regularly uses Westlaw), it sure looked like shame litigation to me, but the shame litigation claim was quickly dismissed, because ROSS couldn’t show Thomson Reuters had improper intent to have filed the copyright suit in the first place."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"This case, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, is one to watch for librarians and vendors. When you look at the landscape of the databases libraries provide for our patrons, many of them are providing a research tool that interacts with a database of information that was previously available only in print. Some vendors do offer the option of uncoupling the information from the search mechanism. In those situations, you often need to purchase separate MARC records and direct patrons to a designated workstation to access the information, but if budgets are tight it may be worth asking vendors if the database of information can be purchased separately from the search tool to make large databases significantly more affordable."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"These conversations are also important to increase transparency between libraries and vendors. As resources become significantly more expensive and contracts between parties become more complicated, transparency in not only pricing but functionality can improve relationships between parties in any negotiation, but will certainly benefit the library\u002F vendor relationship. And vendors and publishers shouldn’t shy away from these conversations; research providers who are open to sharing information, unbundling resources, and making things affordable for libraries and their patrons are often more appealing partners for libraries because they are open to conversations about what will best meet the needs of the library and its users."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"None of this is to say that separating research functionality from collections is the right move. Depending on your library, its collection, staffing, and patron-base, this may sound like the most ridiculous approach to collections possible. But this litigation between Thomson Reuters and ROSS Intelligence opens the very real possibility that courts may consider “searches” and “results” to stem from two separate products that can’t be required to be sold together by major vendors. If that’s the case, everyone working in libraries right now should start considering how much they’re willing to pay to license not only content, but the search functionality, and negotiate accordingly."}},{"subhead":{"text":"Endnotes"}},{"paragraph":{"text":"1. https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ftc.gov\u002Fadvice-guidance\u002Fcompetitionguidance\u002Fguide-antitrust-laws\u002Fantitrust-laws 2.

I just hated it, and in after years my mother told the story of how the moving man had said to her, “Hey, lady, you sure you want me to unload your stuff here?” That night, the wind still howled and the sand beat on the windows, and nobody slept a wink. It wasn’t just springtime in New Mexico, when these things happened and when in another year the hills were carpeted with yellow caterpillars migrating from who knows where to wherever their genes drove them. (After that squishy experience, that same mother of mine swore never to wear open toed shoes again, and I don’t think she ever did.) No, it was worse because we were moving into a newly built housing development on the base, and, to build the houses, they had bulldozed even the minimal desert vegetation, so for a mile all around us, there was nothing but bare dirt just waiting for a good gust of wind."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"In the months that followed, the spring storms died down, they planted grass around the houses, and my mother learned to vacuum my butch haircut before she tried to wash my hair — after the time when she went straight to soap and water and the stuff that had accumulated turned to mud. And I learned to keep my mouth shut while walking into the wind."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"Now I’m back in the southwest after many years and it’s monsoon season again. Literally monsoon season: the cells of atmospheric energy that come up our way from the Gulf of Baja California are doing exactly what their cousins do coming across the Indian Ocean towards Mumbai. I’ve been away from the southwest so long, of course, that the storms make me nostalgic. Old timers are tired of them, rookies are terrified, and when a good one comes in our direction, I’m out on the deck with a big grin on my face, loving every minute of it and feeling twelve years old again. A couple of years ago, to be sure, I noticed it was getting a little windier than usual and I decided to go inside. Checked the web and saw that in fact the wind was gusting to 60 mph, which really is a good time to take cover."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"But when the rain starts, following on the mountains of dust whipped up at first, it can be truly amazing. We know not to drive through the sudden rivers that can materialize, and we know that the worst will be over in fifteen minutes and it will be safe to go on again. When I first learned to drive, back in El Paso, I did try to drive through one of those instant rivers as fast as I could and then got to climb out of the car and sit on the roof until a kindly elder waded over and showed me how to take the cap off the carburetor and dry the thing out. And so the storms are still exhilarating for me. I come away from one revved up and eyes glowing, my troubles far away. And when one passes us by, visible in the difference but veering past Phoenix’s heat island, I’m disappointed. This is the column I’m writing at a time when lots of what we’re all thinking about is morose and discouraging: the politics of exclusion and disempowerment everywhere and just downright nastiness, a pandemic that just won’t quit, war in Ukraine and mass shootings at home, wildfires and heatwaves, and the acute sense that human beings are better and smarter than this, that we could be more inclusive, more generous, and more peaceful than we are. The best non-storm hour I spent this week was in Phoenix’s spectacular Burton Barr Central Library, wonderful for the architecture, wonderful for the books, but especially wonderful for the swarms of patrons, none of whom had parked a Lamborghini outside, but every one of whom knew they were in a good place, a place for calm, a place for the exercise of intelligence, a place for patient reflection. Quiet libraries, rousing storms, a cheerful kicking baby: 2022 is a good year for paying attention to the things like that, things that ground us and let us cherish the moments we have."}},{"paragraph":{"text":"The mountains in the east are getting hard to make out this afternoon and the sky is darkening.

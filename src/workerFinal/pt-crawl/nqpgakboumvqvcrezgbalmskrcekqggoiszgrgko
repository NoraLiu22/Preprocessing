<p>Notes and Comments</p>

<p>Provisional version by Neil Parsons April 1999</p>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>It is a truism to say that all countries are multicultural but
at the same time are linked to globalized culture. But the
recognition of multiculturalism in Botswana has been blocked, until
the later 1990s, by the need to develop a unifying national
culture. That national culture is based largely upon Setswana
(Tswana language) culture. It represents the growth of a distinct
Botswana nationality defined within state borders, and embraces
elements of postcolonial English culture.</p>

<p>Tswana national culture can be traced back to the incorporation
of diverse peoples under a string of Tswana states, beginning in
the later 18th century and reaching maturity by the time of British
colonization at the end of the 19th century. The Tswana states,
linked by the the kinship ties of their rulers speaking linked
dialects of a common language, were brought together in
allianceagainst common enemies between the 1850s and the 1890s.
Such'tribal' federalism continued into the colonial period.</p>

<p>Everyone within the colonial boundaries of Botswana came to be
regarded as a Motswana, regardless of ethnic origin. Hence many
outsiders assumed that Botswana was a monocultural entity with only
one 'tribe'. But it was not until the end of colonialism that the
old Tswana states were incorporated into a unitary state, under a
powerful central government, between 1964 and 1969.</p>

<p>The dominant national culture of Botswana today reflects the
dual heritage and intermingling of Tswana and English cultural
dominions.</p>

<p>In practice the two languages and cultures are subtly mixed and
alternated in urban and official situations. Membership of
Botswana's ruling circles is marked by equal facility in both
languages and cultures, irrespective of the individual's regional
or ethnic origin and home language.</p>

<p>Multiculturalism, in the form of official recognition of
different local languages for use in schools and on the radio, has
been taboo since the 1960s. It was seen as promoting 'tribalism',
i.e. sub-national separatism and national disunity. (For the same
reasons, the government of Botswana followed Zambia in proclaiming
a national policy of 'nonracialism' rather than
'multiracialism'.)</p>

<p>But by the end of the 1990s, now that the universal acceptance
of national identity is no longer seen as a problem, there is a
more relaxed and permissive attitude in Botswana towards
multiculturalism in general and multilingualism in particular.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Botswana makes its contributions to global culture.
Words derived from Setswana in foreign dictionaries include
Kalahari, Tsetse, and Tilapia. Distinctive baskets from north-west
Botswana have carved out an export market in the United States
since the 1970s. The most successful (and controversial for
Margaret Thatcher) design of a British Airways tailplane in the
late 1990s was by an artist from the Kuru Project in the Kalahari.
Blue and yellow coloured diamonds from Botswana are found on
fingers and necks across the globe - though the typical Botswana
diamond is clear and cloudless, full of reflected light.</p>

<h2>Music &amp; drama</h2>

<p>Traditional Tswana music was generally based on the human voice
and string instruments, with a general lack of drumming.
Traditional music and dance generally declined during the last
decades of the colonial period, as such culture was suspected of
being antithetical to modernity and development. Since independence
there has been a revival of interest, with school dance troupes
welcoming official visitors, but music on radio is dominated by
black South African and imported African-American 'soul' music.</p>

<p>See the Music from Botswana page on www.mediaport.net on a
French-sourced world music site (available in English,
Fran&ccedil;ais, Espa&ntilde;ol). At present it features only one
musical group, <a href=
"http://www.mediaport.net/Music/index.en.html">Kgwanyape Band</a>
(1993 album 'Mepatho ya maloba'), with plenty of room for more.</p>

<p>The 1970s saw the emergence of didactic drama to raise popular
awareness of development issues. The 1980s-90s have seen some
revival of teaching of music and art in schools.</p>

<p>See also <a href="bhp9.htm">Literature page</a>, and <a href=

<h2>Fine arts &amp; crafts</h2>
<p>The art form best known abroad is the traditional craftwork of
basketry, most of it from north-western Botswana. See <a href=
"http://www.botswanacraft.bw">Botswanacraft</a> link. For wooden
crafts see ITC UNCTAD/WTO's <a href=
"http://www3.itu.int/virtexh/botswana.htm">Virtual Exhibition
Centre/ Botswana</a>.</p>

<p>The National Museum &amp; Art Gallery in Gaborone holds regular
exhibitions of local graphic artists, and its annual Artists in
Botswana around every April. The doyen of Gaborone freelance
artists is Philip Segola. Other artists include three women
painters who exhibit together: Coex'ae Qgam (Dada), Ann Gollifer,
and Neo Matome. See <a href=
"http://www.sn.apc.org/sangonet/SAIE/saie29/botman.html">Mambo Arts
Commune</a>.</p>

<p>Though Botswana has a number of new towns, notably the capital
city founded in 1964, the architecture of its major buildings and
its town planning is generally undistinguished. Traditional
architectural forms, particularly the use of outdoor space and
shade, have hardly been utilized. One of the more successful
architects, particular in the design of tourist lodges, is <a href=
"http://www.pma.bw">Paul Munnik</a>.</p>

<h2>Film and television</h2>
<p>The most important filming in Botswana has so far been of
wildlife documentaries, including those released through the U.S.
<a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com">National Geographic</a>
Society. No major feature films have yet actually been shot in
Botswana. The Government's Botswana TV station is scheduled to
begin transmission in late 1999.</p>

<p>The biggest fiction film ever made supposedly about Botswana -
but not actually made here - was <a href=
"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0080801">The Gods Must Be Crazy
(1980)</a>, with a <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0097443">
sequel (1989)</a> and a further sequel called <a href=
"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0101864">Fei zhou he shang (1991)</a>.
All three starred a South African actor called N!xau. The first two
were filmed in the Northern Transvaal, and the third in Hong Kong.
("The Gods Must be Crazy" is also the name of the <a href=
"http://www.tntmag.co.uk/travel/africa/botswana.htm">TNT Botswana
Travel Page</a>. Also not filmed in Botswana is the fictiona film
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0059675">Sands of the
Kalahari</a> starring Stuart Whitman and a troupe of baboons.</p>

<p class="x1"><a name="cultural_institutions" href="#contents">Back to contents</a> </p>


<h2>Cultural institutions</h2>
<p>There is a National Museum and Art Gallery in Gaborone, and
district museums founded by local community initiatives at Mochudi
(Phutadikobo), Serowe (Khama III Memorial), Francistown
(Supa-Ngwao), Molepolole (Sebele I Memorial), Maun (Nghabe), and
the Kuru Development Project. Other district museums have long been
planned for Kanye and Ghanzi. See the <a href=
"http://www.sn.apc.org/sangonet/SAIE/saie29/tocbots.html">Botswana
NGO list</a>.</p>

<p>The national learned and semi-scientific society, the Botswana Society, holds regular lectures and
publishes an annual journal (Botswana Notes and Records)and books.
See Page 3 above for advances in <a href="bhp3.htm">archaeology</a>
and Page 12 below for notes on <a href="bhp12.htm">science</a> in
Botswana.</p>

<p>The National Library Service has relatively well-stocked
branches, many in association with schools.</p>

<p>There is a 500-seater theatre in Gaborone, the "Maitisong" at <a
href="http://www.info.bw/~mao/info.html">Maruapula</a> School, used
by amateur theatrical and musical groups. It has a regular Saturday
evening public programme, and hosts visiting professional
productions from abroad. There is an annual Maitisong Festival held
for two weeks every April at many venues in town, involving groups
from all over Botswana and foreign musicians and actors.</p>

<p class="x1"><a name="sport" href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>


<h2>Sport &amp; recreation</h2>
<p>Soccer is the national sport, played on fields and at stadiums
across the country every Saturday. That national team is the
Zebras. The local league consists of (Mochudi) Centre Chiefs,
(Lobatse) Extension Gunners, Gaborone United, Notwane (present
champions), Township Rollers, Mogoditshane Fighters, Jwaneng
Comets, BDF XI, Prisons XI, Police XI, Tafic, and FC Satmos. Soccer
results seem to be off-line at present, but can normally be found
by a bit of web trawling.</p>

<p>Tennis, golf, and softball are other significant minority
interests in towns. There are many opportunites for recreation in
the great outdoors. Foreigners are restricted to photo-safaris,
with very few opportunities for hunting. "Squash in Botswana" has
no web page as yet.</p>

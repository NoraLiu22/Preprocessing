        Habitat And Habits</font><br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Found in 
        Southeastern USA, Cuba, Jamaica, and other Caribbean islands. Only the 
        green anole is native to the U.S.; all others are released or escaped 
        pets, many of which have survived and bred in the U.S.; the other six 
        species are native to the Caribbean islands. The vast majority of green 
        anoles sold in the pet trade are wild caught in the Southeastern U.S. 
        There are over 36 species of non-native anoles breeding in the wilds in 
        Florida (out of an estimated total of 250 anole species in the world), 
        and there has been considerable interbreeding so markings may be considerably 
        altered from the true wild types.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Habitat</b><br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Found in bushes, 
        trees (not above 15'), in and on rock walls, woods, around houses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Habits<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Primarily 
        terrestrial, these diurnal lizards inhabit low bushes and the ground underneath. 
        Often found sunning on exposed walls and branches.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Diet<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Wild diet 
        includes grubs, crickets, cockroaches, spiders, moths, any arthropod which 
        will fit in their mouths. In captivity, avoid 'sowbugs' (aka potato bugs, 
        pill bugs) and beetles. Even though anoles will go for bigger prey, the 
        size fed to them should be no bigger than 1/2 the size of the anoles head.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Anoles are best kept 
        singly or in groups. Generally, males should be kept singly or in the 
        company of two or more females.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Minimum tank size 
        for a group of two adult anoles would be a tall 10 gallon tank. Three 
        or four (one male and up to three females) anoles may be kept in a 20 
        gallon tall aquarium (48&quot; x 13&quot; x 20&quot;). The more lizards 
        there are, the more hiding places and basking areas needed, so tanks must 
        get correspondingly larger.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The ambient enclosure 
        humidity should be maintained around 60-70%...humid but not wet rainforest 
        conditions. Spray plants with purified water (tap water causes hard water 
        spots on plants and glass) a couple times a day, or set up a dripper or 
        mister system.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In the wild, anoles 
        lap off leaves. In captivity, you cannot assume that they will figure 
        out what a water bowl is, so you will need to spray the leaves for them. 
        Some anoles do learn to drink from bowls: you can aid this learning process 
        by setting up a dripper bottle to drip water into a shallow bowl. It is 
        the sight and sound of dripping, splashing water which attracts their 
        attention.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><b><a name="diet"></a>Diet</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The anole's captive diet 
        should be as close to their wild diet as possible. Most people feed small 
        crickets and mealworms (the latter of which which most anoles will not 
        take). As with many reptiles, anoles may be scared of prey that is too 
        large for them to handle.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Wild-caught bugs may 
        be accepted eagerly. Make sure the insects are collected from pesticide 
        free area and areas not heavily impregnated with auto exhaust particulates. 
        Stay away from bugs you are not certain of, and ones known to be toxic, 
        such as fireflies.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Feed anoles daily, 
        letting them have as much as they will eat. If crickets are left uneaten 
        in the enclosure, be sure to provide them with proper cricket food and 
        moisture - otherwise, they will eat whatever is handy: your anoles!</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Prey insects need to 
        be <a href="feedingbugs.html">cared for properly</a> to provide the most 
        nutrition for your lizards. If you cannot find the right size for your 
        lizard, you can order them through the mail from one of the many <a href="resources/preysources.html">companies</a> 
        that breed and supply these food items..</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Gut-loaded freshly 
        molted crickets and mealworms, every other day - usually 2-3 appropriately 
        sized food items per feeding is fine. If any food is left in the tank, 
        food for the prey MUST be provided. Gut-load 24-48 hours on tropical fish 
        flakes, high protein dry baby cereal, reptile vitamins and fruit.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Foods appropriate for 
        gut-loading include tropical fish flakes; high protein baby cereal mixed 
        with reptile vitamins; ground monkey chow mixed with calcium supplement. 
        Provide moisture by placing pieces of carrots, apple, orange, etc., in 
        the cricket enclosure. Dehydration is the biggest cause of cannibalism 
        in insects.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b><a name="temper"></a>Temperament<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some anoles 
        may become comfortable with being gently handled. On the whole, however, 
        handling is very stressful to them, and stress will cause them to become 
        ill. Initially, however, all anoles will try to run from you when you 
        go to pick them up and may bite...and they have quite strong bites for 
        being such small, delicate creatures! Biting, as much as it may hurt you, 
        may be more dangerous for them if you jerk your hand away - this can break 
        their jaws or cause teeth to be ripped out. So, handle them as little 
        as possible, and don't jerk your hand if you get bit - put them back in 
        their enclosure so that they can feel something under their feet - that 
        will get them to release you.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> They can drop their 
        tails if grabbed there (this is called autotomy), and their fragile toes 
        can be broken or injured if removed ungently from branches, bark or your 
        clothing.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Health 
        Issues</font></b><a name="health"></a><br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Since they are 
        primarily wild caught lizards, highly stressed from the capture and the 
        deprivations and often inhumane conditions of the pet trade, they are 
        generally dehydrated, moderately to severely emaciated, and riddled with 
        parasites - just like most reptiles sold in this country every year. A 
        dehydrated reptile will not eat, or will not eat very much, as digestion 
        requires considerable quantities of fluids.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">All new reptiles should 
        be tested for internal parasites and checked carefully visually for external 
        parasites, so <a href="vets/index.html">find a reptile vet</a> before, 
        or right after, you get your anole.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> If there are any significant 
        folds of skin, or the eyes are sunken, the lizard is dehydrated. If 24 
        hours of higher than normal humidity does not resolve it, the anole should 
        be taken to a vet to be assessed for other methods of fluid administration.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Persistent black spots 
        behind the eyes on the head may be an indication that your anole is seriously 
        ill. (See <a href="#Behavior/Communication">Behavior/Communication</a> 
        above.)</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Anoles, when heated, 
        lighted, fed and housed properly, are fairly hardy lizards. Depending 
        upon the age they are when they are caught/bought, the older ones may 
        not settle in as well as the younger ones. Remember: to them, you look 
        like a giant predator. They are not as intelligent as many of the much 
        larger lizards so you must be patient and understand that you may end 
        up with some beautiful lizards in a lush, beautiful environment (lots 
        of plants, bark slabs for hiding places, etc.) rather than a lizard who 
        will tolerate a lot of handling and social interaction.</font></p>

        turns brown, it is a sign of severe stress. Stressed anoles may turn green 
        at night when their lights are out and they are asleep, but will turn 
        brown again once they wake up and start the new day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The stress may be environmental 
        (enclosure is too hot or too cold, or there is a cat staring at them most 
        of the time you aren't around, etc.), or it may be psychosocial, something 
        that will happen if you are keeping two or more anoles together in one 
        enclosure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Two lizards require

        reach ~7 inches snout-tail length (stl). Wild specimens of 10 to 12 inches 
        reported; 9 inches considered big in captivity. This may be due to the 
        fact that they are not generally cared for properly in captivity (diet, 
        heat, lighting) and so do not grow as well and die earlier than in the 
        wild...(about 4 years in captivity).</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Males are larger than 
        females and have a dewlap (throat fan) which they use to display to females 
        and rivals. Some males have a dorsal crest (beginning just behind the 
        head) which is raised as part of the threat display (typically with the 
        dewlap extended). Males have enlarged post-anal pores (found on the tail 
        below the vent).</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Females, and juveniles 
        of both sexes, may have a white stripe down the back. Females of some 
        species have dewlaps - if they do, they are smaller than those of males, 
        and displayed less frequently.</font></p>

        anoles will breed, or attempt to, readily if conditions are right. Breeding 
        occurs most often in the spring and summer months after a period of brumation. 
        For several weeks, they must be kept at lower temperatures (65-70 F during 
        day; down to 60 F at night) and with a shorter photoperiod (8 hours instead 
        of the usual 14). During this time they may be fed only if they take food 
        - they should not be force fed, and weak or thin anoles should not be 
        brumated. The anoles must be healthy and be receiving the necessary UVB 
        and vitamins, especially calcium, accomplished by gut-loading their prey.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Signs of breeding 
        include males displaying their dewlaps and posturing to females. Males 
        may start bobbing their heads rapidly while turning toward female. If 
        female runs away she's not ready; if she stays or, while running, allows 
        herself to be caught, and bows her head, the male will grab her neck with 
        his mouth and they will mate. Actually mating generally occurs in afternoon 
        or evening hours. Breeding season lasts 4-5 months.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Within two weeks of 
        a successful mating, the female will begin to show a swollen abdomen. 
        She will search out a warm moist place in the substrate, push it aside 
        with her head, and deposit an egg (rarely, two may be laid), covering 
        the egg with the substrate. This will be repeated every two weeks, for 
        a total of about 10 eggs per breeding season. Eggs can be removed from 
        the vivarium but many successful hatchings have been achieved leaving 
        by the eggs in the vivarium.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> To prevent injury 
        to the egg, either by the female digging to bury another one or by you 
        as you service the terrarium, the eggs should be removed and set carefully 
        in a mixture of damp sterile vermiculite (1:1 mix, or one part water to 
        12-14 parts vermiculite) or sand, in a covered container, and incubated 
        at 82-85 F, checked weekly to assure the substrate remains damp and that 
        none of the eggs has molded. Provide gentle, not direct heat, to keep 
        the container at 84-86 F (29-30 C); eggs should hatch in 35-40 days.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Hatchlings are 1.25&quot; 
        svl, about 2-2.5&quot; stl, and are considered mature at 4-5&quot; stl. 
        They eat voraciously, and must be supplied with lots of pinheads that 
        have been properly gut-loaded and shaken in a calcium and multivitamin 
        supplement before being fed out. Fruit fly larva and wingless fruit flies 
        are also good foods for hatchlings.</font></p>

        </font></b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Anoles 
        produce no sounds. They can drop their tails if grabbed or otherwise feel 
        threatened. A new tail will generally grow in but regenerated tails are 
        rarely the same as the original in color, texture, or size.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Anoles are generally 
        not aggressive, but males may quarrel if housed together. This applies 
        to inter-species confrontations as well. Some anole species will produce 
        aggressive displays to their reflections in mirrors. Knight anoles should 
        not be housed with other anoles smaller than themselves - they will as 
        cheerfully feed on green anoles as they will spiders and crickets.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Behavior during breeding 
        season may be significantly different than outside of breeding season. 
        Males will display more (posturing, dewlap-flaring) and become more aggressive 
        towards other males. Dominant males may develop black postorbital spots 
        on their head. A sign of their status, most subordinate males will leave 
        these dominant males alone. In a too-small enclosure, however, having 
        two males both attempting to attain and maintain dominant status may end 
        up tragically for one of them. (See also <a href="sight3.html#eyespot">Somatic 
        correlates of adrenergic activity during aggression in the lizard, <i>Anolis 
        carolinensis</i>.</a>)</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Breeding-minded males 
        will also annoy females more.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Not all females will 
        be receptive to all males. Despite extensive research in mate selection, 
        there are still a lot of unknowns. We do know that if a male pursues a 
        female who is not interested, it could cause significant stress in the 
        female, stress to the point of illness. If you are housing more than one 
        anole in an enclosure, you must increase the size of the enclosure and 
        provide discreet areas so that the female can get away from, and out of 
        sight of, the male.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Aggression may be overt 
        and forceful, such as butting, biting, and chasing, but it can be more 
        subtle, too. If you have two or more green anoles and one is always brown, 
        observe them carefully. Notice where the brown one goes, and where it 
        does not go. You will probably see that it is not eating, basking, or 
        otherwise behaving in the same way as the others. More careful observation 
        should enable you to identify which of the other anoles is causing this 
        behavior. A dominant anole (male or female) uses posture and physical 
        position within the environment to maintain their dominant status. While 
        some subordinate lizards are fine with this, some are not, or may for 
        some reason become the focus of the dominant lizard. If you have such 
        a stressed anole, you will need to separate it from the others, providing 
        a completely separate enclosure for it and possibly one other anole with 
        whom you know it is compatible.</font></p>

        are discussed in <a href="#Sexing">Sexing</a> and <a href="#Reproduction">Reproduction</a>.</font></p>

        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The main drawback 
        to anoles is that they require the same type of set ups as more expensive 
        lizards, something which people looking for a &quot;cheap&quot; lizard 
        for their children (and adults buying them for themselves) often have 
        a hard time accepting... Buying all of the equipment they need, and having 
        their feces checked by a vet for internal parasites, taking sick anoles 
        to the vet for diagnosis and treatment, is going to cost you significantly 
        more than the lizards themselves. Anoles are, however, great lizards that 
        can be set up in a wonderful naturalistic setting, enabling you to set 
        up a bit of the jungle anywhere you like in your house. For some wonderful 
        ideas on setting up naturalistic vivaria, one of the following books is 
        a must.</font></p>

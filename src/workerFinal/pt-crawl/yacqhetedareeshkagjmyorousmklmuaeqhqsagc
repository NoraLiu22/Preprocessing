<h1>Information for parents</h1>
<p>Is your son or daughter thinking of studying Computer Science at York? You probably have lots of your own questions you'd like to ask. This page answers some of the questions we are asked most frequently by parents and guardians.</p>
<p>If you can't find the answer to your question, email our <a title="Email Student Engagement Team" href="mailto:cs-ug-admissions@york.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Engagement Team</a>&nbsp;and we'll answer your query!</p>
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">Which accommodation should my child choose? Is it better to be on Campus East?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>Computer Science students live in University accommodation across both Campus East and Campus West.</p>
<p>Many choose to live in one of the five colleges here on Campus East, due to proximity to the Department. These are: Goodricke, Langwith, Constantine, Anne Lister and David Kato Colleges. However, others prefer to have a separation between 'work' and 'home' by living in accommodation on Campus West. Our compact campus means that all colleges are a short walk from the University's departments and teaching buildings.</p>
<p>Whichever accommodation your child chooses, college life will ensure they get to mix with students of other disciplines, which makes for a rich, varied and diverse University experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/">Read more about our colleges</a></p>				
</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">Is it easy to get between the two campuses?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>Yes!&nbsp;It's very easy to travel between Campus East and Campus West, with approximately a ten minutes' walk from one campus to the other.</p>
<p>Traffic-free cycle paths, footpaths and a free and frequent service bus service across the University allow students to move easily between Campus East and Campus West.</p>
<p>Many students bring their own bikes or purchase second-hand bikes when they get here. The University provides cycle storage and cycle pump stations across campus, and shower facilities in many buildings. It also provides regular free 'Bike Doctor' services and heavily discounted cycle products, which are available from the shop on campus.&nbsp;Read more about our <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/about/sustainability/what-you-can-do/sustainable-travel/">sustainable travel initiative</a></p>
<p>Campus East&nbsp;is well connected to other parts of the city, with <a title="Travelling around York" href="https://www.itravelyork.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular bus services</a> into York city centre serving a major supermarket, high street shops and the railway station.</p>				
</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">Are the fees the same for all years, even the year in industry? How are they paid?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>You can find the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/fees-funding/" target="_blank">most up to date information about fees on the main University website</a>. Here, you can also find out more about discounted fees while students are on their year in industry and or on a study year abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Paying the fees</strong></p>
<p>Students can apply for a tuition fee loan from the Student Loan Company, which pays the fees directly to York. Students who already have a first honours degree and overseas students are not eligible for this loan. You can find more information about tuition fee loans <a title="Student Loan Company website" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-undergraduate-student-loan" target="_blank">on the Student Loan Company website</a>.</p>
<p>If a student is not eligible for a tuition fee loan, then they are responsible for paying their fees directly to York. These can be done in instalments throughout the year, and can also be paid online or by direct debit or BACS. More information can be found <a title="Student money web pages" href="https://www.york.ac.uk/students/housing-and-money/payments/" target="_blank">on the student web pages about money and fees</a>.</p>				
</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">What are the key dates in the process?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="UCAS: key dates" href="https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-university/ucas-undergraduate-when-apply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCAS website</a> provides key dates regarding the admissions process.</p>
<p>Prospective applicants are encouraged to attend one of the University's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/visits/open-days/">Open Days</a>&nbsp;so that they can find out more out more about Computer Science at York. Our main Open Days usually take place in June/July and again in September each year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we receive an application and we are impressed by the grades, personal statement and reference, we will recommend the applicant for an offer. Once an applicant has received an offer, they will be able to book a place on a <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/visits/post-offer-visit-day/">Visit Day for offer holders</a>.</p>
<p>For entry in 2023 (or deferred entry until 2024), our visit days for offer holders will be held from February through to April 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">What about a job on graduation?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>Here at York, we work hard to make sure our graduates are fit for the workplace when they leave us. For this reason, we regularly consult with industry leaders so that we can ensure our teaching remains up to date and relevant in the workplace.</p>
<p>Our teaching is principled and covers theory as well as practice. For example, we don't just teach one programming language, but the principles of programming, so when our graduates get a job, they can tackle any programming language much more easily.</p>
<p>We also give our students plenty of time to practice what we teach - problem classes, practicals and tutorials all help to put theory into practice. Projects set by industry also give students the chance to work on real-life problems, and some of these solutions are actually used by the organisation involved.&nbsp;Many of our academics have worked in industry, so know what to do when preparing our graduates for work.</p>
<p>Our year in industry also gives students a chance to do this in a real-life environment - and many of those who go on a year in industry get improved grades, an improved attitude to their studies and a job before they graduate. <a href="/undergraduate/year-in-industry/" title="Year in Industry" target="_blank"><br /></a></p>
<p>Alongside the academic modules, we teach our students the skills associated with being a professional computer scientist in industry or academia. We assist with CV writing, interviews and presentation skills to help prepare our students for the workplace.&nbsp;The University's <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/students/work-volunteering-careers/">Careers</a> team is also on hand to help with preparing for interviews and finding work after graduation.</p>
<p>All of these practices mean that all those who take a job after graduating from York go into professional or managerial positions. We're a <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2017/quality/leo-employment-study/">top Computer Science department for employability</a>, and we work hard to make sure we stay that way.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">My daughter wants to study Computer Science. Will she be the only girl?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>We're delighted to say, no, your daughter won't be the only girl!</p>
<p>While it is true that Computer Science has been considered to be a traditionally 'male' subject area in the past, we're working hard to open up the subject to all. And it is working: the number of women studying Computer Science at York goes up every year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Computer Science holds an <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/about/equality/gender-equality/athena-swan/">Athena SWAN</a> Bronze Award in recognition of our work to promote gender equality.&nbsp;We're committed to make significant progress on many issues of equality, diversity and inclusion, and we look forward to working with our community to achieve the challenges we've set ourselves.</p>
<p>In December 2022, just under 20% of our undergraduate first year intake and nearly 18% of all our undergraduate students are women. Across all our taught courses (undergraduate and on-campus MSc students), approximately 20% of our students identify as female or 'not male'. Around 14% of our teaching staff and 20% of our research-only staff are women.</p>				
</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">My child is not from the UK. Is there an international community at York?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>Yes! Our international students are part of a multicultural community of over 22,000 students, representing over 150 countries.</p>
<p>We recognise that studying in a different country can be daunting, and so the University has an excellent structure in place to give our international students all the help they need.&nbsp;You can also relax in the knowledge that our students are living and studying in a safe and green campus environment, and a student-friendly city.</p>
<p>Here in Computer Science, just over 13% of all our undergraduates are international students (as at December 2022). Across our entire on-campus community in Computer Science, 29% of our students are from outside the UK.</p>

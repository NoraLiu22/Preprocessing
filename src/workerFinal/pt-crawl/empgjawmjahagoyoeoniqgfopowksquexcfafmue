ArticleModule__Introduction-sc-zin2bb-2 fKHSx"><p>Almost a year ago, we started to beta test a feature that lets independent artists upload their music directly to Spotify. Today, we notified participating artists about our decision to close the beta program, along with how we can help them migrate their music to other distributors over the next month.</p>
</span></div><div class="ArticleModule__BodyWrapper-sc-zin2bb-3"><div class="ArticleModule__Body-sc-zin2bb-4 bqewWg"><p>The insights and feedback we received from artists in the beta led us to believe:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The most impactful way we can improve the experience of delivering music to Spotify for as many artists and labels as possible is to lean into the great work <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/directory/distribution"><span>our distribution partners</span></a> are already doing to serve the artist community. Over the past year, we’ve vastly improved our work with distribution partners to ensure metadata quality, protect artists from infringement, provide their users with instant access to Spotify for Artists, and more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The best way for us to serve artists and labels is to focus our resources on developing tools in areas where Spotify can uniquely benefit them — like Spotify for Artists (which more than 300,000 creators use to gain new insight into their audience) and our playlist pitch tool (which more than 36,000 artists have used to get playlisted for the very first time since <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/share-new-music-for-playlist-consideration"><span>it launched</span></a> a year ago). We have a lot more planned here in the coming months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re working with our distribution partners to help make this transition as simple as possible for the artists who uploaded music through the beta. At the end of this month, we’ll stop accepting any new uploads through Spotify for Artists, and artists will need to move their already released content to another provider. </p>
<p>Artists who have released music in the beta should review <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/faq/upload"><span>our FAQs</span></a> and keep an eye on their email for more details — including discount codes from our preferred distributors. They can reach out to our dedicated customer support team for personalized assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you to the artists who participated in our upload beta. We’re incredibly proud to have played a small part in the music they released. Spotify wouldn’t be what it is today without artists and labels who are willing to collaborate with us to build a better experience for creators and listeners.</p>

Today, we notified participating artists about our decision to close the beta program, along with how we can help them migrate their music to other distributors over the next month.","article":"-----\n\nThe insights and feedback we received from artists in the beta led us to believe:\n\n- The most impactful way we can improve the experience of delivering music to Spotify for as many artists and labels as possible is to lean into the great work [our distribution partners](https://artists.spotify.com/directory/distribution) are already doing to serve the artist community. Over the past year, we’ve vastly improved our work with distribution partners to ensure metadata quality, protect artists from infringement, provide their users with instant access to Spotify for Artists, and more.\n\n- The best way for us to serve artists and labels is to focus our resources on developing tools in areas where Spotify can uniquely benefit them — like Spotify for Artists (which more than 300,000 creators use to gain new insight into their audience) and our playlist pitch tool (which more than 36,000 artists have used to get playlisted for the very first time since [it launched](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/share-new-music-for-playlist-consideration) a year ago). We have a lot more planned here in the coming months.\n\nWe’re working with our distribution partners to help make this transition as simple as possible for the artists who uploaded music through the beta. At the end of this month, we’ll stop accepting any new uploads through Spotify for Artists, and artists will need to move their already released content to another provider. \n\nArtists who have released music in the beta should review [our FAQs](https://artists.spotify.com/faq/upload) and keep an eye on their email for more details — including discount codes from our preferred distributors. They can reach out to our dedicated customer support team for personalized assistance.\n\nThank you to the artists who participated in our upload beta. We’re incredibly proud to have played a small part in the music they released. Spotify wouldn’t be what it is today without artists and labels who are willing to collaborate with us to build a better experience for creators and listeners.\n","modules":[{"title":"Default Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Popular Stories","items":[{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","description":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","urlSlug":"how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release","releaseDate":"2022-03-21T09:30-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","headline":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","image":{"title":"Beach House Marquee Case Study HEADER","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2E4qFz6hN0zSt1RG73rYaE/e12746a736dbe692b6b59abb649f33fa/beach-house-marquee-header.png","details":{"size":3249484,"image":{"width":1601,"height":900}},"fileName":"beach-house-marquee-header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#ffffff","textColor":"#000000","id":"n0NGzv73qQsD0JfUVN7rZ","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","article":"Viral moments have a way of traveling far and wide, but the real win is turning that viral moment into a sustained success. Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify. So [get started](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch) today, reach your fans and followers, and make your artist profile a virtual merch table. \n\n*Are you interested in helping to test out new Spotify for Artists’ features?

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3.

Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

","article":"While so many of today’s groundbreaking artists seem no farther than a click away, the [Pixies](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6zvul52xwTWzilBZl6BUbT) are one of those groups that feels untouchable. After setting the mold for alternative rock in the late ’80s and breaking up in 1993, it was almost as if the band was subsumed into music’s DNA. And by the time they reunited in 2004, they’d simply become legends. But last year, fans were offered an unprecedented opportunity to enter the band’s world with [*It’s a Pixies Podcast*](https://open.spotify.com/show/3I3SMEjthKmAxb5oRlYfFF?si=h4oaAfIAQv6x_rvjKIv7zQ), which documents the making of their 2019 album [*Beneath the Eyrie*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4XUtkoya9Ai7VeG4a1yYWN) over the course of a month at a live-in studio in Upstate New York. \n\nThe project once again turned the Pixies into innovators—theirs was the first podcast documentary of an album-making that we’d heard. We’ve since seen the launch of Spotify original [*21 Days with mxmtoon*](https://open.spotify.com/show/7k2gNSLZnopnh6pcvkQACK?si=vYhzF6acTOG6caTQcm6zqA), which captures the creative process using a diary-style audio format. But the Pixies project was, and still is, one of a kind in terms of scope and ambition: the production team captured over 300 hours of material, according to [*Spotify for Podcasters*](https://podcasters.spotify.com/blog/gigantic-unpacking-the-process-behind-a-pixies-podcast). We spoke to Pixies manager Richard Jones to find out whether other artists should consider once again following in the Pixies' footsteps.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: Tell us how this idea was born.__\n\n__Richard Jones:__ The Pixies have a well-known, respected catalog that they can happily tour around the world for many, many years. But we've always found, like lots of artists of this generation, it takes a while for new music to be appreciated and enjoyed in the same way. So as we approached this record, I thought, “How can we enable people to engage with the music over a longer period of time, and therefore have more affinity with it and memories of it at various times of their lives, before the record actually came out, almost as if it was known to them already?\"\n\n__In other words, you're basically canonizing it ahead of time.__\n\nYeah. I spent a long time looking at how our fans talk about the music in social interactions and fan groups—they were quite in depth in the way they analyze the music and discuss it, so I thought, “How about a podcast? Why don’t we record everything we do, and put it into sizable chunks that people can listen to a number of times over to forge their own relationship with the songs?\" And at the same time, get a little bit of insight into the musicians, because the Pixies are known for their lack of public identity. So it was also allowing that for the first time.\n\n![Paz Lenchantin, Photo by Simon Foster](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/25CfhqBR3wIlkPPJT4Elgt/2230f5346430faeb50a6121d3d947b91/rsz_paz_vocals_hi.jpg)\n\n__What about the idea that observing a thing changes it?__\n\nThat fear was really alleviated by the way we did it—the microphones were just on all the time. We didn't have people hovering around, or podcast producers in the studio. For the most part, I think the band forgot about it. And the good thing about working in a residential studio is, they're all there all the time. Often during the recording process, you do things separately—people are working on their parts, going out for walks, or sitting around reading something. Tony could easily pop in, wander around, see who was free, and just say, \"How are you doing today?\" One of the real successes of this is that those conversations became quite natural.\n\n__Did the band have any qualms about this up front?__\n\nThey totally embraced the idea, and that requires a lot of trust. They knew we weren’t going to make them look ridiculous, but we weren’t doing it through rose-colored spectacles either. It's actually a very honest recording and recollection of what happened in the studio. A big part of the Pixies' appeal is that they're very blue-collar artists, so we weren't trying to turn this into a reality TV show. We had to bring listeners in, take them on a journey, and engage them with the new music, while making sure we didn't sensationalize the band or what they were doing.\n\n![David Lovering, Photo by Simon Foster](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/5wGr2BIbPDNy4C9d1g0Oku/0c2f986cd73fd461ce452f32ce0c39ec/rsz_dave_talking_into_mic_hi.jpg)\n\n__You’ve helped bands make albums, but what was it like transitioning to this form of audio storytelling? This thing is in service of the album, but also has to stand alone.__\n\nRight. When you make an album, ideally, you're doing it for yourself. You come in, write the songs that come out, record them the way you do, and there it is. And, of course, this podcast isn't that at all. End of the day, it’s a promotional tool for the album, but a pure promotional tool wouldn’t be very interesting. We knew we’d need to spend the vast majority of our time editing in order to have a group of narratives running through the series. I remember finding it very difficult to get the balance right when it came to sharing the history of the band without being patronizing to the fan, and revealing the details of the process without ruining the mystery. \n\n__So what kind of a response did you see from fans?__\n\nThe superfans in the forums and Facebook groups absolutely adored it. They effervesced over everything, and literally dissected every episode. The casual fans really liked the idea of it and began to understand the band a bit more and forge a connection beyond the songs. We also had a non-fan interest—people who worked in studios or media or podcasts who were fascinated by the whole process. To be honest, we didn't have any negativity about it at all.\n\n__And what happened when you took the new music on the road?__\n\nWhat tends to happen in the first month or so of touring is people know the focus tracks, while the rest gets a lesser reaction. This time they knew all the new songs way earlier. Watching rooms full of people react, there was a greater appreciation for and connection to this album than there was to the last two we did since the band reformed. So, yes, it actually worked! \n\n*—Chris Martins*\n","modules":[{"title":"Related Stories 1","headline":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"SoundBetter Stories: How an International Collaboration Brought Michael Shynes Success at Home and Abroad","urlSlug":"soundbetter-stories-how-an-international-collaboration-brought-michael","description":"The Minnesota folk-rocker collaborated with Poland’s Komodo on a rendition of Cutting Crew’s \"(I Just) Died In Your Arms\" on SoundBetter, and the song went multi-platinum and changed his life.\n","releaseDate":"2020-08-20T12:10-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"259796089"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Minnesota folk-rocker collaborated with Poland’s Komodo on a rendition of Cutting Crew’s \"(I Just) Died In Your Arms\" on SoundBetter, and the song went multi-platinum and changed his life.\n","article":"---\n\nWhen [Michael Shynes](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/85263-michael-shynes) opened his [SoundBetter](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/85263-michael-shynes) page in 2018 and found a request from a band he’d never heard of, the St. Cloud, MN folk-rock singer had no idea what he was in for. After all, the note, from the Polish EDM trio [Komodo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1lmjruOcvyQRZNIKUOlf68?si=TDGk9tdWTnCoYHgGOX_lEw), was just the second message he’d received on [the music talent marketplace](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/spotify-for-artists-and-soundbetter). He figured it would be a one-off job, never dreaming that he’d become the featured vocalist on a triple-platinum single.  \n\nA few months after remotely recording the track—a cover of [Cutting Crew](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cniTumSiUysiPWXapGx1i?si=bYfCHTvXRwKbUM2di_uGiA)’s 1986 hit \"[(I Just) Died In Your Arms](https://open.spotify.com/track/5MqFJxMwbZ5nyNogTDVTeL?si=UNk3S1ZgQiquTIOqEioxXw)\"—Shynes was on a plane to Zakopane, Poland to perform at a massive New Year’s Eve concert alongside his newfound friends. “I was a fish out of water, for sure,” he says, pointing out that he’d never even been out of the country before working with Komodo. Now, the success of that single and two follow-up collaborations has let Shynes write his own ticket back in the US—he’s able to command higher pay rates, be more selective with touring and studio gigs, and thus spend much more time at home with his family in Minnesota while continuing to earn money making music, remotely. We caught up with Shynes to hear about how it all happened and what lessons he has for artists who are new to [SoundBetter](https://soundbetter.com/). \n\n__Spotify for Artists: How did you hear about SoundBetter?__\n\nShynes: A harmony singer in my band named [Maygen Lacey](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/17317-maygen-lacey) was doing these acoustic cover versions of songs [through SoundBetter] and getting millions of hits on them. She knows I like working in the studio even more than I like performing, so she said, “Hey, there’s this website I’ve been on called SoundBetter where people all over the world can hire you for stuff. You can make music, earn side income and you don’t have to perform out as much.” I was like, “That sounds amazing.”\n\n__What were your goals in signing up for the site?__ \n\nMy goal was to sing on other people’s stuff, for sure. I always have way more than enough music—what I was looking for was a way to earn a side income from making music. At that time, I was performing like 200-250 shows a year, just grinding. I said, “I can’t keep up this pace. I need to create other streams of revenue for myself so that I have the flexibility to be home more.” I have a wife and two small kids. I love being home. I don’t want to be on the road all the time.\n\n\n__How did you link up with Komodo?__\n\nI threw up a profile on SoundBetter and [that] was the second job I got on the site. They reached out to me saying, “We’re remaking this ’80s song called ‘(I Just) Died In Your Arms.’” I love that song. They paid me and I sent them the vocal files. I thought that was the end of it. Four months later, [they put out a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8OI9FllKfg) that was, at the time, getting like 100,000 hits a day. They were, “Hey, check this out. This is kind of amazing.” It blew up from there to where now I think it’s over 118 million [streams on YouTube]. It went No. 1 in Poland, triple-platinum. It was crazy. \n\n__What was their rollout strategy for the song?__\n\nThey are signed to Sony, one of only two club acts in Poland signed to [the label]. They were pushing for radio play and had a machine behind them.\n\n__Did you do any follow-up tracks together?__ \n\nWe did [[a Whitesnake cover]](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3UbyYnvNIT5DFXU4WgiGpP?si=7SKyGyFVTD2MiRPEECg1fA) after that called [\"Is This Love\"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HklgS1hnxYF6uwCB0zpOA?si=gx12uMPKQ0uX65T9vOmMIw) that went platinum, and then we tried an original collaboration called [“Rush of Blood”](https://open.spotify.com/track/4WonmftStennNLSDmbRYli?si=mY5mBvGEQzGgeF4ekozG2A) that got 2.2 million plays on YouTube. It’s tough when you start with covers to try to get those fans to jump over to your original tracks. It’s a little slower to go. \n\n__And after the song blew up, they flew you out to perform with them a couple of times.__\n\nThe first time it was like 30,000 or 40,000 people. On New Year's Eve, there were like 73,000 people [there] and eight million watching live. It aired on the biggest TV channel in Poland, kind of like our New Year's Rockin’ Eve here in the US. [Before the first show] I had never spoken with them. I had never seen them. It was pretty surreal. It exploded in a way that none of us were prepared for. \n\n__What was it like to hang out with Komodo?__\n\nIt was definitely unique and humbling. It made me realize a lot of what other people go through when they’re in a new country and they’re learning the language. There’s a lot of times where you’re at dinner and not a word of English is spoken. You feel somewhat isolated, but Yash from Komodo was good about translating things to me. He was very considerate of the fact that I didn’t understand everything that was going on. I was treated very well, so that made it easier. \n\n__What has your career been like since returning to the US?__\n\nThat was the single biggest jump in my career, by a landslide. I was playing small clubs in St. Cloud—where I live before this project with Komodo. Since then, I’ve been able to sell out 800-seat theaters twice, two years in a row, as the only act. In Minneapolis, we were really close to selling out the Varsity Theater. I was able to stop doing all of the bar and club gigs I was doing, step back, and play the shows I wanted to play. The amount of studio work I was able to do—getting jobs with producers all over the world, raising my rates, being able to say no to things that I didn’t think I was a good fit for—was transformative in every aspect of my business. It was just life-changing. \n\n__What advice would you give to somebody just signing up for SoundBetter?__\n\nSet your rates lower, so you can get a body of work and get reviews from people. As you figure out your niche, what you want to work on, and what your value is, you can raise those rates. But to start, just get your foot in the door. Get some jobs under your belt. \n\n*-Adam Rothbarth*\n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7ziv17Hu5bjtTz3apQK30B","circular":true}},{"title":"Default Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Popular Stories","items":[{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","description":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","urlSlug":"how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release","releaseDate":"2022-03-21T09:30-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","headline":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","image":{"title":"Beach House Marquee Case Study HEADER","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2E4qFz6hN0zSt1RG73rYaE/e12746a736dbe692b6b59abb649f33fa/beach-house-marquee-header.png","details":{"size":3249484,"image":{"width":1601,"height":900}},"fileName":"beach-house-marquee-header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#ffffff","textColor":"#000000","id":"n0NGzv73qQsD0JfUVN7rZ","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","article":"Viral moments have a way of traveling far and wide, but the real win is turning that viral moment into a sustained success. Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify. So [get started](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch) today, reach your fans and followers, and make your artist profile a virtual merch table. \n\n*Are you interested in helping to test out new Spotify for Artists’ features?

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3.

Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

For years, she’s dedicated herself to fostering the connection between creators and their audiences, a relationship that continues to transform as current events redefine the role that artistry plays. We caught up with her to discuss her insights on artist and tour management, adapting to a dramatically evolving cultural climate, and how musicians can use their platforms to inspire change.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: Can you describe what you do and tell us how you got there?__\n\n__Dawn White:__ Currently, I oversee the DJ career of ?uestlove from The Roots as his manager, and as part of the management and strategy team for the ?uestlove brand at large. I started my career working for the electronic music pioneer King Britt and I became friendly with ?uestlove back in the late ’90s. After working for King, I managed [Larry Gold's highly regarded recording studio](https://www.bbemusic.com/artist/larry-gold/), where the entire neo-soul movement was born in Philadelphia. Everyone was coming there to work because Larry is a string composer. He was writing arrangements for [Justin Timberlake](https://open.spotify.com/artist/31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7?si=ZVMKvhkvRPi06jZ0XV1PJg), [J-Lo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2DlGxzQSjYe5N6G9nkYghR?si=0vmsBnqYQDew4HwihIremA), [Christina Aguilera](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1l7ZsJRRS8wlW3WfJfPfNS?si=G5IVr-0PQgyXwsoYdVDcpQ), [and] The Roots. \n\n?uestlove asked me to come on the road with him as his assistant and the merch director for The Roots. During that time, he was exploring his burgeoning interest in DJing. [Because] I had come from working with King Britt in the club scene, ?uestlove asked me to head up his DJ career. \n\nI moved to LA in 2006 and was immediately recruited by [Waxploitation Records founder] Jeff Antebi to work on a very exciting project he was heading up for [Danger Mouse](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2dBj3prW7gP9bCCOIQeDUf?si=Z94_Gf-tTlWPDIAZoLAMWA) called Gnarls Barkley. I was their tour manager when that project exploded and spent the next three years traveling the world with them. I went on to tour-manage Tom Morello of [Rage Against the Machine](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2d0hyoQ5ynDBnkvAbJKORj?si=3mWXgabvRBCLtDZ9acvBHw) for a couple years. I also tour-managed Charlotte Gainsbourg. \n\nSimultaneously, I was diligently building ?uestlove's DJ venture with him. In 2011, I started my own boutique DJ management and consulting agency, developed that for a few years, then ultimately decided my main priority is working with ?uestlove.\n\n__What sparked your interest in pursuing this as a career?__\n\nMy obsession with live music started when I went to see my very first show in 1987. I went to the [*Joshua Tree*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5vBZRYu2GLA65nfxBvG1a7?si=XlMYX_xoSzqJEaIlbd5hQQ) [U2](https://open.spotify.com/artist/51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ?si=P2FsM219Q3i8Z9fMJuETBg) tour at the now-defunct JFK stadium in Philly. I was in seventh grade. It was memorable because Bono had a broken arm, so [Bruce Springsteen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eqjTLE0HfPfh78zjh6TqT?si=dE8lS6wPQXCUUCoUXfFOuw) played guitar that night. After that, I spent all my money on concert tickets and merch. By the time I graduated from high school, I'd been to over 200 shows. [When] I went to college, I got turned on to the [Grateful Dead](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4TMHGUX5WI7OOm53PqSDAT?si=k5GdTXgYTdO0Jma6I5kCPA). I took some time off from school and followed the Grateful Dead around in a 1974 VW Westfalia camper van. I fell in love with that traveling-circus energy and the idea that music could inspire community. Though my parents were none too thrilled about my decisions during that time, we now joke about that experience [and how it] ended up being my career path.\n\n__What’s the best way for artists to utilize their platforms during a political and social moment like the unfolding now?__\n\nThe best way to use your platform for the greater good is access. We all relied on touring and performance to spread the message, but the current climate has shown we don't necessarily need to rely so heavily on that when we have access at our fingertips—your phone and your computer. There is a real reason now to tell real stories. If you can't find inspiration right now, maybe music is not meant to be your calling. Look at [BTS](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX?si=zfBFExX_TU66BfH9RbFOfQ) and how they're using their platform to turn their fans into disruptors and [encourage] political change in America. This is the power artists have now. I find it totally inspiring.\n\n__How has your work been affected or evolved in light of the pandemic?__\n\nI see this as a time for huge growth and creativity. Authenticity is being showcased now. We’re able to draw attention to the real impact of music. \n\nIn the pre-COVID world, there was a lot of music centered around a party vibe. That's not bad—that's a celebration of life in its own way. But in the midst of where we are in terms of the pandemic and Black Lives Matter, really, who is trying to bring Vegas into their living room now? That isn't where anyone is, emotionally. \n\nThat's why ?uestlove’s nightly DJ sets are so culturally important. He's teaching history lessons and reminding us to celebrate life. It's also a lesson in how to be better, more mindful humans. Whether it's the health crisis or the civil rights crisis, [that] is the truly the call to action now. I'm really proud of our team and what we're doing to represent those things.\n\n__What is the best advice you have for any artists that are just starting out?__\n\nIt's simple: Stay true, stay on the course, and don't make decisions to please other people.\n\n*—Ariel LeBeau*\n","modules":[{"title":"Related Stories 2","headline":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"Introducing the Best Advice Podcast","urlSlug":"introducing-the-best-advice-podcast","description":"We’ve turned our long-running video series into a longform podcast where the likes of Jeezy, Charli XCX, Russ, Ashnikko, Hayley Kiyoko, and many impart their best advice.

","article":"\nBack in 2018, we launched Best Advice, a video series where some of the most well renowned artists in the world relayed one piece of advice they’d received, a piece of advice that they’ve always taken with them that helped inform how they moved through the world, in terms of their career and otherwise. \n\n[Tierra Whack](https://artists.spotify.com/video/tierra-whack-best-advice)’s advice came from OutKast’s Andre 3000, [Lizzo](https://artists.spotify.com/video/lizzo)’s advice came from Missy Elliott, and [Trippie Redd](https://artists.spotify.com/video/trippie-redd)’s advice was actually a quote from John F. Kennedy Jr. (via a history book).\n\nOver the years we’ve interviewed everyone from [Rick Ross](https://artists.spotify.com/video/rick-ross), to [Christina Aguilera](https://artists.spotify.com/video/christina-aguilera), to [Phoebe Bridgers](https://artists.spotify.com/video/phoebe-bridgers), to [The Killers](https://artists.spotify.com/video/the-killers), [Elton John](https://artists.spotify.com/video/elton-john), [Quincy Jones](https://artists.spotify.com/video/quincy-jones), and [Karol G](https://artists.spotify.com/video/karol-g), and so many more. Each of them had a story attached to the advice they’d received, an anecdotal moment from their own life where these guiding words came in useful. \n\nAs a producer on Spotify for Artists, I spent a lot of time interviewing these incredible artists to extract one snappy tidbit for the video series, but I found there were so many useful takeaways, so much rich experience and perspective that was left on the cutting room floor. So we decided to create the Best Advice podcast: frank, intimate conversations with some of the most fascinating names in music. Each episode offers in-depth insights into what it's like to navigate the world of music, commerce, and creativity. Each artist shares their own advice gleaned from their successes and missteps, as well as advice they've received from mentors, collaborators, family, and confidants. \n\nDropping every Thursday at 10 a.m. EST, our 10-episode season will include conversations with [Joey Bada$$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2P5sC9cVZDToPxyomzF1UH?si=OVOOLObFT3yC8nIfcZXGHw), [Hayley Kiyoko](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3LjhVl7GzYsza1biQjTpaN?si=fDQBSoOPQ3iFmjrMZ5YWCA), [Ashnikko](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3PyJHH2wyfQK3WZrk9rpmP?si=iAr9nUerT0iObiI8M7cyzQ), [Conor Oberst](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Z7gV3uEh1ckIaBzTUCE6R?si=x_v5_5KBRaaXWgLHrmngXg), [Russ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1z7b1Pr1rSlvWRzsW3HOrS?si=ILcdUzktQb2ltAq4KXIsQg), [Billy Corgan](https://open.spotify.com/artist/12B5JK11NOP7OQ9Fxjrpx2?si=oQZQAaHrS6eS8DBo-pIvqA) of [The Smashing Pumpkins](https://open.spotify.com/artist/40Yq4vzPs9VNUrIBG5Jr2i?si=PBl5SnJWQri0aB3xSZgqzw), [Princess Nokia](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6lay1nwbE6hTx1jivysUAL?si=3vtF-GWgTwuHVtCZ5cu47w), and more. \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6XIgJZ99UcpTCXUSaBeMf6\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nToday we’re launching with a double drop: one installment with ATL hip-hop legend [Jeezy](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4yBK75WVCQXej1p04GWqxH?si=vw1-XryIT2ikJ-yI4f3MmQ), and the other with future-pop visionary [Charli XCX](https://open.spotify.com/artist/25uiPmTg16RbhZWAqwLBy5?si=wU5hvHiwSCyJfWJ2HJfPJA).

Having a grudge is toxic. And when you’re toxic, you give toxic energy to the people around you. You give toxic energy to your kids, your loved ones, your employees, you know your peers. I was there. \n\nWhen people do you wrong and you get in your head, if somebody tell you’ll never be nothing… somebody tell you you’ll never be that rapper, that superstar, you'll never do this and that, and then you spend your whole life trying to prove that person wrong to get what they said you couldn't have. Then you get it and you’re not happy, you still lost.\n\n__Your morals and values are everything.__\n\nNo matter where you get to, no matter how it goes, no matter how it comes at you — the money, fame, temptations — just don't lose your values, your morals, and your integrity because when it's all said and done, you could have a billion dollars, 10 billion, if you don't have those three things, you have nothing. \n\n__Being savvy with money is about being open minded in a space where you’re not the smarter person in the room.__\n\nYou are the brand, you are the business, and when you get in a business meeting … they’re looking at ways to crunch numbers … and ways to monetize. When I started understanding what it was to know how to invest, to buy real estate, to use my likeness as leverage to be a part of a brand for equity… those conversations came by being in other rooms and talking to people that were outside of my comfort level. We as artists, we're the leaders of our pack, so it's hard for us to go look up to somebody else. For me it changed when I put my ego to the side… and just started walking in those rooms like “OK let's talk about it.” You gotta be comfortable with being uncomfortable. \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/5h68hNTr1PUZC5z2Qe9qCF\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Highlights from Charli XCX’s Best Advice episode \n\n__Commercial success does not equate to personal success and won’t always fit into your vision as an artist.__\n\nWhen I stopped worrying about what people thought of who I was, I was able to find myself and I was able to find the music that I loved to make. It kind of stripped away a lot of boundaries for me. I always did have a distinct vision, but I also think I grappled with wanting commercial success and not understanding how my vision and the commercial success fit together. I grappled with that a lot and now I just don't. But it took me a second to work that out and I think that was sort of it held me back for a while. I know this is the most standard advice, but I think it's actually advice that we don't follow enough: You have to go with your gut.\n\n__Keep an open mind when working with new collaborators: you never know what could come from it.__\n\nIt's important when you're young and starting off to explore different types of people. Even I have to tell myself that now, because I can definitely be a bit of a snob when it comes to who I'm going to work with for my own work. Less so if I'm writing for other people, but when it comes to my own stuff, I am very quick to judge and I'm very quick to be like, no that person isn't right for me, without even having given them a chance or met them.  There's been so many situations like that where I've almost decided to pull the session, but then I've gone and that person has become one of my most long term collaborators.\n\n__Read your contracts and ask questions.__ \n\nI signed when I was 16 and I didn't know what A\u0026R stood for years and I was too afraid to ask. There's still so many things that people just assume you know. Labels have a responsibility to really make contracts clear for the people they're signing. And lawyers have a responsibility — if they’re going to take on a young client — they need to put the time in with that client and answer their questions. That's the advice: ask all the questions.\n","indexed":true,"author":"Kim Taylor Bennett","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"4aO1M8P3XVdWcVRgHCLIus","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How to Turn Listeners Into Fans With Marquee – Now Available to More Artists","description":"Promote your new release with Marquee, now available for all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Get started here with the fundamentals of demo construction.","article":"For any recording artist, big or small, everything starts with the demo. A song can exist in your head, in your bedroom, or even in your live performances, but it can’t truly be shared with the world until it’s recorded — and a demo is the first step on the road to release. As part of [our new Song Start series](https://noteable.spotify.com/songstart), Noteable by Spotify for Artists sat down with musicians [Phoebe Bridgers](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG?si=TjRDgjWmQguH5rUd_ET1bA) and Marshall Vore, [Kito](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3FLUBwpAnaIlIKeaBfsxFe?si=j4fkMy_ASTGxMHlvZFmezg), and [TOKiMONSTA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3VwKSHAfgzV1DOHV0aANCI?si=rKjld9XFSwGmI6pNl9yLnw) to learn more about the fundamentals of creating and recording a demo.\n\n“Anyone that tells you there’s a proper way to record anything, they’re wrong,” said Marshall Vore, a frequent collaborator with Phoebe Bridgers, advising artists to experiment with different sounds and recording setups. “There’s no proper way, there’s just things that you try and the consequences of those things and do you like that or not. Does it work for your particular situation?” \n\nWhile it’s easy to think that making good music takes expensive, high-end studio setups, Phoebe Bridgers noted that many of her earliest song ideas were captured on her smartphone, and she still sometimes records vocals in her bathroom. “Some of the most exciting and coolest art has been made by teenagers with no money in their bedrooms,” Vore said.\n\nOf course, there are a few fundamentals that any artist should be prepared to use during the recording process. Kito outlined the five key tools every artist should know about when creating a demo: \n\n- An interface: how you power and send sound into a computer in order to capture it\n- A microphone\n- A MIDI keyboard: a piano-style electronic keyboard used to trigger sounds and instruments\n- Your voice and instruments\n- A Digital Audio Workstation (DAW): a computer program like Logic or ProTools\n\nOnce you have your basic setup, the next step is testing your microphone. “Test the levels before you record,” Kito advised. “You can tell if something sounds distorted.” \n\nVore noted that the right setup is key to getting good quality audio. “When it’s too quiet you’re gonna get a lot of extra noise. When it’s too loud, that’s just gonna distort,” he said.\n\nKito recommended always having “some sauce on the vocals,” citing common plug-in tools like pitch correction (also known as Auto-Tune) and a De-Esser. The latter tool is designed to reduce instances of sibilance, a harsh sound that can show up on a vocal track when making “S” or “T” noises. “Whoever’s singing, they feel like they sound good so you’re gonna get a better performance,” she said.\n\nThere’s also tools like reverb, which can give audio more warmth and depth. “Reverb adds room to sounds,” TOKiMONSTA explained. “If you’re in a cathedral and you talk, you don’t really hear an echo; what you’re hearing is reverb, the sound of this large space and how sounds bounce back. But it also gives things an airiness, it provides a texture. Not everything sounds good with reverb and not every artist likes to use a lot of it.”\n\nUnderpinning the vocals of just about any demo track are instrumentals. Some artists and bands will record their instruments in the studio, but many create them using a MIDI and DAW. Artists and producers can choose from a huge array of instruments, samples, and more, and record them directly on their computer with MIDI controls. \n\nDrums form the base of many demo tracks, and TOKiMONSTA advised using a sample library controlled by your MIDI keyboard to create drum patterns. “It does really allow you to create a really consistent sound in your music,” she said.\n\nThere are many approaches to recording instrumental tracks with MIDI, including not using the keyboard at all. “You can draw chords in MIDI using your computer without actually touching the MIDI keyboard,” said Kito, referencing the common “pencil” tool in many DAWs. “A lot of producers I know learned like this, just drawing MIDI in. And you kind of start to recognize patterns. Even if you don’t have a keyboard, this is a really great way to make music.” \n\nAny instrumental performance is likely to have small imperfections, which can be fixed by “quantizing” the track. This converts performed instrumental notes into a perfected representation that lines up with the beat and eliminates any anomalies.\n\nThe process of recording a demo will vary based on an artist’s workflow, but whenever it’s done, the mixing and mastering process shouldn’t be overlooked. Mixing involves balancing all the individual elements of a song, including vocal and instrumental tracks, into a single stereo track using tools like EQ, reverb, and compression. TOKiMONSTA advised artists to listen to their demos in multiple environments to create the perfect mix. \n\n“For me to find ideal levels I need to listen to the song over and over on different speakers,” she explained. “In my car, on my laptop, on my airpods, different kinds of monitors, and then I’ll go micro-adjust. But balance is incredibly important. Even if I can make a song in a day, I take a very long time to mix.” \n\nMastering is often referred to as the “last line of defense,” where the song’s stereo track goes through a quality control process looking for “artifacts” like pops and distortions that would otherwise appear on the final product.\n\n“Mastering is not that hard,” TOKiMONSTA said. “Your music should always sound good without anything on the master. Mastering is just supposed to enhance and level out things.” \n\nAll four stars ultimately advised rising artists to trust themselves, even if they’re just starting out. “Apologize for yourself as little as possible,” Bridgers said, reiterating that it doesn’t take high-end equipment to make great music. \n\nTOKiMONSTA concurred. “It’s really important to trust your instincts,” she underscored. “A lot of people will not understand your perspective in the beginning, but that’s what’s going to set you apart later on.”\n\nTo learn more about creating and recording demos, check out Spotify’s [Song Start](https://noteable.spotify.com/songstart) episodes below:\n\n__Phoebe Bridgers \u0026 Marshall Vore - Recording an Acoustic Demo__\n\n[youtube-video Yn_9I7rmVf0] \n\n__TOKiMONSTA - Building a Demo__\n\n[youtube-video n1uz2gd6PrQ]\n\n__Kito - Setup for a Demo__\n\n[youtube-video SZVWj3T8EKY]\n\n[Click here to check out all the videos and podcasts from Song Start.](https://noteable.spotify.com/songstart)","indexed":true,"author":"Chris Mench","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"7HDjXIMaZd9ZGtTId1Wc2Y","contentType":"articlePage"}],"themeName":"whiteOnBlack","id":"4pzDQsj1CFtIvRhh3WdecI","contentType":"relatedStoriesList"},{"title":"Default Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Popular Stories","items":[{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","description":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","urlSlug":"how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release","releaseDate":"2022-03-21T09:30-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","headline":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","image":{"title":"Beach House Marquee Case Study HEADER","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2E4qFz6hN0zSt1RG73rYaE/e12746a736dbe692b6b59abb649f33fa/beach-house-marquee-header.png","details":{"size":3249484,"image":{"width":1601,"height":900}},"fileName":"beach-house-marquee-header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#ffffff","textColor":"#000000","id":"n0NGzv73qQsD0JfUVN7rZ","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","article":"Viral moments have a way of traveling far and wide, but the real win is turning that viral moment into a sustained success. Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold.

The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify.

But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify. So [get started](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch) today, reach your fans and followers, and make your artist profile a virtual merch table. \n\n*Are you interested in helping to test out new Spotify for Artists’ features?

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3.

Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold.

To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify. So [get started](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch) today, reach your fans and followers, and make your artist profile a virtual merch table. \n\n*Are you interested in helping to test out new Spotify for Artists’ features?

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

After all, the note, from the Polish EDM trio [Komodo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1lmjruOcvyQRZNIKUOlf68?si=TDGk9tdWTnCoYHgGOX_lEw), was just the second message he’d received on [the music talent marketplace](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/spotify-for-artists-and-soundbetter). He figured it would be a one-off job, never dreaming that he’d become the featured vocalist on a triple-platinum single.  \n\nA few months after remotely recording the track—a cover of [Cutting Crew](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cniTumSiUysiPWXapGx1i?si=bYfCHTvXRwKbUM2di_uGiA)’s 1986 hit \"[(I Just) Died In Your Arms](https://open.spotify.com/track/5MqFJxMwbZ5nyNogTDVTeL?si=UNk3S1ZgQiquTIOqEioxXw)\"—Shynes was on a plane to Zakopane, Poland to perform at a massive New Year’s Eve concert alongside his newfound friends. “I was a fish out of water, for sure,” he says, pointing out that he’d never even been out of the country before working with Komodo. Now, the success of that single and two follow-up collaborations has let Shynes write his own ticket back in the US—he’s able to command higher pay rates, be more selective with touring and studio gigs, and thus spend much more time at home with his family in Minnesota while continuing to earn money making music, remotely. We caught up with Shynes to hear about how it all happened and what lessons he has for artists who are new to [SoundBetter](https://soundbetter.com/). \n\n__Spotify for Artists: How did you hear about SoundBetter?__\n\nShynes: A harmony singer in my band named [Maygen Lacey](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/17317-maygen-lacey) was doing these acoustic cover versions of songs [through SoundBetter] and getting millions of hits on them. She knows I like working in the studio even more than I like performing, so she said, “Hey, there’s this website I’ve been on called SoundBetter where people all over the world can hire you for stuff. You can make music, earn side income and you don’t have to perform out as much.” I was like, “That sounds amazing.”\n\n__What were your goals in signing up for the site?__ \n\nMy goal was to sing on other people’s stuff, for sure. I always have way more than enough music—what I was looking for was a way to earn a side income from making music. At that time, I was performing like 200-250 shows a year, just grinding. I said, “I can’t keep up this pace. I need to create other streams of revenue for myself so that I have the flexibility to be home more.” I have a wife and two small kids. I love being home. I don’t want to be on the road all the time.\n\n\n__How did you link up with Komodo?__\n\nI threw up a profile on SoundBetter and [that] was the second job I got on the site. They reached out to me saying, “We’re remaking this ’80s song called ‘(I Just) Died In Your Arms.’” I love that song. They paid me and I sent them the vocal files. I thought that was the end of it. Four months later, [they put out a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8OI9FllKfg) that was, at the time, getting like 100,000 hits a day. They were, “Hey, check this out. This is kind of amazing.” It blew up from there to where now I think it’s over 118 million [streams on YouTube]. It went No. 1 in Poland, triple-platinum. It was crazy. \n\n__What was their rollout strategy for the song?__\n\nThey are signed to Sony, one of only two club acts in Poland signed to [the label]. They were pushing for radio play and had a machine behind them.\n\n__Did you do any follow-up tracks together?__ \n\nWe did [[a Whitesnake cover]](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3UbyYnvNIT5DFXU4WgiGpP?si=7SKyGyFVTD2MiRPEECg1fA) after that called [\"Is This Love\"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HklgS1hnxYF6uwCB0zpOA?si=gx12uMPKQ0uX65T9vOmMIw) that went platinum, and then we tried an original collaboration called [“Rush of Blood”](https://open.spotify.com/track/4WonmftStennNLSDmbRYli?si=mY5mBvGEQzGgeF4ekozG2A) that got 2.2 million plays on YouTube. It’s tough when you start with covers to try to get those fans to jump over to your original tracks. It’s a little slower to go. \n\n__And after the song blew up, they flew you out to perform with them a couple of times.__\n\nThe first time it was like 30,000 or 40,000 people. On New Year's Eve, there were like 73,000 people [there] and eight million watching live. It aired on the biggest TV channel in Poland, kind of like our New Year's Rockin’ Eve here in the US. [Before the first show] I had never spoken with them. I had never seen them. It was pretty surreal. It exploded in a way that none of us were prepared for. \n\n__What was it like to hang out with Komodo?__\n\nIt was definitely unique and humbling. It made me realize a lot of what other people go through when they’re in a new country and they’re learning the language. There’s a lot of times where you’re at dinner and not a word of English is spoken. You feel somewhat isolated, but Yash from Komodo was good about translating things to me. He was very considerate of the fact that I didn’t understand everything that was going on. I was treated very well, so that made it easier. \n\n__What has your career been like since returning to the US?__\n\nThat was the single biggest jump in my career, by a landslide. I was playing small clubs in St. Cloud—where I live before this project with Komodo. Since then, I’ve been able to sell out 800-seat theaters twice, two years in a row, as the only act. In Minneapolis, we were really close to selling out the Varsity Theater. I was able to stop doing all of the bar and club gigs I was doing, step back, and play the shows I wanted to play. The amount of studio work I was able to do—getting jobs with producers all over the world, raising my rates, being able to say no to things that I didn’t think I was a good fit for—was transformative in every aspect of my business. It was just life-changing. \n\n__What advice would you give to somebody just signing up for SoundBetter?__\n\nSet your rates lower, so you can get a body of work and get reviews from people. As you figure out your niche, what you want to work on, and what your value is, you can raise those rates. But to start, just get your foot in the door. Get some jobs under your belt. \n\n*-Adam Rothbarth*\n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7ziv17Hu5bjtTz3apQK30B","circular":true}},{"title":"Default Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Popular Stories","items":[{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","description":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","urlSlug":"how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release","releaseDate":"2022-03-21T09:30-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","headline":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","image":{"title":"Beach House Marquee Case Study HEADER","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2E4qFz6hN0zSt1RG73rYaE/e12746a736dbe692b6b59abb649f33fa/beach-house-marquee-header.png","details":{"size":3249484,"image":{"width":1601,"height":900}},"fileName":"beach-house-marquee-header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#ffffff","textColor":"#000000","id":"n0NGzv73qQsD0JfUVN7rZ","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","article":"Viral moments have a way of traveling far and wide, but the real win is turning that viral moment into a sustained success. Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

For years, she’s dedicated herself to fostering the connection between creators and their audiences, a relationship that continues to transform as current events redefine the role that artistry plays. We caught up with her to discuss her insights on artist and tour management, adapting to a dramatically evolving cultural climate, and how musicians can use their platforms to inspire change.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: Can you describe what you do and tell us how you got there?__\n\n__Dawn White:__ Currently, I oversee the DJ career of ?uestlove from The Roots as his manager, and as part of the management and strategy team for the ?uestlove brand at large. I started my career working for the electronic music pioneer King Britt and I became friendly with ?uestlove back in the late ’90s. After working for King, I managed [Larry Gold's highly regarded recording studio](https://www.bbemusic.com/artist/larry-gold/), where the entire neo-soul movement was born in Philadelphia. Everyone was coming there to work because Larry is a string composer. He was writing arrangements for [Justin Timberlake](https://open.spotify.com/artist/31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7?si=ZVMKvhkvRPi06jZ0XV1PJg), [J-Lo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2DlGxzQSjYe5N6G9nkYghR?si=0vmsBnqYQDew4HwihIremA), [Christina Aguilera](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1l7ZsJRRS8wlW3WfJfPfNS?si=G5IVr-0PQgyXwsoYdVDcpQ), [and] The Roots. \n\n?uestlove asked me to come on the road with him as his assistant and the merch director for The Roots. During that time, he was exploring his burgeoning interest in DJing. [Because] I had come from working with King Britt in the club scene, ?uestlove asked me to head up his DJ career. \n\nI moved to LA in 2006 and was immediately recruited by [Waxploitation Records founder] Jeff Antebi to work on a very exciting project he was heading up for [Danger Mouse](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2dBj3prW7gP9bCCOIQeDUf?si=Z94_Gf-tTlWPDIAZoLAMWA) called Gnarls Barkley. I was their tour manager when that project exploded and spent the next three years traveling the world with them. I went on to tour-manage Tom Morello of [Rage Against the Machine](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2d0hyoQ5ynDBnkvAbJKORj?si=3mWXgabvRBCLtDZ9acvBHw) for a couple years. I also tour-managed Charlotte Gainsbourg. \n\nSimultaneously, I was diligently building ?uestlove's DJ venture with him. In 2011, I started my own boutique DJ management and consulting agency, developed that for a few years, then ultimately decided my main priority is working with ?uestlove.\n\n__What sparked your interest in pursuing this as a career?__\n\nMy obsession with live music started when I went to see my very first show in 1987. I went to the [*Joshua Tree*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5vBZRYu2GLA65nfxBvG1a7?si=XlMYX_xoSzqJEaIlbd5hQQ) [U2](https://open.spotify.com/artist/51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ?si=P2FsM219Q3i8Z9fMJuETBg) tour at the now-defunct JFK stadium in Philly. I was in seventh grade. It was memorable because Bono had a broken arm, so [Bruce Springsteen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eqjTLE0HfPfh78zjh6TqT?si=dE8lS6wPQXCUUCoUXfFOuw) played guitar that night. After that, I spent all my money on concert tickets and merch. By the time I graduated from high school, I'd been to over 200 shows. [When] I went to college, I got turned on to the [Grateful Dead](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4TMHGUX5WI7OOm53PqSDAT?si=k5GdTXgYTdO0Jma6I5kCPA). I took some time off from school and followed the Grateful Dead around in a 1974 VW Westfalia camper van. I fell in love with that traveling-circus energy and the idea that music could inspire community. Though my parents were none too thrilled about my decisions during that time, we now joke about that experience [and how it] ended up being my career path.\n\n__What’s the best way for artists to utilize their platforms during a political and social moment like the unfolding now?__\n\nThe best way to use your platform for the greater good is access. We all relied on touring and performance to spread the message, but the current climate has shown we don't necessarily need to rely so heavily on that when we have access at our fingertips—your phone and your computer. There is a real reason now to tell real stories. If you can't find inspiration right now, maybe music is not meant to be your calling. Look at [BTS](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX?si=zfBFExX_TU66BfH9RbFOfQ) and how they're using their platform to turn their fans into disruptors and [encourage] political change in America. This is the power artists have now. I find it totally inspiring.\n\n__How has your work been affected or evolved in light of the pandemic?__\n\nI see this as a time for huge growth and creativity. Authenticity is being showcased now. We’re able to draw attention to the real impact of music. \n\nIn the pre-COVID world, there was a lot of music centered around a party vibe. That's not bad—that's a celebration of life in its own way. But in the midst of where we are in terms of the pandemic and Black Lives Matter, really, who is trying to bring Vegas into their living room now? That isn't where anyone is, emotionally. \n\nThat's why ?uestlove’s nightly DJ sets are so culturally important. He's teaching history lessons and reminding us to celebrate life. It's also a lesson in how to be better, more mindful humans. Whether it's the health crisis or the civil rights crisis, [that] is the truly the call to action now. I'm really proud of our team and what we're doing to represent those things.\n\n__What is the best advice you have for any artists that are just starting out?__\n\nIt's simple: Stay true, stay on the course, and don't make decisions to please other people.\n\n*—Ariel LeBeau*\n","modules":[{"title":"Related Stories 2","headline":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"Introducing the Best Advice Podcast","urlSlug":"introducing-the-best-advice-podcast","description":"We’ve turned our long-running video series into a longform podcast where the likes of Jeezy, Charli XCX, Russ, Ashnikko, Hayley Kiyoko, and many impart their best advice.

","article":"\nBack in 2018, we launched Best Advice, a video series where some of the most well renowned artists in the world relayed one piece of advice they’d received, a piece of advice that they’ve always taken with them that helped inform how they moved through the world, in terms of their career and otherwise. \n\n[Tierra Whack](https://artists.spotify.com/video/tierra-whack-best-advice)’s advice came from OutKast’s Andre 3000, [Lizzo](https://artists.spotify.com/video/lizzo)’s advice came from Missy Elliott, and [Trippie Redd](https://artists.spotify.com/video/trippie-redd)’s advice was actually a quote from John F. Kennedy Jr. (via a history book).\n\nOver the years we’ve interviewed everyone from [Rick Ross](https://artists.spotify.com/video/rick-ross), to [Christina Aguilera](https://artists.spotify.com/video/christina-aguilera), to [Phoebe Bridgers](https://artists.spotify.com/video/phoebe-bridgers), to [The Killers](https://artists.spotify.com/video/the-killers), [Elton John](https://artists.spotify.com/video/elton-john), [Quincy Jones](https://artists.spotify.com/video/quincy-jones), and [Karol G](https://artists.spotify.com/video/karol-g), and so many more. Each of them had a story attached to the advice they’d received, an anecdotal moment from their own life where these guiding words came in useful. \n\nAs a producer on Spotify for Artists, I spent a lot of time interviewing these incredible artists to extract one snappy tidbit for the video series, but I found there were so many useful takeaways, so much rich experience and perspective that was left on the cutting room floor. So we decided to create the Best Advice podcast: frank, intimate conversations with some of the most fascinating names in music. Each episode offers in-depth insights into what it's like to navigate the world of music, commerce, and creativity. Each artist shares their own advice gleaned from their successes and missteps, as well as advice they've received from mentors, collaborators, family, and confidants. \n\nDropping every Thursday at 10 a.m. EST, our 10-episode season will include conversations with [Joey Bada$$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2P5sC9cVZDToPxyomzF1UH?si=OVOOLObFT3yC8nIfcZXGHw), [Hayley Kiyoko](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3LjhVl7GzYsza1biQjTpaN?si=fDQBSoOPQ3iFmjrMZ5YWCA), [Ashnikko](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3PyJHH2wyfQK3WZrk9rpmP?si=iAr9nUerT0iObiI8M7cyzQ), [Conor Oberst](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Z7gV3uEh1ckIaBzTUCE6R?si=x_v5_5KBRaaXWgLHrmngXg), [Russ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1z7b1Pr1rSlvWRzsW3HOrS?si=ILcdUzktQb2ltAq4KXIsQg), [Billy Corgan](https://open.spotify.com/artist/12B5JK11NOP7OQ9Fxjrpx2?si=oQZQAaHrS6eS8DBo-pIvqA) of [The Smashing Pumpkins](https://open.spotify.com/artist/40Yq4vzPs9VNUrIBG5Jr2i?si=PBl5SnJWQri0aB3xSZgqzw), [Princess Nokia](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6lay1nwbE6hTx1jivysUAL?si=3vtF-GWgTwuHVtCZ5cu47w), and more. \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6XIgJZ99UcpTCXUSaBeMf6\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nToday we’re launching with a double drop: one installment with ATL hip-hop legend [Jeezy](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4yBK75WVCQXej1p04GWqxH?si=vw1-XryIT2ikJ-yI4f3MmQ), and the other with future-pop visionary [Charli XCX](https://open.spotify.com/artist/25uiPmTg16RbhZWAqwLBy5?si=wU5hvHiwSCyJfWJ2HJfPJA). Poles apart —not only in terms of the music they make, but also their journey to now — both artists offer an extremely candid look into their world as a working artist today. \n\n*Listen to the first two episodes and check out just a few of the many takeaways from Charli XCX and Jeezy below.*\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/7DqU6vDIcNPXorFQtNap8c\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Highlights from Jeezy's Best Advice episode \n\n__Forgiveness is key.__\n\nI had to write down a long list of people that did me wrong and I had to go down that list and give a reason for why I will forgive each one of those people, just to give forgiveness to myself so I can move on. Having a grudge is toxic. And when you’re toxic, you give toxic energy to the people around you. You give toxic energy to your kids, your loved ones, your employees, you know your peers. I was there. \n\nWhen people do you wrong and you get in your head, if somebody tell you’ll never be nothing… somebody tell you you’ll never be that rapper, that superstar, you'll never do this and that, and then you spend your whole life trying to prove that person wrong to get what they said you couldn't have. Then you get it and you’re not happy, you still lost.\n\n__Your morals and values are everything.__\n\nNo matter where you get to, no matter how it goes, no matter how it comes at you — the money, fame, temptations — just don't lose your values, your morals, and your integrity because when it's all said and done, you could have a billion dollars, 10 billion, if you don't have those three things, you have nothing. \n\n__Being savvy with money is about being open minded in a space where you’re not the smarter person in the room.__\n\nYou are the brand, you are the business, and when you get in a business meeting … they’re looking at ways to crunch numbers … and ways to monetize. When I started understanding what it was to know how to invest, to buy real estate, to use my likeness as leverage to be a part of a brand for equity… those conversations came by being in other rooms and talking to people that were outside of my comfort level. We as artists, we're the leaders of our pack, so it's hard for us to go look up to somebody else. For me it changed when I put my ego to the side… and just started walking in those rooms like “OK let's talk about it.” You gotta be comfortable with being uncomfortable. \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/5h68hNTr1PUZC5z2Qe9qCF\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Highlights from Charli XCX’s Best Advice episode \n\n__Commercial success does not equate to personal success and won’t always fit into your vision as an artist.__\n\nWhen I stopped worrying about what people thought of who I was, I was able to find myself and I was able to find the music that I loved to make. It kind of stripped away a lot of boundaries for me. I always did have a distinct vision, but I also think I grappled with wanting commercial success and not understanding how my vision and the commercial success fit together. I grappled with that a lot and now I just don't. But it took me a second to work that out and I think that was sort of it held me back for a while. I know this is the most standard advice, but I think it's actually advice that we don't follow enough: You have to go with your gut.\n\n__Keep an open mind when working with new collaborators: you never know what could come from it.__\n\nIt's important when you're young and starting off to explore different types of people. Even I have to tell myself that now, because I can definitely be a bit of a snob when it comes to who I'm going to work with for my own work. Less so if I'm writing for other people, but when it comes to my own stuff, I am very quick to judge and I'm very quick to be like, no that person isn't right for me, without even having given them a chance or met them.  There's been so many situations like that where I've almost decided to pull the session, but then I've gone and that person has become one of my most long term collaborators.\n\n__Read your contracts and ask questions.__ \n\nI signed when I was 16 and I didn't know what A\u0026R stood for years and I was too afraid to ask. There's still so many things that people just assume you know. Labels have a responsibility to really make contracts clear for the people they're signing. And lawyers have a responsibility — if they’re going to take on a young client — they need to put the time in with that client and answer their questions. That's the advice: ask all the questions.\n","indexed":true,"author":"Kim Taylor Bennett","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"4aO1M8P3XVdWcVRgHCLIus","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How to Turn Listeners Into Fans With Marquee – Now Available to More Artists","description":"Promote your new release with Marquee, now available for all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Get started here with the fundamentals of demo construction.","article":"For any recording artist, big or small, everything starts with the demo. A song can exist in your head, in your bedroom, or even in your live performances, but it can’t truly be shared with the world until it’s recorded — and a demo is the first step on the road to release. As part of [our new Song Start series](https://noteable.spotify.com/songstart), Noteable by Spotify for Artists sat down with musicians [Phoebe Bridgers](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG?si=TjRDgjWmQguH5rUd_ET1bA) and Marshall Vore, [Kito](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3FLUBwpAnaIlIKeaBfsxFe?si=j4fkMy_ASTGxMHlvZFmezg), and [TOKiMONSTA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3VwKSHAfgzV1DOHV0aANCI?si=rKjld9XFSwGmI6pNl9yLnw) to learn more about the fundamentals of creating and recording a demo.\n\n“Anyone that tells you there’s a proper way to record anything, they’re wrong,” said Marshall Vore, a frequent collaborator with Phoebe Bridgers, advising artists to experiment with different sounds and recording setups. “There’s no proper way, there’s just things that you try and the consequences of those things and do you like that or not. Does it work for your particular situation?” \n\nWhile it’s easy to think that making good music takes expensive, high-end studio setups, Phoebe Bridgers noted that many of her earliest song ideas were captured on her smartphone, and she still sometimes records vocals in her bathroom. “Some of the most exciting and coolest art has been made by teenagers with no money in their bedrooms,” Vore said.\n\nOf course, there are a few fundamentals that any artist should be prepared to use during the recording process. Kito outlined the five key tools every artist should know about when creating a demo: \n\n- An interface: how you power and send sound into a computer in order to capture it\n- A microphone\n- A MIDI keyboard: a piano-style electronic keyboard used to trigger sounds and instruments\n- Your voice and instruments\n- A Digital Audio Workstation (DAW): a computer program like Logic or ProTools\n\nOnce you have your basic setup, the next step is testing your microphone. “Test the levels before you record,” Kito advised. “You can tell if something sounds distorted.” \n\nVore noted that the right setup is key to getting good quality audio. “When it’s too quiet you’re gonna get a lot of extra noise. When it’s too loud, that’s just gonna distort,” he said.\n\nKito recommended always having “some sauce on the vocals,” citing common plug-in tools like pitch correction (also known as Auto-Tune) and a De-Esser. The latter tool is designed to reduce instances of sibilance, a harsh sound that can show up on a vocal track when making “S” or “T” noises. “Whoever’s singing, they feel like they sound good so you’re gonna get a better performance,” she said.\n\nThere’s also tools like reverb, which can give audio more warmth and depth. “Reverb adds room to sounds,” TOKiMONSTA explained. “If you’re in a cathedral and you talk, you don’t really hear an echo; what you’re hearing is reverb, the sound of this large space and how sounds bounce back. But it also gives things an airiness, it provides a texture. Not everything sounds good with reverb and not every artist likes to use a lot of it.”\n\nUnderpinning the vocals of just about any demo track are instrumentals. Some artists and bands will record their instruments in the studio, but many create them using a MIDI and DAW. Artists and producers can choose from a huge array of instruments, samples, and more, and record them directly on their computer with MIDI controls. \n\nDrums form the base of many demo tracks, and TOKiMONSTA advised using a sample library controlled by your MIDI keyboard to create drum patterns. “It does really allow you to create a really consistent sound in your music,” she said.\n\nThere are many approaches to recording instrumental tracks with MIDI, including not using the keyboard at all. “You can draw chords in MIDI using your computer without actually touching the MIDI keyboard,” said Kito, referencing the common “pencil” tool in many DAWs. “A lot of producers I know learned like this, just drawing MIDI in. And you kind of start to recognize patterns. Even if you don’t have a keyboard, this is a really great way to make music.” \n\nAny instrumental performance is likely to have small imperfections, which can be fixed by “quantizing” the track. This converts performed instrumental notes into a perfected representation that lines up with the beat and eliminates any anomalies.\n\nThe process of recording a demo will vary based on an artist’s workflow, but whenever it’s done, the mixing and mastering process shouldn’t be overlooked. Mixing involves balancing all the individual elements of a song, including vocal and instrumental tracks, into a single stereo track using tools like EQ, reverb, and compression. TOKiMONSTA advised artists to listen to their demos in multiple environments to create the perfect mix. \n\n“For me to find ideal levels I need to listen to the song over and over on different speakers,” she explained. “In my car, on my laptop, on my airpods, different kinds of monitors, and then I’ll go micro-adjust. But balance is incredibly important. Even if I can make a song in a day, I take a very long time to mix.” \n\nMastering is often referred to as the “last line of defense,” where the song’s stereo track goes through a quality control process looking for “artifacts” like pops and distortions that would otherwise appear on the final product.\n\n“Mastering is not that hard,” TOKiMONSTA said. “Your music should always sound good without anything on the master. Mastering is just supposed to enhance and level out things.” \n\nAll four stars ultimately advised rising artists to trust themselves, even if they’re just starting out. “Apologize for yourself as little as possible,” Bridgers said, reiterating that it doesn’t take high-end equipment to make great music. \n\nTOKiMONSTA concurred. “It’s really important to trust your instincts,” she underscored. “A lot of people will not understand your perspective in the beginning, but that’s what’s going to set you apart later on.”\n\nTo learn more about creating and recording demos, check out Spotify’s [Song Start](https://noteable.spotify.com/songstart) episodes below:\n\n__Phoebe Bridgers \u0026 Marshall Vore - Recording an Acoustic Demo__\n\n[youtube-video Yn_9I7rmVf0] \n\n__TOKiMONSTA - Building a Demo__\n\n[youtube-video n1uz2gd6PrQ]\n\n__Kito - Setup for a Demo__\n\n[youtube-video SZVWj3T8EKY]\n\n[Click here to check out all the videos and podcasts from Song Start.](https://noteable.spotify.com/songstart)","indexed":true,"author":"Chris Mench","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"7HDjXIMaZd9ZGtTId1Wc2Y","contentType":"articlePage"}],"themeName":"whiteOnBlack","id":"4pzDQsj1CFtIvRhh3WdecI","contentType":"relatedStoriesList"},{"title":"Default Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Popular Stories","items":[{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","description":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","urlSlug":"how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release","releaseDate":"2022-03-21T09:30-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","headline":"How Beach House Used a Viral Hit to Drive Momentum for Their New Release","image":{"title":"Beach House Marquee Case Study HEADER","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2E4qFz6hN0zSt1RG73rYaE/e12746a736dbe692b6b59abb649f33fa/beach-house-marquee-header.png","details":{"size":3249484,"image":{"width":1601,"height":900}},"fileName":"beach-house-marquee-header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#ffffff","textColor":"#000000","id":"n0NGzv73qQsD0JfUVN7rZ","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Beach House team at Sub Pop Records used Marquee – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – to promote their new album and create a halo effect across their entire body of work.","article":"Viral moments have a way of traveling far and wide, but the real win is turning that viral moment into a sustained success. Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify. So [get started](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch) today, reach your fans and followers, and make your artist profile a virtual merch table. \n\n*Are you interested in helping to test out new Spotify for Artists’ features?

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Under his stage name, [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1?si=dglIwK3BTVGgPh0PtWPTFQ), he has established himself as one of the world’s premier DJs and music producers, earning multiple Grammy nominations and headlining music festivals worldwide while holding down multiple Las Vegas residencies. Last year, with the world effectively shut down, Kaskade took on the challenge of bringing his brand of feel-good music to yet another frontier — the vibrant world of video games. \n\nIn December 2020, Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat and [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/), the popular vehicular soccer game, partnered with Kaskade, making him the face of the game’s first-ever music-themed season. For Rocket League's Season 2, described on its site as a “high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem,” Kaskade’s songs were featured as player anthems in-game and as tracks on its soundtrack. “Gaming and electronic music are a marriage written in the stars,” says Kaskade. “Everything I created for the games was also designed to translate to a dance floor, sort of a second language they’re prepared to speak.” \n\nThe tracks Kaskade contributed to this season of Rocket League — “Closer,” “[Flip Reset](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mUnxSunvs3Clvtpq3FtGo?si=05ddea04e20a45df),” Solid Ground” and “[Miles To Go](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yxiQyMmKQmC4x9U8rfR7A?si=5tEgHRTFQbijn6-P3gfAKg)” — make up his recently released [*Reset*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf?si=WADMX44_TxG49j_k68RjAA) EP. “Miles To Go,” the EP’s lead single with singer [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6?si=jFCxibmzS_6mcVYkrEDYWQ), is more than just another dance song, it was a special track inspired by the times and the climate of the world in 2020. “‘Miles To Go’ was written at a time when the entire world was essentially on fire,” Kaskade explains. “All I’d like to do is offer inspiration and hope that we can get to a better place. The destination has never been as important as the journey and ‘Miles To Go’ tells that story.” \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4yyJerTYT43RYX3J1OR9hf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Kaskade and his team prepared for the March release of this inspirational anthem, they had two objectives in mind: “The goal for ‘Miles To Go’ was to introduce Kaskade to new fans in the gaming community, while making sure the single resonated with his core audience,” says Monstercat’s Music Marketing Lead, Tabitha Neudorf. To build his listenership in the gaming community, they partnered with Rocket League and the ever-popular [Fortnite](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/kaskade-concert-rocket-league-fortnite-1147137/). And, to engage fans who may not have been up to date on the gaming tie-in, they turned to Marquee. Neudorf adds, “Marquee was a critical part of our campaign in ensuring long-time Kaskade and Ella Vos fans felt connected to this single.” \n\nThe team’s strategic use of Marquee’s features also complemented their release strategy. To extend the life of the single beyond the game and initial rollout, they started the Marquee a week after the track’s release. Staggering the campaign around the song allowed organic listenership to grow on its own before boosting it with Marquee’s full-screen recommendation. And, with Marquee’s targeting capabilities, they were able to reach the right U.S. fans. “With the ability to target both artists’ audiences on the track — Kaskade and Ella Vos — we were able to use one advertising method to hit two different audiences,” says Neudorf. This cross-promoting tactic helped each artist broaden their own audience.\n\nTheir strategies paid off — each listener who received the Marquee streamed the single an average of three times and showed no intent of stopping. Neudorf found, “With save rates playing such an important role in the longevity of a track, we were thrilled to see over 20% of listeners who saw the Marquee either saved the track or added it to their personal playlist.” The multi-pronged campaign for “Miles To Go” and the *Reset* EP have driven Monstercat's highest first-day and first-week streams for a new release. As of this writing, “Miles To Go” has racked up approximately 4.7 million plays on Spotify. \n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7gvXXcUXTCiFomGMCSk4xk"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"4jidLqR6CZV75ws1bZDIPa","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

But fandom is about more than just listening to music; for fans, it means interacting with their favorite artists, nerding out with fellow diehards, singing along to every lyric at shows (whether IRL or virtually), and of course, showing off their dedication with merch. \n\nFor artists, that fan support is their lifeblood. That’s why the Spotify for Artists team is focused on developing new tools and resources to help artists turn listeners into fans, fans into superfans, and, ultimately, earn more — not just through music, but also merch, [ticketing](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify), [tipping](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick), [Fans First emails](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-puts-fans-first), and more. As part of that ongoing effort, we’re happy to announce a new integration with Shopify giving artists even more opportunity to grow additional revenue streams, like merch.\n\nSelling merch isn’t just about commerce, it’s about connection, too. Shane Cody, drummer for the Indiana-bred alternative/indie band [Houndmouth](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EGwUS3c5dXduO4sMyLWC5?si=_BkVwLsWTRePiMMltVoMpQ\u0026dl_branch=1), recognizes it as an important part of the fan experience: “Merch is a connection to the fans on a tangible level,” he says. “Our music is the emotional connection, [so] sharing both on Spotify is essential.\" And when Houndmouth’s new album, Good For You, drops on Nov. 5, they’ll make the most of the release moment by featuring new merch on their artist profile.\n\nShopify makes it simple for artists and their teams to manage inventory and control which items are featured on their profiles. (For example, out-of-stock items get automatically removed from your profile.) As soon as you’re ready to drop new merch, you’ll immediately be able to share it with fans and capitalize on your release moments so that they can browse your merch while they stream your new music. \n\nListing your merch on Spotify with Shopify [is easy](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch): All you need to get started is admin access to your Spotify for Artists account and a Shopify store. Get started [here](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) or log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, go to the “Profile” tab, and click “Merch” to get started. From there, you'll be able to choose the three items from your store you want to feature on your artist profile. If your Shopify store sells merch from multiple artists, you can easily manage your entire roster’s sales and inventory on Spotify by connecting the store to each artist’s profile and listing merch from the artist’s “[collection](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch)” in Shopify. Each artist profile can only be connected to one Shopify store. \n\nIf you’re not on Shopify yet, we’ve got you covered: Shopify is offering a[ 90-day free trial](http://shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time. And if you don't have any merch inventory in stock, Printful is offering a [30% discount](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch \"Printful Link\") for Spotify artists' first two print-on-demand merch orders.\n\n![Check out the Merch tab in your Spotify for Artists](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7CD2RRnQC133srV7I5pAbu/f2af7c090df7f8d308cee8f00c09eb23/SxS-Blog-InLine__1_.gif)\n\nArtists globally can link their Shopify stores and list up to three merch items on their artist profiles that will be visible to their listeners.\n\nWe’re excited to continue investing in new ways for artists to monetize their fanbases on Spotify. So [get started](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch) today, reach your fans and followers, and make your artist profile a virtual merch table. \n\n*Are you interested in helping to test out new Spotify for Artists’ features?

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Nearly 40% of Jelani Aryeh’s Marquee Listeners Saved His Debut Album – Here’s How His Team Did It","description":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","urlSlug":"jelani-aryeh-marquee-canvas-case-study-save-debut-album","releaseDate":"2022-01-18T10:45-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2PyWdnrgMdCz2ErqyWTbrG"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The team at IMPERIAL Music explains how they used Marquee to bring listeners deeper into Jelani's music, while also using Canvas visuals to reinforce his brand.","article":"When aesthetic is just as important as your sound, a multi-dynamic marketing strategy is essential to building your brand personality. So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

<h2>Personal Freedom and the Internet</h2>
<p>
There are a lot of personal reminiscences around about the origin of the modern Internet
and about how it came to be. This is another, although it predates anything called the
Internet by a fair bit. In fact, it even preceded DARPANET.
<p>
I post it with a bit of reluctance. After all, true democracy is still the surest guide we have to
escape evil, and the government the modern Internet was designed to evade was, and
still is, far closer to democratic than most. But, at the time, we felt we had no choice.
And, as long as we are human, I doubt that the choices we were forced to face can ever
go away.
<p>
I grew up under the shadow of John Foster Dulles - if the "commies" do anything I don't
like, I can push a button and the whole world will go up in a fireball. Goodie gumdrops
stuff, especially since Canada is between the USA and Russia so everything that didn't
work would fall on us. Not to mention that Dulles worked for an army general turned
president. Today, "Area 51", Annie Jacobsen, documents how out of control American bomb
people were at the time.
<p>
My life continued with Senator McCarthy and his destruction of so many of my fellow
<a href="harpsichord.html">musicians</a> south of the border, General McArthur who
blew the Korean War up to bigtime, President Johnson who faked the Tonkin incident
to create the Vietnam war, and the American CIA.
<p>
And so it was that I quietly joined in the effort to attempt to preserve personal freedom
in the face of foreign domination and statism.
<p>
My first encounter with computers was at McGill University in 1956 - check out this new-fangled
language called FORTRAN; was it worth it for the cyclotron lab? McGill didn't have a computer
then for general use, so my hookup was a 110 baud line - I believe to DARPA thence to Dartmouth
College in the USA but I stand to be corrected; an ASR Teletype was all I saw.
Batch only, of course - FORTRAN didn't go interactive until years later - but the usual error
messages generally came back within 10 minutes. Snide comments typed by the computer operators
came back faster! (My recommendation: skip FORTRAN - assembly language is faster. It stood up
too; I could program faster and more reliably in HP 2116 non-macro assembly at NRC until well into
the 1970s.)
<p>
My experience continued with postgrad courses in the new Shannon information
theory, later with BASIC (definitely at Dartmouth), then by running state-of-the-art
computers at the National Research Council of Canada such as a 1968 HP 2116 that ran
at a blazing 300 kHz with 8 kB core and 300 kB drum. (I ran a whole building full of
world-class experiments with that system, 16 direct-digital-control multiprogrammed
experiments no less. I could even edit and recompile its operating system with 15
experiments running.)
<p>
But, how could we exchange scientific data with our fellows without the CIA
eavesdropping? Sure, we could use letter mail hard printouts, as long as we scotch-taped
the envelope corners so we could see if the contents had been read enroute. (That was to
keep tabs on our own RCMP, who were so dumb then that they opened them anyway,
then stuck a on a note supposedly from the Post Office, "Damaged in Transit".) And, the
"bandwidth of a Beetle full of mag tapes" was mighty high for the day. But, surely there
should be a better way...
<p>
At the time, a number of hackers were setting up what were called BBS's - bulletin board systems.
The term hacker was a compliment then - you had to be an electronics expert too, not just a
programmer. A remarkable number of us were 'hams', licensed amateur radio operators - I was VE2ARH
besides being an electrical engineer. BBS's interfaced to the telephone network by means of
modems - 110 baud, masquerading as Western Union Teletype ASR33's. (In Canada, 300 baud then
required that you rent an expensive modem from Bell Canada, along with an
equally-expensive specially configured telephone line.)
<p>
Canadian day-time long-distance charges then were hundreds of times a professional salary. But,
unlike many parts of the world, in Canada local telephone calls have always been without limits.
Very quickly, most BBS's set up a long distance charge avoidance network - each BBS had a list of
all other BBS's within local-dial range, so we in Ottawa could send messages to Toronto in half a
dozen relays or so without having to pay for long-distance connections.  But, the dumbest exchange
monitor could detect the two frequencies used by modems then and switch on a recorder, and we knew
it.
<p>
And so it was that I joined the world of international intrigue: I proposed a system called
Jaberwocky, after the Lewis Carroll rhyme
<blockquote>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
<br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
<br>All mimsy were the borogoves,
<br>And the mome raths outgrabe...
</blockquote>
<p>
Each letter (upper case only, of course - this was the 1960's) was represented by a
phoneme. The commonest English letters were represented by the commonest English
phonemes, so the result approximated the spectrum of an innocuous English speaker.
Pauses were put in that matched human breathing. (There were hilarious moments sorting
this out: listening to real people speaking, analysing the results, then comparing the measurements
to the prototype Jaberwocky with Carroll's rhyme in mind!) Do remember that no computer then
could even come close to analysing voice waveforms in real-time, so we had to design
the "phonemes" so that discrete-component audio filters could sort them out and output
DTL (diode-transistor-logic) digital signals.
<p>
It was a mess of wire-wrap, of course - only half a dozen or so were
ever made. And, it seems laughable now - anyone scanning with a modern PC
could detect Jaberwocky's output within seconds. But at that time, I doubt very much that
any automatic system eavesdropping on the telephone lines of that time could have
detected the difference between Jaberwocky-digital communications and those of the
average English speaker.
<p>
Jaberwocky was local, and slow: 3 characters/second. Others of my colleagues had wider
ideas. Coast-to-coast television was just taking off. (The first TV set where I grew up
was bought specifically to watch the coronation of the current Queen Elizabeth. Movie
film of the proceedings was shot in London, each reel loaded as soon as it was exposed
into a series of propeller-driven airplanes, probably DC-6's, and developed enroute to Newfoundland,
where a specially setup national microwave hookup had been rented by the Canadian
government for the occasion. The whole neighbourhood jammed the livingroom and
staircase, and peered in through the windows from the porch to see that 14"
black&amp;white screen. A week later, we all visited the local movie theatre to see it in
colour.) The bandwidth used by TV was then astronomical - four megabaud for the video
signal alone.
<p>
Well, to skip technical details, we worked out that a deterministic 50 kilobaud signal with
a proper spectrum could be hidden in a standard TV signal of the time with no possibility
then of detection that it was there except by someone who knew the code. And so, the
spirit of Jaberwocky went coast to coast, on a TV network that I won't name even to this
day.
<p>
Paranoiac? Not if you grew up in the world I did.
<p>
Of course, by 1983 and TCP/IP, 110 baud was laughable, 50 kilobaud trunk lines even
more so. But, when you read the accounts of the network pioneers who came after me,
who did their best to design the modern Internet so that no one could ever control it,
remember where we all began - with egomaniacs who were determined to dominate the
entire world or destroy it if they couldn't. (eg: "We shall never capitulate, no, never. We may
be destroyed but if we are, we shall drag a world with us, a world in flames." Adolf
Hitler, the democratically selected chancellor of Germany, 1934.)
<p>
So, if you don't like the ability of people to send you untraceable junk mail on today's
Internet (and I'm sure you don't), remember the alternatives we faced. Those
alternatives will pop up in an instant if we ever decide that freedom isn't worth the hassle.

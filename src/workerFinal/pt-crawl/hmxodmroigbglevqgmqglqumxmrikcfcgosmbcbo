<p> <img src="gif/ec2018.jpg" class="flr" width="222" height="206" 
alt="eric chudler photo" /> <strong> Eric Chudler, Ph.D.</strong> is a 
neuroscientist (Research Associate Professor) and Executive Director of 
the <a href="http://www.centerforneurotech.org"> Center for 
Neurotechnology</a> in <a href="seattle.html">Seattle, Washington</a>.  
He is a &#34;basic researcher&#34; performing experiments related to how 
the nervous system works and how Parkinson&#39;s disease affects the 
brain. </p>

<p>Dr. Chudler attended elementary, junior and senior high school in a few 
places including:<br />
<ol>
<li>Los Angeles, California (K-4 grade); (7 grade); (11-12 grade)</li>
<li>The International School of Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia (5-6 grade) </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.canacad.ac.jp/" title="EXTERNAL LINK - canadian academy website">Canadian Academy</a> in Kobe, Japan (8-10 grade)</li></ol>

<p> He graduated from <a href="http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Grant_HS/" 
title="EXTERNAL LINK - grant high school website">Grant High School</a> 
in 1976 (Los Angeles, California) and from <a 
href="http://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> in 1980 with a B.S. degree in 
Psychobiology.  For graduate school, he attended the <a href= 
"http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> and received an 
M.S. degree (1983) and Ph.D. degree (1985) from the <a 
href="http://web.psych.washington.edu/">Department of Psychology</a>.  
Then it was off to the <a href="http://www.nih.gov">National Institutes 
of Health</a> in the Washington, D.C. area for post-doctoral training 
(1986-1989).  In 1989, he headed up the east coast for a position 
(Instructor) in the <a 
href="http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/">Department of 
Neurosurgery</a> at <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org//"> 
Massachusetts General Hospital</a> in Boston, MA. In 1991, it was back 
to Seattle and the University of Washington where Dr. Chudler did some 
teaching in the Department of Psychology before taking a research 
position in the Department of Anesthesiology.  Since 2011, Dr. Chudler 
has been the Executive Director of the Center for Neurotechnology.<img

<td><strong>Ellen Kuwana, M.S.</strong> -- Staff Writer/Research Consultant<br />
Ellen Kuwana worked with Neuroscience for Kids until 2005.  She 
composed articles for the Neuroscience for Kids <a 
href="inthenews.html">&#34;In the News&#34;</a> section which focuses on 
recent innovations in science that have been spotlighted in the media. 
Kuwana also wrote articles explaining mental and neurological diseases 
and disorders. Kuwana received her Bachelor of Science from the 
University of Kansas (where her father is an emeritus professor), then 
worked for several years as a staff research associate at the University 
of California San Francisco (UCSF).  Kuwana had also been active in the 
Science Education Partnership, working with the public school system to 
bring hands-on science into the classroom. As part of the Triad project, 
she teamed with another scientist and two teachers to create an 
afterschool science club for girls. Neuroscience for Kids is the perfect 
combination of neuroscience, education, science outreach, and writing 
and editing-all rolled into a collaborative and creative atmosphere. 
When not at work, Kuwana enjoys spending time with her pediatrician 
husband, two daughters and hyper dog.</td></tr>

<td><strong>Melissa Phillips</strong> --  Research Consultant</br />
Melissa Phillips was a research consultant for Neuroscience for Kids 
from 2002 until 2004. She wrote about new neuroscience research for the 
<a href="inthenews.html">In the News</a> section of the site. Phillips 
grew up in Ottumwa, Iowa, and graduated from Ottumwa High School in 
1996. She then moved to St. Louis for four years of college, graduating 
from Washington University in 2000 with a bachleor&#39;s degree in 
Psychology and PNP (Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology). After spending 
a few months studying photography in Paris, Phillips came to Seattle and 
started work as a research technician in a neurobiology lab at the 
University of Washington. Researchers in this lab study the development 
and regeneration of the retina. Phillips began writing for Neuroscience 
for Kids in March of 2002. In the fall of 2002, she enrolled in classes 
in the science writing pathway in the department of Technical 
Communication at the UW. She has developed her science writing by 
completing stories for class, and editing the papers of scientists in the lab. </td></tr>

<td><strong>Marge Murray, Ph.D.</strong> -- Staff Writer/Research Consultant <br />
Marge Murray was involved with the development of curriculum 
materials for Neuroscience for Kids from 1999 to 2001. She completed several 
units of experiments on the senses: touch, smell, taste, vision, and 
hearing. In these units, Dr. Murray included a Teacher Resource with 
background information on each topic, a Teacher Guide to the experiment, 
and a Student Guide to help students organize and interpret their work. 
Crucial parts of these units are the "How Can You Design a Good 
Experiment?" and "Try Your Own Experiment" sections, which encourage 
teachers and students to think critically when designing and executing 
experiments. Murray received her Ph.D. from Case Western University in 
Cleveland, where she studied what happens in a muscle when the nerve to 
the muscle is cut. At the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, she 
tracked the growth of sensory nerves in the wings of developing fruit 
flies. After polishing skills in technical writing and editing with 
courses from the UW Department of Technical Communication, Murray worked 
with a middle school outreach group in the Department of Molecular 
Biotechnology at the UW. </td></tr></table>

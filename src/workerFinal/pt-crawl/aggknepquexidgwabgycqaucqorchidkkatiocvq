Buddhism was founded by Siddharta Gautama, a prince 
      of the Sh<U>a</U>kya familiy that reigned over a small kingdom in modern 
      Nepal. His epithet Sh<U>a</U>kyamuni (chin.: Shijiamouni 釋迦牟尼) means "Wise 
      of the Sh<U>a</U>kya", other epitets are <EM>arhata</EM> "Thoroughly 
      saint" and <EM>tath</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>gata</EM> "Thus Come One" 
      (chin.: Rulai 如來). He was born in the Lumbin<U>i</U> grove during the 6th 
      century BC and was kept free from knowledge of daily suffering in the 
      palace. During a ride he first became aware of human suffering in shape of 
      an sick person, an old man and a funeral. Very upset by these visions of 
      true life, Siddharta left his family and for seven years lived as an 
      ascetic, only to find out that the extreme ascetic life was not able to 
      solve from suffering. He further relied upon meditation 
      (<EM>dhy</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>na</EM>, chin.: <EM>chan</EM> 禪) to 
      arrive at the conclusions that made him a Buddha ("Enlightened Man", 
      chin.: <EM>fo</EM> 佛 or Zhengjue 正覺), after being tempted by the evils of 
      the world sent by the hell spirit Mar<U>a</U> or Yama (chin.: <EM>mo</EM> 
      魔, <EM>yemo</EM> 夜摩), under a fig tree ("Bodhi tree", chin.: 
      <EM>putishu</EM> 菩提樹). In Isipattna/Ben<U>a</U>res, the Enlightened began 
      to teach his sermons, the "Wheel of Teaching" (<EM>dharmacakra</EM>, 
      chin.: <EM>falun</EM> 法輪; a wheel is the symbol of Buddhism, sometimes stylized as <EM>svastika</EM> 卍, chin.: <EM>wan</EM>), in 
      Kusin<U>a</U>r<U>a</U> Buddha died and entered the 
      <EM>nirv</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>na</EM> ("extinction", chin.: 
      <EM>ji</EM> 寂), free from the misery of <EM>karma</EM> (intended deeds and 
      their accumulated results, the eternal rebirth; chin.: <EM>yinguo</EM> 因果) 
      and the rotation of the world (<EM>sams</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>ra</EM>, 
      chin.: <EM>zhuanlun</EM> 轉輪). The stories of his life and enlightenment 
      (chin.: <EM>wu</EM> 悟, jap.: <EM>satori</EM>) are accounted in the 
      <EM>j</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>taka</EM> tales (chin.: <EM>fo zhuan 
      gushi</EM> 佛傳故事; especially birth stories, chin.: <EM>shousheng</EM> 受生). 
      Among his close disciples was the famous <U>A</U>nanda (chin.: Anantuo 
      阿難陀). <br>
<br>
<span class="head"><a name=teachings>Teachings</A> (<EM>dharma</EM>) of the 
      Buddha <a href="#top"><img src="../../Eidola/up.jpg" border="0"></a></span><br><br>
  Buddha found out the Four Noble Truths (chin.: 
      <EM>sidi</EM> 四諦) that lead to rebirth, the form of which is a result of 
      doings and behaviour accumulated during the past lifes of a person: life 
      is suffering, and the cause for the suffering is craving for existence and 
      sensual pleasures. This suffering can be suppressed by the Eightfold Path 
      (chin.: <EM>bashengdao</EM> 八聖道): right views, right intentions, right 
      speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfullness, 
      and right concentration (<EM>yoga</EM>). To successfully walk on the 
      eightfold path, it is necessary to observe a strict moral discipline, not 
      to commit evil, but to do good, and to purify one's own mind by mental 
      discipline, fixing it at the important part of doings. Lead by intuitive 
      wisdom (<EM>praj</EM><EM><U>na</U></EM>; chin.: <EM>zhihui</EM> <FONT 
      size=3>智慧</FONT>), the meditating person is able to know that he has to 
      give up imaginations of a permanent self or soul in favour of the non-self 
      (<EM>an</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>tman</EM>, chin.: <EM>wuwo</EM> 無我). 
      During life, a person is only a conglomeration of the five aggregats or 
      factors (<EM>skandha</EM>, chin.: <EM>wuyin</EM> 五陰: <EM>se</EM> 色, 
      <EM>shou</EM> 受, <EM>xiang</EM> 想, <EM>xing</EM> 行, <EM>shi</EM> 識): body, 
      sensation, perception, predisposition and consciousness. Another pattern 
      of explanation is the chain of causation, ignorance being the base, 
      leading to predisposition, consciousness, name and form, the six senses, 
      sensation, contact, craving, grasping, becoming, leading to birth, and 
      birth leading to age and death. A normal being that is not able to enter 
      the <EM>nirv</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>na</EM> at least tries to become a 
      heavenly being (<EM>deva</EM>, chin.: <EM>tian</EM> 天 or <EM>Da Fan 
      Tianwang</EM> 大梵天王). The Three Jewels (<EM>sanbao</EM> 三寶) of the Buddhist 
      religion are Buddha, his teaching (<EM>dharma</EM>, chin.: <EM>fa</EM> 法) 
      and the community (<EM>sangha</EM>, chin.: <EM>seng</EM> 僧).<BR>Buddhist 
      cosmology bases on the Hindu world image that is much more complex than 
      the unsystematic chinese cosmic picture. Mount Sumeru (short: Meru) is the 
      center of this world, which is only one of millions of worlds that will 
      perish after millions of years only to be replaced by a new one. Every 
      world has its own Buddha who acts as world master, therefore depicted by 
      huge Buddha sculptures. <br>
<br>

							The early history of Buddhism is less then clear. There have been a handfull of conciles to fix the teachings of the Buddha, the concile of P<u>a</u>taliputra in 245 BC tried to fix the teachings in book form, the so called &quot;Three Baskets Canon&quot; <em>Tripitaka</em>. It is fully preserved in Pali language and consists of the writings about discipline (<em>vin</em><em><u>a</u></em><em>ya, </em>chin.: <em>lü</em> 律), teachings (<em>sutras</em>), and comments (<em>abidharma</em> 論). When Buddhist parishes divided into different sects, is not known. The more conservative form of Buddhism is the confession Therav<u>a</u>da (&quot;Way of the Elders&quot;; also called &quot;Small Vehicle&quot;, H<u>i</u>nay<u>a</u>na, chin.: <em>Xiaosheng</em> 小乘 [not <em>cheng</em>!]), basing on the Pali canon. It is a discipline for personal salvation by the individual, possible only for those who join the monasteric order as monk or nun, at least for a short time, to accumulate enough meritorious <em>karma</em> for one's own salvation. In this way, Buddhism is only a caste-less Hinduism that makes it possible to escape rebirth. Therav<u>a</u>da Buddhism spread over Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Indochina Peninsula.<br>
								The confession of the Great Vehicle, Mah<u>a</u>y<u>a</u>na (chin.: <em>Dasheng</em> 大乘), instead spread from Kashmir, Gandhara, Soghdia and Inner Asia into China, and further to Korea and Japan. It teaches that salvation is possible to all sentient beings because they posses the Buddha nature in them and hence all have the potentiality of being enlightened. Enlightenment is simply achieved by faith and devotion to Buddha and the religious ideal, the Bodhisattva (chin.: <em>Pusa</em> 菩薩), Pratyekabuddha (chin.: <em>Pizhifo</em> 辟支佛) or Arhat (chin.: <em>Aluohan</em> 阿羅漢, short: <em>Luohan</em>). These beings, though qualified to enter <em>nirv</em><em><u>a</u></em><em>na</em>, delay their final entry in order to bring every sentient being across the sea of misery to the calm shores of enlightenment. The most important Bodhisattvas are Ma<u>n</u>jushr<u>i</u> (chin.: Wenshushili 文殊師利), the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, Avalokiteshvara (&quot;Observing the Sounds of the World&quot;, chin.: Guanshiyin 觀世音, short: Guanyin, or Guanzizai 觀自在), the Bodhisattva of Compassion, and Samantabhadra (&quot;Universal Goodness&quot;, chin.: Puxian 普賢), the Meditation Teacher. Buddha appears in different shapes, according to the belief that Buddha appears in every age in a special appearance, like Amit<u>a</u>bha (Amit<u>a</u>yus, &quot;Buddha of Endless Light&quot;, chin.: Namo Amituofo 南無阿彌陀佛, jap.: Amida Butsu) or Vairocana &quot;Universal Illuminator&quot; or Lokeshvaraja (chin.: Pilushena 毘盧舍那, short: Lushena), the Buddha of the Past; Maitreya (chin.: Milefo 彌勒佛), the Buddha of Future. The Light Buddhas are clearly an influence of Iranian religion with the god of light, Ahuramazda. Compare a text from the <a href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#amitabha">Large Amitabha Sutra</a>. Popular Great Vehicle Buddhism is very fond of describing and depicting hells and heavens and the many Arhats, best seen in the wall paintings of Dunhuang.<br>

      align=right>The first Buddhist parishes are found in China in the 1st 
      century AD and focused mainly on the suppression of passions by means of 
      meditation, charity and compassion. The monastery claiming to have been 
      the first in China is the <A 
      href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#luoyangqielanji">White Horse 
      Monastery</A> (<EM>Baimasi</EM> 白馬寺) near Luoyang. Many similarities with 
      Taoism made Buddhism look like another sect of Huang-Lao-Taoism; both 
      religions have no sacrificial ritus, believe both in immortality and 
      operate with concentration, meditation and abstinence. The early 
      translations of Buddhist sutras all used Taoist terms to paraphrase the 
      complicated construct of Buddhist metaphysical philosophy, like 
      <EM>dao</EM> 道 for <EM>dharma</EM>, <EM>bodhi</EM>, <EM>yoga</EM>, or 
      <EM>zhenren</EM> 真人 as <EM>arhat</EM>, <EM>wuwei</EM> 無為 as 
      <EM>nirv</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>na</EM>, and <EM>ming</EM> 命 as 
      <EM>karma</EM>. Later translators were more cautious in translating 
      Buddhist terms and sometimes did not even dare to translate it. 
      <EM>Nirv</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>na </EM>was simply transscribed as 
      <EM>niepan</EM> 涅盤, <EM>abhidharma</EM> as <em>apidamo</em> 阿毘達摩. Experienced tranlators of <a href="../Tang/tang.htm">Tang Dynasty</a> finally were able to define exact terms of translation: <em>ji</em> 寂 and <EM>lun</EM> 論, in our example. 
      The first great time of Buddhism in China was during the <a href="jin.htm">Eastern Jin Dynasty</a>, when the new religion entered the <a href="../../History/Terms/gentry.html">gentry class</a>. Disappointed and not more interested in governmental officials, the landowning class joined the Buddhist community. But also scholars, that were more interested in Taoism since the end of the <a href="../Han/easthan.htm">Later Han Dynasty</a>, became fond of the new religion, that gave both groups a stronghold in a time of ceaseless war. The Non-Chinese rulers of the <a href="tobawei.htm">Northern Wei Dynasty</a> converted to Buddhism and saw 
      themselves as personification of the Buddha. The maturity and great age of 
      Buddhism in China was the <a href="../Tang/tang.htm">Tang Dynasty</a> when emperors spent their wealth to establish monasteries and sculptures in different Buddhist caves. But this age was not free of persecution, especially by Confucian oriented statesman that wanted to get rid of the foreign religion. Many people converted and entered a monastery to escape military service and tax paying. The <a href="../../Literature/Classics/neoconfucianism.htm">revival of Confucianism</a> under the <a href="../Song-Yuan/song.htm">Song Dynasty</a> caused the decline of Buddhism as a state religion. But as popular belief, Buddhism is still very widespread, but highly mixed with Taoist belief.<br>
							The transition of the foreign religion into a Chinese 
      one was made easy especially by the ideal of charity and compassion of 
      Great Vehicle Buddhism. Both terms are quite similar to the Confucian idea 
      of filial piety and the compassion of the ruler for his subjects. Other 
      concepts of Buddhism are quite <A 
      href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#mouzi">contrary to 
      Confucianism</A> (suffering - enjoying; celibacy - family; mendicant monks 
      - productive farmers; monastic community - subordination under the state), 
      but the missing of a central power during the 3rd and 4th centuries gave 
      room for the Buddhist religion of salvation of the individual. The power 
      of spells and charms had a great attraction not only to Chinese peasants, 
      but also for the foreign rulers in the north. Finally, many people escaped 
      military service and tax duty by entering a monastery. Looking at 
      Confucianism, we see that this state doctrine is totally lacking the 
      aspect of the spiritual world (except <a href="../../History/Terms/ancestors.html">ancestor veneration</a>), and it is 
      quite understandable that people found a good way to meet their religious 
      needs in Buddhism.<BR>Buddhism and its representative objects became part of 
      the Chinese culture like dragons and chopsticks. The Laughing Buddha 
      ("Pot-Belly Buddha") is the transformation of an Indian askete into a 
      deity objecting Chinese ideals. The Indian <EM>stupa</EM>, a small 
      buildings that contains relics of the Buddha or his scholars, and at the 
      same time symbolizing the center of the Indian universe, mount Meru, 
      became the Ceylonese <EM>dagoba</EM>, the Thai <EM>chedi</EM>, the 
      Tibetian <EM>cherten</EM> (the most beautiful being erected in 
      Katmandu/Nepal), and finally the Chinese nine-floor pagoda (<EM>ta</EM> 
      塔). <br>
<br>
<span class="head"><A name=monks>Eminent monks</A>: translators, teachers, and travellers <a href="#top"><img src="../../Eidola/up.jpg" border="0"></a></span><br><br>
      The first monks in China 
      all were foreigners, the first Chinese clerics are found from the 4th 
      century on. An Shigao 安世高 (mid 2nd cent.) was the first translator of 
      Buddhist <EM>s</EM><EM><U>u</U></EM><EM>tras</EM> (chin.: <EM>jing</EM> 經) 
      from Sanskrit (chin.: <em>Fan</em> 梵) into Chinese. During the <a href="jin.htm">Jin Dynasty</a>, the teaching of <em>praj</em><EM><U>na</U></EM> ("sage wisdom") 
      became prevalent, manifested in the sutra 
      <EM>Praj</EM><EM><U>na</U></EM><EM>p</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>ramit</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM> 
      ("Perfection of wisdom"), translated by Dharmaraksha (chin.: Zhu Fahu 竺法護) 
      in 291. Other representatives of this school were Zhi Dun 支盾 (d. 366) and 
      Xi Chao 郗超 (d. 377). The 4th and 5th century brought up a number of famous 
      monks of Chinese and Non-Chinese origin who tried to translate accurately 
      Buddhist sutras into Chinese and to make the early translations free from 
      Taoist tought and terms: Fotu Cheng 佛圖澄 (d. 349), Kum<U>a</U>raj<U>i</U>va 
      鳩摩羅什 (413), <A 
      href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#gaosengzhuan">Faxian</A> 法顯 
      who travelled in 399 to India to bring back the whole corpus of 
      <EM>Vin</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>ya </EM>texts "Rules of Discipline" 
      (chin.: <EM>lü</EM> 律) and translated them into Chinese, Daoan 道安 (d. 385) 
      who compiled a catalogue of sutras and promoted the Maitreya cult, Huiyuan 
      慧遠 (d. 416) who promoted the Amit<U>a</U>bha cult and together with Buddhabhadra 佛馱跋陀羅 (chin.: Juexian 覺賢) the practice of meditation and 
      <EM>yoga</EM>, and Daosheng 道生 (d. 434) who focused on the 
      <EM>Nirv</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>na-s</EM><EM><U>u</U></EM><EM>tra</EM>, 
      like Dharmakshema (chin.: Tanwuchen 曇無讖, around 400). The Chinese monks 
      did not only translate the sutras that Indian and Inner Asian missionaries 
      had brought them, but many translators brought back the Buddhist writings 
      from India themselves, like Dharmaraksha, Faxian, Huisheng 慧生, Xuanzhao 
      玄照, Buddhadharma, Yijing 義淨 and Zhihong. But the most famous pilgrim was 
      the translator <A 
      href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#xiyuji">Xuanzang</A> 玄奘 who 
      even figures as the main person in the Ming time novel <A 
      href="../../Literature/Novels/novels.htm#xiyouji"><EM>Journey to the 
      West</EM></A>. With the closure of the trade routes by the Arabs and 
      Tibetians, the decline of Tang central government and the proscriptions of 
      Buddhism in the 840ies, pilgrim travels were ended. <br>
<br>
<span class="head"><a name=sutras>Chinese Buddhist Literature</a> <a href="#top"><img src="../../Eidola/up.jpg" border="0"></a></span><br><br>
							By the end of <a href="../Tang/tang.htm">Tang Dynasty</a>, almost all Buddhist scriptures were translated into Chinese, and many <strong>catalogues</strong> have been compiled to collect the different translations of all the sutras. The most important catalogues are:<br>
							<em>Zongli zhongjing mulu</em> 綜理眾經目錄 &quot;Comprehensive catalogue of sutras&quot; by Daoan 道安, unfortunately not preserved<em><br>
								Chu sanzang jiji</em> 出三藏記集 &quot;Collection of records concerning the Tripitaka&quot; by Sengyou 僧祐<em><br>

							<em>Kaiyuan shijiao lu</em> 開元釋教錄 &quot;Catalogue of the Kaiyuan era on Buddhism&quot; by Zhisheng 智昇<em><br>
							</em>The whole corpus of Chinese Buddhist writings is compound in the so-called <b>Tripitaka</b> &quot;Threefold basket&quot; (<i>Sanzang</i> 三藏). The modern edition of that corpus was made in Japan under the Taishô Emperor from 1922-1933, therfore called <em>Taish</em><em><u>o</u></em><em> Daiz</em><em><u>o</u></em><em>ky</em><em><u>o</u></em> 大正大藏經 &quot;Great Sutra Storehouse of the Taish<u>o</u> era&quot; (chin.: <em>Dazheng Dazangjing</em>). It is divided into 86 volumes, distributed into the sermons of the Buddha (Sutras; <i>jing</i> 經); the <em>Vin</em><em><u>a</u></em><em>ya</em> writings (rules of discipline; <em>lü</em> 律); the <em>Abhidharma</em> writings (&quot;Higher Subtleties&quot;; chin.: <em>lun</em> 論 or <i>apitan</i> 阿毘曇); <em>M</em><em><u>a</u></em><em>dhyamika</em> (&quot;Middle path&quot;, i.e. Great Vehicle; chin.: <em>zhongdao</em> 中道) and <em>Vij</em><em><u>na</u></em><em>nav</em><em><u>a</u></em><em>da</em> (Idealistic School; chin.: <em>Weishizong</em> 唯識宗) writings; <em>sh<u>a</u>stra</em> (treatises; chin.: <em>lun</em> 論); commentaries by Chinese monks; literature of the various Chinese schools; historical records; encyclopedias; catalogues.<br>

The <strong>Pure Land School</strong> (<i>Jingtu Zong</i> 淨土宗, jap.: <i>J<u>o</u>do Sh<u>u</u></i>, kor.: <i>Chòngt'o Jong</i>) that focuses on the simple Amit<u>a</u>bha (chin.: Namo Amituofo 南無阿彌陀佛; jap.: Amida, kor.: Amit'a) cult, was already founded by Huiyuan 慧遠 during <A href="jin.htm">Eastern Jin</A>, but the monk Shandao 善導 (d. 681) was its forming patriarch. Its basic writing is the <i><a href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#amitabha">Wuliangshou Jing</a></i> 無量壽經 in a short and a long version. Both decribe the Western Paradise, the access to which is possible by meritorious deeds as well as faith and devotion to the Amitabha Buddha. A central deity in Jingtu Buddhism is the Guanyin (jap.: Kan'on) Bodhisattva, the Chinese form of the Avalokiteshvara. Shandao wrote that five activities could lead to rebirth in the Western Paradise: uttering the name of the Buddha (<i>nian Fo</i> 念佛), chanting the sutras, meditating on the Buddha, worshipping and singing praises to the Buddha. The Pure Land School is one of the most popular of Buddhist schools and has still many believers today. See an example of the <a href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#amitabha">Larger Amitabha Sutra</a>.<BR>The <STRONG>Tiantai School</STRONG> 天台宗 (<i>Tiantai Zong</i>, jap.: <i>Tendai Sh<u>u</u></i>, kor.: <i>Ch'ontae Jong</i>) was founded by Zhiyi 智顗 (d. 597), basing on the <EM><a href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#lotussutra">Lotus Sutra</a></EM>. According to Zhiyi, the Buddha taught different Sutras during his lifetime. Because the early sermons, were too complicated for the mass, the Buddha relied on simplier &quot;Scriptures&quot; (<EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>gama</EM>, 
      chin.: <EM>ahan</EM> 阿含) to preach. Later on, he preached the elementary 
      <EM>v</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>ipulya</EM> "broad and equal" (chin.: 
      <EM>fangdeng</EM> 方等) sutras of the Great Vehicle, to end with the "Sutra 
      of Perfection of Wisdom" 
      (<EM>Praj</EM><EM><U>na</U></EM><EM>par</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>mit</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>-s</EM><EM><U>u</U></EM><em>tra</em>) and the <a href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#nirvana">Nirv<u>a</u>na</a> and Lotus Sutras. A central teaching of the Tiantai school is the Threefold Truth (<i>santi</i> 三諦): voidness of all things, temporariness of all phenomena, and the synthesis of emptiness and phenomenal existence as the truth of the mean or middle. The absolute mind embraces the universe in its entirety, small and huge things. To separate one's consciousness from worldy phenomena (<em>dharma</em>), spiritual concentration and 
      insight consiousness help to become aware of the non-existence of all 
      appearance and that all is a manifestation of the absolute mind. The 
      Buddha nature can even be found in inanimate things.<BR>Fazang 法藏 (d. 712) 
      founded the <STRONG>Garland School</STRONG> (Huayan,, jap. Kegon, kor.: Hwaòm) 華嚴宗, 
      basing on the <EM>Garland Sutra </EM>華嚴經. The empty phenomena are thought to arose simultaneously by themselves. The static principle (<EM>li</EM> 理) 
      and the dynamic phenomenon (<EM>shi</EM> 事; things and their appearance) 
      of the emptiness are interfused and mutually identified. No phenomenon can 
      exist independently and alone, all things depend on others and are 
      combined to a whole. This system of totality finally points to the Buddha 
      in the center.<BR>A very special school that renounced dogma, asceticism, 
      rites and the traditional monastery system, was the <STRONG>Chan 
      School</STRONG> 禪宗 (<i>Chan Zong</i>, jap.: <i>Zen Sh<u>u</u></i>, kor.: <i>Jòn Jong</i>; a term deriving from the Sanskrit word <em>dhyâna</em> "meditation, <EM>yoga</EM>"), founded by 
      Bodhidharma (chin.: Putidamo 菩提達摩; d. 524) and Huineng 慧能 (d. 713; see an 
      excerpt from his writing <A 
      href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#tanjing">"Altar Sutra" 
      <I>Tanjing</I></A>). The believers of Chan relied on riddles 
      (<EM>gongan</EM> 公案) and spontaneous actions to achieve enlightenment. 
      Because of the emptiness 
      (<EM>sh</EM><EM><U>u</U></EM><EM>nyat</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM>; chin.: 
      <EM>kong</EM> 空) of reality, the Buddha nature can only be apprehended by 
      intuition. Avoiding conscious thought, reality is expressed by silence or 
      negation of the object in mind. It was the Chan School that also developed 
      the worldwide known fighting techniques (<EM>gongfu</EM> 功夫, &quot;Kung-fu&quot;) in the Shaolin Monastery 少林寺. The spontaneity thought of Chan Buddhism is familiar to Taoism and the nature-near spontaneous action of the free individual. Chan monks also composed writings like the &quot;Green Cliff Records&quot; <i>Biyan Lu</i> 碧巖録, and the &quot;Gateless Pass&quot; <i>Wumenguan</i> 無門關.<br>
							Important branches of the Chan School are the <i>Caodong</i> School 曹洞宗, <i>Linji</i> School  臨濟宗.<br>
							The <strong>Idealistic School</strong> (<i>Faxiang Zong</i> 法相宗) was founded by the great pilgrim Xuanzang 玄奘 (d. 664) and based on the <EM>Mah</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><EM>y</EM><EM><U>a</U></EM><em>na-samgraha</em> &quot;Compendium of the Great Vehicle&quot; and the <i>Yogacarin</i> writings. According to the idealistic teachings, the external world is but a fabrication of our consciousness and does not really exist and is only an illusion. The five sensual consiousnesses like sight, hearing, and so on, are helped by the conscious mind, which forms conceptions out of the perceptions received from outside. A seventh consciousness is the thought center, and finally the storehouse consciousness, which stores and coordinates all the ideas reflected in the mind. This school did not survive the great persecutions of 845 AD.<br>
							Very little impact on the history of Chinese Buddhism had the <b>Sattyasiddhi School</b> (<i>Chengshi Zong</i> 成實宗) that was originally a Theravada school but was oriented to Mahayana by its explanation that Buddhahood can be attained by destroying the attachment to names, elements and emptiness. Its main writing is the <i>Sattyasiddhi-Shastra</i>.<br>
							The<b> School of the Middle Path</b> (<i>Zhongdao Zong</i> 中道宗 or <i>Zhongguan Pai</i> 中觀派), is the Chinese branch of the Indian M<u>a</u>dhyamika School that seeks a middle way between two extremes like existence and non-existence, between emptiness and non-emptiness. The most important representatives of this school were Buddhap<u>a</u>lita (chin. Fohuo佛護; d.540) and Candrak<u>i</u>rti (chin. Yuecheng 月稱, d. 650).<br>
							A branch of the Madhyamika School is the <b>Three Treatise School</b> (<i>Sanlun Zong</i> 三論宗). The most important representative is Jizang 吉蔵 whose thought bases upon the three treatises <i>Zhong Lun</i> 中論, <i>Shiermen Lun</i> 十二門論, and <i>Bai Lun</i> 百論, all writings that deeply influenced the Chinese Tiantai and Huayan Schools.<br>
							Less important are the two vinaya schools <i>Jielü Zong</i> 戒律宗 and <i>Nanshan Zong</i> 南山宗, the Nirvana School (<i>Niepan Zong</i> 涅槃宗), and the School of Consciousness (<i>Weishi Zong</i> 唯識宗).

<span class="head"><A name=tibet>Tibetan and Mongolian Buddhism 
      (Lamaism)</A> <a href="#top"><img src="../../Eidola/up.jpg" border="0"></a></span><br><br><IMG 
      src="TantrafigurSmall.JPG" width=125 
      align=right><BR>The native religion of Tibet is the so-called Bon 
      religion, a belief in spirits, demons and ghosts in nature, that can bring 
      good and evil. Sorcery and <a href="../../History/Terms/fangshu.html">magic</a> were influential instruments of Tibetan 
      religion. Buddhism was introduced into Tibet during the 7th century by a 
      Tantric master named Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpotche), but it was only 
      during the 11th century that Buddhism gained a real foothold in Tibet. The 
      resulting religion was Lamaism (tibetan <EM>bla-ma</EM> means 
      "Superior"), that is Tantric Buddhism mixed with a good portion of the Bon 
      religion. A special feature of Lamaism is that abbotship of a monastery is 
      inheritable, thus creating monastery dynasties. When the Tibetans 
      submitted to the Mongols during the 13th century, the nomadic people was 
      quite ready to replace their shamanism by the the more subtle and 
      systematized magic of Tibetan Buddhism. <BR>Tantric Buddhism, also called 
      Tantray<U>a</U>na, Mantray<U>a</U>na or Vajray<U>a</U>na (<EM>vajra</EM> 
      means "thunderbold" or "diamond", chin.: <EM>jingang</EM> 金剛), in the West 
      sometimes called "Diamond Vehicle", is a third confession of Buddhism. 
      According to Tantrism, freeing from ignorance is possible by esoteric 
      consecration, diving into the cosmic relations. Magic spells are of great 
      importance to defend oneself from evil and temptation. <EM>Tantra</EM> 
      (chin.: <EM>mi</EM> 密 "secret", jap.-chin.: <EM>shingon</EM> 真言 "true 
      words"), esoteric literature, borrows many items from Hindu mythology but 
      gives them a new meaning. Gods and their females counterparts are symbols 
      of function, energy and will of the universe. Four kinds of instruments 
      help to transform knowledge into action: <EM>Mantras</EM> (chin.: 
      <EM>zhou</EM> 咒) like the famous "<EM>om mani padme hum</EM>" (Oh, the 
      jewel in the lotus!) are mystic syllables sometimes without real meaning, 
      are seen as a shortcut to enlightenment (see an example of a <I>mantra</I> 
      in the <A href="../../Literature/Diverse/lotussutra.htm#heart">Heart 
      Sutra</A>). <EM>Mandalas</EM> (chin.: <EM>ti</EM> 體) are cosmograms, a 
      picture of the universe with all its deities and beings, easily being 
      destroyed to show the vanity of what the five senses feel. <EM>Mudras</EM> 
      (chin.: <EM>yin</EM> 印) are gestures by a particular position of hand and 
      fingers, showing words without sound. <EM>Abishekas</EM> (chin.: 
      <EM>huanding</EM> 頂) are sacraments like baptization and yoga practices. A 
      special yoga practice is the <EM>unio mystica</EM> or sexual unification 
      of a priest symbolizing a deity and a virgin, showing his counterpart. 
      Only known in Tibetan Buddhism are the prayer mill, prayer flag, while 
      prayer rosaries are also known to Chinese Buddhism. Depictings of Tantrist 
      deities show a god and his corresponding goddess, like the Bodhisattva 
      Avalokiteshvara (tibet.: Chenresi) and the female Tara-Dolma. Another kind 
      of presentation in Tantrism is the emanation of a deity, that means that 
      above the head of Buddha or the god of death appear heads of the deity 
      itself, - the Buddha is multiplied, having eleven watching heads and 
      thousand helping arms. The counterpart deity of Bodhisattva 
      Ma<U>n</U>jushri is Yamantaka, the god of death. Tibetian Buddhist art 
      makes use of rolled pictures, called <EM>thanka</EM>, that are rolled out 
      during festivities and then cover a whole mountain slope. In proper China, 
      Tantrism could only flourish for a short time during the 8th century, and 
      was ostracized because of the obscenity of its secret cults.<BR>The head 
      of Tibetian Lamaism is the Dalai Lama, a title granted to the head of the 
      Yellow Cap sect by the Mongols who helped the Tsong-ka-pa to reform 
      Tibetian Buddhism and to fight against the old Red Cap sect. The second 
      highest person is the Panchen Lama, the third is the Karmapa who belongs 
      to another school.

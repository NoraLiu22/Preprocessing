/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 49]]</font> Mr. A. W. 
          Bennett's article entitled &quot;The Theory of Natural Selection from a Mathematical 
          Point of View,&quot; contains several criticisms on my own writings, and 
          touches on some points which have not yet been fully discussed. I propose, 
          therefore, to reply to such of these as appear to be of sufficient importance. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first objection brought forward (and which had 

          been already advanced by the Duke of Argyll) is, that the very title 

          of Mr. Darwin's celebrated work is a misnomer, and that the real &quot;origin 

          of species&quot; is that spontaneous tendency to variation which has not 

          yet been accounted for. Mr. Bennett further remarks, that throughout 

          my volume of &quot;Essays&quot; I appear to be unconscious that the theory I advocate 

          does not go to the root of the matter; and this unconsciousness is not 

          apparent only, for I maintain, and am prepared to prove, that the theory, 

          if true, does go to the root of the question of the origin of species. 

          The objection, which, from its being so often quoted and now again brought 

          forward, is evidently thought to be an important one, is founded on 

          a misapprehension of the right meaning of words. It ignores the fact 

          that the word &quot;species&quot; denotes something more than &quot;variety&quot; or &quot;individual.&quot; 

          A species is an organic form which, for periods of great and indefinite 

          length as compared with the duration of human life, fluctuates only 

          within narrow limits. But the &quot;spontaneous tendency to variation&quot; is 

          altogether antagonistic to such comparative stability, and would, if 

          unchecked, entirely destroy all &quot;species.&quot; Abolish, if possible, selection 

          and survival of the fittest, so that every spontaneous variation should 

          survive in equal proportion with all others, and the result must inevitably 

          be an endless variety of <i>unstable forms</i>, no one of which would 

          answer to what we mean by the word &quot;species.&quot; No other cause but selection, 

          has yet been discovered capable of perpetuating and giving stability 

          to some forms and causing the disappearance of hosts of others, and 

          therefore Mr. Darwin's book, if there is any truth in it at all, has 

          a logical claim to its title. It shows how &quot;species,&quot; or stable forms, 

          are produced out of unstable spontaneous variations; which is certainly 

          to trace their &quot;origin.&quot; The distinction of &quot;species&quot; and &quot;individuals&quot; 

          is equally important. A horse or a number of horses, as such, do not 

          constitute a species. It is the comparative <i>permanence</i> of the 

          form as distinguished from the ass, quagga, zebra, tapir, camel, &amp;c.,<i> 

          </i>that makes them one. Were there a mass of intermediate forms connecting 

          all these animals by fine gradations, and hardly a dozen individuals 

          alike--as would probably be the case had selection not acted--there 

          might be a few horses, but there would be no such thing as a species 

          of horse. That could only be produced by some power capable of eliminating 

          intermediate forms as they arise, and preserving all of the true horse 

          type, and such a power was first shown to exist by Mr. Darwin. The origin 

          of varieties and of individuals is one thing, the origin of species 

          another.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bennett next discusses the phenomena of &quot;mimicry,&quot; 

          and proposes to show, by mathematical calculations, that the effects 

          could not be produced by natural selection. But, at the very outset, 

          he makes an important error, which seriously affects his subsequent 

          reasonings; for he leads his readers to understand that there is only 

          one completely mimicking species of <i>Leptalis</i>, while the majority 

          are of the normal white-butterfly type. The fact is, however, that but 

          few species of <i>Leptalis</i> retain the simple colouring of their 

          allies the Pierid&aelig;, while the great majority are either coloured 

          like the Heliconid&aelig;, or show a considerable amount of colour or 

          marking in that direction. He is also apparently unaware that some Heliconid&aelig; 

          (<i>Ithomia eurimedi&aelig;, </i>for example) approximate in colour 

          to the normal white and yellow species of <i>Leptalis</i>, and thus 

          renders it much less difficult to understand how a sufficient amount 

          of variation in colour might occur at a first step, to produce a resemblance 

          which, viewed at some considerable distance, would be deceptive, and 

          therefore useful.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We next come to the demonstration by means of figures, 

          and we here find still more serious errors. Mr. Bennett says, that supposing 

          a <i>Leptalis </i>may vary in twenty different ways, one only being 

          the direction required,-- &quot;the chance of any individual producing a 

          descendant which will take its place in the succeeding generation varying 

          in the required direction, is 1/20; the chance of this operation being 

          repeated in the second generation is 1/20<sup>2</sup> = 1/400; the chance 

          of this occurring for ten successive generations is 1/20<sup>10</sup>, 

          or about one in ten billions;&quot; whence it is concluded that there are 

          overwhelming chances against any progressive variation in the right 

          direction ever taking place. But first, I do not admit the assumption 

          that only one variation out of twenty would be in the right direction; 

          when it is remembered how great is the variety of the Heliconid&aelig;, 

          both in colour and marking. It seems more likely that one-fourth or 

          one-third at least would help to approximate to some of them, and thus 

          be useful. Taking, however, Mr. Bennett's own figures, there are three 

          great oversights in this one short sentence. The first is, that each 

          <i>Leptalis</i> produces, not one only, but perhaps twenty or fifty 

          offspring; the second is, that the right variation has, by the hypothesis, 

          a greater chance of surviving than the rest; and the third, that at 

          each succeeding generation the influence of heredity becomes more and 

          more powerful, causing the chance of the right variation being reproduced 

          to become greater and greater.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now with these three modifications the weight of 

          the argument is entirely destroyed; for, allowing the <i>Leptalis</i> 

          to produce only twenty offspring (a small number for a butterfly), the 

          chances become even that one out of the twenty varies in the right direction. 

          But nineteen out of the twenty, on the average, are soon killed off 

          by the various causes that keep down the population of the species, 

          and the chances are very much in favour of that one surviving which, 

          by the hypothesis, has varied in the right direction. It is not pretended 

          that this one would survive always, or even on the average, but in a 

          large number of cases it would certainly do so; and taking Mr. Bennett's 

          own estimate of a million individuals as the population of a rare species, 

          we may fairly estimate that in a quarter, or say even in a tenth part 

          of these, the surviving offspring would possess the favourable variation. 

          But now a new factor enters into the problem, of which Mr. Bennett takes 

          no account. Those that have already varied tend to leave offspring varying 

          in the same direction as themselves; and as these will all have advantage, 

          the offspring of the one-tenth will increase at the expense of those 

          of the nine-tenths; and this tendency being still more powerful in the 

          third generation, with the additional advantage as the numbers increase 

          of the chance of both parents being favourable varieties, we may fairly 

          expect the favourable to have completely exterminated the unfavourable 

          variations, and to have firmly established themselves as a well-marked 

          race. The enormous possible rapidity of multiplication, enabling a pair 

          of individuals to produce millions in a few generations; the survival 

          of the fittest, giving to favourable variations--not their bare numerical 

          chance, as Mr. Bennett supposes, but--a certainly in the long run of 

          living at the expense of the rest; and the powerful influence of heredity, 

          which actually increases the <i>tendency</i> to produce the favourable 

          variations with each succeeding generation,--are three of the main foundation-stones 

          of the theory of natural selection, yet all three are ignored in this 

          attempted mathematical demonstration of its insufficiency.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one other point in the theory of the origin 
          of &quot;mimicry&quot; that deserves notice. It is, that the modifications leading 
          to it are much more easy to explain than <font color="990000">[[p. 50]]</font> 
          those leading to new genera and families, because the changes effected 
          are wholly superficial and are almost entirely confined to colour. Now 
          colour is both more variable than any other character, and is less intimately 
          correlated with structure, so that great changes of colour may rapidly 
          occur without in any other way affecting the individual, as we see in 
          almost all our domestic animals. Experiments in breeding show that very 
          large spontaneous variations of colour are frequent in insects; and 
          thus the number of steps to produce a required amount of change may 
          be much fewer than in cases of structural modification, in which every 
          other part of the organism has to be coordinated to work harmoniously 
          with the modified organ. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may here take the opportunity of denying that 

          I have argued, as Mr. Bennett says I have, that &quot;an infinitesimal and 

          inappreciable distinction may make the difference of a slightly longer 

          span of life being allowed to the butterfly to lay its eggs in safety;&quot; 

          and I cannot imagine how he could have imputed to me anything so absurd. 

          What I have maintained is, that for natural selection to act, either 

          in producing &quot;mimicry,&quot; or structural changes, no large or special variations 

          are required, because the usual amount of <i>variability</i> which occurs 

          in every part of every organism is sufficient. (&quot;Contributions,&quot; pp. 

          287-291.) But so far from supporting this to be &quot;infinitesimal&quot; or &quot;inappreciable,&quot; 

          I show that it is so palpable and so readily appreciated by horticulturists 

          and breeders as to have enabled them to produce all the wonderful variety 

          in our domestic animals and cultivated plants. And every entomologist 

          knows that similar variability exists in insects, and that the constantly 

          occurring variations of colour are especially great.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bennett next returns to the laws of variation, 

          and, because Mr. Darwin says that we are profoundly ignorant of these 

          (although he himself has done so much to elucidate them), maintains 

          that we cannot really know anything of the origin of species. As well 

          might it be said that, because we are ignorant of the laws by which 

          metals are produced and trees developed, we cannot know anything of 

          the origin of steamships and railways. Spontaneous &quot;variations&quot; are 

          but the materials out of which &quot;species&quot; are formed, and we do not require 

          to know how the former are produced in order to learn the origin of 

          the latter. But though we may not know the laws which determine each 

          variation in detail, the general causes which lead to variation are 

          not difficult to perceive. We do not know all the laws and causes that 

          have given their peculiar form to each mountain or each valley, but 

          we know a good deal of the general causes which have produced them, 

          and we can perceive that the reason no two are exactly alike is, the 

          number and complexity of the causes and the endless variety of conditions 

          under which these causes have acted. In the far more complex operations 

          of the development and growth of organisms, affected as we know they 

          are by almost infinitely numerous and ever varying external and internal 

          causes, it would be a much greater mystery if there were no variations, 

          and if absolutely identical forms were produced by constant diversity 

          of conditions. Even the successive offspring of the same parents are 

          developed under very different conditions. At each succeeding year, 

          and at every different period of each year, the parents have changed 

          in age, in size, in vigour, health, and constitution; they may be living 

          in a different locality, have different food, and be subjected to every 

          different physical and mental influences. Add to this the effect of 

          cross unions of distinct individuals, each with its own characteristic 

          peculiarities, which are in varying degrees transmitted to the offspring; 

          and further, that these modified offspring are submitted to a somewhat 

          different set of conditions from the parents, and intercross perhaps 

          with a distinct set of individuals; and add the effects of atavism in 

          bringing up long ancestral characters, and it can hardly be said that 

          the almost universal fact of &quot;spontaneous variation&quot; is quite unaccounted 

          for. But as I have already remarked, this variability could never by 

          itself produce <i>species</i>, but must absolutely prevent their production 

          without the eliminating, accumulating, and fixing powers of selection, 

          multiplication, and heredity.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mr. Bennett's concluding passages he advances 

          a theory of his own on the subject of &quot;mimicry,&quot; to the effect that 

          it is connected with intelligence or instinct, &quot;and runs almost <i>paripassu</i> 

          with the development of the nervous system.&quot; In support of this view 

          he asserts that it is &quot;strongly developed in birds.&quot; This is erroneous. 

          In birds it is very rare, only two or three cases being known, and these 

          not nearly so remarkable as hundreds that occur in insects; and in mammalia, 

          with the exception of one doubtful case, it is absolutely unknown. This 

          view, therefore, is directly opposed by the facts.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have only one more point to notice, a charge of 

          inconsistency against myself. Mr. Bennett quotes me to the effect that 

          man's chief peculiarities of form and structure were developed before 

          his intellect had raised him above the condition of the brutes, and 

          also <i>imputes</i> to me the belief that certain peculiarities in his 

          structure (the absence of hair on his body, for example) &quot;must have 

          been in some way connected with <i>his</i> reasoning powers.&quot; But this 

          is Dr. Laycock's view, which I have expressly repudiated, and I have 

          never used a word to show that I believed that man has modified his 

          own structure in any important degree, by the conscious or unconscious 

          exercise of his reasoning powers. I have, it is true, declared my belief 

          that &quot;some intelligence&quot; has acted on him, but I have also, I think, 

          made it quite clear that I did not believe it to be his own intelligence. 

          The inconsistency, therefore, is of Mr. Bennett's making.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have now noticed the chief points in this 

          last assault on the theory of Natural Selection, which has failed, like 

          all preceding ones. Its author also exhibits the usual inability to 

          keep steadily before him the great fundamental principles of the theory 

          he is discussing, so that his arguments continually break down owing 

          to his taking a partial and wholly inadequate view of its mode of operation. 

          In the case of &quot;mimicry&quot; he is not sufficiently careful in his statement 

          of the facts, and this, combined with his imperfect grasp of the theory, 

          entirely neutralises the elaborate numerical proofs which at first sight 

          appear so overwhelming.</p>

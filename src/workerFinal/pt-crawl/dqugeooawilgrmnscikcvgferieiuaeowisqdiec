<P>Alexander Vladimirovich Varlamov was born on June 19th, 1904 in Simbirsk
(now Ulyanovsk) in a musicians and actors family. One should note, that
some celebrated representatives of theatrical and musical professions were
also among his ancestors: his great-grandfather, Glinka's contemporary
A.E.Varlamov, a famous Russian composer, and one of his grandfathers -
K.A.Varlamov - a well-known actor of St.Petersburg Alexandrine theatre.
The future jazzman's mother was an opera singer, so such a heredity told
much on young Varlamov's choice of profession. In 1922 he entered the Moscow
GITIS&nbsp; actors faculty, but his attraction to music appeared to be
stronger as in 1926 he leaves the previous place for the Gnesins musical
college. That was just the time of Jack Wilters' jazz band tour to Moscow,
and Varlamov visited one of its concerts. He had already became familiar
with Parnach's jazz style before. And as a result he began to pay much
more attention to new musical instruments, principles of jazz arrangement
and playing manner, in a word, was really captivated with jazz.

<P>In 1930 Alexander Varlamov organized the "First modern variety vocal
quartett" ("Pervokse" in Russian abbreviation). The posters announced "musical
humouresques, songs, satyre and news of the day" being in programme. Successfully
finishing his study, Alexander Varlamov receives a conductors' diploma
and assembles an instrumental band which performed first time in 1934 at
the Moscow Red Army park' Green theatre after 14 month rehearsals and was
a huge success. Note that Varlamov's orchestra specialisation at that time
were various tangos, what could seem a bit strange. Soon, however, the
ensemble changed radically, as trumpets, trombone, and saxophones were
added. The new collective played music of foreign composers as well as
dance pieces created by the bandleader himself. Celestine Cool, the black
singer then working in the USSR, became the soloist of the first orchestra's
programme. Varlamov composed the "Yellow Rose" waltz-boston and "Lullaby"
rumba exclusively for her, and, supplied with suitable English texts, they
were immediately put on a disk in 1934.

professionalism, good taste and musicality marked Alexander Varlamov's
jazz unlike many of its contemporaries. Within the big band the smaller
collective, which one can now call the soloists ensemble, was organized.
The first Soviet jazz improvisators showed their art there - saxophonist
A.Vassil'ev, P.Boriskin and V.Bykov, the trumpet-players, O.Khvedkevich,
the drummer. In 1938 the septet made a series of records, where jazz was
treated in a virtuous manner similiar to this of Nat Gonella and Joe Donaldson
bands in England, or "Hot Club de France" jazzmen groups in pre-war France.
These recordings, particularly

 became the classical examples of Soviet
jazz' brilliant era. Also in 1938 the whole orchestra visited the recording
studio with a number of Varlamov's own compositions and foreign pieces
in his arrangements, such as
 <B>"Wee Hours"<A HREF="real/47.ram"><IMG SRC="pics/logos/ra.gif" ALT="Play in a RealAudio format" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=25 WIDTH=46 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></A></B>,

 In a half of them the bandleader's voice is clearly
heard. But not a word about the singer's name was noted on the record labels.
The cause was Varlamov's own wish, as he regarded the voice as an instrumental
colouring, never considering its inclusion in a dance composition being
an important thing.

Vladimirovich Varlamov became the first leader of the All-Union Radio Commitee'
jazz orchestra in 1938. Only two recordings of this orchestra were made at that
time:
 <B>"Jolly Hour"<A HREF="real/51.ram"><IMG SRC="pics/logos/ra.gif" ALT="Play in a RealAudio format" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=25 WIDTH=46 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></A></B> (P.Tomlin),

 He had created the superb orchestral groups, learned
them to play complicated swing passages and riffes, did his best to reach
a refined sonority balance. He passed on an experienced collective that
had already achieved a good ensemble to his successor <A HREF="tsfasman.html">A.Tsfasman</A>
in 1939. An original, intonationally new type of jazz music had been worked
out under Varlamov's leadership. It was here where the new musical thinking
has taken its first shape, forming a true basis of the quite new playing
style developed by the new generation of the Soviet jazz musicians of the
1950s. And if one is going to appraise Varlamov's orchestal art, then his
main desert is that he had laid the fundament of the Soviet jazz-performing
school.

<P>Alexander Varlamov was also busy with jazz studies with amateur musicians.
In 1939 he had trained a jazz band of Moscow Bauman college students, that
appeared to sound so fine, that it was invited to play at the "Nationale"
cafe, known for its high musical reputation.

<P>Varlamov gave much energy to the further development of the USSR State
jazz orchestra, and who knows, what heights could have been reached by
this collective, if there were no war... These four sides

expected to be presented in July 1941 can prove it.

<P>Preparing to move to the North Front, A.Varlamov organized the "Melody-orchestra",
that consisted mainly of bow instruments, also including two pianos and
a drum section. As Varlamov himself had noted, that was the best band he
had ever led.

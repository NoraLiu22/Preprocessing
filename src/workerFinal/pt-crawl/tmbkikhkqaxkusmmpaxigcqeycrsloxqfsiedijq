</p>

<p>
The Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) currently has twenty-eight organisational members.  Given that they are motivated enough to join the DPC, it will come as no surprise that they also tend to be actively involved in a whole range of interesting digital preservation projects.  Details of these are available from 
&lt;<a href="http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/join/projects.html">http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/join/projects.html</a>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
However, the very size and diversity of these projects can also make it difficult to keep up to date with what's happening and to become aware of what is potentially of value to similar work, so the DPC has developed a new format aimed at highlighting individual projects likely to be of general interest.  From January 2006, we are featuring an individual DPC member's project, using an interview format.  The first of these is SHERPADP, a project led by the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS).  The project is investigating cost effective methods of incorporating digital preservation into institutional repositories.  
</p>

<p>
The interview with Andrew Wilson, AHDS Preservation Services and Projects Manager, is available at
&lt;<a href="http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/join/sherpa.html">http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/join/sherpa.html</a>&gt;
</p>

<p>
The intention of the series is to profile the work of individual DPC members and to present enough detail to provide interested individuals with answers to questions they may want to ask about specific projects, with a link to further information via the project website.  This is a way of complementing more formal mechanisms, such as DPC Forums and Briefing meetings, which include presentations from particular projects in the programmes, and also the current awareness bulletin <i>What's New in Digital Preservation?</i> (<a href="http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/whatsnew/">http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/whatsnew/</a>), which provides a general summary of activities and events.

<p>
The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) invites application from scholars who have received their doctorates in any discipline in the Humanities to apply for its 2006 Postdoctoral Fellowship in Scholarly Information Resources. The program, now in its third year, seeks to provide humanists with an intensive, intellectually rigorous introduction to the issues facing libraries, archives, and institutions of higher learning as they meet the exciting challenges produced by increased reliance on and integration of digital scholarly research tools. The goal of the program is to encourage new scholars to investigate and gain experience in those areas that offer opportunities to develop meaningful linkages between disciplinary scholarship, libraries, archives, and evolving digital tools. A full description of the fellowship is available at &lt;<a href="http://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/postdoc.html">http://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/postdoc.html</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>
The genesis of the fellowship program was a growing awareness among library directors, scholars, and teaching faculty that, in the digital era, it is increasingly important that librarians and scholars become active collaborators in developing effective approaches to the interrelated domains of knowledge production and knowledge stewardship. Such collaboration ensures preservation of and enables broadened access to a wide range of research materials and primary sources; allows students to benefit from the ever-increasing range and types of materials available to them; encourages inter-departmental partnerships in curricular development; and assures the integration of campus libraries and collections into the teaching missions of higher education.
</p>

<p>
Fellows begin their appointments with an intensive two-week seminar at Bryn Mawr College, where participants are introduced to the history of and current challenges facing librarianship and higher education. The seminar includes presentations by leaders of related professions, and tours, workshops, and presentations at the Library of Congress. Fellows spend one to two years at a participating institution working on specific projects and on various issues facing libraries, archives, special collections, and digital resources; fellows are also required to attend monthly synchronous virtual seminars and lectures with guest speakers and to maintain a professional portfolio of their work.  Fellows have been placed at Yale University, Bryn Mawr College, Lehigh University, University of Virginia, Princeton University, University of Alabama, North Carolina University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Johns Hopkins University, and University of Southern California. The five sponsoring institutions offering fellowships in 2006 are North Carolina University Libraries; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the Johns Hopkins University; the University of Nebraska at Lincoln; and the University of Virginia. Fellowship positions vary; details on each are available at &lt;<a href="http://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/postdoc.html">http://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/postdoc.html</a>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
To date, the program has awarded 17 fellowships that have led to a range of successful collaborations between librarians, archivists, the fellows, and teaching faculty. Fellows have gone on to an assortment of career paths. For example, Megan Norcia spent her fellowship year at Lehigh University working with Special Collections and the Digital Library Team there to create the <i>"I  remain," A Digital Archive of Letters, Manuscripts and Ephemera</i> project. She worked with faculty members in several disciplines to implement use of the archive in the classroom and supported instructional technology efforts, participated in the information literacy initiative, and presented at and attended faculty development sessions. Ms. Norcia is currently an assistant professor of children's and young adult literatures at SUNY Brockport where she is building alliances with library and technology services for a project on the use of archival children's picture books and the student production of original illustrations for stories by children. Patricia Hswe, a specialist in Slavic and East European Studies, is in the second of her two-year fellowship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where her work includes the development of a database-driven inventory of Slavic,  East European, and Eurasian digital projects, and the digitization of the Zdenka and Stanley B. Winters Collection of Czech and Slovak Posters, 1920-1991. Her work on the latter includes constructing metadata about the posters, working on the resolution of copyright issues, developing a Web site that addresses the different subject areas of the posters, and maintaining a blog on Czech and Slovak posters. Ms. Hswe is simultaneously pursuing a Master's of Library and Information Science at the Graduate  School of Library and Information Science at UIUC. We encourage potential applicants and colleagues in the profession to view examples of fellows' work at &lt;<a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/clirfellows/participants.htm">http://www.brynmawr.edu/clirfellows/participants.htm</a>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Applicants for the CLIR Postdoctoral Fellowship must have received their Ph.Ds in a field of the humanities within the last five years. The deadline for application is February 24, 2006.

<H4>The University of Pittsburgh Announces Establishment of Minority
Health Archive</H4>

<p>January 6, 2006 - &quot;The University of Pittsburgh's Center for Minority
Health (CMH) of the Graduate School of Public Health (GSPH) and the
University Library System (ULS) have joined to develop the Minority
Health Archive (MHA) as an online repository for minority health documents.... &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The MHA takes full advantage of the latest information technology being
used by the University of Pittsburgh Library System. In addition to
being the first electronic archive devoted solely to minority health and
health disparity research, it has special features that allow
individuals outside of the university to post resources to the archive
for approval by the editors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The MHA is made possible by EPrints software, a tool for building
collections of digital documents. Through its 'author self-archiving'
feature, the software provides an easy way for registered users to
deposit a digital document in a publicly accessible Website at no cost
and in less than 10 minutes through a simple Web interface. Scholars can
use this software to disseminate research results rapidly and to foster
subject-specific collaborative global research communities. For more
information on EPrints, see &lt;<a href="http://www.eprints.org">http://www.eprints.org</a>&gt;.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information about the MHA, please see the full press release at &lt;<a href="http://newsbureau.upmc.com/Medsurg3/CMH-MHA.htm">http://newsbureau.upmc.com/Medsurg3/CMH-MHA.htm</a>&gt;.</p>

<H4>Health Awards for Libraries: January 31, 2006 Application Deadline</H4>

<p>December 20, 2005: &quot;The U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) announced today that applications continue to be submitted for the 2006 Health Awards for Libraries.  All libraries in the United States are eligible to submit an electronic application at &lt;<a href="http://www.nclis.gov/award/healthawards06.html">http://www.nclis.gov/award/healthawards06.html</a>&gt;.  Applications will be received through January 31, 2006.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The awards, to be presented in May 2006 at the National Library of Medicine, are designed to mobilize the resources of libraries to help citizens learn how to live healthy lifestyles and to provide citizens with consumer health information, particularly when they require information in a critical or unusual situation.  The 2006 NCLIS Health Awards will recognize libraries that excel in providing these resources.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A winner in each state will be determined by a panel of local judges selected by the state librarian.  From these state winners, ten finalist libraries will be chosen by a panel of NCLIS Commissioners.  Three recognized leaders in national policy on healthcare, Joseph Califano, Edward J. Hill and Louis W. Sullivan, will select the $20,000 grand prize winner. The other nine finalists will receive prizes of $1,000 each.&quot;</p>

<H4>DLF Aquifer Invites Public Review of Metadata Guidelines</H4>

<p>December 16, 2005 - &quot;The Digital Library Federation's Aquifer Initiative is
seeking public comment on a draft set of implementation guidelines for the
Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS). The guidelines will help
developers of digital collections of cultural heritage and humanities-based
scholarly resources create metadata records that can be easily exchanged and
shared, whether by the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata
harvesting (OAI PMH) or by other means.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Metadata are created to convey essential information about an electronic resource. The MODS guidelines pertain to descriptive metadata such at title,
author, or genre that help scholars and researchers find and identify needed
resources in digital library collections. At present, there are a handful of
descriptive metadata schemes in common use, but they are loosely defined and
are implemented in many ways. These variations reduce the effectiveness of
search and retrieval. The MODS guidelines aim to address this problem by
providing a limited set of suitable implementation choices for cultural
materials.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The guidelines include a general overview of requirements and
recommendations, advice concerning the attributes common to all MODS
elements, discussions of each element in the MODS 3.1 Schema, and seven full
examples of MODS records that meet these guidelines.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The draft guidelines are available at
<a href="http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/DLF_MODS_ImpGuidelines_ver4.pdf">http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/DLF_MODS_ImpGuidelines_ver4.pdf</a>. Comments are
due by January 20, 2006 and should be sent to  DLF-MODS-GUIDELINES-COMMENTS-L&#064;LISTSERV.INDIANA.EDU.&quot;</p>

<H4>NCLIS Study Recognizes New Roles for Libraries in Africa</H4>

<p>December 13. 2005 - &quot;The U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) today announced the publication of The Role of Libraries in HIV/AIDS Information Dissemination in Sub-Saharan Africa. The report is available on the NCLIS Web site (<a href="http://www.nclis.gov">http://www.nclis.gov</a>) and a limited number of print copies are available on request (info&#064;nclis.gov).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Believing that a key weapon in the battle against the HIV/AIDS pandemic is education and information targeted directly to the general public, especially young people, the Commission set the goal of this study to explore how information is &#150; or can be &#150; disseminated in parts of the world where the impact of HIV/AIDS has been the greatest, and the resources of the countries impacted have been the smallest.  Nowhere is information so crucial and nowhere is information for the general population so lacking as in Africa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because libraries in Sub-Saharan Africa do not exist in the same way that Western societies perceive libraries, a broad definition of libraries, including "library-like" institutions, was used to measure current and potential information dissemination centers. The recommendations of the report are intended to be general enough to apply to other developing countries, or even in parts of developed countries such as the United States &#150; wherever there are insufficient libraries and information institutions to meet the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse people.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information, the News Release can be also be viewed by linking to  &lt;<a href="http://www.nclis.gov/news/pressrelease/pr2005/2005-12LibrariesAfrica.pdf">http://www.nclis.gov/news/pressrelease/pr2005/2005-12LibrariesAfrica.pdf</a>&gt;.</p>

<H4>Introducing the Bibliocasting listserv</H4>

<p>December 9, 2005. Announced by Gerry McKiernan, Iowa State University.&quot;The bibliocasting listserv (bibliocasting&#064;listserv.syr.edu) is
dedicated to a discussion of streaming media in the library
environment. This list grows out of the increasing popularity of
"Podcasting," or the use of RSS and the Internet to download audio
programs (like audio blogs) to computers and MP3 players.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what to post on the list? Examples of how libraries can build on the
growing excitement of Podcasting; Questions on how libraries can use
podcasting and other multimedia information they create to promote
themselves and provide better service; Questions on how to podcast and
other technical questions on streaming media including QuickTime
Streaming, RealProducer,  and others. In addition, the list will
include postings of key articles, reports, and news about podcating and
other streaming media in general and in the the library context.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bottom Line: We are looking to build a community of individuals
interested in the application of multimedia in the library environment.&quot;</p>

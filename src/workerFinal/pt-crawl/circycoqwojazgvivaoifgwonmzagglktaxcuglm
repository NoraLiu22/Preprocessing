 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Aside from the noodly
solos and thirty-minute songs, jam bands are also noteworthy for their
unique business practices. The Grateful Dead and Phish, two pioneers of
this genre, both built innovative business models around their music.
These practices have evolved into an exceptional business model within
today&#8217;s thriving jam band community&#8212;one that is an expanding and
exciting market with the possibility of influencing a dramatic change
in the business practices of the ailing mainstream music industry. </font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">The very name of the
jam band genre has been the subject of much discussion. Some bands view
it as a musical boundary and try to distance themselves from it while
others embrace the style and push the limit. Whatever their perceptions
may be, a broad conjecture can be made that there are four defining
features of the music and bands that are categorized in this dynamic
and loosely defined genre. First and foremost, the artists are expert
musicians who have mastered their instruments and playing styles.
Second, these bands are marked by their relentless touring schedules,
often surpassing two hundred shows a year. This naturally lends itself
to the improvisation that is a hallmark of the live setting. Every
night, each song takes on new life as it is redefined through
improvisation. Next, the term arose from a need to categorize bands
that did not fit within other genres of popular music. According to
Dean Budnick, the senior editor of <i>Relix</i> magazine and the
person responsible for popularizing the term jam band, &#8220;their
willingness, their ability, [and] their propensity to cross genres&#8221;
defines jam bands. They do not fit within other styles, yet these bands
are influ-enced by, and create, music that draws from nearly all
genres. Finally, the taping policy of jam bands is perhaps the most
distinctive aspect of their business model and thus a defining
characteristic of the genre. While the specific terms vary from band to
band, jam bands generally encourage fans to record their live concerts
and trade them among other fans with the stipulation that no money is
exchanged. The mixture, to varying degrees, of these four features
loosely defines jam bands, a diverse musical culture that thrives upon
the live concert experience. These bands have ignored the traditional
record industry business model and created unique practices to form a
new model that is healthy and flourishing. As Carrie Lombardi,
president of Madison House Publishing, so aptly puts it, &#8220;Jam band
isn&#8217;t really a genre as much as it is an approach to music.&#8221; This
approach is distinguished by the same creativity and improvisation that
drives their noteworthy business practices. </font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Before the term existed, the
prototypical jam band that laid the groundwork for today&#8217;s jam band
community was the Grateful Dead. The preconceived notions surrounding
the Grateful Dead and their fans, Deadheads, are a hindrance in
attempting to comprehend their real impact on the music business. It is
important to look beyond their music and distinctive legacy to discover
that they developed a different way to do business. Their most
significant contribution was to let fans record and trade music freely.
Not only did tape-trading feed a fan base that was committed to sharing
the intellectual property of the Grateful Dead, but also &#8220;carved in
stone&#8221; a business practice that would be at the core of an active and
thriving music community over forty years later. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">In his article <i>Fear and
Norms and Rock &amp; Roll: What Jam Bands Can Teach Us About Persuading
People to Obey Copyright Law</i>, Mark F. Schultz, Assistant Professor
of Law at Southern Illinois University explores the business
contributions of the Grateful Dead. As Schultz explains, &#8220;[The Grateful
Dead] ran its own business very effectively, gaining a tremendous
amount of freedom and independence from the large amounts of income
generated by its endless touring&#8221; (Schultz 676). Traversing the nation
sev-eral times a year in their prime, the Grateful Dead would provide a
unique concert experience each night that relied heavily upon
improvisation. Fans soon began modeling their lives around the Grateful
Dead, their tour schedule, and community. It was much more than just
the music. Tape trading allowed fans to share their passion as they
captured each night&#8217;s unique performance&#8212;special moments in time that
happened once and would never happen again in quite the same way. John
Perry Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, explains how tape
trading was important to the Grateful Dead&#8212;how it fostered the Deadhead
community: </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">I think it is probably the
single most important reason we have the popularity that we have&#8230; [T]he
proliferation of tapes&#8230;formed the basis of a culture and something
weirdly like a religion&#8230;A lot of what we are selling is community. That
is our main product, it&#8217;s not music (McNally 386). </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">The generous and kind
community that evolved as a direct effect of the business practices of
the Grateful Dead is an attractive environment for a certain group of
music fans. These music fans respect the rules set forth by the band in
trading free music, yet they also actively support the band by buying
commercial releases, wearing band merchandise, and attending concerts. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">The Grateful Dead made
taping and trading a foundation for their business model. As Schultz
notes, fan recordings of live performances were available, but rare,
when the band started in the late 1960s. During this time the band
passively encouraged taping by allowing fans to plug right into the
soundboard. In the mid-70s the band officially condoned taping during
shows. By the mid-80s they realized the importance of taping to their
fan base and began the first ever tapers&#8217; section, typically behind the
soundboard at a venue, where tapers could get the best sound while not
interfering with the experiences of the non-taping fans. The Deadheads&#8217;
passion for capturing the best sound possible influenced their
enthusiastic consumption of new recording technologies. This community
was always quick to embrace new technologies such as cassettes, digital
audiotapes, CD burning, and the internet (as a forum to list and trade
tapes more easily). </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">If the Grateful Dead laid
the groundwork for the generous community and taping policy of jam
bands, Phish modernized the business prac-tices for a new generation.
Much like the Grateful Dead, Phish constantly toured, had a devoted
community of &#8220;phans,&#8221; and created innovative business practices by
interacting with those fans. Phish was a pioneer in recognizing the
need for high quality soundboard recordings of their live concerts. As
a result, they were among the first to release a series of live
soundboard-quality recordings in 2001&#8212;the LivePhish CD series
ultimately including twenty-three volumes. Apparently this did not
quench the fans&#8217; thirst for high quality recordings. In December of
2002, just days before Phish returned from hiatus, livephish.com was
launched as the first-ever web site to release a live
soundboard-quality recording of a concert within forty-eight hours of
the performance. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">The band was also among the
first to truly embrace the power of the internet as a virtual gathering
place for fans. Through the web, Phish polled fans for Halloween
musical costume ideas, accepted suggestions for versions of songs to be
included on <i>A Live One</i>, and, as early as 1990, created an email
list of fans. Phish used the internet unlike any other band before to
connect with fans. This was a grassroots, organic approach to culture
and to growing notoriety. These loyal fans on the internet increased
the social capital of the band. Fans created fan web sites, rumor
pages, message boards, email lists, subgroups within the fan base, and
maintained a comprehensive history of the band and its performances. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Phish used this special
connection with their fans to interact with them and use their feedback
to guide their business practices. For example, as Budnick
acknowledges, for several tours in the early years Phish merchandise
was primarily designed with the stylized and unique imagery of Jim
Pollock. The band began to notice that fans were more interested in the
lot-style shirts, unofficial merchandise created by fans often
incorporating song names in creative ways. Phish then began to
integrate more of this lot-style iconography into their official
merchandise so as to satisfy the desires of the fan base. Phish further
developed a reciprocal relationship with its fan base through
one-of-a-kind festivals, unique Halloween concerts, elaborate New
Year&#8217;s Eve performances, a tour-long chess match, and a secret language
between band and audience. The fans motivated these uncommon business
practices and Phish delivered while reshaping music business norms at
the same time. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2" color="#000000"><font size="+2"
 color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">As the pioneers of the jam
band genre, the Grateful Dead and Phish certainly did their part in
defining the virtuosic musicianship that is characteristic of the
style. Perhaps more importantly, they also laid the foundation for
business practices that continue to this day to foster a community
based on generosity. This contributes to the conclusions of Schultz,
&#8220;The jam band community has found a way to tap into reciprocity, thus
inspiring norms that are unusually supportive of the rights of
musicians&#8230;[through] loyal, sustained, and mutually beneficial
relationships between musicians and their fans&#8221; (Schultz 657). The
Grateful Dead and Phish are the founders of this genre and it is a
healthy and thriving alternative to a music business that is struggling
to step into the digital age. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1">The jam band scene has evolved and responded
to the post-Grateful Dead and post-Phish era. There is no longer a
single band that can claim the throne to the jam band world, rather
there exists a multifarious group of high quality bands consistently
touring the U.S. and abroad. Some bands can sell out arenas (although
not too frequently) while other bands stick to the local bar scene. The
music of today&#8217;s jam band scene has expanded into a rich and eclectic
mix of different styles and energies far beyond its hippie ancestry.
There are now several distinct genres within the jam band scene
including rock, jazz, electronica, bluegrass, reggae, folk, funk,
blues, fusion, and world music. This new era for jam bands, coupled
with the radically changing business environment of the music industry,
challenges today&#8217;s artists to push themselves musically and to develop
creative grassroots marketing campaigns. It appears this musical
community has got it figured out&#8212;close relationships among fans and
bands, the integral role of live performances, and business practices
that favor the interests of both the fans and the artists. When
performed live, the lyrics quoted at the beginning of this section from
Trevor Garrod, keyboardist of Tea Leaf Green, reveal that the most
important factor in this model is the music&#8212;a creative passion for
bands and fans. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1">The relationship between the band and the
audience cannot be denied as being at the core of this scene. The bands
feed off the audience both to create surreal live experiences and to
motivate their distinctive business practices. To properly understand
why the businesses of these bands oper-ate as they do, it is essential
to be familiar with the fans. The following is an analysis of jam band
fans&#8212;who they are, why they attend so many concerts, and the values
they share. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

mostly at concerts, on the internet, and at festivals. Through these
shared experiences jam band fans transmit the culture and values of the
scene to others. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">To further
investigate the jam band community, primary research was performed
through an online survey of fans, the results of which are included
throughout this analysis. This ten-question survey was posted on nine
different fan-created band message boards. A smaller portion of the
data was collected by direct email. The survey yielded 82 respondents,
making the study anecdotal, but nonetheless relevant and indicative of
general trends among the jam band community. The fans responded to the
survey with limited knowledge of its purpose. The compiled data reveals
some interesting trends. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Live jam
band concerts are the most frequent gathering place for fans. 97.5% of
respondents had seen at least one concert in the past three months,
with over 45% having attended eleven or more. The concert is a
commu-nity-based event where fans congregate outside the venue several
hours before and after the performance to interact with others. To
relate a personal experience that typifies the atmosphere of the jam
band community, after a concert in the summer of 2004 my friend and I
were sitting in the lot by our car talking to other fans. One person,
whom we had never met, gave us a high quality recording of the previous
night&#8217;s concert after talking with him for just two minutes. This fan
had nothing tangible to gain from going to the effort to make and
distribute recordings of the concert free of charge. He just wanted to
spread his joy and passion for the band. This experience also
illustrates how much this community has embraced newer technologies to
quickly distribute recordings. This experience is typical of jam band
shows; it creates a strong bond between fans. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">In fact, 84%
of those surveyed feel there is a connection between themselves and
other fans that like the same music; contrast this with the 63% who
feel a connection between themselves and the bands they like. Fans feel
a stronger connection to other fans than they feel with the bands they
enjoy. The fans perceive an increased value of a live concert because
they are getting much more than just the music&#8212;they also get a
community experience. Perhaps the words of a surveyed fan, written
under the username treywarren, best describe this connection, &#8220;That&#8217;s
one of the great parts about going to shows&#8230;Getting together with a
group of like-minded people for an event that 99% of the public
wouldn&#8217;t give a shit about. But that small group, whether it be 100,
1,000, or 5,000, &#8216;gets&#8217; what you get.&#8221; </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Nevertheless,
the connection between fans and the bands is still significant. Shultz
has made it clear that because jam bands operate outside of the
mainstream music business, it&#8217;s more likely they will interact with
their fans before or after the concert. The bands are not separated
from their fans by the industry middlemen found in the mainstream music
business. This fosters a special connection that promotes trust and
loyalty among fans. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

popularity of festivals has been steadily increasing in the past few
years. Of those surveyed, 84% attended at least one festival since
January, 2006. Festivals such as Bonnaroo, High Sierra, Langerado, and
Gathering of the Vibes range in diversity of lineup and in size&#8212;from
1,000 to 80,000 attendees. Bands even play host to their own festivals
such as moe.down, Camp Bisco, and Hookahville. The summer months are
typically festival season with temporary utopian cities springing up
across America for several days of music, community, and art. Attending
a festival has become almost a religious experience for fans, serving
as a pilgrimage of sorts. People travel great distances to remote and
beautiful locations to be with other fans and to share in the joy of
the music. In this religious context the music serves as a communal
event, perhaps analogous to Holy Communion among Christians. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

explains that the demographics of the jam band community are between
ages 16 and 40, more heavily within the 18 to 25 year old range. She
also points out that the fans are getting older as the bands they enjoy
are staying around longer. The heavy markets are major cities and
college towns&#8212;not unusual for any genre. The majority of survey
respondents indicated that they don&#8217;t hear music they like on
terrestrial radio. This encourages them to actively seek out music
through other means. The main ways grassroots jam band fans find new
music is by word of mouth (35%) and the internet (28%). These fans also
consume large quantities of recorded music with 82% having obtained six
or more live recordings in the past month. Lombardi explains, &#8220;The [jam
band] fans demand more music&#8230;[and] want every piece of music that their
favorite band makes.&#8221; </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

of obtaining several live recordings of a single band rather than a
smaller number from a wider variety of bands feeds the notion that the
more familiar a fan is with the music of a particular band, the more
enjoyable the live concert experience will be. Familiarity with the
music does not just mean knowledge of the songs&#8212;it&#8217;s about knowing the
many versions of songs, the changes in the band&#8217;s sound over the years,
and the set-list formation. For the jam band fan, it&#8217;s one experience
connecting community, tape trading, and live music. Also, the survey
respondents report enjoying many genres of music including (starting
with most popular) jam band/improvisational music, rock, bluegrass,
jazz, hip-hop, electronica, funk, reggae, and classic rock. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

of kindness is pervasive within the community. Due in part to the
direct and positive relations a band has with its fans, &#8220;Jam bands and
their fans have forged a unique community based on a mutual passion for
the music and reciprocal generosity, trust, and respect&#8221; (Shultz 675).
The reduced distance and perceived fairness of the bands contributes to
the fans&#8217; willingness to cooperate with, and even enforce, the taping
policies. This unique trusting relationship allows jam bands to pursue
business practices that the mainstream music industry would not and
could not achieve. These loyal fans are even concerned with preserving
and promoting the values of their community. Oftentimes when referring
to &#8220;the scene,&#8221; a fan is making a reference to fan-to-fan relations and
surprisingly, reference to the music is a smaller, yet still
significant, contributing factor. An example of promoting the values of
the community in the virtual world was reported in the July, 2005 issue
of <i>Relix</i> in which an entire article was devoted to message
board ethics in an attempt to raise awareness of the effect of message
boards on bands. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

not a great term for bands because they can play so many genres of
music, but it&#8217;s an accurate term for a fan because it&#8217;s those fans that
are willing to be open-minded and are willing to hear all this
different music. What I love about Yonder Mountain String Band is
totally different than what I love about the Slip and different than
what I love about the Disco Biscuits. But they&#8217;re all incredible
musicians. For [jam band fans], we embrace them the same. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

creativity and independence in their business practices. They operate
outside of the mainstream music industry that is still, in many ways,
trying to figure out what to do with the internet. This section
provides a close portrait of several business aspects of jam bands
including a look at the &#8220;total package&#8221; company, SCI Fidelity/Madison
House, founded by the String Cheese Incident to meet nearly every need
of both artists and fans. Other areas in this section include the
approach to a studio album, various forms of promotion, the influence
of festivals and a look at two important means of communication for jam
bands and their fans: <i>Relix</i> and the internet. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1">The type of business environment and
practices that String Cheese Incident wanted to create could not
operate under the traditional music industry model. This led to the
formation in 1998 of SCI Fidelity Records/ Madison House Inc., an
integrated business that provides services to accommodate the needs of
artists and fans on several levels. This partnership, which is a
separate entity from the band, increases communication and supports
increased creativity for a business that focuses on a grassroots
community. Its services include booking, management, a record label,
travel, ticketing, publicity, graphic design, and merchandise. Since
1998 it has grown to include a number of today&#8217;s jam bands on its
roster&#8212;a one-stop shop for jam bands and fans. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1">Carrie Lombardi suggests that this business
model can easily adapt to the rapidly changing market due to its
independence. The company understands the need for these bands to
create a unique connection with its fan base to help foster a loyal
relationship. Lombardi explains that the company tries to let the
relationship between the band and the fans grow organically. SCI
Fidelity/Madison House has developed business practices that are in
step with the trends of the genre, focusing on the importance of a
unique live experience, the mass consumption of live releases, and the
grassroots community of fans. An obvious way to encourage the
perception of fairness and the continued consumption of music is to cut
and control costs. One example of this is the marketing strategy of
creating buzz on the internet by advertising on message boards; the
company even has a message board on its own web site. Web advertising
can be a low-cost, effective marketing tool. The label has also
controlled the costs of making and distributing its albums, both live
and studio. The unique trust between fans and bands has permitted the
widespread use of digital distribution channels for live and studio
releases. Although the label does have a major distribution deal with
Ryko, the increasing number of digital downloads helps to control
costs. In 2003, SCI Ticketing even filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster
alleging antitrust violations. This was an attempt to gain more control
of the ticket prices and pass the savings on to the fans. As Lombardi
points out, &#8220;We can keep costs down and let the fans feel that through
cheaper concert tickets.&#8221; SCI Fidelity/Madison House is committed to
providing a total quality experience for fans. With String Cheese
Incident as the spirit of the company, festivals have been held in
beautiful locations with high-quality sound, lower-priced concert
tickets, and participatory artistic events for the fans. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1">The primary source of revenue for the
artists of SCI Fidelity/Madison House is touring. These bands don&#8217;t
have the benefit of using radio to sell records; instead they must tour
constantly. However, album sales do contribute to the revenue of bands
due to the much lower breakeven point. Lombardi even suggests that
sales of 50,000-100,000 units can be profitable if the costs are
controlled. SCI Fidelity Records differentiates itself further by not
having an artists &amp; repertoire department. Instead, all the people
who work at the company are also fans of the music who are always
searching for new talent either out in the community or by listening to
demos sent to the office. In discussing SCI Fidelity Records&#8217; approach
to studio albums, Carrie Lombardi comments on an important distinction
in the jam band business model. &#8220;SCI Fidelity is about the music. We
have never tried to stifle the artist&#8217;s creative vision, they are
allowed to make the album that they want.&#8221; </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1">The studio album is a common obstacle to jam
bands in that it&#8217;s difficult to capture the energy and creativity of a
live performance. In recording a studio album, some bands have used
unconventional methods in an attempt to capture this live aspect. For
example, the 2002 release from moe., <i>Wormwood, </i>featured an
interesting approach. The band laid down the rhythm tracks during their
summer 2002 tour with textures, solos, and vocals recorded at a later
time in the studio. The January 2006 issue of <i>Relix</i> reported
that moe. would attempt to capture this live energy again for their
2007 release entitled <i>The Conch</i>. The band recorded several
basic tracks of two live shows at the State Theater in Portland, Maine
to fully capture the complete performances. A special microphone, the
Holophone, captured the 360-degree ambience and reverberation of the
room. These tracks were then completed and mixed in the studio. Jam
bands experiment with ways to capture the strengths of both live and
studio recordings in their album releases. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1">As mentioned earlier, jam band fans do not
generally hear the music they enjoy on the radio. Radio is a difficult
medium for jam bands because these bands are typically not known for
the short, pop songs that commercial radio seeks. Some bands even claim
that producing radio-friendly songs has hurt their success within the
jam band community. As reported in the January 2006 issue of <i>Relix</i>,
Chan Kinchla of Blues Traveler asserts, &#8220;In the jam-fan world, we&#8217;re
still to this day paying penance for having a hit single. That&#8217;s
sacrilege&#8221; (47). Therefore radio promotion is naturally a much smaller
part of the jam band business model. Specialty shows on college or
public radio, and Sirius or Rhapsody, are outlets that these bands have
pursued to get some radio play. In the case of SCI Fidelity/Madison
House, radio promotion is an in-house operation. However, several other
bands use an independent radio promotion company, such as Powderfinger
Promotions or Leeway&#8217;s Home Grown Music Network. Leeway&#8217;s also serves
as a direct online distribution outlet for its artists. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1">One way that jam bands gain exposure and
build their fan base is by playing at music festivals. Jam band music
festivals have increased in importance in the post-Phish era with the
festival circuit often shaping a band&#8217;s summer touring schedule. The
festivals, such as Wakarusa, 10,000 Lakes, and All Good are several-day
experiences featuring diverse lineups, late night music, and bigger
names alongside local bands. As Ted Kartzman explains, &#8220;The festivals
are typically a cash cow for the bigger names, while the smaller bands
play for exposure and free entry.&#8221; The festival promoters have an early
application process for bands and seek to introduce their audience to
new and diverse music. Lombardi notes, &#8220;In the booking realm, the
festivals have become a priority for our bands.&#8221; Not only can festivals
spread the word faster about a new band, they also challenge sponsors
to create innovative ways to benefit the fans. This has resulted in
live webcasts of several festivals, faster recording of festival
performances, and other unique services. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><i>Relix</i>, the leading magazine for live
improvisational music, has a presence at, and provides coverage of,
several of these festivals. The magazine was founded in 1974 as a
newsletter for Grateful Dead tape-traders. It has now grown into an
eight-issue-per-year subscription magazine with an interactive web
site. Beginning with the February/March 2006 issue, <i>Relix </i>included
a free mix CD with each edition to help introduce readers to new music.
Dean Budnick, senior editor at <i>Relix</i> and founder of
jambands.com, acknowledges that <i>Relix</i> is the dominant source
for news about the premier bands. He also suggests that the magazine
acts as a filter in &#8220;distinguishing which bands are worth potential
fans&#8217; discretionary income.&#8221; Additionally, <i>Relix</i> has sponsored
this genre&#8217;s version of the Grammy Awards, the Jammy Awards, for the
past six years. The Jammy Awards are specifically designed to give
recognition to bands within the live and improvisational realm. The
Jammy evening includes several performances (with unique
collaborations) and award presentations for tour of the year and live
performance of the year among others. <i>Relix</i> is a formidable and
respected voice in the jam band community. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1">This past year, the Sixth Annual Jammy
Awards was produced concurrently with the Green Apple Music &amp; Arts
Festival, the largest Earth Day celebration in the United States. This
is representative of a trend within the jam band community toward
socially and environmentally conscious actions. With Hot Buttered Rum
traveling on a bio-diesel fueled tour bus and The String Cheese
Incident using their Gouda Causes to leave a posi-tive legacy in every
city through charity, performers in this genre try to funnel their
energy, and use music as a medium, to address greater issues. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1">Another means of communication within the
jam band community is the internet. The internet has become
increasingly popular for the marketing of bands, with 28% of fans
citing it as an ideal forum to learn about new music. The internet
carries enough significance for Budnick to claim, &#8220;The hallmark of one
of the bands that&#8217;s succeeding is not only that they&#8217;re doing well at
their shows, but clearly that they have a strong online community.&#8221;
This online community has several places to interact. Tape-trading
forums such as archive.org and etree.org give fans an opportunity to
interact around a forum for live recordings. People can also interact
on several band web sites, message boards, and genre-specific web
sites. Jambands.com, an online music source, provides daily news,
concert reviews, editorial articles, and surveys of the jam band
community. JamBase is a comprehensive live music web site that boasts a
tour date search engine of over 30,000 bands playing in over 50,000
venues worldwide, as their web site states. It also serves as a music
marketing and promotions company, which as Kartzman explains, was one
of the first sites to use targeted direct email marketing. JamBase uses
its database of over 400,000 registered users to send emails directly
to fans about their favorite bands. In many ways, internet promotion
has taken the place of radio promotion and has proven to be more
cost-effective and efficient. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1">Bands also frequently interact with their
fans through the internet. They offer discounted concert tickets and
exclusive downloads, and they receive suggestions for tour routes and
venues. Bands and their management listen to the voices of the fans
when making decisions, and the fans appreciate the opportunity to
participate in the conversation. This is an example of a unique
relationship where fans, band management, and artists work together to
create a special experience for all, whereas in the mainstream music
industry, management is often seen as greedy middlemen who exploit
artists and their fans. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">While the
jam band business model employs many creative innovations, there are
also much farther-reaching implications. The model is rooted in
permitting the free recording and trading of live concert recordings, a
defining aspect of the genre. This has evolved into a community that is
uniquely supportive of copyright law. Also, this post-Grateful Dead and
post-Phish era has seen an explosion of talented bands creating some of
the most relevant and exciting music today. Some of these bands have
evolved their sounds to incorporate more songwriting. This group of
bands has recently been identified as being among the first crop of a
new, distinguishable genre&#8212;post-jam, bands with a tighter focus on
songwriting that can still jam. With the release of their latest album,
<i>Eisenhower</i>, The Slip is among this freshman class. The jam band
genre is staying true to its roots and evolving at the same time. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">The social
norm of reciprocity, as described by Mark Schultz, is fundamental to
the jam band community. He suggests that this norm directly correlates
with jam band fans being willing to follow copyright law. The
mainstream music industry has had difficulty in finding solutions to
the increasing problem of copyright infringement. From suing music
consumers to installing illegal software on albums, very little has
worked. This growing problem is directly related to the widespread use
of digital media and the internet. So how has the jam band community
set up a culture that supports cooperation and persuades fans to
respect intellectual property rights? </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font
 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">To
paraphrase Shultz, the community has several features that support this
environment. The reduced social distance among all players&#8212; bands,
fans, and management&#8212;encourages cooperation. These bands are not seen
as distant, money-making rock stars, but more as hard-working, friendly
musicians. Another important feature is an increased perception of
fairness. Through their taping policies, jam bands generously give away
massive amounts of free music. Fans feel a loyalty to the band and are
compelled to support them. Fans support the bands by attending
concerts, buying merchandise, purchasing commercial releases, and
complying with the taping policies. In several cases, they even work
with management and the law to punish those who don&#8217;t follow the
policies. The majority of fans don&#8217;t want to steal music; they just
have to be given the opportunity to comply. This grassroots community
has made a conscious effort to involve fans at several levels of the
business, which supports active participation and encourages
reciprocity. The bands and labels do not assume the worst about music
fans; they encourage voluntary compliance. An emphasis is also placed
upon &#8220;building communities based on sustained relationships between
fans and bands&#8221; (Schultz 719). Through time, loyalty has developed. It
has grown organically into a community that is unique within the music
industry. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Despite all
the positive aspects of the jam band community, several bands do not
like some of its associations, and desire to branch out of the scene.
For example, The Slip formed in 1996 and built a dedicated following
through constant touring. The progression of live shows and album
releases has seen a transformation, so much so that the band&#8217;s web site
states the band has &#8220;been accused&#8212;perhaps appropriately&#8212;of changing
everything short of their name.&#8221; The progression has been from a
heavily jam-based, improvisational sound to a greater focus on
songwriting. Their latest album, <i>Eisenhower</i>, is targeted for an
audience outside of the jam band scene. The band wants to sell more
albums and become more known for songwriting than jamming. At the same
time, The Slip wants to retain the freedom of jam bands and still play
to its original, open-minded fans. As Ted Kartzman, former manager of
the band insists, &#8220;It was my feeling, as manager, that the jam band
fans are always going to be there if you give them what they want at
the shows. That is virtuosic musicianship&#8212;you play well, you play great
songs, and you do it night in and night out.&#8221; </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">The desire
to be a song-oriented band that can jam during live performance is not
uncommon. Bands such as Apollo Sunshine, the Benevento/ Russo Duo, My
Morning Jacket, and The Slip are all comprised of extremely talented
musicians who perform unique live concerts focused on both songwriting
and jamming. The idea that this group of bands is the beginning of the
post-jam genre was reported concurrently in <i>The Village Voice</i>
and the December/January 2007 issue of <i>Relix</i>. Post-jam is a
melding of indie rock and jam bands, two of the primary genres that
have recently been filling the lineups of festivals across the country.
While there is still a plethora of jam-heavy bands that embrace the jam
band moniker, this new breed offers an appealing innovative sound to
many listeners. It will be interesting to see if, and how, these bands
incorporate the practices of the jam band business model into their own
approaches. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

has embraced the trends and interests of the grassroots fan community
to develop unique practices that differ from the traditional music
industry model. Some of these innovative business practices should be
incorporated into the drastically changing environment of the
mainstream music industry. This model is healthy and thriving with
dedicated, trustworthy fans and passionate musicians. One of the
essential success factors has been the community-building fostered by
maintaining close relationships between fans and bands. Within this
community, it is clear that music has, and always will be, the number
one priority; the fans actively consume tremendous amounts of taped
live performances and commercial releases, and the bands are constantly
developing new and better ways for fans to access music. Interestingly,
unique characteristics of this community, such as reduced social
distance, increased perception of fairness, and reciprocity, persuade
fans to obey the copyright laws. The mutually beneficial relationship
between the bands and the fans is based on trust, loyalty, and
generosity. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

 size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Some bands have evolved to
be among the first post-jam groups, opening the door for continued and
more widespread innovation of the jam band business model. The genre is
changing and there are more bands trying to build a fan base. Although
creating a unique sound and building a fan base are difficult tasks, a
band with passion and talent has a good chance of success if it works
within the jam band business model. As Budnick argues, &#8220;Nowadays there
are so many bands out there that I think it&#8217;s much harder for a
developing act to come up and get the community support right now, as
of November 2006, but I think that the opportunities still are there
and that&#8217;s how bands within the scene thrive.&#8221; The mainstream music
industry, controlled by the four major labels, is suffering while it
struggles to incorporate the internet and digital media into its old
business model. The jam band model could save the traditional record
industry. The majors have an opportunity to develop innovative and
effective business practices similar to those found in the jam band
model. If this were to happen they might positively affect consumer
perceptions of the mainstream music industry and perhaps even save
their companies. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

      <h4>1. What is a salary cap? Why have one?</h4>

      <p>
        A salary cap is a limit on the amount teams can spend on player
        contracts, which helps to maintain competitive balance in the league.
        Without a salary cap, teams with deeper pockets could simply outspend the
        remaining teams for the better free agents. The basic idea behind a
        salary cap is that a team can only sign a free agent if its total payroll
        will not exceed the cap -- so a team with deep pockets is on a more level
        playing field with every other team.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this is true in theory, NBA teams in big markets nevertheless have
        been able to significantly outspend teams in small markets. For example,
        for the 2016-17 season (the final season under the previous CBA) the lowest
        team payroll was approximately $80.5 million<sup>1</sup> and the highest
        was over $127.5 million (plus an additional $27.3 million in luxury tax).
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, there is now a weak to moderate correlation between team
        payroll and regular season wins. For the 2016-17 NBA season the correlation
        coefficient<sup>2</sup> was about 0.35. It was much stronger in the past --
        for example, in 2010-11 (the last season under the 2005 CBA) the correlation
        coefficient was 0.53, indicating that deep-pocket teams were able, to a
        certain extent, to buy their way to success.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interestingly, this correlation was only 0.13 (nearly orthogonal) in the
        2001-02 NBA season. One possible explanation for this variation is the changes
        in the league's luxury tax and revenue sharing systems over time.

      <h4>2. What is a soft cap? What is the difference between a soft cap and a
          hard cap? Which does the NBA have?</h4>

      <p>
        The NBA has a soft cap. A hard cap cannot be exceeded for any reason. A 
        soft cap like the NBA's contains exceptions which allow teams to sign
        players or make trades that exceed the cap under certain conditions. In
        practice, few NBA teams are under the cap during a season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain components of the NBA's system function as a hard cap under
        specific circumstances. See question number <a href="#Q20">20</a>
        for more information.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q3" class="question">
      <h4>3. Why have a soft cap?</h4>

      <p>
        A soft cap promotes a team's ability to retain its own players. Nobody
        likes it when a player plays with one team his entire career, the fans
        love him, he wants to stay and the team wants to keep him, but he has
        to leave because the team cannot offer him a satisfactory contract. The
        exceptions under a soft cap provide the means for teams to keep players
        under these kinds of circumstances. In addition, they allow teams to
        make a limited number of changes (replacing departed players,
        improvements, etc.) every year.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q4" class="question">
      <h4>4. What is the Collective Bargaining Agreement?</h4>

      <p>
        It's the legal contract between the league and the players association
        that sets up the rules by which the league operates. (It's commonly abbreviated
        as "CBA," which is not to be confused with either the Chinese
        Basketball Association or the Continental Basketball Association. The
        abbreviation CBA will be used in the remainder of this document.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The CBA defines the salary cap, the procedures for determining how it is set,
        the minimum and maximum salaries, the rules for trades, the procedures for
        the NBA draft, and hundreds of other things that need to be defined in order
        for a league like the NBA to function.
      </p>

      <p>
        The CBA also prevents the NBA from being in violation of federal antitrust
        laws. Many of the league's practices (such as the salary cap and draft)
        would violate antitrust laws were they not agreed to via collective
        bargaining (see question number <a href="#Q118">118</a>).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q5" class="question">
      <h4>5. Has there always been a salary cap?</h4>

      <p>
        It may surprise you to learn that the NBA first had a salary cap in
        1946-47, its first season. The cap that season was $55,000, with most
        players earning between $4,000 and $5,000. Star player Joe Fulks earned
        $8,000, and Tom King earned a league-highest $16,500 for his combined
        duties as player, publicity director and business manager for the Detroit
        Falcons.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "modern" NBA salary cap began in 1984-85, at $3.6 million.
        It made steady but gradual increases of around $1-2 million each season
        until 1994-95, when it was $15.964 million. Armed with a big TV contract
        from NBC, the salary cap jumped to $23.0 million in 1995-96, and increased
        to $26.9 million in 1997-98, the last season of the 1995 CBA (a 647% increase
        in 13 years). The ABC/ESPN TV contract, which took effect with the 2002-03
        season, provided $4.6 billion over six years, but less in 2002-03 than NBC
        paid in 2001-02. As a result, the salary cap went down for the first time
        ever in 2002-03.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under the 2005 CBA the salary cap started at $49.5 million, and finished
        at $58.044 million, a 17.26% increase, and averaging 3.45% per year.
        However the salary cap decreased in 2009-10, dropping from $58.68 million
        to $57.5 million. Under the 2011 CBA the salary cap started at $58.044
        million and finished at $94.143 million, a 62.19% increase. This was largely
        driven by the new national TV deals that took effect in 2016.

    <div id="Q6" class="question">
      <h4>6. What's the history of the CBA?</h4>

      <p>
        Bob Cousy began to organize the NBA players in 1954, although the league
        refused to recognize the union until 1957. A near strike at the 1964 All-Star
        game forced the league to adopt a pension plan. The first CBA was established
        in 1970, and new agreements followed in 1973, 1976 and 1980. The 1976 CBA
        coincided with the settlement of the "Oscar Robertson" suit, which
        was filed by the players association in 1970 to block the NBA-ABA merger.
        The 1976 agreement also provided limited free agency through the elimination
        of "option" clauses that bound players to teams in perpetuity.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the 1983 agreement the parties agreed to share league revenues. This agreement
        also instituted the modern salary cap, which went into effect in 1984. When
        this agreement expired the players filed an antitrust lawsuit, resulting in
        the "Bridgeman" agreement which brought unrestricted free agency,
        reduced the draft to two rounds, and added anti-collusion provisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another antitrust lawsuit ensued in 1994 following the expiration of the 1988
        CBA, challenging the salary cap, college draft, and right of first refusal
        provisions. The parties eventually reached a "no-strike, no-lockout"
        agreement that allowed the 1994-95 season to be played.
      </p>

      <p>
        The parties came to terms on a new agreement in 1995, but the players tabled a
        ratification vote and instead filed for union decertification. The league responded
        by imposing a lockout. The parties quickly came to an agreement, and the players
        subsequently voted against decertification. A new six-year agreement was ratified
        which lifted the lockout before any games were missed, although the agreement was
        not actually signed until 1996.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NBA exercised its option to terminate the 1995 CBA following the 1997-98
        season, eventually imposing a lockout which took effect on July 1, 1998 and
        resulted in the cancellation of the start of the 1998-99 season and the 1999
        All-Star weekend. The parties reached agreement on a new six-year agreement
        in early 1999, just in time to salvage a minimal 50-game season. The new
        agreement introduced maximum salaries, the Mid-Level exception, and the escrow
        and luxury tax systems. The league invoked its option to extend this agreement
        through the 2004-05 season.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NBA and players association ratified a new agreement in July 2005, which
        expired at the end of the 2010-11 season. The league had the option to extend
        it through the 2011-12 season, but elected not to do so, citing $300 million
        in losses during the 2010-11 season alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the 2005 CBA expired in July 2011, the league once again imposed a lockout
        (see question number <a href="#Q7">7</a>), which was settled in late November 2011.
        As a result, the 2011-12 season was reduced to 66 games. The 2011 CBA had a
        10-year term, but a mutual opt-out after the 2016-17 season. The sides agreed to
        terms for a new CBA before the opt-out date, which took effect on July 1, 2017.
      </p>

    <div id="Q7" class="question">
      <h4>7. What happened to the negotiations in 2011, and why did they go so smoothly in 2016?</h4>

      <p>
        The 2005 CBA guaranteed the players 57% of BRI (see question number
        <a href="#Q12">12</a>). Coupled with sharply rising expenses, slowing revenue
        growth caused in part by the economic downturn in 2007-08, and other factors, 22
        of the 30 teams lost money in 2009-10, collectively losing a reported $370
        million. As a result, the owners sought a complete reset of the league's economic
        system. The players disagreed over the extent of the losses, and maintained that
        the league's problems could be addressed through better management and revenue
        sharing.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, the sides were nowhere near an agreement when the 2005 CBA expired
        in July 2011. The league imposed a lockout, which led to the players filing
        multiple unfair labor practices charges with the National Labor Relations
        Board (NLRB), a union disclaimer of interest (see question number
        <a href="#Q118">118</a>) and subsequent class action lawsuits, several players
        signing to play overseas (eligible to receive a Letter of Clearance allowing
        them to do so as long as their overseas contracts let them return to the NBA
        when the lockout ended), and the cancellation of the entire preseason and the
        first 16 games of the regular season. The sides ultimately ratified a new CBA
        in early December 2011, and a 66-game 2011-12 season opened on Christmas Day,
        2011.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2011 CBA was effective through the 2020-21 season, but there was a mutual
        opt-out allowing the agreement to be terminated at the conclusion of the
        2016-17 season. The sides agreed to terms on a new agreement in December 2016,
        which superseded the 2011 CBA and took effect on July 1, 2017.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many factors were involved in the comparative ease of the 2016 negotiation
        process, including the improved financial state that resulted from changes
        made in the 2011 CBA, the influx of new revenue starting in 2016 that came
        as a result of new national TV contracts, an improving economy, skyrocketing
        franchise values, and new leadership at both the league and union, with Adam
        Silver replacing David Stern as NBA Commissioner, and Michelle Roberts
        replacing Billy Hunter as NBPA Executive Director.

    <div id="Q8" class="question">
      <h4>8. Do any unresolved issues remain from the 2017 labor agreement?</h4>

      <p>
        In 2011 the sides were rushed to complete and ratify the agreement in time
        to open the season on Christmas Day, so they put off discussing several
        issues. In 2017 they had more time to work through the issues, so very
        few items were identified to be discussed at a later date:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The review and approval of wearable biometric devices (see below).</li>
        <li>The establishment of a player mental health and wellness program, a long-term
            care insurance plan, and additional financial education programming.</li>
        <li>The league and union agreed to bargain over new player conduct rules
            beginning in 2017-18.</li>
        <li>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver mentioned the need to continue thinking about
            the age for draft eligibility (see question number <a href="#Q55">55</a>)
            but no official determination has been made to re-open discussions on
            this issue.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The review and approval of wearable biometric devices will be conducted by a
        joint advisory committee to be established after the agreement takes effect.
        Wearable devices are devices that are worn by the player, and measure movement
        information, biometric information, and/or other health, fitness and
        performance information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams will request that the committee review specific devices. Their standard
        will be whether the device is potentially harmful, has been vetted for
        effectiveness, and provides adequate security.
      </p>

      <p>
        Approved devices can be worn in practice, but not games, and the player may
        decline to wear a device. The device can only be used to measure health and
        performance information, or data for team on-court strategic and tactical use.
        The data cannot be used for player contract purposes. The player must be
        given access to his own data.

    <div id="Q9" class="question">
      <h4>9. When will the current CBA expire?</h4>

      <p>
        The CBA runs through the 2023-24 season, although either side may opt out
        after the 2022-23 season. To do so, notice must be given by December 15, 2022.

        <li>Certain "force majeure" events (such as war or terrorism) make
            it impossible or economically impractical for the league to fulfill the
            agreement (the league may terminate).<sup>1</sup> (See question number

      <h4>12. How is the salary cap set each year?</h4>

      <p>
        The salary cap is calculated based on projected amounts for Basketball
        Related Income (BRI) and benefits for the upcoming season. The projected
        BRI is a matter of negotiation between the league and players association.
        Each year the sides meet to try to agree on an amount. If they cannot
        agree by the end of the previous season (June 30), they instead use:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The set amount for national broadcast rights (which is determined in
            advance), plus</li>
        <li>The BRI for the previous season (other than national broadcast rights),
            increased by 4.5%.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The salary cap calculation takes 44.74% of projected BRI, subtracts
        projected benefits, and divides by the number of teams in the league<sup>1</sup>.
        The following adjustments are then made to the result:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the league didn't pay the players enough the previous season, i.e.,
            if they had to cut the players a supplemental check to make their
            guarantee, then the shortfall, divided by the number of teams in
            the league<sup>1</sup>, is added to the cap. For example, in 2015-16
            there was a shortfall of $130.9 million, which led to a $4.36 million
            increase in the 2016-17 cap.</li>
        <li>If there is an overage -- i.e., if the players were paid more (pre-escrow)
            than their guaranteed share in the previous season -- and the system is
            getting close to exceeding what the league can get back through the escrow
            system, then the cap (and tax level) may be reduced in order to put on the
            brakes (see question number <a href="#Q17">17</a> for more information).</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="Q13" class="question">
      <h4>13. Exactly what is included when computing total team salaries? What is cap
              room? What is a cap hold?</h4>

      <p>
        A team's cap room (referred to simply as "room" in the CBA) refers to its
        ability to sign players to free agent contracts. If a team is above the cap,
        then its room is limited to the exceptions it possesses. If the team is below
        the cap, then its room is how far it is below the cap when all salaries and
        cap holds are included. Cap holds are "placeholders" for players the team
        is expected to sign in the future. For example, a team is expected to sign
        its unsigned first round draft pick, so an amount is reserved for this
        signing in the form of a cap hold. A team $10 million below the cap with
        $4 million in cap holds therefore has $6 million in room. A team $5 million
        under the cap with $6 million in cap holds is not considered to be under the
        cap at all, and must use exceptions to sign players. The following are
        included in team salary:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Salaries of all active and inactive players<sup>1</sup>, including likely bonuses.</li>
        <li>The full season salary of any players the team acquires in midseason trades.</li>
        <li>Salaries paid or payable to waived players, minus any set-off amounts<sup>2</sup>
            and subject to the Stretch provision (see question number <a href="#Q65">65</a>).</li>
        <li>Any salary still being paid to retired players (see question number
            <a href="#Q61">61</a>).</li>
        <li>A cap hold for amounts paid or expected to be paid in conjunction with certain
            grievances.</li>
        <li>A cap hold for salaries in contracts that have been agreed to but not yet executed
            (i.e., verbal agreements or agreements pending physicals)<sup>3</sup>.</li>
        <li>A cap hold for a percentage of the previous salary of every unrenounced free agent
            (see question number <a href="#Q37">37</a>).</li>
        <li>A cap hold for salaries offered in offer sheets to restricted free agents (see
            question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>).</li>
        <li>A cap hold for 120% of the "scale" amount for the team's unsigned first round draft
            pick(s) (see question number <a href="#Q50">50</a>). This amount begins to apply to
            team salary immediately upon selection in the draft<sup>4</sup>. This amount can be
            excluded from the team salary for the current season if, before the season starts,
            the team and player agree in writing that the team will not sign the player during
            that season.</li>
        <li>A cap hold called an "incomplete roster charge" if the team has fewer than 12 players
            (players under contract, free agents included in team salary, players given offer
            sheets, and first round draft picks)<sup>5</sup>. This charge is equal to the rookie minimum
            salary for each player fewer than 12. For example, if there are 11 players included
            in team salary, then an amount equal to the rookie minimum salary is added to the team
            salary<sup>6</sup>; if the roster is completely empty, then 12 times the rookie
            minimum salary is added to the team salary. This charge only applies during the
            offseason.</li>
        <li>A cap hold for the combined amount of any Mid-Level, Bi-Annual, Disabled Player (see
            question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>) and trade exceptions (see question number
            <a href="#Q87">87</a>) available to the team (see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a>),
            if the team is under the salary cap. (Teams may renounce these exceptions, in which
            case they no longer are included in team salary.)</li>
        <li>Salaries for completed contracts (such as 10-day contracts) are included in team
            salaries for the remainder of that salary cap year (through June 30).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They use a slightly different calculation for determining the team salary
        in relation to the Apron (see question number <a href="#Q20">20</a>). This applies
        to the Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level, and Taxpayer Mid-Level exceptions
        (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>), and for Sign-and-Trade
        transactions (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>). For these purposes
        they use the team salary as defined above, with the following modifications:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>All unlikely bonuses are included for contracts and extensions signed
            under the current CBA.</li>
        <li>Amounts that <em>could be</em> included in team salary as the result
            of certain grievances are included.</li>
        <li>For rookies and players with one year of experience who were signed as free
            agents (not as draft picks) and whose salary is less than the two-year minimum
            salary, the two-year minimum salary is used in place of their actual salary.</li>
        <li>For the team's restricted free agents, the amount of any outstanding
            qualifying offer or first refusal exercise notice (both including unlikely
            bonuses), whichever is greater, are included.</li>
        <li>The amount of any required tenders for the team's draft picks is included
            (80% of the scale salary for first round picks; the rookie minimum salary
            for second round picks).</li>
        <li>The amount of any cap holds for empty roster spots (below 12).<sup>7</sup></li>
        <li>Cap holds for free agents are excluded.</li>
        <li>Cap holds for first round draft picks are excluded.</li>
        <li>Cap holds for the team's outstanding exceptions are excluded.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They do this because those exceptions and sign-and-trade transactions affect
        whether the team is subject to a hard cap (see question number <a href="#Q20">20</a>),
        and these modifications to the team salary calculation ensure that subject teams
        remain below the Apron.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following are <em>not</em> included in team salaries:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The full season salary of any players the team trades away in midseason trades.</li>
        <li>Salaries of some players with long-term or career-ending injuries or illnesses
            (see question number <a href="#Q61">61</a>).</li>
        <li>The salaries for the team's two-way players (see question number
            <a href="#Q82">82</a>).</li>
        <li>The "scale" amount for the team's unsigned first round draft pick(s)
            when the player signs with a non-NBA team. The scale amount is excluded from the
            team salary on the date he signs a non-NBA contract or the first day of the regular
            season, whichever is <em>later</em>. The scale amount goes back onto the team
            salary on the following July 1 or when his non-NBA contract ends, whichever is
            <em>earlier</em>. In other words, these cap holds are removed for players
            playing elsewhere during the regular season only. Scale amounts are also excluded
            from team salary when the team and player both agree in writing that they will
            not sign a contract that season.</li>
        <li>For rookie scale contracts that pre-date the 2017 CBA, the amount of the "conforming
            increase" (see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>) to bring the rookie scale
            amounts in line with the 2017 CBA (the amount of the conforming increase is excluded
            unless the pre-increase amount is less than the current minimum salary, in which case
            the current minimum salary is applied to team salary).</li>
        <li>Salaries from summer contracts (see question number <a href="#Q70">70</a>).</li>
        <li>Salaries of players selected in an expansion draft (see question number
            <a href="#Q114">114</a>) and waived by the expansion team prior to the start
            of the season.</li>
        <li>Salary not paid to players due to set-off<sup>3</sup> (see question number
            <a href="#Q65">65</a>).</li>
        <li>For certain purposes, 50% of salary not paid to players who were suspended by
            the league is excluded. For example, if a player with a $10 million salary is
            suspended by the league for exactly half the season, then he loses $5 million,
            and 50% of this amount, or $2.5 million, is excluded from certain calculations
            including escrow and luxury tax. The team does <em>not</em> receive extra cap
            room which it can use to sign another player.</li>
        <li>Any bonus amounts for called for in Exhibit 10 of a player's contract (see question
            number <a href="#Q83">83</a>).</li>
      </ul>

        For minimum team salary purposes the salary of a player who changes teams
        through trade or waivers is divided among the teams for which he played.
        For example, if a $10 million player is traded exactly 60% of the way
        through the season, then the player's original team counts $6 million of
        the player's salary for minimum team salary purposes, and the player's
        new team counts $4 million of the player's salary for minimum team
        salary purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any salary included in team salary as a result of international buyouts (see
        question number <a href="#Q77">77</a>) is excluded from team salary
        for minimum team salary purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams with a team salary below the minimum are surcharged for their shortfall,
        with the money distributed among the players on that team. The determination of
        how the money is distributed is up to the players union. Most recently they have
        distributed a full share to players who had spent at least 41 games on the team's
        roster, and a half share to players who had spent 20 to 40 games on the team's
        roster. However, a player cannot receive more than the maximum salary as a result
        of a shortfall payment.

      <h4>15. What percentage of revenues do the players receive?</h4>

      <p>
        Player contracts are individually negotiated between players and
        teams, and several factors control the amount each player
        individually can receive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collectively, the players are guaranteed to receive 50% of forecasted
        revenues<sup>1</sup>, plus (or minus) 60.5% of the amount by which revenues
        exceed (or fall short of) the forecasts, with a lower limit of 49% of BRI
        and an upper limit of 51% of BRI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are the revenue forecasts for 2017-18 through 2023-24, with 50% of the

        For example, if BRI for 2017-18 is $5.418 billion (i.e., revenues exceed
        forecasts by $100 million), then the players collectively are guaranteed
        $2.7195 billion, which comes from:

        <li>$2.659 billion, which is 50% of the $5.318 billion forecast, PLUS</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        If instead BRI for 2017-18 was $4.8 billion, then the players'

      <p>
        Since individual salaries are negotiated before the season starts (in many
        cases years before), and BRI is not determined until the season concludes,
        there are mechanisms in place to adjust when salaries miss their target. If the
        players receive less than their guaranteed share of BRI, the league cuts a check
        to the players association for the difference, and this amount is distributed
        to the players (this happened in 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17, under the 2011
        CBA).
      </p>
 
      <p>
        The escrow system adjusts the players' salaries when they earn more than
        their guaranteed share (see question number <a href="#Q16">16</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        An additional benefits pool is funded with 1% of BRI, which comes out of the
        players' share. This pool is used to fund various benefits and annuities for
        players who have vested. If there is an escrow overage (see question number
        <a href="#Q16">16</a>) and the escrow fund is not large enough to bring
        salaries and benefits down to the players' designated share, they take the
        remainder out of this pool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Revenues significantly decerased in 2019-20, due to COVID-19. As a result, the
        escrow system (which was designed for fine-tuning, not for significant adjustments)
        was insufficient, so the league also retained the $97 million that was in the
        supplemental benefits pool. In addition, the league and players association
        implemented a substantial escrow increase. Combined, these measures were sufficient
        to bring salaries and benefits down to the players' designated share.

      <h4>16. How does the escrow system work? What is it for?</h4>

      <p>
        The escrow system works hand-in-hand with the players' revenue guarantee
        (see question number <a href="#Q15">15</a>) to control the amount of league
        revenues that go to the players.
      </p>

      <p>
        The escrow system tries to ensure that salaries &amp; benefits do not
        exceed the players' guaranteed share of BRI. To do this, 10% of the
        players' salaries<sup>1,2</sup> is withheld from their paychecks and
        deposited into an escrow account. At the end of each season they compare
        the players' guaranteed share of BRI to the amount they were actually
        paid in salaries &amp; benefits. If there was an overage (i.e., if
        the players were paid more pre-escrow than they were guaranteed), then
        the amount of the overage is returned to the teams from the escrow
        account. The players then receive any escrow money that remains. It is
        also possible that they find themselves at the end of the season with
        insufficient escrow funds to cover the overage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are some examples to illustrate what could happen in the escrow
        process. In Example A there is not an overage. In Example B there is
        an overage, but the escrow is sufficient to reduce salaries to the
        designated percentage. In Examples C there is an overage, which the
        escrow is insufficient to cover.

        In Example A, salaries &amp; benefits are less than the designated share,
        so the escrow money isn't needed. The players get to keep it all, in
        addition to receiving a supplemental payment to meet their guaranteed
        share. In Example B the escrow system successfully lowers salaries back
        down to the designated share, and the players get to keep what's left over. In
        Example C there isn't enough escrow money to lower salaries back down to the
        designated share. The players "owe" $366 million, but the escrow account
        contains only $280 million. The owners receive the entire balance of the
        escrow account, but the players don't have to pay any additional money (see
        question number <a href="#Q17">17</a> for more information on this situation).

      <h4>17. What happens when there's not enough money in the escrow account? What happened
              as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? What changes were made for future seasons
              as a result?</h4>

      <p>
        Under normal circumstances (before COVID-19), players never lost more than 10% of
        their salaries to the escrow system<sup>1</sup>. If they reconcile the numbers after
        the season and discover that the escrow fund is insufficient to return salaries &amp;
        benefits back down to the players' designated share, they take the shortfall out of
        the supplemental benefits pool that is funded with 1% of BRI (see question number
        <a href="#Q15">15</a>). If they exhaust the entire supplemental benefits pool and
        <i>still</i> haven't brought salaries down to the designated share, they stoped there.
        The players don't lose any additional money, and ended up earning more than their
        designated share that season.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, there is a system in place to try to prevent this from happening.
        If there is an overage -- i.e., if the players were paid more than their
        guaranteed amount in the previous season (pre-escrow) -- and the system is
        getting close to exceeding what the league can get back through the escrow
        system, then the cap and tax levels may be reduced in the following season
        in order help put on the brakes.
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li>If the overage was less than 6% then no action is taken.</li>
         <li>If the overage was between 6% and 9%, then they look at projected
             BRI (see question number <a href="#Q12">12</a>). No action is taken
             if projected BRI will be high enough to fix the problem on its
             own. If the projected BRI is not high enough, then the cap and tax
             levels are reduced.</li>
         <li>If the overage exceeds 9%, they put on the brakes (by reducing
             the cap and tax levels) without regard to projected BRI.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For example, if the total salaries and benefits for 2019-20 are $4.686
        billion and this results in an overage of $351 million (7.5% of total
        salaries and benefits), and if the projected BRI for 2020-21 exceeds
        the BRI for 2019-20 by 9%, then the 2020-21 salary cap is adjusted
        downward by $0.8 million, and the tax level is reduced by $1.07 million.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of this changed with the 2019-20 season, due to COVID-19. The CBA
        already had protections in place in the event of unforseen drops in
        revenue:
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li>The "Force Majeure" clause says that if there's an event such as a
             war, terrorism, epidemic, natural disaster or government action that
             makes it impossible or impractical to perform under the CBA, resulting
             in the loss of games, then players lose a game's salary (1/92.6) for
             each missed game. The Force Majeure clause also gives the league the
             right to terminate the CBA after 60 days, with 60 days' notice to the
             players association.</li>
         <li>The "Revenue Decline" clause says that if BRI decreases substantially
             from one season to the next, resulting in the players earling more
             than their designated share, then the sides will negotiate in good faith
             on CBA adjustments to compensate.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The COVID-19 epidemic caused the loss of a substantial portion of the 2019-20
        season, and a substantial revenue decline through lost games, and loss of
        arena-based revenues such as ticket sales and concessions. As a result, the
        sides agreed upon the following changes moving forward:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For the 2019-20 season, the players lost the full escrow fund ($384 million)
          and the suppplemental benefits pool ($97 million). The league also increased
          escrow withholding to 25% beginning on May 15 of that season. $141 million of
          the additional escrow withholding was sufficient to return the players to their
          51% designated share. The luxury tax was reduced in proportion to the revenue
          losses as well.
        </li>

        <li>
          For the 2020-21 season, the salary cap, luxury tax threshold, and all related
          exceptions and salary scales were held at their 2019-20 amounts. The league played
          a 72-game schedule. Escrow withholding used a new "Ten-and-Spread" system
          which supplements the standard 10% withholding with any projected additional
          necessary withholding spread over a three-year period. The 2020-21 withholding
          was set at 20%. The luxury tax was reduced in proportion to any revenue losses.
          The 2020-21 overage totaled $1.285 billion. The players' calculated withholding
          was their "standard 10 percent," or $394 million, plus one-third of the remainder
          ($297 million) minus a $5 million adjustment, for a total of $686 million. THe
          actual withholding totaled $622 million, leaving $599 million to be recovered in
          2021-22 and 2022-23.
        </li>

        <li>
          For 2021-22 and subsequent seasons, the league returned to an 82-game schedule.
          The salary cap and luxury tax threshold will increase a minimum of 3% and a maximum
          of 10% over the preceding seasons. The Ten-and-Spread system was retained, with the
          additional withholding amount determined prior to the start of each season, and not
          to exceed 20%. The luxury tax will continue to be reduced in proportion to any revenue
          losses.
        </li>

        <li>
          In 2021-22 there was a $165 million shortfall per the standard escrow formula, which
          was credited toward the $599 million carry-forward. The calculated withholding was
          $302 million, and the actual withholding totaled $453 million. The difference
          ($151 million) was returned to the players, leaving a carry-forward of $132 million
          to the 2022-23 season.

      <h4>18. What is the "luxury tax?" Why does it exist? How is it
              determined? Who pays it?</h4>

      <p>
        The luxury tax is a mechanism that helps control team spending. While it
        is commonly referred to as a "luxury tax," the CBA simply calls it a
        "tax" or a "team payment." It is paid by high spending teams -- those
        with a team salary exceeding a predetermined tax level. These teams pay
        a penalty for each dollar their team salary (with a few exceptions, see
        below) exceeds the tax level.
      </p>

      <p>
         The tax level is determined prior to the season, and is computed by
         taking 53.51% of projected BRI (see question number <a href="#Q12">12</a>),
         subtracting projected benefits, and dividing by the number of teams in the
         league<sup>1</sup>. The tax level may be adjusted from there, based on what
         happened during the previous season:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the league didn't pay the players enough the previous season, i.e., if
            they had to cut the players a supplemental check to make their guarantee,
            then the shortfall, divided by the number of teams in the league<sup>1</sup>,
            is added to the tax level. For example, if the players are paid $90 million
            less in 2017-18 than they are guaranteed, then the 2018-19 tax level is
            adjusted upward by $3 million.</li>
        <li>If there is an overage -- i.e., if the players were paid more (pre-escrow)
            than their guaranteed share in the previous season -- and the system is
            getting close to exceeding what the league can get back through the escrow
            system, then the tax level (and salary cap) may be reduced in order to put
            on the brakes (see question number <a href="#Q17">17</a> for more
            information).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Teams pay an incremental tax rate based on their team salary as of the
        team's last regular season game, and whether the team is a "repeat offender,"
        i.e., whether they were also taxpayers in at least three of the four
        previous seasons (not including the most recent season):

        For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A team with a team salary $12 million over the tax level pays a
            tax of $21.25 million (the incremental maximum of $7.5 million
            for $0 to $4,999,999, plus the incremental maximum of $8.75
            million for $5 million to $9,999,999, plus $2 million times
            the incremental rate of $2.50 for $10 million to $14,999,999).</li>
        <li>A team that was a taxpayer in three of the four previous seasons,
            with a team salary in the current season $4 million over the tax
            level pays a tax of $10 million ($4 million times the repeater rate
            of $2.50 for $0 to $4,999,999).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When determining the amount of tax a team owes, the league uses its
        team salary (see question number <a href="#Q13">13</a>) on the date of
        its last regular season game (i.e., if a player is traded away before the
        end of the season, then none of his salary is taxed), with the following
        adjustments:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cap holds and exceptions are ignored.</li>
        <li>Any "unlikely bonuses" (see question number <a href="#Q74">74</a>) that
            were actually earned are added to the team salary.</li>
        <li>Any "likely bonuses" (see question number <a href="#Q74">74</a>) that
            were not earned are subtracted from the team salary.</li>
        <li>Any trade bonuses (see question number <a href="#Q99">99</a>) for players
            received in trade after the last regular season game are added to the team
            salary. This amount may be pro-rated -- see question number <a href="#Q100">100</a>
            for details.</li>
        <li>Any amounts from settlements of grievances are added to the team salary.</li>
        <li>For players who signed as free agents (i.e., not draft picks) under the current
            CBA, and make less than the two-year minimum salary, the minimum salary for a
            two-year veteran is used in place of their actual salary.<sup>2,3</sup></li>
        <li>For minimum salary players whose salary is partially paid by the league (see
            question number <a href="#Q22">22</a>) only the amount paid by the team (the
            two-year minimum salary) is taxed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Due to the revenue decrease related to COVID-19, the 2020-21 tax threshold was set to
        the same amount as 2019-20 ($132,627,000). In 2021-22 and subsequent seasons it is
        guaranteed to rise at least 3% but no more than 10% each season.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2019-20 and 2020-21 the the formula for determining how far a team's Team Salary is
        above the tax threshold (and therefore how much tax it owes) was adjusted. The team's
        amount above the tax threshold was reduced commensurate to to that season's revenue
        loss (calculated as the ratio between the actual BRI for that season to the BRI that
        would normally be necessay to produce that season's salary cap). In 2019-20 the ratio
        was 0.8544, meaning a team's amount above the tax threshold was reduced by 14.56% before
        its tax bill was calculated. For example, a non-repeater that was $10 million above the
        tax threshold would be considered to be $8.544 million above the tax thresold. This team
        would therefore pay $13.7 million in tax rather than $16.25 million. In 2020-21 the ratio
        was .711, so each team's amount above the tax threshold was reduced by 28.9 percent.

      <h4>19. Where does the escrow and luxury tax money go?</h4>

      <p>
        The money collected from the escrow (see question number <a href="#Q16">16</a>)
        and luxury tax (see question number <a href="#Q18">18</a>) systems may be
        distributed to teams or used for league purposes, subject to certain rules:
      </p>
  
      <h5>Escrow money:</h5>
  
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Some or all of the escrow money may be given to teams, but only if
            given to all teams in equal shares.</li>
        <li>Any escrow money not distributed to teams will be used for "league
            purposes."</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Tax money:</h5>
  
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Up to 50% of the tax money may be given to non-taxpaying teams. Note
            that there is no requirement that <em>any</em> of the tax money be
            distributed to teams in this manner.</li>
        <li>Any tax money not distributed to teams will be used for "league
            purposes." In other words, <em>at least</em> 50% of the tax
            revenue will be used for league purposes each season.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        "League purposes" essentially means for any purpose the league
        decides, including distributing the money back to teams. Currently
        50% of the tax revenue is used as a funding source for the revenue
        sharing program, and the remaining 50% is distributed to non-taxpaying
        teams in equal shares.
      </p>

      <p>
        To understand the consequence of crossing the tax line, consider a team
        just below the tax line that suffers injuries and needs to sign a
        replacement player. This team would pay the player's salary, pay tax on
        the amount by which they are now above the tax line, and forfeit any
        tax distribution they otherwise may have received.

      <h4>20. Other than financial penalties, are there restrictions on taxpaying teams?
              What is the "Apron?" What is the hard cap?</h4>

      <p>
        In addition to the tax payments described in question number <a href="#Q18">18</a>,
        taxpaying teams have the following restrictions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Taxpaying teams do not receive a distribution from the league wide tax
            fund. However, they remain eligible to receive a distribution from the
            escrow fund (see question number <a href="#Q19">19</a>) and from revenue
            sharing (see question number <a href="#Q21">21</a>).</li>
        <li>Taxpaying teams can acquire less salary in a simultaneous trade (see
            question number <a href="#Q86">86</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Further restrictions kick-in once a team crosses a point known as the
        <strong>apron</strong><sup>1</sup>. In 2017-18 the apron is the point
        $6 million above the tax threshold. In subsequent seasons the apron
        rises or falls by one-half the percentage that the salary cap rises
        or falls.

      <p>
        Teams with a team salary above the Apron have the following additional
        restrictions. Note that they use the team salary at the <em>conclusion</em>
        of any transaction to determine whether a team is over the Apron (for
        example in a sign-and-trade transaction, they look at what the team
        salary would be after the trade is completed).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Teams above the Apron cannot use the Bi-Annual exception (see question
            number <a href="#Q25">25</a>).</li>
        <li>Teams above the Apron have a smaller Mid-Level exception (see question
            number <a href="#Q25">25</a>). It can be used to offer a mid-level
            contract no longer than three years, while other teams can offer four. The
            starting salary is also lower.</li>
        <li>Teams cannot receive a player in a sign-and-trade transaction (see question
            number <a href="#Q92">92</a>). Note that they calculate whether the team is
            over or under the Apron after the full sign-and-trade transaction, and not
            just the signing.</li>
        <li>Teams above the Apron do not have the same protections under the Gilbert
            Arenas provision (see question number <a href="#Q43">43</a>). Under the
            Arenas provision other teams can offer restricted free agents salaries
            starting up to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. If a team with the
            right of first refusal does not have Early Bird rights to the player
            and is over the Apron, it will have only the smaller Taxpayer Mid-Level
            exception at its disposal, and cannot match an offer for the full
            Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The transactions listed above are reserved for teams that are below the Apron.
        This applies to the entire season in which one of these exceptions is used -- for
        example, if a team is below the Apron and utilizes its Bi-Annual exception, it
        commits itself to remaining below the Apron for the remainder of that season
        (through the following June 30).
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, when a team is below the Apron and uses its Bi-Annual exception,
        receives a player who is signed-and-traded, or uses its Mid-Level exception to
        sign a player to a contract larger than allowed by the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception,
        the team becomes <strong>hard-capped</strong> at the Apron for the remainder of that
        season. This eliminates any potential loophole where a team could first use one of
        these exceptions and subsequently add salary to go above the Apron, since the
        reverse -- adding salary first and <em>then</em> using the exception -- would be 
        illegal.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team is hard-capped, it cannot exceed the Apron under any circumstance. If the
        team subsequently needs to sign a player (for example, to replace injured players)
        it must first create room under the Apron by waiving player(s) with non-guaranteed
        salary, waiving player(s) with guaranteed salary and utilizing the stretch
        provision, trading downward in salary, etc<sup>2</sup>. A team that is hard-capped
        can utilize Summer Contracts (see question number <a href="#Q70">70</a>) to sign
        players for training camp, but must waive them in time to clear waivers before the
        start of the regular season, if necessary to stay below the hard cap. A team
        subject to the hard cap can also sign players to Rest-of-Season contracts during
        the season, as long as the salary pro-ration keeps the team below the Apron.
      </p>

      <p>
        A modified version of the team salary calculation is used for all transactions
        related to the Apron and to the hard cap. See question number <a href="#Q13">13</a>
        for details.

      <h4>21. How does revenue sharing work? How is it different from the luxury tax?</h4>

      <p>
        The high revenues generated by big-market teams increase BRI, which
        increases the salary cap, which increases the amount all teams (including
        low-revenue, small-market teams) are forced to spend on player salaries --
        which leads to an unsustainable system. The league's revenue sharing plan
        works in parallel with the CBA (including the luxury tax) as a one-two punch
        to address franchise economic disparity. It is designed to help redistribute
        money from high-revenue teams (generally in big markets) to needier teams
        (generally in small markets), leading to sustainability and profitability
        for all 30 teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NBA has had some form of revenue sharing in place since the 2005 CBA.
        Under the 2005 agreement it was funded entirely through luxury tax revenues,
        and redistributed an average of $40 million per season. However in many cases
        teams merely got back money they had put into the pool themselves, so the net
        redistribution of money was much lower than the gross distribution. Under the
        current plan, for example, $153 million was redistributed to small-market
        teams in 2013-14.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept behind the plan is that teams contribute an equal percentage
        of their total revenues into a common pool (minus certain expenses such as
        arena expenses), then receive an allocation equal to a 1/30 share of the
        pool<sup>1</sup>. Small market teams with lower revenues will therefore
        contribute less than they receive, and will be net beneficiaries under the
        plan. Large market teams will contribute more than they receive, and will
        be net payers under the plan. Other components of the plan are as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The plan makes teams responsible for meeting revenue benchmarks, based
            on the size of the market (determined on the basis of the number of TV
            households in the team's designated market area) in which they play.
            Any team that falls short of its benchmark has to make up the difference
            in its contribution into the pool -- in other words, teams are penalized
            for underperforming. Revenue benchmarks range from 65% (New Orleans) to
            160% (New York and Brooklyn) of the league average revenues.</li>
        <li>Teams falling short of their revenue expectations are required to work
            with the league office to develop and implement a business improvement
            plan, which could include reorganizing business operations, hiring or
            replacing staff, or adopting new sales strategies. If a team fails to
            satisfactorily implement such a plan it could forfeit a portion of its
            revenue sharing payments (up to 25%).</li>
        <li>The percentage of revenues teams contribute to the pool is based on the
            percentage of league-wide revenues that go to player salaries. For example,
            if player salaries are 50% of league-wide revenues, then each team would
            contribute 50% of its revenues into the pool.</li>
        <li>Teams in markets with fewer than 1 million TV households do not have to
            contribute more than 15% of their revenues.</li>
        <li>Teams in markets with more than 2.5 million TV households cannot receive a
            revenue sharing payment. Teams in markets with 2 million to 2.5 million TV
            households receive a percentage of a full payment (for example, a team
            with 2.25 million TV households receives a 50% payment). A team with fewer
            than 2 million TV households receives a full payment.</li>
        <li>If a team is profitable without revenue sharing, it receives a smaller or
            no payment. Any payments from revenue sharing that would lead a team to
            have a profit over $10 million are eliminated.</li>
        <li>High revenue teams are limited in the amounts they have to pay. No team
            pays more than 30% of its profits in excess of $5 million.</li>

        The revenue sharing pool is always "fully funded," i.e., it is always funded
        to its full amount despite some teams having contribution limits. When there
        is a shortfall, the difference is made up through luxury tax receipts and
        collective league sources -- 50% of tax revenues goes to fund revenue sharing,
        with the remaining 50% distributed back to non-taxpaying teams.

      <h4>22. What is the minimum salary a player can receive?</h4>

      <p>
        Minimum salaries for all seasons of a contract are based on the minimum salary
        scale in effect when the contract is signed. To determine the salary for each
        season of a multi-year, minimum salary contract, read diagonally across the chart
        below. For example, if a five-year veteran signs a three-year contract, his
        first-year salary will be the Year 1 salary for a five-year veteran; his
        second-year salary will be the Year 2 salary for a six-year veteran; and his
        third-year salary will be the Year 3 salary for a seven-year veteran.

      <p>
        The minimum salary scale amounts for the 2017-18 season were negotiated into the
        agreement. For each subsequent season the minimum salary scale amounts are
        determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap to the previous
        minimum salary scale amounts. For example, if the salary cap increases by 4% from
        2017-18 to 2018-19, then all minimum salary scale amounts also will increase by 4%
        from 2017-18 to 2018-19. The minimum salary scales for previous seasons can be
        found <a href="http://www.cbafaq.com/minimums.htm">HERE</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Players on minimum-salary contracts may receive salary advances and deferred
        compensation (see question number <a href="#Q115">115</a>), as well as trade
        bonuses (see question number <a href="#97">97</a>) and Exhibit 10 bonuses (see
        question number <a href="#Q83">83</a>). They cannot receive loans or other
        types of bonuses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two-Way players (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) receive the NBA
        rookie minimum salary (no matter how many years of NBA service they have) on
        a per-day basis, for each day they are with their parent club. For each day
        they are on the team's G-League affiliate, they receive a pro-rated portion of
        the G-League scale salary for that season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Minimum salaries begin to pro-rate starting on the first day of the regular
        season -- see question number <a href="#Q28">28</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Any salaries below the applicable minimum salary in contracts that pre-date
        the current CBA are automatically revised upward to the applicable minimum
        salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a player has been in the NBA for three or more seasons, and is playing
        under a one-year, 10-day or Rest-of-Season contract at the minimum salary,
        the league reimburses the team for part of his salary -- any amount above
        the minimum salary for a two-year veteran. For example, the minimum salary
        for a two-year veteran in 2017-18 is $1,471,382, so for a ten-year veteran,
        with a minimum salary of $2,328,652, the league would reimburse the team
        $857,270. Only the two-year minimum salary is included in the team salary,
        not the player's full salary. They do this so teams won't shy away from
        signing older veterans simply because they are more expensive than younger
        veterans.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other notes on league reimbursement of minimum-salary contracts:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The team is reimbursed even if the player is waived during the season, as
            long as the player was paid more than the minimum salary for a two-year
            veteran.</li>
        <li>If the player is traded mid-season the reimbursement is pro-rated between
            the two teams, in proportion to the amount of time he spent with each
            team.</li>
        <li>For a Rest-of-Season contract (see question number <a href="#Q28">28</a>)
            the reimbursement threshold (the two-year veteran minimum salary) itself
            is pro-rated. For example, the minimum salary for a two-year veteran in
            2017-18 is $1,471,382. If a team signs a ten-year veteran to a Rest-of-Season
            contract on the 60th day of this 177-day season, the league would reimburse
            the team for any salary paid above $972,608, which is 117/177 of $1,471,382.
            The pro-rated $972,608 amount also would be included in the team salary.</li>

      <p>
        The above maximum salaries are for the <em>general</em> case, but there are
        exceptions. The first exception is that in a multi-year contract only the
        first season's salary is subject to the maximum. The latter seasons of a
        contract can have salaries above the maximum, although there are restrictions
        about how big raises can be from year to year (see question number <a href="#Q53">53</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        The second exception is that the maximum salary in the first season of a
        contract is never less than 105% of the salary in the last year of the
        player's previous contract. For example, a seven-year veteran free agent
        who most recently earned $40 million has a maximum salary of at least $42
        million, even if that is above the league-wide maximum. A free agent does
        not have to re-sign with the same team in order to receive 105% of his
        previous salary, although the team that signs him is subject to the same
        salary cap restrictions as with any other free agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third exception is that certain players qualify for the next-higher
        maximum salary band (for example, a player with four years of experience
        can sign for 30% of the cap, which is normally reserved for players with
        seven to nine years of experience) at specific points in their careers.
        This is covered in question number <a href="#Q24">24</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a team distributes money to its players because it did not spend at
        least the minimum team salary (see question number <a href="#Q14">14</a>),
        no player can receive a distribution that takes his salary above the maximum
        salary. For example, if a player's salary is $500,000 below the maximum
        salary, his distribution is limited to $500,000. A player whose salary is
        at or above the maximum salary cannot receive a distribution. Any money a
        player forfeits in this manner is redistributed to the other players on his
        team.

      <h4>24. What is the Designated Player rule? What are the performance criteria for earning
              a higher maximum salary?</h4>

      <p>
        Certain players can receive contracts or extensions that are more favorable
        (in years and/or salary) than they ordinarily could receive. This applies to
        players who are finishing their rookie scale contracts (and other players
        with four years of experience), who can receive a starting salary up to 30%
        of the cap (which is normally reserved for players with 7-9 years of service).
        It also applies to players who are finishing their rookie scale extensions
        (and other players with eight or nine years of experience), who can receive a
        starting salary up to 35% of the cap (which is normally reserved for players
        with at least 10 years of service).
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, players signing a rookie scale extension can be designated by their
        team to receive a longer extension, totaling six seasons (including the season
        remaining on their rookie scale contracts).
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to qualify for the higher maximum salary, players must meet
        certain performance criteria<sup>1</sup>. At least one of the following
        must be true:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The player was named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team in
            the most recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the
            most recent season.</li>
        <li>The player was named the Defensive Player of the Year in the most
            recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the most
            recent season.</li>
        <li>The player was named the NBA Most Valuable Player in any of the
            three most recent seasons.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For example, if this is the 2018 offseason, then a player met the
        performance criteria if he accomplished any of the following:

      </ul>

      <p>
        The naming of these rules and criteria are somewhat inconsistent and confusing.
        The <em>Designated Veteran rule</em> allows teams to sign or extend players
        with eight or nine years of service to a higher salary (up to 35% of the cap).
        The <em>Designated Rookie rule</em> allows teams to sign players finishing
        their rookie scale contracts to <em>longer</em> extensions, but does <em>not</em>
        provide for the higher maximum salary (up to 30% of the cap). In fact, there
        are no performance criteria the player must meet to qualify for the Designated
        Rookie rule -- he just needs to be designated by his team to receive a longer
        extension. The higher maximum salary for these players is provided by the <em>5th
        Year, 30% Max criteria</em>. And while the criteria are the same for players with
        eight or nine years of experience to qualify for the higher maximum salary (up to
        35% of the cap), the CBA calls it the "Designated Veteran Player 35% Max Criteria"
        for these players.
      </p>

      <p>
        A player's eligibility for a higher maximum salary doesn't imply he will
        actually receive that amount -- as with all contracts, the actual salary is a
        matter of negotiation between the player (or his agent) and his team. However,
        a Designated Rookie must receive at least 25% of the cap. In addition, for
        players entering their fifth season the exact percentage of the cap can be based
        on <em>how</em> the player meets the 5th Year, 30% Max criteria. For example, a
        rookie scale extension can specify that the player will receive 27% of the cap if
        he meets the criteria by being named to the All NBA Second Team, 28% if he meets
        the criteria by being named to the All NBA First Team, or 30% if he meets the
        criteria by being named Most Valuable Player.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a limit to the number of designated players a team can have on its
        roster at a time. A team can have up to two designated rookies (who received
        a longer rookie scale extension) and up to two designated veterans (who received
        higher than the 30% maximum salary) at any time.<sup>2</sup> However, only one
        designated rookie may have been acquired from another team in a trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        A designated veteran extension can only be signed from the end of the July
        Moratorium through the last day before the start of the regular season. A player
        who signs a designated veteran contract or extension can't be traded for one year
        after he is signed.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summary, the kinds of contracts and extensions that can be signed using the Designated
        Player rule and the 5th Year, 30% Max Criteria are as follows:

      <h4>25. What are salary cap exceptions?</h4>

      <p>
        The basic rule of the NBA's salary cap is that a team can't sign a player
        or make a trade that leaves the team's team salary above the cap, unless
        the team is using an <em>exception</em>. In a system with a soft cap,
        exceptions are the mechanisms that allow teams to function while above
        the cap. Some exceptions are available only for making trades, and are
        described in detail starting in question number <a href="#Q84">84</a>. The
        exceptions available for signing players are as follows<sup>1</sup>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>LARRY BIRD EXCEPTION</strong> -- This exception allows teams to
        exceed the cap in order to re-sign their own free agents, up to the
        player's maximum salary. Teams are said to have "Bird rights"
        to players who qualify. To qualify for this exception a player essentially
        must play for three seasons without clearing waivers or changing teams as a
        free agent, however there are nuances to this rule, which are explained
        in question number <a href="#Q32">32</a>. This means a player can qualify
        by playing under three consecutive one-year contracts, a single contract
        of at least three years, or any equivalent combination. It also means that
        when a player is traded, his Bird rights are traded with him, and his new
        team can use the Larry Bird exception to re-sign him. These contracts can
        be up to five years in length, with raises up to 8% of the salary in the
        first season of the contract. Players who qualify for this exception are
        called "Qualifying Veteran Free Agents" in the CBA, and this
        exception is formally a component of the Veteran Free Agent exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 1983 CBA introduced the modern salary cap, and with it the provision
        allowing a team to exceed the cap to re-sign its own players. It is
        commonly believed that this exception acquired its common moniker because
        Larry Bird was the first such player to be re-signed. However, this is
        apocryphal, as Bird signed a seven-year contract in 1983 (before this
        provision took effect), and did not sign another until 1988.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting January 10 of each season, this exception begins to reduce in
        value. See question number <a href="#Q26">26</a> for details.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>EARLY BIRD EXCEPTION</strong> -- This is a weaker form of the
        Larry Bird exception. It also allows teams to exceed the cap to re-sign
        their own free agents, but with more limited contracts than the Larry
        Bird exception. To qualify for this exception the player must play for
        <em>two</em> seasons without clearing waivers or changing teams as a free
        agent (see question number <a href="#Q32">32</a> for details and nuances
        to this rule). A team may use the Early Bird exception to re-sign its
        own free agent for up to 175% of his salary in the previous season
        (not over the maximum salary, of course) or 105% of the average salary
        in the previous season<sup>3</sup>, whichever is greater (see question
        number <a href="#Q31">31</a> for the definition of "average salary").
        Early Bird contracts must be at least two seasons in length, which
        prevents teams from using the Early Bird to sign a one-year contract,
        then signing the same player with the full Larry Bird exception the
        following season. Early Bird contracts can be up to four years in length,
        with raises up to 8% of the salary in the first season of the contract.
        Early Bird is also a component of the Veteran Free Agent exception, and
        qualifying players are called "Early Qualifying Veteran Free
        Agents" in the CBA. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player is a restricted free agent with two years of service and
        qualifies for the Early Bird exception, then the player's prior team
        may use the Early Bird exception to match an offer sheet he receives
        from another team under the Gilbert Arenas provision (see question
        number <a href="#Q43">43</a>. This is true even if the starting salary
        for the Early Bird exception is lower than the starting salary in the
        offer sheet, which is based on the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team can renounce its Early Bird rights to a player, and instead
        re-sign him with the Non-Bird exception (see below). They might do this in
        order to sign the player to a one-year contract, instead of the minimum
        two years required by the Early Bird exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting January 10 of each season, this exception begins to reduce
        in value. See question number <a href="#Q26">26</a> for details.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>NON-BIRD EXCEPTION</strong> -- This is also a component of the
        Veteran Free Agent exception. Its name is somewhat of a misnomer, since
        Non-Bird really <em>is</em> a form of Bird rights. Players who qualify
        for this exception are called "Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agents"
        in the CBA. They are veteran free agents who are neither Qualifying Veteran
        Free Agents nor Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agents, and include the
        following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Players who finished the season with a given team, who have played
            no more than one season without clearing waivers or changing teams
            as a free agent.</li>
        <li>Players who were Early Bird free agents, but whose team renounced
            its right to use the Early Bird exception to re-sign the player.</li>
        <li>Players who were to be Larry Bird or Early Bird free agents, were
            playing on one-year contracts, and were traded mid-season.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This exception allows a team to re-sign its own free agent to a salary
        starting at up to 120% of his salary in the previous season
        (not over the maximum salary, of course), 120% of the minimum salary, or
        the amount needed to tender a qualifying offer (if the player is a restricted
        free agent -- see question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>), whichever is
        greater. Raises are limited to 5% of the salary in the first year of
        the contract, and contracts are limited to four seasons when this
        exception is used.
      </p>

      <p>
         A partial season counts as a full season for the tenure calculation
         related to Bird rights. If a team signs another team's free agent to
         a Rest-of-Season contract mid-way through the season, then at the end
         of that season the player is a non-Bird free agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting January 10 of each season, this exception begins to reduce in
        value. See question number <a href="#Q26">26</a> for details.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>NON-TAXPAYER MID-LEVEL EXCEPTION</strong> -- This exception is
        available only when a team is below the "Apron" (see question number
        <a href="#Q20">20</a>). This determination is made <em>after</em> the
        exception is used, so a team below the Apron cannot use this exception
        if doing so takes it above the Apron. It cannot be used by a team that
        has already used the Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception or the Room Mid-Level
        exception. It allows a team to sign any free agent to a contract with
        a starting salary up to the following:
      </p>

      <table class="lefttable"><tbody>
        <tr>

        </tr>
      </tbody></table>

      <p>
        The Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception amount for the 2017-18 season was
        negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception
        amount is determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap
        to the previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases
        by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will
        increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19.
      </p>

      <p>
        This exception may be split and given to multiple players. It may be
        used for contracts up to four years in length, with raises up to 5%
        of the salary in the first year of the contract. Signing a player to a
        multi-year contract does not affect a team's ability to use this
        exception every year -- for example, a team can use this exception to
        sign a player to a four-year contract, and use it again the following
        year to sign another player. Also see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a>
        for more information on the availability and use of this exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player is a restricted free agent with one or two years of service
        and receives an offer sheet from a new team under the Gilbert Arenas
        provision, the player's prior team may use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level
        exception to match the offer sheet (see question numbers <a href="#Q42">42</a>
        and <a href="#Q43">43</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, this exception is only available to teams that are below the "Apron."
        Teams above the Apron instead must use the smaller Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        (see below). Further, any team that uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        cannot go above the Apron for the remainder of that season. In other words,
        once a team uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, it is hard-capped
        at the Apron (see question <a href="#Q20">20</a> for more information).
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if a team uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception but does not
        exceed the constraints of the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (e.g., in
        2017-18 they use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to sign a player for
        $5.192 million or less), then the team is allowed to later exceed the Apron
        (i.e., it is not hard-capped). If the team later exceeds the Apron, then it
        is considered to have used the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception rather than the
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. But the converse is not true -- if a team
        is above the Apron and spends any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, it
        cannot drop below the Apron and spend the remaining money as part of its
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. Finally, a team that was above the Apron
        but did not spend any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception has full access
        to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception if it later drops below the Apron.
      </p>

      <p>
        A different team salary definition is used for determining whether a
        team is above or below the Apron. See question number <a href="#Q13">13</a>
        for details. In addition, this exception begins to pro-rate downward
        daily starting on January 10 each season (see question numbers
        <a href="#Q26">26</a> and <a href="#Q28">28</a>), and expires following the
        last day of the team's regular season.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>TAXPAYER MID-LEVEL EXCEPTION</strong> -- This exception is
        available only when a team is above the "Apron" (see question number
        <a href="#Q20">20</a>). This determination is made <em>after</em> the
        exception is used, so a team below the Apron must use this exception
        rather than the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception if doing so takes it
        above the Apron. It cannot be used by a team that has already used the
        Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level or the Room Mid-Level exception. It
        also cannot be used if the team has received a player that season in a
        sign-and-trade transaction (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>).
        It allows a team to sign any free agent to a contract with a starting
        salary up to the following:

        The Taxpayer Mid-Level exception amount for the 2017-18 season was
        negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception
        amount is determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap
        to the previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases
        by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will
        increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19.
      </p>

      <p>
        This exception may be split and given to multiple players. It may be
        used for contracts up to three years in length, with raises up to 5%
        of the salary in the first year of the contract. Signing a player to a
        multi-year contract does not affect a team's ability to use this
        exception every year -- for example, a team can use this exception to
        sign a player to a three-year contract, and use it again the following
        year to sign another player. Also see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a>
        for more information on the availability and use of this exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player is a restricted free agent with one or two years of service
        and receives an offer sheet from a new team under the Gilbert Arenas
        provision, the player's prior team may use the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        to match the offer sheet, but only if the offer is within the constraints
        of the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (see question numbers <a href="#Q42">42</a>
        and <a href="#Q43">43</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception but does not
        exceed the constraints of the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (e.g., in
        2017-18 they use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to sign a player for
        $5.192 million or less) and the team later exceeds the Apron, then the team
        is considered to have used the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception rather than
        the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. But the converse is not true -- if a
        team is above the Apron and spends any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception,
        it cannot drop below the Apron and spend the remaining money as part of its
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. Finally, a team that was above the Apron
        but did not spend any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception has full access
        to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception if it later drops below the Apron.
      </p>

      <p>
        A different team salary definition is used for determining whether a
        team is above or below the Apron. See question number <a href="#Q13">13</a>
        for details. In addition, this exception begins to pro-rate downward
        daily starting on January 10 each season (see question numbers
        <a href="#Q26">26</a> and <a href="#Q28">28</a>), and expires following the
        last day of the team's regular season.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ROOM MID-LEVEL EXCEPTION</strong> -- This exception is
        available only to teams that drop far enough below the cap to use cap
        room, and therefore lose their Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level and
        Taxpayer Mid-Level exceptions (see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a>).
        This exception cannot be used if the team already has used the Bi-Annual,
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level or Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. This exception
        becomes available once the team salary drops far enough that the team
        loses its other exceptions, and expires following the last day of the
        regular season. It allows a team to sign any free agent to a contract
        with a starting salary up to the following:

      <p>
        The Room Mid-Level exception amount for the 2017-18 season was
        negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception
        amount is determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap
        to the previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases
        by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will
        increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19.
      </p>

      <p>
        This exception may be split and given to multiple players. It may be
        used for contracts up to two years in length, with raises up to 5%
        of the salary in the first year of the contract. Signing a player to a
        multi-year contract does not affect a team's ability to use this
        exception every year -- for example, a team can use this exception to
        sign a player to a two-year contract, and use it again the following
        year to sign another player. Also see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a>
        for more information on the availability and use of this exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a team has used this exception, it no longer can use the Bi-Annual,
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level or Taxpayer Mid-Level exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>BI-ANNUAL EXCEPTION</strong> -- This exception is available only
        when a team is below the "Apron" (see question number <a href="#Q20">20</a>).
        This determination is made <em>after</em> the exception is used, so a team
        below the Apron cannot use this exception if doing so takes it above the
        Apron. It cannot be used by a team that has already used its Taxpayer Mid-Level
        or Room Mid-Level exception. It allows a team to sign any free agent to a
        contract with a starting salary up to the following:

      <p>
        The Bi-Annual exception amount for the 2017-18 season was negotiated
        into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception amount is
        determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap to the
        previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases
        by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will
        increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19.
      </p>

      <p>
        This exception may not be used two years in a row (and if this
        exception was used under the previous CBA in 2016-17, it may not
        be used in 2017-18). It may be split and given to more than one
        player, and can be used to sign players for up to two years, with
        raises limited to 5% of the salary in the first season of the
        contract. Also see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a> for more
        information on the availability and use of this exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team that uses its Bi-Annual exception cannot go above the Apron
        for the remainder of that season. In other words, once a team uses
        its Bi-Annual exception, it is hard-capped at the Apron (see question
        <a href="#Q20">20</a> for more information).
      </p>

      <p>
        A different team salary definition is used for determining whether
        a team is above or below the Apron. See question number <a href="#Q13">13</a>
        for details. In addition, this exception begins to pro-rate downward
        daily starting on January 10 each season (see question numbers
        <a href="#Q26">26</a> and <a href="#Q28">28</a>), and expires following
        the last day of the regular season.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ROOKIE EXCEPTION</strong> -- Teams may sign their first round draft picks
        to rookie "scale" contracts even if they will be over the cap as a result
       (see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>MINIMUM PLAYER SALARY EXCEPTION</strong> -- Teams can offer players
        minimum salary contracts even if they are over the cap. Contracts can be up
        to two years in length. In a two-year contract, the salary in the second year
        is specified in the minimum salary scale in effect when the contract was
        signed (see question number <a href="#Q22">22</a>). The contract may not
        contain a bonus of any kind. This exception can also be used to acquire
        minimum salary players via trade. There is no limit to the number of players
        that can be signed or acquired using this exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        This exception begins to reduce in value after the first day of the season.
        For example, if there are 177 days in the season, then this exception
        reduces in value by 1/177 of its initial value each day. So if a team signs
        a minimum salary player 90 days into the season, it can pay the player only
        87/177 of the minimum salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        See question number <a href="#Q88">88</a> for more information on how minimum
        salary players are handled in trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>DISABLED PLAYER EXCEPTION</strong> -- This exception allows a team
        which is over the cap to replace a disabled player who will be out for the
        remainder of that season (it can also be granted in the event of a player's
        death). This exception is granted by the league, based on an application from
        the team and a determination by an NBA-designated physician or Fitness to
        Play panel (see question number <a href="#Q62">62</a>) that the player
        is substantially more likely than not to be unable to play through the
        following June 15.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this exception is granted, the team can acquire one player via free agent
        signing, trade or waiver claim, to replace the disabled player:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The team may sign a free agent for one season only, for 50% of the
            disabled player's salary or the amount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level
            exception, whichever is less.</li>
        <li>The team may trade for a player in the <em>last season of his contract
            only</em> (including any option years)<sup>2</sup>, who is making no more
            than 50% plus $100,000 of the disabled player's salary, or the amount of
            the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception plus $100,000, whichever is less.</li>
        <li>The team may claim a player on waivers who is in the <em>last season of
            his contract only</em> (including any option years), who is making no
            more than 50% of the disabled player's salary, or the amount of the
            Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, whichever is less.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Teams can apply for this exception from July 1 through January 15, and cannot
        apply after January 15. Once granted, the exception expires when a player is
        acquired, when the disabled player is traded or returns to the team, or on
        March 10 of that season, whichever comes first. This exception is granted on
        a season-by-season basis -- if the player also will be out the following
        season, the team needs to apply for this exception again the following season.
      </p>

      <p>
        The disabled player must be on the team's roster from the time the team submits
        its application through the date on which the exception is granted. This exception
        only can be granted to the team for which the player was playing when his injury
        or illness was known, or reasonably should have become known. A team cannot trade
        for an injured player and subsequently apply for a Disabled Player exception for
        that player.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        If a team's application for a disabled player exception is denied, the team
        must wait 90 days before submitting another request related to the same
        player, and then only for a new injury or aggravation of the same injury.
        Whether the application was approved or denied, the team can apply again
        (including for the same injury) the following season.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the disabled player comes back sooner than expected he may be
        activated immediately, and the replacement player is not affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't confuse the Disabled Player exception with the salary cap relief
        teams sometimes receive after losing a player to a career-ending injury
        or death (see question number <a href="#Q61">61</a>). The Disabled
        Player exception allows a team to acquire a replacement player. The
        salary cap relief removes a contract from the team's books.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a> for more information
        on the availability and use of this exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>REINSTATEMENT</strong> -- If a player was banned from the league
        for a drug-related offense and later reinstated, his prior team may re-sign
        him for up to his previous salary, or the estimated average salary for the
        season in which he is reinstated, whichever is less.
      </p>

      <p>
        See question number <a href="#Q109">109</a> for more information on
        reinstatement.

      <h4>26. How do exceptions count against the cap? Does being under the cap always mean
          that a team has room to sign free agents? Do teams ever lose their exceptions?</h4>

      <p>
        If a team is below the cap, then its Disabled Player, Bi-Annual, Mid-Level
        (either the Taxpayer or Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level, whichever applies to the team)
        and/or trade exceptions are added to their team salary, and the league
        treats the team as though they are over the cap<sup>1</sup>. This is to prevent
        a loophole, in a manner similar to free agent amounts (see question number
        <a href="#Q37">37</a>). A team can't act like it's under the cap and sign free
        agents using cap room, and then use its Disabled Player, Bi-Annual, Mid-Level
        and/or trade exceptions. Consequently, the exceptions are added to the
        team salary (putting the team over the cap) if the team is under the cap and
        adding the exceptions puts them over the cap. If a team is already over the cap,
        then the exceptions are <em>not</em> added to their team salary. There would be
        no point in doing so, since there is no cap room for signing free agents.
      </p>

      <p>
        So being under the cap does <em>not</em> necessarily mean a team has room to sign
        free agents. For example, assume the cap is $100 million, and a team has $90
        million committed to salaries. It also has a Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        for $9 million and a trade exception for $6 million. Even though its salaries
        put it $10 million under the cap, its exceptions also count toward team salary,
        increasing the total to $105 million, or $5 million over the cap. So the team
        actually has no cap room to sign free agents, and instead must use its
        exceptions to sign players.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team has the option to renounce its exceptions in order to reclaim its cap
        room. So in the example above, if the team renounced its Traded Player and
        Mid-Level exceptions, then the $15 million is taken off its team salary,
        which then totals $90 million, leaving the team with $10 million of cap
        room which then can be used to sign free agent(s).
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting January 10 of each season, the Mid-Level (Non-Taxpayer, Taxpayer and
        Room), Bird (Larry Bird, Early Bird and Non-Bird) and Bi-Annual exceptions begin
        to pro-rate<sup>2</sup> (reduce in value). For example, if there are 177 days in
        the season, then these exceptions reduce in value each day by 1/177 of the amount
        remaining on January 10. So if a team had a $9 million Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level
        exception and spent $2 million before the start of the season, then on January 10,
        and each day thereafter, the exception would reduce in value by 1/177 of $7
        million, or $39,548. Even if the team signs another player after January 10, the
        daily pro-ration would continue to be 1/177 of $7 million.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team's exceptions may be lost entirely, or the team may never receive them
        to begin with. This happens when their team salary is so low that when the
        exceptions are added to the team salary, the sum is still below the salary
        cap. If this happens when the exceptions arise on July 1, then the team
        doesn't get their exceptions at all. If the team salary ever drops below this
        level during the year, then the unused portions of any remaining exceptions
        are lost (and do not return if the team salary later increases).
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, assume there is a $100 million salary cap, and during the
        offseason a team has $80 million committed to salaries, along with a
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception for $9 million, a trade exception
        for $5 million, and an unrenounced free agent whose free agent amount is
        $10 million. The team's salaries and exceptions total $104 million, or $4
        million over the cap. What if the free agent signs with another team?
        The $10 million free agent amount comes off the team's cap, leaving its
        team salary (including their remaining exceptions) at $94 million. This
        total is below the cap so the team loses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level and
        trade exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is logic behind this. The whole idea behind an "exception"
        is that it is an exception to the rule which says a team cannot go over
        the salary cap. In other words, an exception is a mechanism which allows
        a team to function above the cap. If a team isn't over the cap, then the
        concept of an exception is moot. Therefore, if a team's team salary ever
        drops this far, its exceptions go away. A rule of thumb is that a team may
        have either exceptions or cap room, but it can't have both at the same
        time.  However, a team in this situation does qualify to use the Room
        Mid-Level exception (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>).

      <h4>27. If a team has more than one exception available to sign a particular player,
          are there any rules regarding which one it has to use?</h4>

      <p>
        The team has the right to choose which of its available exceptions to use to
        sign a player. However, teams may not combine exceptions, or combine exceptions
        with cap room, in order to sign a player. For example, a team $5 million under
        the salary cap that has not used its $9 million Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        may not combine the exception and the cap room to sign a player for $14 million.
        This is explained more thoroughly in question number <a href="#Q90">90</a>.

      <h4>28. When a player signs mid-year for the rest of the season, is his salary pro-rated?
              What is a "Rest-of-Season" contract?</h4>

      <p>
        A "Rest-of-Season" contract is exactly what its name implies -- it is a
        contract signed after the start of a season, which is in effect for the
        remainder of that season.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the exception of minimum-salary contracts, salaries do not pro-rate
        during the season. However, the exceptions that enable players to be
        signed are subject to pro-ration (see question number <a href="#Q26">26</a>).
        For example, a team that has not used its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        could use its full amount to sign a player on the last day of the regular
        season. By that day this exception will have pro-rated down to less than
        half its original value. However a player could sign a rest-of-season
        contract on that day for the entire pro-rated amount, earning it all for
        just one game.
      </p>

      <p>
        The minimum salary begins to pro-rate on the first day of the regular
        season. The minimum salary on a Rest-of-Season contract is based on the
        fraction of the season remaining when the contract is signed. For example,
        if there are 177 days in the season, then a minimum salary contract
        signed on the 60th day of the season is worth 117/177 of the full
        minimum salary amount.<sup>1</sup> If a player signs a multi-year minimum
        salary contract partway through a season, then the first season is
        pro-rated and the salary in subsequent seasons is the full minimum
        salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Raises are based on the actual salary in the first season of the contract.
        For example, if a free agent signs a two-year contract on the last day of
        the regular season and the salary for the first season is $1 million, then
        the second season salary may range from $950,000 to $1.05 million (plus
        or minus 5% of the first season salary). 
      </p>

      <p>
        10-day contracts (see question number <a href="#Q80">80</a>) are also
        pro-rated. The salary on a 10-day contract is based on the number of
        days actually covered by the contract (a 10-day contract lasts 10 days
        or three games, whichever is longer).
      </p>

      <p>
        The G-League salary in a Two-Way contract (see question number
        <a href="#Q82">82</a>) is pro-rated as well, if the contract is signed during
        the season. In addition, the 45 day maximum for NBA service on a Two-Way
        contract is also pro-rated.

      <h4>29. Can a team pay a player less but arrange for an affiliated company to also
              pay him, perhaps by way of an endorsement contract?</h4>

      <p>
        I suppose it could happen, but the NBA will investigate if it suspects that an
        outside person or organization is paying a player on behalf or at the request
        of a team (even if the compensation is ostensibly for non-basketball services).
        If they find out that such circumvention has occurred, they will penalize the team.
        For the first offense the fine can be up to $3 million, forfeiture of a first
        round draft pick, and/or voiding the player's contract (see question number
        <a href="#Q112">112</a>). The penalties increase for subsequent violations.
      </p>

      <p>
        See question number <a href="#Q106">106</a> for more information on circumvention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incidentally, players are not allowed to become player-coaches. This is
        because it would be possible to circumvent the cap by signing a player as a
        player-coach, and paying him less as a player but overpaying him as a coach.
        The only payment a team can make to a player is for rendering services as
        a basketball player.

      <h4>30. Do players and teams ever have under-the-table agreements for future
              contracts? What happens when the league finds out about them? Is this
              what happened with the Timberwolves and Joe Smith?</h4>

      <p>
        Teams and players are not allowed to negotiate terms of a new contract (other than
        an extension) prior to the July 1 when the player becomes a free agent<sup>1,2</sup>.
        Teams are required to notify the league office immediately upon reaching any verbal
        or written agreement with a player, and all contracts must be filed with the
        league office within 48 hours of signing<sup>3</sup>. If a team makes an agreement
        with a player that is not reported to the league, the penalties can be even harsher
        than those described in question number <a href="#Q29">29</a>. Such a violation
        is considered by the league to be among the most serious a team can commit. Again,
        the league will investigate any allegations of wrongdoing. A violation can result
        in a fine up to $6 million, forfeiture of draft picks, voiding the player's
        contract(s) (see question number <a href="#Q112">112</a>), and/or the suspension
        for up to one year of any team personnel who were involved. In addition, the player
        himself can be fined up to $250,000, and prohibited from ever signing with that team.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what happened in 2000 with Joe Smith and the Minnesota Timberwolves.
        Smith left the Philadelphia 76ers in 1999 (following the lockout) to sign
        with the Timberwolves for their $1.75 million Mid-Level exception.
        They made an under-the-table agreement that Smith would play under three
        consecutive one-year contracts at below market value, and the Timberwolves
        would reward him by using their Bird rights to sign him to a huge contract
        beginning with the 2001-02 season. Unfortunately, they reduced this agreement
        to writing, and the written agreement eventually found its way into the
        league's hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        It had long been rumored that such under-the-table agreements existed, but
        this was the first time the league had hard evidence in the form of a signed
        agreement. The league responded by fining the team the maximum (at the time)
        $3.5 million, taking away their next five draft picks (two were later
        returned), and voiding Smith's then-current contract. Owner Glen Taylor and
        GM Kevin McHale also agreed to leaves of absence (in lieu of suspensions, at
        which time the fifth draft pick was returned). Most interestingly, the league
        also voided Smith's two previous, already-completed contracts. This essentially
        stripped the Timberwolves of any Bird rights to Smith, preventing them from
        re-signing Smith for any salary above the minimum (they had already used their
        other exceptions). Smith left Minnesota and signed with the Detroit Pistons,
        but returned to the Timberwolves in 2001.
      </p>

      <p>
        Claims that a team violated the "Undisclosed Agreements" rule go before the
        league's system arbitrator, although the Commissioner has the authority to
        impose penalties of up to $250,000 without having the case heard by the
        arbitrator.

      <h4>31. How is "average salary" defined?</h4>

      <p>
        The league computes the average player salary for a season by dividing the
        total salaries paid during that season by 13.2 times the number of teams
        (other than expansion teams in their first two seasons). The current
        denominator is 13.2 times 30, or 396. In addition to regular player salaries,
        the total salaries paid also includes the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Any supplemental payment to the players in the event of a shortfall in
            the players' share of BRI (see question number <a href="#Q15">15</a>).</li>
        <li>Any salaries excluded due to a career-ending injury or illness (see question
            number <a href="#Q61">61</a>).</li>
        <li>Any amounts paid by teams for failing to meet their minimum team salary

      <p>
        The average player salary for a season is not determined until the league audit
        in July, following the conclusion of that season. Before the average salary is
        determined they use an <em>estimated average salary</em>, which is 104.5% of the
        average salary for the previous season. The estimated average salary figure is
        used when determining the amount of the Early Bird exception<sup>1</sup>, the
        cap hold for unsigned free agents, and the salaries of reinstated players. Here

      <h4>32. How long must a player be with one team before the Larry Bird exception can be used?</h4>

      <p>
        The basic idea is that a player must play for the same team for three seasons
        for his team to gain full Bird rights (two seasons for Early Bird rights). It can
        be a single three-year contract, a series of three one-year contracts, or any
        combination that adds up to three seasons (or two for Early Bird). However there
        are a number of complications:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>When a player is traded, his new team inherits his Bird rights. For example,
            if a player signs a three-year contract, plays two and a half seasons with
            that team, and is traded at the trade deadline in the third season, then his
            new team has full Bird rights following the third season.</li>
        <li>The <em>first</em> season of the three-year tenure doesn't have to be a full
            season. If a player signs midseason in year one, then plays for two additional
            full seasons, his team will have full Bird rights following the third season.</li>
        <li>The player must complete his contract immediately prior to becoming a free
            agent, which essentially means he can't have cleared waivers. If he signs a series
            of contracts, then this only applies to the last contract. If a team signs a
            player and waives him after one game, signs and waives him after one game
            again the next year, and in the third year signs him and keeps him the entire
            season (assuming he didn't sign elsewhere during those three seasons), then
            they will have full Bird rights following the third season.</li>
        <li>The same is true for Early Bird rights. For example the Chicago Bulls signed
            John Lucas III to a one-year contract for 2010-11, but waived him in October,
            2010. They signed him again to a non-guaranteed contract in November 2010, but
            waived him again in January 2011 (just before the league wide contract guarantee
            date). They signed him again in March 2011 to a two-year contract (with a team
            option for 2011-12, which the Bulls picked-up). Despite having three contracts
            and being waived twice over a two-year period, the Bulls have Early Bird rights
            to Lucas in 2012.</li>
        <li>Once Bird rights are established, they don't go away unless the player is
            renounced or signs with another NBA team. This means teams retain Bird rights
            to many players who have long since retired, and could still use those Bird
            rights to re-sign such a player if that player attempts a comeback (but not
            for a sign-and-trade transaction -- see question number <a href="#Q103">103</a>
            for details).</li>
        <li>If the player is out of the NBA for at least one season before re-signing, the
            clock resets when he re-signs with his prior team. This is because Bird rights
            are established on the basis of the immediately preceding three (or two) seasons
            when a player <em>becomes</em> a free agent. For example, if a team had Larry
            Bird rights to a free agent in 2017 and that player signed overseas for 2017-18,
            then the team still has full Bird rights if the player returns to the NBA in 2018
            (because when the player <em>became</em> a free agent in 2018 they had full Bird
            rights, and those rights didn't go away when the player signed outside the NBA).
            However, if that player signs a one-year contract with his previous NBA team for
            2018-19 then the clock resets, and the team will have only Non-Bird rights in
            2019 -- because the player <em>becomes</em> a free agent again in 2019, so his
            Bird status is re-evaluated on the basis of the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19
            seasons. Since the player did not play for the team in 2017-18, the one-year
            version of Bird rights (non-Bird) is awarded.</li>
        <li>The clock resets when the player signs with a different NBA team as a free agent.
            An interesting case occurred in the 2008-09 season with Antonio McDyess, who
            had played exclusively for the Pistons since the 2004-05 season. In 2008-09
            the Pistons traded him to the Nuggets, the Nuggets waived him, and he re-signed
            with the Pistons. Even though he only signed contracts with the Pistons and he
            completed his last contract without being waived, his Bird clock reset when he
            re-signed with the Pistons because he changed teams as a free agent.</li>
        <li>If a player is waived and is claimed by another team before he clears waivers,
            his Bird clock does not reset; however such players do not retain full Bird
            rights.</li>
        <li>If a player is selected in an expansion draft, then his Bird clock resets.</li>
        <li>Bird rights do not exist if the player's last contract was a 10-day contract
            (see question number <a href="#Q80">80</a>). However, if the player's last
            contract was <em>not</em> a 10-day contract, then any preceding 10-day contracts
            could count toward Bird rights. For example, if a player signs only a 10-day
            contract in 2017-18 and a regular, one-season contract for 2018-19, then he
            is an Early Bird free agent in 2019.</li>
        <li>If a team renounces a player (see question number <a href="#Q39">39</a>), they
            can't use the Bird exception to re-sign him. However, if that team then re-signs
            the player by some other means (for example, with cap room), the team reclaims
            its Bird rights.</li>
        <li>Bird rights accrue for a player signed to a Two-Way contract (see question
            number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) the same as for a player signed to a standard
            NBA contract.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="Q33" class="question">
      <h4>33. Why a three-year wait before gaining Bird rights?</h4>

      <p>
        It closed a salary cap loophole. There used to be no waiting period,
        but this was abused by Portland with Chris Dudley and Phoenix with
        Danny Manning. Both teams signed these players to one-year deals at
        small salaries. The next year, Bird rights in hand, they signed new
        contracts far in excess of the cap. The three-year rule prevents
        these types of cap circumventions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q34" class="question">
      <h4>34. Does having Bird rights mean that free agents can be signed and not
              count against the cap?</h4>

      <p>
        With very few exceptions, all salaries are included in team salary.
        The Bird exception simply enables a team to exceed the cap to sign
        certain players. The player's new salary applies toward the team
        salary just like the salaries of the team's other players. So if a
        team is over the cap and uses the Bird exception to re-sign its own
        free agent, it will end up farther over the cap.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q35" class="question">
      <h4>35. I just saw that a team signed a player for more money than it has under the cap.
          It was another team's free agent, so the Bird exception wasn't used. What gives?</h4>

      <p>
        If one of the other exceptions wasn't used, it may just be the way the
        deal was reported. In most cases, only the first season's salary must
        fit under the cap, but signings are often reported using the total salary
        for the entire contract. For example, if a team is $10 million under the
        cap, they can sign a player to a four-year contract for $10 million, $10.5
        million, $11 million and $11.5 million, respectively, for the four
        seasons. The deal then gets reported as four years for $43 million.
        But only the first-year salary counts when determining whether the
        team has enough cap room, and the first-year salary fits perfectly.

    </div>

    <div id="Q36" class="question">
      <h4>36. Can a team with cap room sign all the free agents it wants (up to the salary cap) and
              THEN re-sign its own free agents using the Bird exception?</h4>

      <p>
        A team's ability to do this is very limited. The team's free agents continue to
        be included in team salary. This charge is called the "free agent amount," which
        is a form of cap hold. There may not be enough money available under the cap to
        sign another team's free agent, because the team's own free agents are taking up
        all its cap room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Essentially, if a team retains the right (i.e., Bird rights) to sign a player
        while above the cap, the league assumes the team will do so, and sets aside
        an amount of money under the team's cap in anticipation of that signing. This
        keeps teams from signing other teams' free agents using their cap room, and
        then turning their attention to their own free agents once their cap room is
        all used up, using the Bird exception to re-sign their own players.
      </p>

      <p>
        The free agent amount is based on the player's current status (type of free
        agent, whether coming off a rookie contract, and previous salary), as a rough
        guideline to predict the amount he is likely to receive in his next contract.
        Such a rough guideline obviously is not perfect -- for example, in 2015 Kawhi
        Leonard's free agent amount was just $7.2 million, even though his value as a
        basketball player was much higher. By waiting to sign Leonard last, the Spurs
        also were able to sign LaMarcus Aldridge away from the Trailblazers. Had they
        instead signed Leonard first, they would not have had enough cap room to sign
        Aldridge. They eventually re-signed Leonard for a starting salary of $16.4
        million.

    <div id="Q37" class="question">
      <h4>37. How much do free agents count toward team salary?</h4>

      <p>
        Here's an example of how to use this chart: Let's say a player who made
        $10 million during the previous season becomes an Early Bird free agent,
        and is not coming off the second season of his rookie scale contract.
        According to this chart, the player's free agent amount is 130% of his
        previous salary. So $13 million is included in team salary while he
        is a free agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of determining a player's free agent amount, they use the
        player's base salary from the previous season, plus any portion of a
        signing bonus that was attributed to the previous season (see question
        number <a href="#Q75">75</a>), plus any incentives (see question number
        <a href="#Q74">74</a>) that were actually earned (whether they previously
        were likely or unlikely). This also means that if the player was signed
        pursuant to the Gilbert Arenas provision (see question number
        <a href="#Q43">43</a>, his offer sheet was matched by his previous team,
        and that team chose to count the average salary in the entire contract
        toward its team salary, then the player's free agent amount is based on
        the player's actual salary, and not the team salary value.
      </p>

      <p>
        A restricted free agent is included in team salary by the <em>greatest</em> of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>His free agent amount (as defined in the table above)</li>
        <li>The amount of his qualifying offer (see question number

      <h4>38. When do free agents stop counting against team salary?</h4>

      <p>
        Free agents continue to be included in team salary until one of the following
        happens:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The player signs a new contract with the same team. When this happens, the
            team salary reflects the player's new salary rather than his cap hold.</li>
        <li>The player signs with a different team. As soon as this happens, the player
            becomes his new team's problem, and his salary no longer counts against his
            old team.</li>
        <li>The team renounces the player. (See question number <a href="#Q39">39</a>)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="Q39" class="question">
      <h4>39. What does renouncing a player mean?</h4>

      <p>
        As detailed in question number <a href="#Q36">36</a>, free agents continue
        to be included in team salary. By renouncing a player, a team gives up its
        right to use the Larry Bird, Early Bird, or Non-Bird exception (see question
        number <a href="#Q25">25</a>) to re-sign that player. A renounced player no
        longer counts toward team salary, so teams use renouncement to gain additional
        cap room. Teams are still permitted to re-sign renounced players, but only
        with cap room or an exception other than the Bird exception<sup>1</sup>. The
        exception to this rule is that an Early Bird free agent, at the team's option,
        can be renounced to the Non-Bird level. A team might do this in order to sign
        the player to a one-year contract, instead of the minimum two years required
        by the Early Bird exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player does not sign with any team (his prior team or any other team)
        for the entire season, then his renouncement continues. In other words, the
        team is not permitted to renounce a player, let him sit idle for the year, and
        then re-sign him the following summer using Bird rights. However, if the player
        is renounced and then re-signs with his prior team, his renouncement is no longer
        in effect when his contract ends. For example, if a team renounces their Larry
        Bird rights to a player, then re-signs that player to a one-year contract using
        cap room, the player will be a Larry Bird free agent once again the following
        summer.
      </p>

      <p>
        After renouncing a player, a team <em>can</em> still sign the player to a
        Two-Way contract (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) or trade the
        player in a sign-and-trade agreement (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>).

              raises associated with the means they use to sign the player -- for example,

              Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, the contract must conform to the

              the player can still receive the contract length and raises associated with
              the Bird exception. This is because the maximum contract length and
              raises in a cap room signing are determined by the player's original

      <p>
        Only in one specific circumstance -- when they renounce one or more of their
        players in order to create enough cap room to sign another team's restricted
        free agent, but the restricted free agent's original team matches the offer
        sheet and keeps him. If that happens, the team can rescind the renouncement.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, a team can't rescind a renouncement if doing so takes them from
        below the salary cap to above it; or if they are already above the cap and
        rescinding the renouncement takes them farther above the cap than they were
        before the renouncement. This closes a loophole -- it prevents a team from
        rescinding a player in order to make an offer, then if the offer isn't
        accepted using the resulting cap space to sign another free agent, before
        rescinding the renouncement to get back the renounced player's Bird rights.

      <h4>42. What is restricted free agency?</h4>

      <p>
        There are two types of free agency: unrestricted and restricted. An
        unrestricted free agent is free to sign with any other team, and
        there's nothing the player's original team can do to prevent it.
        Restricted free agency gives the player's original team the right
        to keep the player by matching a contract the player signs with
        another team. This is called the "right of first refusal."
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Restricted free agency exists only on a limited basis:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Following the fourth year of rookie "scale" contracts for
            first round draft picks (see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>).</li>
        <li>For most veteran free agents who have been in the league three
            or fewer seasons. One exception is a first round draft pick
            following his second or third season if his team does not
            exercise its option to extend his rookie scale contract for
            the next season. Such players are <em>unrestricted</em> free
            agents rather than restricted. The other exception is players
            coming off a Two-Way contract (see question number
            <a href="#Q82">82</a>). For Two-Way players, the years of
            service is ignored, and instead the days on the NBA roster
            is the determining factor (see below).</li>
        <li>Following a Two-Way contract, if the player was on an NBA
            active roster or inactive list for at least 15 days in the
            preceding regular season.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All other free agency is limited to unrestricted free agency.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to make their free agent a restricted free agent, a team
        must submit a <strong>qualifying offer</strong> to the player between
        the day following the last game of the NBA Finals and June 29. The
        qualifying offer is a standing offer for a one-year guaranteed
        contract, which becomes a regular contact if the player decides to
        sign it. This ensures that the team does not gain the right of first
        refusal without offering a contract themselves. The amount of the
        qualifying offer depends on the situation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For players on rookie "scale" contracts the qualifying offer
            amount is based on the player's draft position, and is set in
            the rookie scale (see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>).</li>
        <li>For players coming off Two-Way contracts where the player is no
            longer eligible to sign another Two-Way contract<sup>1</sup>, the
            qualifying offer is a standard NBA contract with the minimum
            salary based on years of service, with at least the Two-Way
            G-League amount guaranteed.</li>
        <li>For all other players coming off Two-Way contracts, the qualifying
            offer is a Two-Way contract, for the standard Two-Way salary, with
            $50,000 protected.</li>
        <li>For all other players, the qualifying offer must be for 125% of
            the player's previous salary, or the player's minimum salary (see
            question number <a href="#Q22">22</a>) plus $200,000, whichever
            is greater.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        However, a player coming off a standard NBA contract (not a Two-Way
        contract) may qualify for a higher or lower qualifying offer based
        on whether or not he met the "starter criteria" in the previous season,
        or in the average of the previous two seasons. The starter criteria
        are based on starting at least 41 games or playing at least 2,000
        minutes in the regular season.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the player was drafted with picks 10-30 and met the starter criteria,
            his qualifying offer equals the amount of the qualifying offer<sup>2</sup>
            applicable to the ninth pick in the same draft class.</li>
        <li>If a second round pick or undrafted player met the starter criteria following
            his second or third season in the league, his qualifying offer equals the
            amount of the qualifying offer applicable to the 21st pick in the first round
            of the draft class whose rookie scale contract is now finishing<sup>3</sup>,
            if this amount is higher than the qualifying offer he otherwise would have
            received.</li>
        <li>If the player was drafted with picks 1-14 and did <em>not</em> meet the
            starter criteria, his qualifying offer can be no higher than the amount
            of the qualifying offer<sup>2</sup> applicable to the 15th pick in the
            same draft class.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A qualifying offer automatically expires on October 1, unless it
        is extended by the team (which is rarely done). A qualifying
        offer cannot be extended past March 1. If the deadline passes and
        the qualifying offer is neither withdrawn nor accepted, the
        player continues to be a restricted free agent. The team and player
        are free to negotiate a new contract after the qualifying offer
        expires -- the deadline only affects the player's ability to accept
        his qualifying offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player is coming off the fourth year of his rookie scale
        contract, then in addition to a qualifying offer, his team can also
        submit a <strong>maximum qualifying offer</strong>. A maximum
        qualifying offer is for five seasons at the maximum salary with
        8% annual raises. It can contain no options, ETOs or bonuses of
        any kind, and must be fully guaranteed. When a team submits a maximum
        qualifying offer (in essence "stepping up" with a maximum
        contract offer before the player hits the free agent market), it
        places a more stringent requirement on other teams' offer sheets
        (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        A player can elect to accept his qualifying offer and play the
        following season under its terms. This is sometimes done in order
        to become an unrestricted free agent the following summer (see
        question number <a href="#Q44">44</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        When a restricted free agent wants to sign with another team, the
        player and team sign an <strong>offer sheet</strong>, the principal
        terms of which the original team is given two days to match.<sup>4</sup>
        The offer sheet must be for at least two seasons (not including option
        years), and a standard NBA contract (not a Two-Way contract). If the
        player's prior team also submitted a maximum qualifying offer, then the
        offer sheet must be for at least three seasons (not including option
        years). If the player's original team exercises its right of first
        refusal within two days (by issuing a <strong>First Refusal Exercise
        Notice</strong>), the player is then under contract to his original
        team, at the principal terms of the offer sheet (but not the non-principal
        terms). If the player's original team does not exercise its right of
        first refusal within two days (or provides written notice that it is
        declining its right of first refusal), the player is deemed to be under
        contract with the new team.
      </p>

      <p>
        The principal terms of an offer sheet consist of the following. Any
        other terms of an offer are not considered to be principal terms,
        and the player's original team is not required to match:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The number of years, including option years.<sup>5</sup></li>
        <li>The base salary</li>
        <li>The amount of any signing bonus or deferred compensation,
            including the payment schedule</li>
        <li>Certain bonuses -- those considered to be "likely"
            for both teams (see question number <a href="#Q74">74</a>),
            and those based on generally recognized league honors<sup>6</sup></li>
        <li>Any allowable amendments such as guarantees, options and trade
            bonuses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Both an offer sheet and a first refusal exercise notice can be
        conditioned on the player passing a physical. If the offer sheet
        team requires a physical which the player subsequently fails, and
        the offer sheet is matched, then the matching team may elect to
        continue, in which case the match remains in effect, or elect not
        to continue, in which case the player becomes a restricted free
        agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the first refusal exercise notice is conditioned on the player
        passing a physical, and the player subsequently fails, then the
        matching team can withdraw its first refusal exercise notice, at
        which time the player is deemed to be under contract with the offer
        sheet team. If the matching team does not withdraw its first refusal
        exercise notice, then the team is considered to have waived the
        physical, and the player is deemed to be under contract with the
        matching team.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player refuses to report for his physical with the matching
        team within two days, the first refusal exercise notice remains in
        effect until the player reports. The matching team also has the
        option to withdraw its first refusal exercise notice if the player
        refuses to report for his physical. If this happens, then both the
        first refusal exercise notice and the offer sheet are invalidated,
        the player returns to being a restricted free agent, and he cannot
        sign with or be acquired by the offer sheet team for one year.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with any contract offer, a team must have enough room -- either
        cap room or room provided by an exception -- for the offer sheet. It
        must maintain the necessary room from the time the offer sheet is
        signed until the time the new contract is in place or the player's
        prior team exercises its right of first refusal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Likewise, the player's prior team cannot match an offer sheet that
        is greater than its room -- again, either cap room or a satisfactory
        exception<sup>7</sup> -- and must maintain the necessary room from
        the time it gives notice of first refusal to the time the new contract
        is in place. In order to match an offer sheet, the matching team must
        have room for both the regular salary and any unlikely bonuses.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are additional restrictions placed on offer sheets for players
        with one or two years in the league, under a rule known as the
        "Gilbert Arenas provision." This provision helps enable
        teams to retain their restricted free agents under certain
        circumstances. This is described in question number <a href="#Q43">43</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        An offer sheet can be signed during the July Moratorium (see
        question number <a href="#Q105">105</a>), however the two-day
        matching period does not commence until the end of the Moratorium.
        An offer sheet cannot be signed after March 1. If the player
        does not sign an offer sheet by that date, his only choice is to
        re-sign with his previous team (or remain unsigned for the rest
        of the season). This happened with Wilson Chandler, who signed
        in China during the 2011 lockout and did not return to the NBA
        until after March 1, 2012. Chandler ended up re-signing with the
        Nuggets to a five-year contract shortly after returning to the
        United States.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team may relinquish its right of first refusal, making the player
        an <em>unrestricted</em> free agent. If a qualifying offer is
        outstanding, the team can withdraw it unilaterally through July
        13. It can be withdrawn after July 13 if the player
        consents, in which case the player is also renounced as a free
        agent<sup>8</sup> (see question number <a href="#Q39">39</a>). If
        a qualifying offer is <em>not</em> outstanding, then a team can
        relinquish its right of first refusal at any time by providing
        written notice<sup>9</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To summarize, a restricted free agent essentially has six options:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>He can accept his prior team's qualifying offer, play for one
            season, and become a free agent again the following summer.</li>
        <li>He can accept his prior team's maximum qualifying offer (if
            applicable, and if one has been submitted) and play under a
            long-term contract at the maximum salary.</li>
        <li>He can negotiate a new contract with his prior team that is
            independent of the qualifying offer or maximum qualifying offer.</li>
        <li>He can sign an offer sheet with another team through March 1,
            which his prior team is given the opportunity to match.</li>
        <li>He can negotiate a sign-and-trade (see question number
            <a href="#Q92">92</a>) if he has not signed an offer sheet with
            another team.</li>
        <li>He can do nothing, but if he doesn't sign a qualifying offer,
            a contract, or an offer sheet for one year, his prior team can
            submit a new qualifying offer (or maximum qualifying offer),
            and the player becomes a restricted free agent again the
            following offseason.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There can be no compensation given to a team in return for their
        submitting or not submitting an offer sheet, or for matching or
        not matching an offer to a restricted free agent. For example,
        Houston could not sign Golden State's restricted free agent to
        an offer sheet, then send Golden State a draft pick in exchange
        for their not matching the offer. Teams also can't try to scare
        teams that might sign their restricted free agents, for example
        by declaring publicly that they will match any and all offers.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team matches an offer sheet and retains its free agent, then
        for one year they cannot trade him without his consent, and during
        that year cannot trade him at all to the team that signed him to
        the offer sheet. They also can't trade the player in a sign-and-trade
        transaction (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>). A restricted
        free agent's resulting contract (whether with the new team or the
        contract is matched by the player's prior team) cannot be amended in
        any manner for one year.

      <h4>43. What is the "Gilbert Arenas" provision?</h4>

      <p>
        Before 2005 it was sometimes possible to sign restricted free agents
        to offer sheets their original teams couldn't match. This happened
        when a player was an Early Bird or Non-Bird free agent (see question
        number <a href="#Q25">25</a>) and the team didn't have enough cap room
        to match a sufficiently large offer. For example, Gilbert Arenas was
        Golden State's second round draft pick in 2001, and became an Early
        Bird free agent in 2003. Golden State could only match an offer sheet
        (or sign Arenas directly) for up to the amount of the Early Bird
        exception, which was about $4.9 million at the time. Washington signed
        Arenas to an offer sheet with a starting salary of about $8.5 million,
        which Golden State was powerless to match.
      </p>

      <p>
        This loophole was addressed starting with the 2005 CBA (although not
        closed completely -- see below). Teams are now limited in the salary
        they can offer in an offer sheet to a restricted free agent with one
        or two years in the league. The first-year salary in the offer sheet
        cannot be greater than the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (see
        question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>). Limiting the first-year salary
        in this way enables the player's original team to match the offer
        sheet by using the Early Bird exception (if applicable -- see question
        number <a href="#Q25">25</a>), or Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        (provided they have it and haven't used it already)<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second-year salary in such an offer sheet is limited to the standard
        5% raise. The third-year salary can jump considerably -- it is allowed
        to be as high as it would have been had the first-year salary not been
        limited by this rule to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception<sup>2</sup>.
        The salary in the fourth season may increase (or decrease) by up to 4.5%
        of the salary in the third season. The offer sheet can only contain the
        large jump in the third season if it provides the highest salary allowed
        in the first two seasons, it is fully guaranteed, and it contains no
        bonuses of any kind.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the raise in the third season exceeds the standard raise (5% of the
        salary in the first season of the contract), then an additional restriction
        exists. In order to determine how large the offer can be, the team doesn't
        just have to fit the first-year salary under the cap. Instead, it must
        fit the average salary in the entire contract under the cap. So a team $8
        million under the cap is limited to offering a total of $24 million over
        three years, or $32 million over four years. If the offer sheet does not
        contain a third-season raise larger than 5% of the first-season salary,
        then the team only has to fit the first season salary under the cap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Putting this all together, if a team that is $12 million under the cap in
        2017-18 wants to submit a four-year offer sheet, and wants to provide
        a large raise in the third season, it can offer a total of $48 million
        over four years. The first-year salary is limited to the Non-Taxpayer
        Mid-Level exception, or $8.406 million. The second-year salary will be
        $8.8263 million (5% raise). This leaves $30.768 million to be distributed
        over the final two seasons of the contract, with a 4.5% raise from year three
        to year four. So the entire contract looks like this:

      </tbody></table>

      <p>
        For the team making this offer, this contract would count for $12.0
        million (i.e., the average salary in the contract) of team salary in
        each of the four seasons if they sign the player. If the player's
        prior team matches the offer and keeps the player, it can choose
        whether the actual salary in each season or the average salary counts
        toward its team salary<sup>4</sup>. The matching team is allowed to
        use any available exception (e.g., the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level or the
        Early Bird) to match the offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since a team must fit the average salary from the entire contract under
        the cap in order to offer the large third-season raise, it must have
        some amount of cap room above the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception
        amount in order to effectively utilize this provision. For example,
        suppose the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception amount is $10 million, and
        a team wants to provide a four-year offer sheet. If they offer a
        third-year raise greater than 5%, their cap hit will be determined by
        the contract's average salary, so the total contract can pay up to $40
        million. However, since a four-year offer starting at $10 million with
        standard 5% raises would total $43 million, the Arenas provision
        would be ineffective unless it offered more than this amount. So the
        team in this example would need more than $10.75 million in cap room in
        order to effectively utilize the provision.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I said above, the loophole was addressed with this rule, but not
        closed completely. The Gilbert Arenas provision is primarily intended
        to protect teams from losing their successful second round picks, who
        are typically Early Bird free agents after two years. There are several
        situations where a team still might be unable to match an offer sheet:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the player is a Non-Bird free agent, the team only has the Taxpayer
            Mid-Level exception, and the offer sheet is higher or for more years
            than allowed by the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception.</li>
        <li>If the player is a Non-Bird free agent and the team already used
            their Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to sign another player.</li>
        <li>If the player is a Non-Bird or Early Bird free agent with three
            years in the league (this rule applies only to players with one or
            two years in the league).</li>
        <li>If a team has two Non-Bird free agents with one or two years in
            the league. They can use their Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to
            keep one of them, but would lose the other.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="Q44" class="question">
      <h4>44. Haven't some restricted free agents gotten away anyway? How did this happen?</h4>

      <p>
        For one, the team can simply decide not to match the offer sheet. If this
        happens, the offer sheet is reduced to an official contract with the new
        team after two days. The team can also provide the league with a written
        statement declining their right to match the offer sheet, in which case
        the player becomes a member of his new team right away.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is sometimes possible to sign a player to an offer sheet his prior
        team cannot match, as described in question number <a href="#Q43">43</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q45" class="question">
      <h4>45. What if a restricted free agent has no interest in staying with his original team?
          Is there any way he can force the issue?</h4>

      <p>
        If the player really wants to leave, he can sign his original team's
        qualifying offer, which constitutes a one-year contract at a scale
        salary. He must then play with his original team for one season, and
        following that season he will become a free agent again. If he meets
        the tenure requirement he will be an <em>unrestricted</em> free agent,
        and then can sign with any other team.
      </p>

      <p>
        This strategy typically would not be effective for players who would
        continue to be subject to restricted free agency. For example, if a
        second round pick completes a two-year contract, he will be a restricted
        free agent at the end of his second year. But if he accepts his
        qualifying offer and plays an additional season with his previous team,
        he would be a three-year veteran the following summer and therefore
        still subject to restricted free agency.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q46" class="question">
      <h4>46. Does a team receive compensation when another team signs their free agent,
          like in some other sports?</h4>

      <p>
        No. A team that loses a free agent does not receive anything. It used
        to be the case in the NBA a long time ago, but not any longer. Perhaps the
        most famous example of this is when the Lakers' Gail Goodrich signed as
        a free agent with the New Orleans Jazz. The Lakers received a draft pick
        as compensation, which turned out to be Magic Johnson.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q47" class="question">
      <h4>47. First round draft picks operate under a different set of rules?</h4>

      <p>
        Yes. There's a salary scale for first round draft picks and their first
        contracts. They do this because it was once common for rookies to
        hold out, not signing with their team until they got the contract they
        wanted. There also was backlash from the veteran players who saw rookies
        with no NBA experience getting more money than they were. The last year
        without a salary scale was 1994, when it was rumored that first overall
        pick Glenn Robinson was going to hold out for $100 million, and he
        eventually signed a 10-year, $68.15 million contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beginning in 1995 salaries for first round picks were set according
        to a strict scale, determined by their draft position. In previous
        CBAs the salary scales for all seasons were negotiated into the agreement.
        In the current CBA only the 2017-18 salary scale was determined in
        advance. Starting in 2018-19 they determine the salary scale for the
        upcoming season on or before June 30. The scale is calculated by
        applying the percentage change in the salary cap to all dollar amounts
        in the previous rookie salary scale. For example, if the salary cap
        increases by 4% from 2021-22 to 2022-23, then all rookie scale amounts
        also will increase by 4% from 2021-22 to 2022-23. Any scale amounts
        that are expressed as a percentage (for example, the raise from the
        third season to the fourth season) do not change from year to year.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a special procedure in place to phase-in a 45% increase
        to the rookie salary scales for the 2017-18 through 2019-20
        seasons (15% per year over three years). There is a "baseline" scale
        for 2017-18 that does not include the 15% increase used for the actual
        2017-18 rookie scale. For 2018-19 they first apply the percentage
        change in the salary cap from 2017-18 (as described above) to the
        2017-18 baseline scale to create the 2018-19 baseline scale, and then
        they increase all resulting amounts by 30% to create the actual rookie
        scale. For 2019-20 they repeat the process, starting with the baseline
        scale for 2018-19, applying the cap percentage increase or decrease to
        create the 2019-20 baseline scale, and then applying a 45% increase to
        create the 2019-20 rookie scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rookie scale contracts that pre-date the current CBA also receive the
        phased-in increase (15% in 2017-18, 30% in 2018-19, and 45% in 2019-20),
        called a "conforming increase." These increases are funded out of a
        league-wide pool created for this purpose. The player's official salary
        value does not include the increase amount, nor is the increase amount
        included in the team's team salary. However, these increases count
        toward the players aggregate salary guarantee (see question number
        <a href="#Q15">15</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If a salary in an existing rookie scale contract is below the minimum salary
        for that season, even after the phased-in increase, then it is further
        increased to the minimum salary. If this happens, then the increase is not
        funded by the league-wide pool, and the minimum salary is used both for the
        player's official salary value and for team salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rookie scale contracts are always for two seasons, with team options
        for the third and fourth seasons. Scale amounts are provided for the
        first three years (two guaranteed years and the first team option
        year), and the fourth year (second team option year) is defined in
        terms of the percentage raise over the year-three salary (with all other
        terms and conditions unchanged from the first option year). The salary
        scale also dictates the amount of the qualifying offer should the
        player become a restricted free agent (see question number
        <a href="#Q42">42</a>) following his fourth season.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team may sign a player for as little as 80% or as much as 120% of the scale
        salary figure. Teams usually spring for the full 120%, but there have been
        exceptions. Teams over the salary cap use the Rookie exception to sign their
        first round picks (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>).
      </p>

        The full rookie scale amounts for the current and all previous seasons
        can be found <a href="http://www.cbafaq.com/scale17.htm">HERE</a>.
        As an example, here are the scale salary figures for the #1 overall draft
        pick in 2017-18, along with the 80% (minimum) and 120% (maximum) amounts,
        and also the "baseline" amounts (as explained above):

      <p>
        If the player is not signed by January 10, the scale amount pro-rates (reduces
        in value) each day for the remainder of the season. For example, if there are 177
        days in the season, then the scale amount reduces by 1/177th each day starting
        January 10, until the player is signed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The exact percentage increase for the fourth (second team option) year and
        qualifying offer varies by the player's draft position. For the fourth
        (second team option) year it is 26.1% for the first pick, scaling up to
        80.5% for the 30th pick. For the qualifying offer it's 30.0% for the first
        pick, scaling up to 50.0% for the 30th pick.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams have until the October 31<sup>1</sup> preceding the player's second
        regular season to exercise their option for the player's third season. Likewise,
        they have until the October 31<sup>1</sup> preceding the player's third
        regular season to exercise their option for the player's fourth season (see
        question number <a href="#Q57">57</a> for more information on options). If
        the team invokes both options (keeping the player for all four seasons)
        and submits a qualifying offer after the fourth season, then the player
        becomes a restricted free agent (see question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>
        for more information on restricted free agency). If the team declines 
        either option, then the player enters free agency as an unrestricted free
        agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if the team declines either option and the player becomes a free
        agent, the team cannot re-sign him to a salary greater than he would have
        received had the team exercised its option. In other words, teams can't
        decline an option year in order to get around the rookie salary scale and
        give the player more money. This applies to all types of signings, including
        the Bird exception, the Mid-Level exception, and cap room. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The qualifying offer for a player coming off a rookie scale contract is
        a defined percentage over his fourth-year salary. The percentage is set in
        the rookie scale based on the player's draft position. However, the player
        may qualify for a higher or lower qualifying offer based on whether or not
        he met the "starter criteria" in the previous season, or in the
        average of the previous two seasons (see question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        A buyout to an international team or organization is the only form of
        signing bonus allowed in a rookie scale contract (see question number
        <a href="#Q77">77</a>). Performance bonuses are allowed in rookie scale
        contracts, but only with respect to the salary above 80% of the scale
        amount (see question number <a href="#Q74">74</a>). Loans are not permitted
        with rookie scale contracts (see question number <a href="#Q115">115</a>). 
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams select players in the draft at their own risk. If a player's draft
        eligibility is contested, the league will investigate. If the player is
        determined to be ineligible, the team will have forfeited the pick it used
        to select the player.

      <h4>48. What about second round draft picks? What rules do they operate under?</h4>

      <p>
        Unlike first round picks, who have a scale salary (see question number
        <a href="#Q47">47</a>), second round picks do not have any specific
        salary restrictions. They may sign for any amount from the minimum to
        the maximum, but players who last to the second round of the draft
        seldom command more than the minimum salary. A second round picks may also
        be signed to a Two-Way contract<sup>1</sup> (see question number
        <a href="#Q82">82</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Also unlike first round picks, teams do not receive a salary cap
        exception specifically for their second round picks. These players
        must be signed using cap room or an available exception (see question
        number <a href="#Q25">25</a>), such as the Minimum Player Salary exception
        or the Mid-Level exception. It is most common for a second round
        pick to receive the minimum salary and be signed using the Minimum
        Player Salary exception. However, since the Minimum Player Salary exception
        limits contracts to two seasons, it is not uncommon for teams to use a
        portion of their Mid-Level exception in order to sign the player for
        three seasons. This gives the team full Bird rights at the end of
        the contract, and avoids the Gilbert Arenas provision (see question
        number <a href="#Q43">43</a>).
      </p>

        Unsigned second round draft picks do not have a cap hold.

          How long does the team keep his draft rights?</h4>

      <p>
        The player's options are limited. What happens depends on a number of factors:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the player is already under contract to, or signs a contract with a
            non-NBA team, the drafting team retains the player's draft rights for one
            year after the player's obligation to the non-NBA team ends. Essentially,
            the clock stops as long as the player plays pro ball outside the NBA.
            Players are not included in team salary during the regular season while
            the player is under contract with a non-NBA team.</li>
        <li>If the player goes on to play college ball after he was drafted, then the
            team retains the player's draft rights until one year following the draft
            the player would have entered had he not declared early. For example, if
            a team drafts a college sophomore in 2017 and he returns to college and
            plays intercollegiate basketball, then they retain his draft rights until
            the 2020 draft. Note that the NCAA rules state that players lose their
            NCAA eligibility if they are drafted, so the player currently cannot return
            or go on to play college ball. This rule exists in the CBA in the event
            the NCAA rules ever change.</li>
        <li>If the player was eligible to play in college before he was drafted but
            does not go on to play college basketball, then the team retains the player's
            draft rights until the draft the player would have entered had he not declared
            early. For example, if a team drafts a college sophomore in 2017 and he does
            <em>not</em> return to college and play intercollegiate basketball, they
            retain his draft rights until the 2019 draft.</li>
        <li>For all other players, the team retains the player's draft rights until
            the date of the next draft.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In any of the above cases, if the team does not sign the player in the
        allotted time, the player can enter the next draft. If the team that selects
        the player in the next draft doesn't sign him either, he becomes a rookie
        free agent on the date of the following draft.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a team signs a first round draft pick within three years after he is drafted,
        they use the salary scale for the year in which he signs (usually the player signs
        in the same year he is drafted). After three years they have the option of either
        using the salary scale or signing him as if he was a free agent -- using their cap
        room or any available exception, with the standard raises. They can only do the
        latter if the player did not play intercollegiately in the interim. Such a contract
        must be for at least three seasons, and the salary in the first season must be
        greater than 120% of the applicable rookie scale amount.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q50" class="question">
      <h4>50. Are draft picks included in team salary? If so, for how much?</h4>

      <p>
        Unsigned first round picks are included in team salary at 120% of the player's
        scale salary amount immediately upon their selection in the draft. Once a first
        round pick signs a contract, his actual salary is included in the team salary,
        of course.
      </p>

      <p>
        An unsigned first round pick is removed from team salary if the team and
        player both agree in writing not to sign any contract through the following
        June 30. The scale amount is returned to the team salary the following July 1.
        If the team <em>renounces</em> its draft rights, the player's scale amount is
        removed from the team salary permanently, and the team relinquishes its draft
        rights to the player (see question number <a href="#Q52">52</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If a first round pick signs with a non-NBA team, his scale amount is
        excluded from the team salary on the date he signs his non-NBA contract
        or the first day of the regular season, whichever is later. The scale
        amount goes back onto the team salary on the following July 1 or when
        his non-NBA contract ends, whichever is earlier. In other words, these
        cap holds are removed for players playing outside the NBA, but only
        during the regular season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unsigned second round picks are not included in team salary. This is a
        loophole teams sometimes leverage by trading late first round picks for
        early second round picks in order to clear cap room.
      </p>

      <p>
        As described in question number <a href="#Q89">89</a>, the <em>trade
        value</em> of an unsigned first or second round draft pick is always $0.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q51" class="question">
      <h4>51. What if a team likes its first round pick and wants to sign him, but either feels
          he isn't worth the scale salary or doesn't want to commit to two seasons?</h4>

      <p>
        They're stuck. In essence, this makes late first round picks less valuable,
        because they force teams to make a two-year commitment to a marginal player.
        In 1996, rather than give their first round pick Travis Knight (29th overall)
        a contract with a (then) three-year guarantee, the Bulls renounced him, making
        him a free agent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q52" class="question">
      <h4>52. If a first round draft pick is renounced, is he still bound to the salary scale
          for a first round pick?</h4>

      <p>
        No. The salary scale only applies to the team that drafts the player or the
        team to which the player's draft rights are traded. When Chicago renounced
        first round pick Travis Knight in 1996, he then signed with the Lakers for
        one year at the league minimum salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since a renounced draft pick is not constrained by the rookie scale, he is
        also free to negotiate a larger contract. It is therefore possible for the
        renouncement to work to the player's advantage.

      <h4>53. Is there a limit to the length of a contract, or to the amount a player's
              salary can increase or decrease from year to year?</h4>

      <p>
        The maximum years and raises depend on the type of contract, however the "standard"
        maximum length is four seasons and the "standard" maximum raise is 5%<sup>1</sup>

      <p>
        The raise limit also applies to salary decreases -- for example, since the
        Larry Bird exception limits raises to 8% of the first-year salary, the
        salary may also decrease by up to 8% of the first-year salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The percentage (5% or 8%) applies to regular salary, i.e., the player's
        base salary, not including signing bonuses or anything treated like a signing
        bonus (see question number <a href="#Q75">75</a>). The same limit also usually
        applies separately to likely and unlikely incentives (see question number
        <a href="#Q74">74</a>), and to the total salary (which includes signing bonuses
        and anything treated like a signing bonus). Because of this rule, certain
        combinations of signing bonuses and non-guaranteed salary are incompatible.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, suppose a team has $9 million of cap room and uses it to sign a
        player for four years with 5% raises. The first three seasons are fully
        guaranteed and the fourth season is non-guaranteed. The player also receives
        a 15% signing bonus. This contract would not be legal. Here's why (see question
        number <a href="#Q75">75</a> for more information on the allocation of signing
        bonuses):

        The base salary in the first season is $7,183,099, and 5% of that amount
        is $359,155 which is the maximum amount that either the base salary or the
        total salary (the rightmost column) can change (up or down) from year to year.
        However, in the fourth season the total salary decreases by $1,457,746,
        because the non-guarantee means that none of the signing bonus is allocated
        to that season. This contract could be fixed in a number of ways, by adjusting
        the raises, the guarantees and/or the signing bonus. For example, the following

      <h4>55. Are there restrictions based on a player's age?</h4>

      <p>
        There are rules regarding the minimum age for draft eligibility. A player can't play
        in the NBA unless he's been eligible for at least one draft (he doesn't have to actually
        be drafted, he just has to have been eligible). A player who is eligible for a draft must
        be at least 19 during the calendar year of that draft, and if a U.S. player, at least one
        year removed from high school. In addition, at least one of the following must be true:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The player has graduated from a U.S. four-year college or university prior to or
            during the calendar year of the draft, and has no remaining NCAA eligibility.</li>
        <li>The player is attending or has previously attended a U.S. four-year college or
            university, his original class has graduated prior to or during the calendar year
            of the draft, and has no remaining NCAA eligibility.</li>
        <li>The player attended high school in the U.S., did not attend college, and four
            years have elapsed since he graduated (or his class graduated, if he did not
            graduate).</li>
        <li>The player has played as a professional outside the NBA prior to January 1
            of the draft year.</li>
        <li>The player has declared himself an "Early Entry" player.</li>
        <li>The player is an international player (see question number <a href="#Q76">76</a>)
            for whom at least one of the following is true:
            <ul>
              <li>Is 22 during the calendar year of the draft (an international player
                  who is older than 22 and was not drafted in the year of his 22nd birthday
                  is a free agent)</li>
              <li>Has played as a professional in the U.S. but outside the NBA</li>
              <li>Has declared himself an "Early Entry" player.</li>
            </ul></li>
      </ul>

        There are also rules which prevent teams from padding extra years onto
        contracts for older players. The "Over-38" rule is described in
        question number <a href="#Q56">56</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q56" class="question">
      <h4>56. What is the "Over-38" rule?</h4>

      <p>
        The Over-38<sup>1</sup> rule addresses a loophole. Suppose a player is nearing
        retirement, and he wants to finish his career with a team that can only offer
        him their Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. If they want to give this player
        more money than is allowed by the exception, they could instead offer a
        contract for more years than they expect the player to play -- continuing to
        pay the player past his retirement.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, suppose the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception is $9 million.
        With 5% raises, a three-year contract would total $28.35 million. But
        if they added a fourth year to the contract, the salary would total
        $38.7 million. If the player retires after three seasons and continues
        drawing his salary for the additional season, then he effectively will
        be paid $38.7 million for three years' work. In essence, they are giving
        the player a three-year contract with additional deferred compensation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This loophole is addressed by the Over-38 rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain contracts that extend past the player's 38th birthday are
        deemed Over-38 contracts. In an Over-38 contract, the presumption
        is that the seasons at the end of the contract are likely to come
        after the player retires. Therefore, the salaries in those seasons
        are classified as deferred compensation as described above. This is
        significant because deferred compensation is charged to team salary
        in the year it is <em>earned</em>, not the year it is <em>paid</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with the previous example, suppose the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level
        exception is $9 million, and a 36-year-old player signs a contract
        with 5% raises. Here are the three-year and four-year versions
        of the contract:

      <p>
        The four-year contract is classified as an Over-38 contract. In this contract,
        salary in the fourth season is classified as deferred compensation earned in
        the first three seasons. Therefore, the $10.35 million from the fourth season
        counts toward team salary in each of the first three seasons, in proportion
        to the salary in each of those seasons. The next chart shows the salary paid,
        the amount reclassified as deferred salary, and the total (paid plus deferred)
        counted against the cap in each season, at the time the contract is signed:

        Some things to note from this chart:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How are the amounts in the "Deferred" column determined? The
            fourth season's salary ($10,350,000) is treated as deferred compensation
            earned in the first three seasons. The total (non-deferred) amount
            earned in the first three seasons is $28.35 million. In the first
            season the player earns about 31.75% of the $28.35 million. Therefore,
            about 31.75% of the $10.35 million deferred amount, or $3,285,714, is
            charged against the cap in the first season. A similar calculation is
            performed for the second and third seasons.</li>
        <li>The total four-year salary is still $38.7 million. The fourth season's
            salary was simply shifted onto the first three seasons.</li>
        <li>The fourth season has a team salary amount of $0 when the contract is
            signed because the salary was shifted onto the earlier seasons. The CBA
            calls this a "zero year."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        But this shifting of salaries creates a big problem -- note that the cap
        amount in the first season is now greater than the team's $9 million
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception! To make the contract fit within the
        exception, the salaries need to be reduced:

      <p>
        As before, the salary from the fourth season is divided up and shifted
        onto the first three seasons, in proportion to the salaries earned in
        those seasons. In the first season, the reduced salary and deferred
        amounts now add up to exactly $9 million -- so the total fits within
        the team's Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note the effect the Over-38 rule has on the contract -- since the salary
        had to be reduced, the player earns exactly the same amount ($28.35
        million) over four years as he would have earned with a three-year contract
        that was not subject to the Over-38 rule. In other words, the Over-38 rule
        completely eliminates the advantage of adding the additional year onto the
        contract, effectively closing the loophole described earlier. It does not
        matter how many additional years are added on -- as more years are added,
        more salary is classified as deferred and counted against the cap in the
        earlier seasons, and the base salary in the earlier seasons has to be
        reduced further to fit the total within the maximum allowed amount. The
        player therefore receives no more money in a longer contract than he would
        receive in a three-year contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is sometimes reported that the Over-38 rule <em>prevents</em> teams from
        signing older players to long contracts, but this is false. Teams are not
        prevented from signing longer contracts -- the Over-38 rule simply removes
        the incentive for doing so<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Over-38 rule is mostly a remnant of earlier CBAs, when contracts could
        be longer and therefore more salary could be paid after the player retires.
        With contracts now limited to four or (in a few cases) five seasons, the
        overall impact of the Over-38 rule has been reduced.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what contracts are classified as Over-38 contracts, and in those
        contracts, what are the zero years? Like everything else related to this
        rule, it's complicated -- it depends on the length of the contract, the
        player's birthdate and age when the contract is signed, and whether the
        player was a full Bird free agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following chart indicates what free agent contracts are subject to the
        Over-38 rule, and which years are zero years. For example, if a 35-year-old
        Qualifying Veteran Free Agent (a player with full Bird rights) re-signs
        with his prior team for five seasons, then his contract is classified as
        Over-38, and the fifth season is considered a zero year. "N/A" indicates
        that the contract is not considered Over-38 because it is specifically
        excluded from the Over-38 rule in the CBA.

        * If he signs before October 1 and his birthday is October 1 or earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the Over-38 rule, seasons are defined to commence on October 1. So if the
        player's birthday is October 1 or later, then the season will commence
        <em>before</em> his birthday, but the Over-38 rule applies only to seasons that
        commence <em>after</em> the player's 38th birthday -- essentially gaining such
        players an extra year where the Over-38 rule doesn't apply. Also, if the player's
        birthday is during the July Moratorium (July 1-6) and he signs his contract on or
        before July 11, then he is not charged with being a year older when he signs.
        For example, if the player turns 35 on July 3 and he signs his contract on July 9,
        then for Over-38 purposes he is considered to be 34 when he signs his contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other notes about Over-38 contracts:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The columns in the chart for Qualifying Veteran Free Agents only apply when
            the player re-signs with his prior team. If the player signs with a different
            team, the "Other Free Agents" column applies instead.</li>
        <li>The Over-38 rule also applies to extensions and renegotiations. They always
            start counting from the date the extension or renegotiation is <em>signed</em>.
            For example, if a contract with two years remaining is extended by two
            additional years, it's counted as a four-year contract.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Over-38 rule has an additional component. As the player continues playing,
        and therefore proves wrong the assumption that he will retire before earning
        all his salary, the deferred salary stops being classified as deferred, and is
        shifted back onto the zero years of the contract. This begins to happen two
        seasons before the first zero year, and continues for each remaining year of
        the contract. In the previous example, the first (and only) zero year was
        the fourth season of the contract, so beginning with the second season, the
        team salary amount is readjusted. Here is the remainder of the contract at that
        point in time (copied from the previous example):

        amount, plus the cap amounts for the following two seasons (or however
        many remain if there are fewer than two), average them together, and

      <h4>57. What are option clauses? What kind of option clauses are there?</h4>

      <p>
        An option clause allows a contract to be extended for one additional season
        after the date it is scheduled to end. For example, a three-year contract with
        an option for the fourth year means that if the option is exercised, then the
        contract extends through the fourth season, but if the option is not exercised,
        then the contract ends after the third season. Once exercised, an option cannot
        be revoked (for example, a player cannot invoke an option on June 20 and change
        his mind on June 25). Conditional options are not allowed -- the availability
        of the option may <em>not</em> be contingent on some condition, such as the
        number of games the team wins or the player's points per game<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are three types of options:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Team Options give the <em>team</em> the right to invoke the option.  There
            can be only one option year (except in the case of rookie scale contracts).</li>
        <li>Player Options give the <em>player</em> the right to invoke the option.  There
            can be only one option year.</li>
        <li>Player Early Termination Options (ETOs) give the player the right to terminate
            the contract early. An ETO can't occur prior to the end of fourth season of the
            contract (which implies that the contract must be for five seasons). An ETO is
            not allowed in a veteran extension (see question number <a href="#Q58">58</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A contract may not contain more than one option, either in the same year
        (such as a player option and a team option in the same year) or in different
        years. The exception is rookie scale contracts for first round draft picks,
        which contain a team option before both the third and fourth seasons. No
        other options are permitted in rookie scale contracts. See question number
        <a href="#Q47">47</a> for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a summary of the differences between an option and an ETO:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Options can be included in any multiyear contract, but ETOs are allowed
            only in five-year contracts.</li>
        <li>Options can be held by the player or the team, but ETOs are always held by
            the player (i.e., there's no such thing as a <em>team</em> Early Termination
            Option).</li>
        <li>Option years may not have a lower salary than the previous season. ETOs
            have no such restriction.</li>
        <li>A contract with a player option can be extended (see question number <a href="#Q58">58</a>)
            when the option is not exercised. A contract with an ETO may not be extended
            if the ETO is exercised.</li>
        <li>When determining the amount of a trade bonus (see question number <a href="#Q99">99</a>),
            option years are not counted as part of the remaining value of the contract, but years
            following an ETO are counted.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All contracts with player options contain a clause that indicates whether the
        player receives his salary for the option year in the event his contract is
        terminated (i.e., he is waived and clears waivers) prior to invoking his option.
        See question number <a href="#Q65">65</a> for an interesting implication of
        this rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        The salary in an option year may be greater (but not less) than the salary in the
        previous season, and the payment schedule (see question number <a href="#Q115">115</a>)
        for base compensation may be different. Other than these exceptions, all other
        contract terms, including the percentage of salary that is guaranteed, must be the
        same as in the prior season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Options have a window of time during which they may be exercised. The specific
        opening and closing dates of this window are a matter of individual negotiation,
        except in the following circumstances:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For team options in Rookie Scale contracts, the window opens at the end of
            the July Moratorium and closes on October 31<sup>2</sup> of the calendar
            year <em>prior</em> to the year the option takes effect.</li>
        <li>If the contract contains a clause stating that the player does not receive his
            salary for an option year if he is waived prior to exercising his option, then
            the window cannot open sooner than the day following the team's last game of
            the season prior to the option year.</li>
        <li>The window for players who will be restricted free agents can close no later
            than June 25 of the year the option takes effect (an earlier date may be
            specified as a matter of individual negotiation).</li>
        <li>The window for all other options can close no later than June 29 of the year
            the option takes effect (an earlier date may be specified as a matter of
            individual negotiation).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Interestingly, there is no mechanism to notify the league that an option or ETO
        will <em>not</em> be exercised. Teams and players might want to do this in order
        to make the player tradable after the season ends but before July 1 (see
        question number <a href="#Q101">101</a>), or because the player wants to be traded
        to a team which does not want the player if he might become a free agent. As
        described in question number <a href="#Q60">60</a>, under these circumstances the
        team and player can mutually amend the contract to remove the option or ETO. A
        contract can be amended like this with the condition that the trade must be
        completed within 48 hours, otherwise the amendment is canceled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Player options once were used as a way to give the player more money. The
        team and player agreed to a long-term deal with a player option after the
        player obtained full Bird rights (which used to be after one season). The
        player would not invoke the option, which made him a free agent, and then
        signed a new contract for more money using the Bird exception. However they
        mostly closed this loophole by making Bird rights ramp-up over three
        seasons, and by allowing options only on the last year of a contract. The
        most common usage today is for a player to change teams by signing a
        two-year contract, with the second year being a player option (commonly
        referred to as a "one-plus-one"). In this case the second season acts
        as an insurance policy, and the player opts-out after the first season
        (unless he suffers a severe injury). He then signs another of these
        one-plus-one contracts as a non-Bird free agent, receiving a 20% raise.
        He can then either play both years under this contract and enter free
        agency with full Bird rights, or opt-out again and repeat the process.
        Both LeBron James (re-signing with Cleveland) and Kevin Durant (Golden
        State) used this one-plus-one strategy when changing teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Two-Way contract (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) cannot
        contain an option or ETO.

      <p>
        A contract cannot be extended unless the player will have full Bird
        rights at the end of the contract (prior to the extension). Two-Way
        contracts (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) cannot be
        extended under any circumstance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rules for extensions depend on whether the contract being extended
        is a rookie scale (first round draft pick) contract, or other (veteran)
        contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Rookie scale contract extensions</em>:
      </p>

      <p>
        Rookie scale contracts may be extended for up to four seasons beyond
        the last option season in the contract, bringing the total contract
        length to five seasons. Teams can also select up to two players<sup>4</sup>
        (called "Designated Rookies") who can receive five-year extensions,
        bringing the total contract length to six seasons (see question number
        <a href="#Q24">24</a> for more information on designated players).
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, the salary in the first year of an extension to a rookie
        scale contract may be any amount up to the player's maximum. This is
        usually the 0-6 year maximum, which is 25% of the salary cap (see
        question number <a href="#Q23">23</a>). However, a player may receive
        up to the 7-9 year maximum, which is 30% of the cap, if he meets the
        "5th Year 30% Max Criteria," as explained in question number <a href="#Q24">24</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The salary in the first year of an extension to a rookie scale contract
        for a Designated Player must be the player's maximum salary. If the
        player has also met the 5th Year 30% Max Criteria, his salary may be
        any amount between the 0-6 year maximum and the 7-9 year maximum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the maximum salaries for the following season are not known at
        the time the extension is signed, and the player may meet the 5th Year
        30% Max Criteria during his fourth season (also after the extension is
        signed), the following amounts can be specified in lieu of a specific
        salary:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>"The Maximum Annual Salary applicable to such player in the first
            Season of the extended term" (for any player)</li>
        <li>"XX% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of the
            extended term," where XX% is between 25% and 30% (if the player has
            already met the 5th Year 30% Max criteria)</li>
        <li>"25% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of the
            extended term, or, if the player meets at least one of the 5th Year
            30% Max Criteria during the fourth Season of his Rookie Scale
            Contract, XX% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season
            of the extended term," where XX% is between 25% and 30% (if the
            player has <em>not</em> already met the 5th Year 30% Max criteria)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In addition, the exact percentage of the cap can be based on how the player
        meets the 5th Year, 30% Max criteria. For example, that the player will
        receive 27% of the cap if he meets the criteria by being named to the All
        NBA Second Team, 28% if he meets the criteria by being named to the All NBA
        First Team, or 30% if he meets the criteria by being named Most Valuable Player.
        Raises can also be conditioned on how the player meets the criteria (unless
        the player is a Designated Rookie, in which case the raise must be 8%).
      </p>

      <p>
        When the first season of the extension arrives and the maximum salaries
        for that season have been defined, the salaries in the extension are
        filled-in (or amended downward, if necessary). 
      </p>

      <p>
        Extensions for players signed using the 5th Year 30% Max criteria must
        be at least four seasons (not including the fourth season of the player's
        rookie scale contract).
      </p>

      <p>
        Raises in a rookie scale extension are limited to 8% of the salary in
        the first year of the extension<sup>5</sup>. If the salary in the first
        year of the extension is filled-in or amended downward, the salaries in
        all subsequent seasons are filled-in or amended as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rookie scale contracts can be extended even if the team receives the player
        in trade. For example the Oklahoma City Thunder traded James Harden to the
        Houston Rockets on October 27, 2012, and the Rockets signed him to an extension
        four days later.
      </p>

      <p>
        A rookie scale contract can be extended through an extend-and-trade
        transaction, although there is no benefit in doing so (see question
        number <a href="#Q95">95</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Veteran extensions</em>:
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: certain players (called Designated Veterans) can receive longer and
        more lucrative extensions than described here, if they meet specific
        service, tenure and performance criteria. Designated Veteran Extensions
        are covered in question number <a href="#Q24">24</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Extensions to contracts that are <em>not</em> rookie scale contracts
        (i.e., veteran extensions) may be signed up to June 30, the day before
        the player would have become a free agent. However, an extension cannot
        be signed starting on the first day of the regular season and through
        June 30 if more than one season remains on the contract (in other words
        if more than one season remains, they have to complete an extension
        before the season starts, or otherwise wait until the last season of
        the contract).
      </p>

      <p>
        A contract that contains an Early Termination Option (ETO) cannot be
        extended if the ETO is exercised (ending the contract early). A contract
        with an option can be extended if the player (or team) opts-in. A contract
        with an option can also be extended if the player (or team) opts-out, as
        long as the extension adds at least two new seasons onto the contract
        (excluding any new option year) and the salary in the first year of the
        extension is not less than the salary in the non-exercised option year.
        See question number <a href="#Q57">57</a> for more information on options
        and ETOs.
      </p>

      <p>
        A veteran extension can contain an option (player or team), but cannot
        contain an ETO.
      </p>

      <p>
        Veteran extensions are limited to five seasons, including the seasons
        remaining on the current contract. Even if the extension is signed in
        late June, the current, almost concluded season counts as one full
        season toward the total, reducing the number of <em>new</em> seasons
        to four.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an extension is signed in conjunction with an Extend-and-Trade
        transaction (see question number <a href="#Q95">95</a>), the limit is
        <em>three</em> seasons, including the seasons remaining on the current
        contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        The salary in the first year of a veteran extension may be any amount
        up to 120% of the player's previous salary<sup>6</sup>, or 120% of the
        estimated average salary (see question number <a href="#Q31">31</a>),
        whichever is greater, but no more than the player's maximum salary in
        that season (i.e., the maximum salary the player can receive if he were
        to sign a new contract that year as a free agent -- see question number
        <a href="#Q23">23</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the maximum salaries for an upcoming season are not known at
        the time the extension is signed, it is possible that the extension
        will specify a salary that is greater than the maximum salary. If
        this happens, the salaries in the extension are amended downward
        once the maximum salaries are defined.
      </p>

      <p>
        Raises in each year of a veteran extension are limited to 8% of the
        salary in the first year of the extension<sup>7</sup>. If the salary
        in the first year of the extension is amended downward, the salaries
        in all subsequent season are amended as well. If the contract being
        extended contained bonuses, then the extension must contain the same
        bonuses -- teams can increase or decrease the bonus amounts by up to
        8%, but they can't leave them off or add new ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        An extension can contain a signing bonus, which is payable no sooner
        than July 1 of the year the extension takes effect. The signing bonus
        may be for up to 15% of the total salary of the extension. The signing
        bonus is charged to team salary in all guaranteed years of the
        extension, in proportion to the percentage of salary in each season
        that is guaranteed. For example, if an extension adds two additional
        years to a contract, with the first 100% guaranteed and the second 50%
        guaranteed, then 2/3 of the signing bonus is charged to the cap in
        the first year, and 1/3 of the signing bonus is charged to the cap in
        the second year. If the extension is entirely non-guaranteed, then the
        entire signing bonus is charged to the first season of the extension.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the team is under the cap when the extension is signed, then the
        signing bonus may be paid <em>before</em> the first season of the
        extension (i.e., it can be paid right away). When this happens, the
        extension is treated as a renegotiation (see question number
        <a href="#Q59">59</a>). The signing bonus is charged to team salary
        in all remaining years of the current contract and the extension,
        in proportion to the percentage of salary in each season that
        is guaranteed (as described in the previous paragraph). If all
        remaining years of the contract and the extension are entirely
        non-guaranteed, then the entire signing bonus is charged to the
        season in which the extension is signed. The signing bonus cannot
        exceed 15% of the total salary in the extension, and the portion of
        the signing bonus charged to the year in which the extension is
        signed also can't exceed the team's cap room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other rules related to extensions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An extension cannot contain an Exhibit 6 (requiring the player to
            pass a physical exam for the contract to be valid). Only new contracts
            can contain an Exhibit 6.</li>
        <li>An extension to a contract with an unearned trade bonus (see question
            number <a href="#Q99">99</a>) can specify that the trade bonus does not
            apply to the extension. If the player is then traded when his extension
            is in effect, he does not receive a trade bonus. If he is traded before
            his extension takes effect, then all bonus calculations and salary
            pro-ration ignore the extension.</li>
        <li>Contracts can also be extended in conjunction with a trade. See question
            number <a href="#Q95">95</a> for details.</li>
        <li>If a player agrees to waive a portion of his trade bonus in order to
            facilitate a trade (see question number <a href="#Q100">100</a>), his
            contract may not be extended for six months following the trade.</li>

      <h4>59. Can existing contracts be renegotiated?</h4>

      <p>
        A contract for four or more seasons can be renegotiated after the third
        anniversary of its signing, extension, or previous renegotiation (if
        the previous negotiation increased any season's salary by more than 5%).
        Contracts for fewer than four seasons cannot be renegotiated. A contract
        cannot be renegotiated between March 1 and June 30 of any year. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Only teams under the cap can renegotiate a contract, and the salary in
        the then-current season can be increased only to the extent that the team
        has room under the cap (and cannot increase the player's salary beyond
        the maximum salary). A renegotiation can only be used to provide a salary
        increase -- players can't take a "pay cut" in order to create
        more cap room for the team.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player agrees to waive a portion of his trade bonus in order to
        facilitate a trade (see question number <a href="#Q100">100</a>), his
        contract may not be renegotiated for six months following the trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every category of compensation (base salary, likely bonuses, and unlikely
        bonuses) that are increased in the renegotiated season must also increase
        in all subsequent seasons of the contract. Raises are based on the salary
        that is added to the first renegotiated season -- 8% of the amount that is
        added to the first renegotiated season becomes the maximum additional
        (renegotiated) salary in each subsequent season.
      </p>

      <p>
        A renegotiated contract can be extended simultaneously (see question
        number <a href="#Q58">58</a>). If a player's contract is extended and
        renegotiated simultaneously in this manner, his salary may not decrease
        by more than 40% from the last season before the extension (after it
        is renegotiated) to the first season of the extension. For example, if
        the salary in the last season of a contract is renegotiated to $10
        million and the contract is simultaneously extended, the salary in the
        first season of the extension cannot be less than $6 million.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other rules for renegotiations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A signing bonus cannot accompany a renegotiation unless the contract
            is extended simultaneously (see question number <a href="#Q58">58</a>).</li>
        <li>A renegotiation cannot lead to any season having an unlikely bonus
            greater than 15% of the player's regular salary for that season.</li>
        <li>A rookie scale contract (see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>)
            cannot be renegotiated.</li>
        <li>A contract cannot be renegotiated in conjunction with a trade.</li>
        <li>Two-Way contracts (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) cannot
            be renegotiated.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="Q60" class="question">
      <h4>60. In what other ways can an existing contract be modified?</h4>

      <p>
        Other than extensions (see question number <a href="#Q58">58</a>) and
        renegotiations (see question number <a href="#Q59">59</a>), a team and
        player can mutually amend an existing contract as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>To alter the amount of compensation protection -- i.e., the guarantee
            (see question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>). This is commonly done as
            part of a buyout (see question number <a href="#Q66">66</a>).</li>
        <li>To eliminate an option or ETO (see question number
            <a href="#Q57">57</a>). Note that eliminating an option does NOT
            constitute illegally shortening a contract, since an option year isn't
            considered part of the original term of a contract until it is
            invoked.</li>
        <li>To reduce the amount of a trade bonus (see question number
            <a href="#Q99">99</a>).</li>
        <li>To waive set-off (see question number <a href="#Q65">65</a>), which is
            commonly done in conjunction with a buyout (see question number
            <a href="#Q66">66</a>).</li>
        <li>To alter the pay schedule (see question number <a href="#Q115">115</a>).
            However, when a contract signed under the current CBA is terminated
            through the waiver process, the pay schedule is automatically "stretched"
            (see question number <a href="#Q64">64</a>).</li>
        <li>To alter the window of time during which an option may be invoked
            (rare).</li>
        <li>To alter the list of outside activities in which the player is
            allowed to participate (rare).</li>
        <li>To change the section of the standard contract that permits the
            team to suspend the player if the player does not maintain
            sufficient physical condition.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Contracts are sometimes amended to eliminate an option or ETO in order
        to facilitate a trade. For example, before the Hornets traded Chris Paul
        to the Clippers in 2011 they amended his contract to remove his player
        option, thereby locking Paul into his contract for two seasons rather
        than allowing him to leave after one season with the Clippers.

    <div id="Q61" class="question">
      <h4>61. What are the rules for retired players? What if the player suffers a career-ending injury?</h4>

      <p>
        There's nothing binding about a player announcing his retirement.
        The player can still sign a new contract and continue playing (if
        he's not under contract), or return to his team (if he is still
        under contract) and resume his career.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only exception to this is when a player is still under contract,
        wants to quit, and his team doesn't want to let him out of his
        contract. Under these circumstances the player can file for retirement
        with the league. The player is placed on the league's Voluntarily
        Retired list (see question number <a href="#Q79">79</a>), forgoes his
        remaining salary, and cannot return to the league for one year. The
        latter requirement prevents players from using retirement as an
        underhanded way to change teams, and can be overridden with unanimous
        approval from all 30 teams. For example, guard Jason Williams signed
        with the LA Clippers in August 2008, then changed his mind the following
        month, announcing his retirement. He applied for reinstatement in early
        2009, but his request was denied by a vote of 24-6. Williams later
        signed with the Orlando Magic once the one-year anniversary of his
        retirement announcement had passed.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Any money paid to a player is included in team salary, even if the
        player is no longer playing or has retired.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is one exception whereby a player can continue to receive his
        salary, but the salary is excluded from team salary. This is when a
        player suffers a career-ending injury or illness. The team must waive
        the player, and can apply for this salary exclusion following a waiting
        period. Only the player's team at the time the injury or illness was
        discovered (or reasonably should have been discovered) can apply for
        this salary exclusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team can apply to have the player's salary excluded starting on
        the first anniversary of the player's last regular season or playoff
        game, and not before the one-year anniversary of the first regular
        season game for which the player was on the team's roster under his
        current contract. If the player played in fewer than 10 games in the
        last season in which he played, the team can apply on the one-year
        anniversary of the player's last regular season or playoff game, or
        60 days after his last game in the current season, whichever is later.
      </p>

      <p>
        The determination as to whether an injury or illness is career ending
        is made by a physician jointly selected by the league and players
        association, or by a Fitness to Play panel (see question number
        <a href="#Q62">62</a>). The determination is based on whether the
        injury or illness will prevent the player from playing for the
        remainder of his career, or if it is severe enough that continuing
        to play constitutes a medically unacceptable risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the injury exclusion is granted, the player's salary is removed
        from the team salary immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player later "proves the doctors wrong" and resumes his
        career, then his salary is returned to the team salary when he plays
        in his 25th game<sup>1</sup> in any one season, for any team. This
        allows a player to attempt to resume his career without affecting
        his previous team unless his comeback is ultimately successful.<sup>2</sup>
        If the 25th game was a playoff game, then the player's salary is returned
        to the cap effective on the date of the team's last regular season
        game (i.e., the returned salary counts toward the luxury tax).
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few additional nuances to the salary exclusion:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the player resumes his career and his salary is returned to
            the team salary, the team can re-apply for the salary exclusion
            under the same rules (including the rules for the waiting period).</li>
        <li>If a player retires, even for medical reasons, his team does
            <em>not</em> receive a salary cap exception to acquire a replacement
            player.</li>
        <li>A team can only apply for salary exclusion during the original term
            of a contract. If the player was waived and his salary stretched (see
            question number <a href="#Q64">64</a>), the team must apply for the
            salary exclusion before the contract's original end date.</li>
        <li>A team cannot apply for this salary exclusion if they have applied
            for a Disabled Player exception (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>)
            that season, whether the exception was granted or not.</li>
        <li>If this salary exclusion is granted, the team cannot re-sign or
            re-acquire the player at any time.</li>
        <li>This salary exclusion can be used when a player dies while under
            contract.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>62. What is a Fitness to Play Panel?</h4>

      <p>
        Sometimes a player and team can disagree over whether the player is physically
        capable of playing, or whether his continuing to play would carry an elevated 
        risk of serious injury or even death. Fitness to Play panels exist to bring
        a consensus of objective medical expertise to decisions about whether players
        in these situations can continue to play.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Fitness to Play panel consists of three physicians, one appointed by the league,
        one by the players association, and with the third appointed by the first two
        physicians. The panel members must be board certified and fellowship-trained
        specialists in the applicable area of medicine, with at least 10 years of
        post-fellowship clinical experience. There are multiple Fitness to Play panels,
        established for different medical fields:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cardiac illnesses and conditions</li>
        <li>Blood clots, and other blood conditions and disorders</li>
        <li>Other areas as issues arise</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The league, player's team or players association can refer a player to a Fitness
        to Play panel if a physician advises the league, his team or the players association
        in writing that the player is unable or unfit to play as a result of an injury,
        illness or other health condition, or if his continuing to play carries an elevated
        risk of death. Once a player has been referred to a Fitness to Play panel, the player
        can no longer play or practice with his team until he is cleared by the panel.
      </p>

      <p>
        The panel will review the player's medical information and examine him personally
        (unless a personal examination is determined to be unnecessary) and report to the
        league, team and players association whether the player is fit to play, guided by
        current medical knowledge, authoritative medical guidelines, and the best available
        objective evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the panel finds the player to be fit to play, he must sign an informed consent
        and assumption of risk, and then he is cleared to play. If the panel does not find
        the player fit to play and material circumstances later change, then the player
        can be re-referred to the panel after nine months, or after the first day of the
        next regular season, whichever is later.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team is not forced to let the player play, even after he is cleared by the
        panel. However, if the team doesn't let the player play, and the player is not in
        the last season of his contract (excluding any option year) when cleared, then
        within 60 days the team must either trade the player, add an "Exhibit 7" to his
        contract<sup>1</sup>, or waive him. Under these circumstances a waiver can be either
        full or partial -- see question number <a href="#Q68">68</a> for more information
        on partial waiver claims.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a Fitness to Play panel finds that a player is physically unfit to play, then
        the team also can request that the panel's decision be used to establish that the
        player has suffered a career-ending injury or illness in order to have his salary
        excluded from the team's team salary<sup>2</sup> (see question number <a href="#Q61">61</a>).

    <div id="Q63" class="question">
      <h4>63. Are contracts always guaranteed?</h4>

      <p>
        There are only a few specific types of contracts that <em>must</em>
        be guaranteed. All other guarantees are a matter of individual
        negotiation between the player and team. In practice, the majority
        of NBA contracts (especially for established veterans) are fully
        guaranteed. Non-guaranteed salary is most often used for fringe
        players (either at the beginning or end of their careers) or for
        the later years of long-term contracts (often in conjunction with
        benchmarks that allow the salary to become fully guaranteed over
        time).
      </p>

      <p>
        Only a player's base salary can be guaranteed -- not bonuses or
        incentives. The percentage of base salary that is guaranteed cannot
        increase from one year to the next (e.g., if 50% of a player's
        salary is guaranteed one season, then no more than 50% can be
        guaranteed in any subsequent season of the contract).
      </p>

      <p>
        There are actually several types of guarantees:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of skill</strong>: A "catch-all" that means the player
            cannot play well enough to justify remaining on the team.</li>
        <li><strong>Death</strong>: The player dies while under contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Basketball-related injury</strong>: The player cannot render
            his playing services as a direct result of an injury sustained while
            playing or practicing for the team.</li>
        <li><strong>Injury/illness</strong>: The player cannot render his
            playing services as a direct result of any illness or injury, whether
            or not it was basketball related.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental disability</strong>: The player cannot render his
            playing services as a direct result of a mental disability.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each type of guarantee is independently negotiated, so, for example, a
        contract might be fully guaranteed for injury or illness, but not for
        mental disability. Players do not qualify if their condition was caused
        by participation in a prohibited activity (for example, skydiving),
        attempted suicide or self-inflicted injury, alcohol or substance abuse,
        commission of a felony, not complying with the terms of his contract, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some salaries are only partially guaranteed, and/or the guaranteed amount
        can change based on certain conditions. For example, the salary in the
        final season of a player's contract might be unprotected for lack of skill,
        with the protection changing to full if the team has not requested waivers
        on the player (see question number <a href="#Q64">64</a>) prior to the team's
        first regular season game of that season<sup>1</sup>. The protection can
        even be tied to performance benchmarks -- for example a player's
        guaranteed amount might increase if he played 1,600 minutes the previous
        season. For contracts and extensions signed under the current CBA, guarantees
        can be contingent only upon one of the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Whether the team waives the player by a certain point in time (and the
            guarantee must <em>increase</em> if the player is still on the roster)</li>
        <li>Benchmarks relating to team or player performance, based solely on
            official NBA statistics</li>
        <li>Benchmarks relating to the player's physical condition (for example, weight)</li>
        <li>A particular injury, illness or other medical condition</li>
        <li>The team's ability to obtain insurance on the player's contract</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The required guarantees are as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For sign-and-trade contracts (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>),
            the first season must be protected for lack of skill.</li>
        <li>For rookie "scale" contracts (see question number
            <a href="#Q47">47</a>), the first three seasons must be protected for
            lack of skill and injury/illness for at least 80% of the rookie scale
            amount.</li>
        <li>Qualifying offers to restricted free agents (see question number
            <a href="#Q42">42</a>) must be protected for lack of skill and
            injury/illness. A maximum qualifying offer must be protected for
            every season.</li>
        <li>If an offer sheet to a restricted free agent is subject to the Gilbert
            Arenas provision (see question number <a href="#Q43">43</a>), all
            seasons must be protected for lack of skill and injury/illness.</li>

        In addition, on January 10<sup>2</sup>, also known as the "cut-down date,"
        the base salary in all contracts becomes guaranteed for the remainder of
        that season (except for one case -- see question <a href="#Q66">66</a>).
        A player must clear waivers before this date, so teams have to waive
        players by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on January 7th in order to have them off
        their rosters before January 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, if a player is waived prior to January 10 but is injured as a direct
        result of playing basketball with his team, then his salary is guaranteed
        until he is ready to play again or until the end of that season, whichever
        comes first.<sup>3</sup> However, this does not apply to players whose
        contracts utilize Exhibit 9 of the Uniform Player Contract (see question
        number <a href="#Q70">70</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the rules for the allocation of signing bonuses and the limits on raises,
        certain combinations of signing bonuses and non-guaranteed salary are
        incompatible. See question number <a href="#Q53">53</a> for more information.

      <p>
        A Two-Way contract (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) can have a
        maximum of $50,000 guaranteed. This guarantee is pro-rated if the player is
        signed after the start of the regular season.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player is waived from a standard NBA contract with more than $50,000
        protected, then for the rest of that season he can't play for that team's
        G-League affiliate or sign a Two-Way contract with that team.

      <h4>64. What happens when a player is released? What are waivers? What is the Stretch provision?</h4>

      <p>
        Waivers are a temporary status for players who are released by their
        team. A team initiates the waiver process by "requesting waivers" on
        the player they are releasing. The player stays "on waivers" for 48
        hours (including weekends and holidays), during which time other teams
        may claim the player and assume his contract. If no team has claimed
        the player before the end of the waiver period (which is always 5:00 PM
        Eastern Time), he "clears waivers." The player's contract is terminated
        and he becomes a free agent. The only way to terminate a contract early
        (other than with an ETO -- see question number <a href="#Q57">57</a>)
        is through the waiver process.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        The term "waived" is ambiguous -- it can be used as a verb to refer to
        a waiver request (for example, "The Bulls just waived Michael Jordan"),
        or as an adjective to refer to a player who has cleared waivers (for
        example, "A team can sign a waived player."). This ambiguity is usually
        easily resolved by the context in which the term is used. In this
        document the term "waived" is used as an adjective, unless otherwise
        made clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team can claim a player on waivers only if one of the following is true:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The team is far enough under the salary cap to fit the player's
            entire salary.</li>
        <li>The team has a Disabled Player exception for at least the
            player's salary (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>),
            and the player is on the last season of his contract.</li>
        <li>The team has a trade exception for at least the player's
            salary (see question number <a href="#Q87">87</a>).</li>
        <li>The player has a minimum salary contract (one or two seasons
            at the minimum salary, with no bonuses of any kind).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a team makes a successful waiver claim, it acquires the player
        and his existing contract, and pays the remainder of his salary --
        the waiving team is relieved of all responsibility for the player.
        There is a fee of $1,000, payable to the league office, for
        claiming a player on waivers. If more than one team tries to claim
        a player on waivers, the team with the worst record gets him. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player clears waivers he becomes a free agent, and is free
        to sign with the team of his choice. The player's roster spot is
        freed-up as soon as the team places the player on waivers. The team
        can sign a new player or acquire one via trade immediately, without
        waiting for the player to be claimed or to clear waivers. The team
        continues to pay the guaranteed portion of the terminated contract
        (see question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>). 
      </p>

      <p>
        Individually negotiated revisions to the payment schedule are not
        allowed. For contracts for with more than $250,000 of remaining guaranteed
        salary, the guaranteed salary for the remaining seasons<sup>2</sup> is
        "stretched" and paid in equal amounts over a greater time span, as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the player is waived from July 1 to August 31, then his remaining
            salary is paid over twice the number of years remaining on his
            contract, plus one. For example, if the player is waived on August 1
            with two seasons remaining on his contract at $10.2 million and $10.3
            million, respectively, then his remaining salary is paid over five
            years (two seasons times two, plus one), in even amounts of $4.1
            million per year.</li>
        <li>If the player is waived from September 1 to June 30, then the current
            season is paid per the normal payment schedule, and any remaining
            years are stretched over twice the number of years remaining plus one
            as described above. For example, if the player is waived on December 1
            with two seasons remaining on his contract at $10.2 million and $10.5
            million, respectively, then the current season (at $10.2 million) is
            paid normally, and the final season (at $10.5 million) is stretched
            over three years (one season times two, plus one) and paid in even
            amounts of $3.5 million per year<sup>3</sup>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Not stretching the current season if the player is waived after August 31
        means that teams cannot use waivers &amp; stretch during a season as a means
        to free up cap room, get the team under the tax threshold, or create room
        under the hard cap.
      </p>

      <p>
        If $250,000 or less of guaranteed salary remains at the time the player
        is waived, the player's remaining guaranteed salary continues to be paid
        according to the contract's original payment schedule.
      </p>

      <p>
        The effect of stretched players on the team's salary cap is described in
        question number <a href="#Q65">65</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a player clears waivers and signs with a new team, his new salary is
        a matter of negotiation. Few players are actually claimed while on waivers,
        since the claiming team inherits his entire contract. It is far more common
        for teams to wait for the player to clear waivers, and then sign him to a
        much smaller (even minimum salary) contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other rules related to waivers:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Once a team puts a player on waivers, the waivers cannot be
            withdrawn.</li>
        <li>If a team requests waivers on a player after March 1, the player
            is ineligible to be included in the playoff roster of any team
            that subsequently signs or acquires him<sup>4</sup>.</li>
        <li>In the last season of a player's contract (or a season that
            <em>may</em> be the last due to an option or ETO) he must be
            waived in time for the 48-hour waiver period to elapse before
            the date of all 30 teams' final regular season games.</li>
        <li>Players claimed from waivers retain their Early-Bird rights (see
            question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>) just as if they had been
            traded. If a player with full Bird rights is claimed from waivers,
            his status drops from full Bird to Early Bird.</li>
        <li>When a team trades a player who is subsequently waived by the
            receiving team, it cannot claim the player off waivers or re-sign
            the player until the one-year anniversary of the trade, or until
            the July 1 following the end of his contract<sup>5</sup>, whichever
            is earlier<sup>6</sup>.</li>
        <li>A "buyout" is actually a combination of altering the player's
            contract to change the guarantee and/or payment schedule, then
            waiving the player (see question number <a href="#Q66">66</a>).</li>
        <li>A player's non-protected salary is removed from the team salary
            as soon as the team requests waivers.</li>
        <li>If a team claims a player on waivers, it cannot trade the player
            for 30 days if the claim was made during a season. If the player
            was claimed during the offseason, he cannot be traded until the 30th
            day of the following regular season.</li>
        <li>The 48 hour waiver period continues into and through the July Moratorium
            (see question number <a href="#Q105">105</a>). Teams are allowed to
            waive players and claim waived players during the Moratorium. Salaries
            adjust at the start of the Moratorium, so waivers initiated on June
            29 or 30 may require a different salary amount to claim.</li>
        <li>A system of "partial waivers" is available under certain circumstances
            (see question number <a href="#Q68">68</a>).</li>
        <li>If a team chooses to stretch the cap hit of a waived player's salary (see
            question number <a href="#Q65">65</a>), it cannot re-sign or re-acquire
            the player until the end of the original term of the contract.</li>

      <h4>65. How do released or stretched players apply to team salary? What is set-off?</h4>

      <p>
        Guaranteed salary must be paid even if the player is released, and
        continues to be included in team salary after the player is waived.
        For example, if a player is waived with $10 million in guaranteed
        base salary remaining on his contract, then that $10 million will
        continue to be included in team salary. If a player is waived partly
        through a season, then the portion of team salary that is charged to
        the cap for that season reflects either the guarantee or the salary
        that was actually paid, whichever is greater. For example, if a player
        has a $6 million salary with $3 million guaranteed and is waived 1/3
        through the season, then $3 million (reflecting the 50% that is
        guaranteed) continues to be included in the team salary. If instead
        he is waived 2/3 through the season, then $4 million (reflecting the
        salary actually paid) continues to be included. Players on non-guaranteed
        "summer contracts" are not included in team salary at all unless they
        make the team's regular season roster (see question number 
        <a href="#Q70">70</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        As described in question number <a href="#Q64">64</a>, if the contract
        had more than $250,000 in remaining guaranteed salary, the remaining
        guaranteed salary is paid over twice the number of remaining years, plus
        one, per the Stretch provision. The team gets to choose whether the
        player's cap hit is stretched as well, or stays on its original schedule.<sup>1</sup>
        For example, if a team waives a player with one season and a guaranteed
        $6 million remaining, his salary payments will be stretched over three
        years, at $2 million per year. The team gets to choose whether the team
        salary is charged the original $6 million over one season, or the stretched
        $2 million per season over three seasons.
      </p>

      <p>
        The remainder of the contract includes any seasons following an Early
        Termination Option (ETO), but not a season following a player or team
        option. However, as mentioned in question number <a href="#Q57">57</a>,
        all contracts with player options contain a clause indicating whether the
        player receives his salary for the option year in the event he is waived
        before the option is picked-up. This clause states that the benefit is
        "to the same extent" as if the option had been exercised. The league
        interprets this to mean that the team salary is charged to all seasons of
        the contract, including the unexercised option season. For example, when
        Derek Fisher was waived by the Houston Rockets during the 2011-12 season,
        his player option for the 2012-13 season was unexercised. His remaining
        guaranteed salary (he agreed to take less in a buyout arrangement) was
        charged to the Rockets' cap in both 2011-12 and 2012-13.
      </p>

      <p>
        If another team signs a player who has cleared waivers, the player's
        original team is allowed to reduce the amount of money it still owes the
        player (and lower its team salary<sup>2</sup>) by a commensurate amount.
        This is called the right of <em>set-off</em>. This is true if the player
        signs with <em>any</em> professional team -- it does not have to be an NBA
        team. The amount the original team gets to set off is limited to one-half
        the difference between the player's new salary and the minimum salary
        for a one-year veteran during the season in which the player is waived
        (if the player is a rookie, then the rookie minimum is used instead).
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, suppose a fifth-year player is waived with one guaranteed
        season remaining on his contract for $5 million. If this player signs
        a $2 million contract with another team for the 2017-18 season, his 
        original team gets to set off $2 million minus $1,312,611 (the minimum
        salary for a one-year veteran in 2017-18), divided by two, or $343,694.
        The team is still responsible for paying $4,656,306 of the original
        $5 million. Note that between his prior team and new team the player
        will earn a combined $6,656,306, which was more than he earned prior
        to being waived.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player has been waived and his salary has been stretched, his
        salary can be set-off only during the original term of the contract.
        For example, suppose a player is signed for 2017-18 and 2018-19, and
        he is waived during the 2017-18 season, with his 2018-19 salary
        stretched across 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21. If the player signs
        with another team, only his 2017-18 and/or 2018-19 salary can be set
        off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams and players may negotiate a waiver of the team's set-off rights.
        Typically this is done when a contract is altered as part of a buyout
        (see question number <a href="#Q66">66</a>), but not at other times.

      <h4>66. What is a contract buyout?</h4>

      <p>
        Sometimes players and teams decide to divorce each other. They do this
        by mutually agreeing that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The team will waive the player</li>
        <li>If the player clears waivers, the player's guaranteed salary will
            be reduced or eliminated (see question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>)</li>
        <li>Optionally the team's set-off rights (see question number
            <a href="#Q65">65</a>) may be waived</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After the player clears waivers, he and his former team are free to go
        their separate ways. There is a quid-pro-quo between the player and team
        regarding contractual obligation and salary -- in exchange for gaining
        his freedom, the player agrees to give the team a break on the remaining
        salary he is owed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there's a twist, which needed an arbitrator's ruling to resolve. As
        detailed in question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>, on January 10 (the
        "cut-down" date) all contracts become guaranteed for the remainder of that
        season. Although compensation protection ensures the player is paid after
        he is waived, the compensation protection does not kick-in if the player
        is waived after January 10, because the player does not lose any salary.
        Even though the team and player can mutually agree to reduce or eliminate
        the player's compensation protection, he is still owed his full salary if
        waived after January 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was challenged by John Starks during the 1999-2000 season. Starks had
        been traded to the Bulls, and wanted to sever ties with the team after
        January 10. The arbitrator ruled that in the last season of a player's
        contract a team and player can choose to eliminate the protection that
        kicks-in on January 10. Starks and the Bulls were therefore free to walk
        away from each other with no money owed.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a buyout in which the player's guaranteed salary is reduced, the
        team cannot re-sign the player or claim him of waivers for one year, or
        until the waived contract would have ended, whichever is later.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Voluntarily Retired List (see question number <a href="#Q79">79</a>)
        can also be utilized when the player wishes to end his employment with his
        team. However, since the player is not free to sign with another team, it
        is typically utilized when the player really intends to retire, and not
        when the parties are simply seeking a divorce.

    <div id="Q67" class="question">
      <h4>67. How do buyouts affect team salary?</h4>

      <p>
        Any guaranteed salary still owed to the player as the result of a buyout
        continues to be included in team salary, just as with any waived player.
        See question number <a href="#Q65">65</a> for details.

    <div id="Q68" class="question">
      <h4>68. What are partial waivers?</h4>

      <p>
        Partial waivers are an alternative form of waivers that allow other teams
        to claim the player with a bid for less than his full salary. Under the
        current agreement partial waivers are available only when a player is
        referred to a Fitness to Play panel (see question number <a href="#Q62">62</a>),
        is cleared to play by the panel, and the player's team still refuses to
        let him play. Under the 2011 CBA partial waivers were available in
        conjunction with the Amnesty provision.
      </p> 

      <p>
        When a team makes a full waiver claim it acquires the player, assumes his
        full contract, and pays all remaining salary obligations (and the waiving
        team has no further salary obligation to the player. A partial waiver claim
        is a bid for a single dollar amount. If no team makes a full waiver claim,
        the player is awarded to the team submitting the highest bid in a partial
        waiver claim. If multiple teams bid the same amount, the player is awarded
        to the team with the worst record. When a team is awarded a player via a
        partial waiver claim, it pays the following portion of the player's salary:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The amount of their bid, spread across all remaining guaranteed seasons of
            the player's contract (all seasons with any protection at all), in proportion
            to the total salary in each season</li>
        <li>All non-base compensation, such as bonuses</li>
        <li>100% of the player's salary in non-guaranteed seasons</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The waiving team continues to pay the remainder of the player's salary -- any
        portion that is not paid by the claiming team. This system (plus the rules
        for minimum bids, as described below) helps ensure that the waiving team doesn't
        have to pay the player more than they would have paid had they waived their
        player via regular waivers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The minimum bid for a partial waiver claim is whichever of the following is larger:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The sum of the player's minimum salary for all remaining "protected"
            years of his contract.<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>The sum of all non-guaranteed salary in protected years.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In order to submit a bid for a partial waiver claim, the bidding team must
        have cap room equivalent to the portion of their bid that would be charged
        to team salary in that season, plus the amount of any likely bonuses (see
        question number <a href="#Q74">74</a>) for that season.

      <p>
        Amnesty was a component of the 2005 and 2011 CBAs that allowed teams to

      <h4>70. What is a summer contract?</h4>

      <p>
        A summer contract is typically used for training camp invitees, because
        the player's salary is not included in team salary until the first day
        of the regular season. In other words, it is a "make-good"
        contract -- the player must make the team's opening day roster in order
        to receive his salary and for his contract to be included in team salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player is a veteran free agent who last played for that team, the
        contract must be for one season at the minimum salary (see question
        number <a href="#Q22">22</a>). In all other cases there are no special
        limits to the salary or number of years -- a team could theoretically
        sign a player to a summer contract for four seasons at the maximum
        salary. However, summer contracts frequently utilize Exhibit 9 of the
        Uniform Player Contract, which adds further limitations (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        A summer contract can be signed from the end of the July Moratorium (see
        question number <a href="#Q105">105</a>) to the last day before the regular
        season. To avoid counting as team salary, the player must clear waivers prior
        to the first day of the regular season. To qualify as a summer contract no
        compensation of any kind can be earned or paid prior to the start of the regular
        season. The salary cannot be guaranteed or insured. However, the player may
        receive per diem, lodging and transportation expenses, and disability insurance
        covering summer leagues and training camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since summer contracts do not count against the team's cap until the start of
        the regular season, teams can effectively sign players to summer contracts when
        they do not have room (cap room or an exception) for the contract, and
        <em>delay</em> creating the necessary room until the start of the regular season.
        This can be especially useful when a team is hard-capped (see question number
        <a href="#Q20">20</a>) and does not have enough room under the hard cap to bring
        players to training camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        A summer contract does not <em>need</em> to utilize Exhibit 9 of the Uniform
        Player Contract (One Season, Non-Guaranteed Training Camp Contracts), but doing
        so limits the team's liability in the event the player becomes injured. If a
        player with an Exhibit 9 becomes injured and unable to play basketball prior to
        the team's first regular season game and the injury is a direct result of
        playing basketball for the team, then the team pays the player $6,000 when it
        waives him. This is in lieu of the rule for ordinary contracts guaranteeing
        the salary of an injured player until he is ready to play again or until the end
        of that season, whichever comes first (see question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>).
        If Exhibit 9 <em>is</em> used, the contract must be for one season at the
        minimum salary, with no bonuses of any kind.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team cannot sign a player using Exhibit 9 unless it has at least 14 players
        on its roster, not including summer contracts. A team also cannot have more than
        six players at one time who are signed to contracts with an Exhibit 9.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a player on a summer contract is traded before the start of the regular
        season, his salary for trade purposes is $0 and the trade is treated the same
        as a trade for draft rights. Teams cannot receive trade exceptions (see question
        number <a href="#Q87">87</a>) when trading summer contracts, and the acquiring
        team does not need to match salaries, have cap room, or use an exception.
        However, the acquiring team must create the necessary room or designate an
        exception prior to the start of the regular season, when the player's salary is
        added to the team's cap.

    <div id="Q71" class="question">
      <h4>71. Do injured players apply to team salary?</h4>

        number <a href="#Q61">61</a> for details.
      </p>

      <p>
        In certain cases, teams can gain an exception which allows them
        to exceed the cap to sign a replacement. See question number

        Sadly, a number of players have died while they were active, including
        Jason Collier, Bryce Dejean-Jones, Reggie Lewis, Drazen Petrovic, Bobby
        Phills, Malik Sealy and Nick Vanos.
      </p>

      <p>
        A player who dies is treated the same as one who has suffered a
        career-ending injury or illness. See question number <a href="#Q61">61</a>.

    </div>

    <div id="Q73" class="question">
      <h4>73. Are player contracts insured?</h4>

      <p>
        There is a league-wide policy that insures the contracts of around 150
        players each season for inability to perform their duties as professional
        basketball players due to sickness or injury. Each team submits at least
        five players for coverage each season, from their five most expensive
        contracts based on either of the following criteria:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Current season salary</li>
        <li>Total remaining salary (with at least two years remaining on the contract)</li>
      </ul>

       <p>
        Each team must insure at least five players, including the two most expensive
        contracts with at least two seasons remaining in each of the above categories.
        Teams have the option of submitting additional names for coverage, including
        players with less than two seasons remaining on their contracts. Players ages
        37 and over are not covered unless offered by the insurance carrier and accepted
        by the team.
       </p>

      <p>
        If an insured player is disabled, there is a 41 game waiting period, after which
        the insurance company pays 80% of the covered salary, which includes current and
        deferred compensation, and any signing bonus and incentive compensation that can
        be earned prior to the start of the regular season. The maximum covered salary is
        $28,187,500, or $275,000 per regular game. The maximum coverage for any one player
        is six seasons (451 games after the waiting period).
      </p>

      <p>
        The waiting period can span seasons, and the player even can attempt to come back
        -- if he does and finds that he is unable to play, the 41-game count resumes (as
        long as he stopped playing due to the same injury).
      </p>

      <p>
        The carrier has the right to exclude up to 14 players per season, with a maximum
        of six players per season excluded due to sickness (there are specific exceptions
        and sublimits to these exclusions). One example is when they excluded Luol Deng in
        2008-09 because he had $71 million remaining on his contract and a history of
        back injuries. The list of excluded players changes each year, so a player who is
        not covered one season might be covered the following season. However, once a
        player is covered the carrier can't exclude the player for the remainder of his
        current contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the player is traded, his new team receives the benefit -- for example,
        even though Cuttino Mobley's heart condition was discovered prior to his
        trade to the Knicks in 2008, the Knicks received the insurance payout.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q74" class="question">
      <h4>74. Can incentives be built into a contract? How do they apply to team salary?</h4>

      <p>
        There are three categories of allowable incentives: performance,
        academic/physical achievement, and extra promotional. The latter two
        categories are always included in the player's salary and team salary
        amounts. Performance incentives are classified as either "likely
        to be achieved" or "not likely to be achieved," with only the likely
        incentives included in the player's salary and team salary amounts.
        The determination of whether an incentive is likely or not likely is
        based on whether the criterion was achieved in the previous season.
        For example, if a player had seven assists per game the previous
        season, then an incentive based on seven assists per game would be
        classified as likely to be achieved, but one based on eight assists
        per game would be classified as not likely.
      </p>

      <p>
        If either the league or players association feels that the previous
        season does not fairly predict the performance in the current season,
        then a jointly-selected expert determines whether the default
        classification should be overruled. This can happen when the player
        was injured the previous season. The determination can also be referred
        to a jointly-selected expert when the player did not play in the NBA
        in the preceding season, or when incentives are based on team
        performance and the team is an expansion team in its first season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlikely bonuses in any season are limited to 15% of the player's
        regular salary in that season. When a contract is signed, the first
        season's base salary, likely bonuses and unlikely bonuses all must
        fit within the team's cap room or exception. When making this
        determination, if the player's salary includes an unlikely bonus they
        also include the sum of the unlikely bonuses for <em>all</em> players
        who signed that season. This prevents a team from signing multiple
        players to lower salaries but with unlikely bonuses that collectively
        exceed the cap room the team has to offer. For example, suppose a
        team has $10 million in cap room and signs a player to a contract
        with $5 million in base salary and $750,000 in unlikely bonuses. The
        team then has $5 million in remaining cap room<sup>1</sup>, and can
        sign another player for $5 million with no unlikely bonuses. But if
        the team also wants to include an unlikely bonus for this player, the
        player's full salary (including the unlikely bonus) cannot exceed $4.25
        million (the team's remaining cap room minus the $750,000 unlikely
        bonus given to the other player).
      </p>

      <p>
        Incentives must be structured so that they provide an incentive for
        <em>positive</em> achievement by the player or team, and are based
        upon numerical benchmarks (such as points per game or team wins) or
        generally recognized league honors<sup>2</sup>. The numerical benchmarks
        must be specific -- for example, a bonus may be based on the player's
        free throw percentage exceeding 80%, but may not be based on a relative
        measure such as the player's free throw percentage improving over his
        previous season's percentage. Certain kinds of incentives are not
        allowed, such as those based on the player being on the team's roster
        on a specific date or for a specific duration of time. A bonus also
        cannot be based on the player dressing in uniform or being eligible to
        play for a specific number of games.
      </p>

      <p>
        All performance incentives are re-evaluated at the start of each
        season to determine whether they should be classified as likely or not
        likely to be achieved<sup>3</sup>. Performance incentives are recomputed
        when a player is traded<sup>4</sup>, but only if they are team-related
        and based on the previous-season performance of the team. For example,
        suppose Team A won 25 games last season, and Team B (with the league
        MVP) won 55. Also suppose the MVP has a performance incentive that is
        based on his team winning 30 games. Going into the season this incentive
        would be classified as likely to be achieved, since his team (Team B)
        won 55 games the previous season. Now suppose this player is traded to
        Team A in exchange for draft picks. The incentive would be recomputed
        upon the trade, and in this case would be reclassified from likely to
        unlikely to be achieved, since the player's new team won fewer than 30
        games the previous season (even though adding the MVP could easily push
        Team A's win total above 30).<sup>5</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Other rules related to incentives:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Minimum salary contracts cannot contain bonuses of any kind.</li>
        <li>Two-Way contracts (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>)
            cannot contain bonuses or incentives.</li>
        <li>The rules for raises (and decreases) also apply to incentives. When
            salary increases or decreases are limited to 5% or 8, then
            likely and unlikely bonuses may each increase or decrease by 5%
            or 8%, respectively (see question number <a href="#Q53">53</a>).</li>
        <li>If a contract with bonuses is extended (see question number
            <a href="#Q58">58</a>), then the extension must have the same bonuses.
            The bonus amounts may increase or decrease by up to 8%, but they
            can't be left off.</li>

      <h4>75. How about signing bonuses? Are they allowed? How do they apply to team salary?</h4>

      <p>
        Teams are allowed to offer the players they sign a bonus worth as
        much as 15% of the total compensation.<sup>1</sup> The total
        compensation includes the signing bonus itself, but excludes any
        incentive compensation. It also includes seasons following an option
        or ETO. A signing bonus is paid up-front, but it is charged to the
        salary cap across the guaranteed seasons in the contract (not
        including option years or years following an ETO), in proportion to
        the percentage of salary in each of those seasons that is
        guaranteed<sup>2</sup>. This can create a problem when a player is
        signed to the maximum salary or to the full extent of the team's room
        under the salary cap or an exception. For instance, if the Non-Taxpayer
        Mid-Level exception is $9 million, then a team could sign a player to a

        Note that in order to fit the first-year amount (salary plus a
        pro-rated portion of the signing bonus) within the $9 million
        exception, the first-year base salary had to be reduced to $7,564,895.
        The net effect is that the player gets more money in the first year (he
        receives his base pay of $7,564,895 plus his entire signing bonus of
        $5,740,420, for a total of $13,305,315), but he receives less in the
        subsequent years. Also note that the total value of the contract
        ($38,269,468) is lower, because raises are based on the lower base
        salary in the first season<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For extensions, the signing bonus can be paid no sooner than July 1 of
        the year the extension takes effect, and the signing bonus is allocated
        to team salary over the years of the extension (per the same formula
        as described above for contracts). However, if the team is under the
        salary cap when the extension is signed, then the signing bonus may be
        paid before the extension takes effect. If this happens, then the extension
        is deemed to be a renegotiation (see question number <a href="#Q59">59</a>)
        and the signing bonus is charged to team salary over both the extension
        and the remaining seasons of the current contract. Under these circumstances
        the amount of the signing bonus is limited -- the portion of the signing
        bonus charged to the season in which the extension is signed must fit
        within the team's cap room. Except in this special case of a renegotiation
        in conjunction with an extension, a renegotiation cannot contain a
        signing bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following are also treated like signing bonuses for the purpose
        of determining a player's salary and the allocation of the player's
        salary to the team salary:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Payments in excess of the Excluded International Player Payment
            Amount (see question number <a href="#Q77">77</a>) that are made to
            international teams or organizations to release a player's rights.</li>
        <li>Trade bonuses (see question number <a href="#Q99">99</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Except for international player buyouts, rookie scale contracts for
        first round draft picks cannot contain signing bonuses.
      </p>

      <h4>76. What are the rules relating to international players and teams?</h4>

      <p>
        A player is considered to be an international player if he has maintained
        permanent residence outside the U.S. for the three years prior to the draft
        while playing basketball (as either an amateur or pro) outside the U.S., and
        who never completed high school or enrolled in a college or university in the
        U.S. An international player is eligible for the NBA draft that is held in
        the same calendar year as his 22nd birthday. An international player who is
        at least 19 but younger than 22 also can become draft eligible by declaring
        himself an early entry player. An international player who is older than 22
        or was not selected in the draft in the same calendar year as his 22nd
        birthday is considered a rookie free agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NBA has a formal agreement with the Federation Internationale de Basketball
        (FIBA) recognizing each others contracts.  A player who is currently playing
        or last played on a FIBA team must obtain a <em>letter of clearance</em> from the
        basketball federation of the country in which he played before signing with an
        NBA team. The letter of clearance ensures that the player does not have an
        existing and validly binding contract with any FIBA team. Likewise, a player
        who last played in the NBA must secure a FIBA license before signing with a
        FIBA team, which requires FIBA to contact the NBA to obtain a written statement
        that the player is not subject to an existing and validly binding NBA contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        NBA teams signing international players are allowed to pay a buyout to the
        players team or organization in order to release the player to sign in the NBA
        (see question number <a href="#Q77">77</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        The NBAs agreement with FIBA also requires NBA teams to allow their players
        to play for their national teams in major FIBA competitions, including the
        European Championships, the World Championships and the Olympics, as long as
        the competition does not conflict with an NBA game and the player is adequately
        insured. NBA teams cant take any steps to dissuade their players from
        participating in such competitions, such as asking their players not to
        participate or making public statements suggesting they do not want their
        players to play in these competitions.

      <h4>77. What about buyouts paid to international teams? Are they allowed? How do they apply to team salary?</h4>

      <p>
        NBA teams signing international players<sup>1</sup> are allowed to pay a
        buyout to the player's team or organization in order to release the player
        to sign in the NBA. The buyout amount is a matter of negotiation between
        the player and the international team or organization. NBA teams are allowed
        to pay up to the <em>Excluded International Player Payment Amount</em>, and
        this amount is not charged to the team salary. Any amount above the Excluded
        International Player Payment Amount comes out of the player's (after-tax)
        salary, and therefore is included in the team's team salary. Here are the
        Excluded International Player Payment Amounts:

      <p>
        It is a common misconception that a buyout cannot exceed the excluded amount.
        On the contrary, buyouts <em>can</em> exceed the excluded amount, but any amount
        above the excluded amount essentially comes out of the player's paycheck. For
        example, if a team's second round pick in 2017 has a $1 million buyout, the team
        can use its (Non-Taxpayer or Taxpayer) Mid-Level exception to sign the player,
        with $1 million going to the player's international team or organization. Since
        $675,000 is excluded in 2017-18, $325,000 of the player's (after tax) salary
        will be used to fund the buyout, with the remainder going to the player. The
        amount above the excluded amount is charged to the team's team salary as a
        signing bonus (see question number <a href="#Q75">75</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        It is trickier to pay more than the excluded amount for a first round
        draft pick, which is why international players with large buyouts
        often drop to the second round of the draft. A first round pick's first
        contract must be a rookie scale contract<sup>2</sup> (see question number
        <a href="#Q47">47</a>), with a salary between 80% and 120% of the scale
        amount. It is possible to write the contract for 120% of the scale amount,
        with the player paid less than that amount and the remainder used as a
        buyout to the international team in excess of the excluded amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, the 30th pick in the 2017 draft has a scale amount of $1,162,100.
        The player could be paid $929,680 (80% of the scale amount), with up to
        $1,394,520 (120% of the scale amount) charged to the team salary in 2017-18.
        Since the buyout is charged to the cap as a signing bonus, and signing
        bonuses are allocated to the guaranteed years of a contract, the player's
        total buyout could be up to $1,604,680<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        An international player payment cannot be provided when signing a player to
        a Two-Way contract or a contract with an Exhibit 10 (see question number
        <a href="#Q83">83</a>).

      <h4>78. Are teams really competing on a level playing field? Since the tax rate is
          different in the different states and Canada, don't the teams in a more "tax
          friendly" state have an advantage over the other teams?</h4>

      <p>
        Yes they do. For example, an offer from Orlando will provide a higher net
        income than the same offer from Los Angeles, because the player will play
        at least half his games in a state with no state income tax. But the
        advantage is not quite as large as you might expect, because most jurisdictions
        with NBA teams require visiting athletes to pay state income taxes (often
        called a "jock tax") for each "duty day" they spend there. There is not a
        universal definition for a duty day, but it is generally considered to be any
        day the player spends in a particular jurisdiction, including for preseason,
        regular season and postseason games. For example, if there are 177 duty days
        in a season and a player plays five of those duty days in a state with a jock
        tax, then the player will pay state income taxes in that state based on 5/177
        of his income.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Florida (Heat and Magic), Tennessee (Grizzlies) and Texas (Mavericks,
            Rockets and Spurs) have no state income tax.</li>
        <li>Florida (Heat and Magic), Ontario (Raptors), Tennessee (Grizzlies),
            Texas (Mavericks, Rockets and Spurs) and Washington D.C. (Wizards) do
            not make visiting athletes pay a jock tax.</li>
        <li>Illinois (Bulls) does not make visiting athletes pay a jock tax if
            they come from jurisdictions without a jock tax. However, Illinois does
            not credit its residents for jock taxes paid out of state, so Bulls
            players can be double-taxed for some road games.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The league also has regulations to help neutralize the tax disadvantage
        of Canadian teams, and there is language in the CBA to help protect players'
        benefits from any adverse effects caused by changes in Canadian legislation
        or tax laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incidentally, players are always paid in U.S. dollars, even if their team
        is located in Canada.

              For example, California does not exempt players from taxes on income

      <p>
        A team gets two roster spots exclusively for Two-Way players (see question
        number <a href="#Q82">82</a>). A Two-Way player must be on his team's Active
        List or Inactive List while playing in the NBA. For each Two-Way player on the
        team's Active List or Inactive List, the number of players required to be on
        the team's Inactive List increases by one, as indicated in the above chart. For
        example, if a team can have 13 active and two inactive players if it does not
        have any Two-Way players; 13 and three if it has one Two-Way player; or 13 and
        four if it has two Two-Way players.
      </p>

      <p>
        The composition of the Inactive List can change on a game-by-game basis --
        no less than 60 minutes prior to tipoff, the team must present to the
        official scorer a list of the players who will be active for that game. A
        player can be inactive for as little as one game. While individual teams
        are only required to carry a minimum of 14 players (13 active and one
        inactive, or 12 active and two inactive), the NBA also guarantees a
        league-wide average of at least 14.5 players per team (not including
        Two-Way players), however the average must be under 14.5 in two consecutive
        seasons for a violation to occur. If a violation occurs, then for the
        remaining seasons under the CBA the requirements for the number of players
        on teams' Inactive Lists increases by one.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the Active and Inactive Lists, the following lists exist:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-Way List</strong>: The team's Two-Way players, when
             they are assigned to the team's G-League affiliate, but only during
             the NBA regular season or playoffs, and only during the G-League
             season.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspended List</strong>: Any player who is suspended by
             his team for four or more games may be transferred to the team's
             Suspended List following the third game of his suspension (and
             may be placed on the team's Active List or Inactive List for the
             first three game). Any player who is suspended by the league for
             six or more games may be transferred to the team's Suspended List
             following the fifth game of his suspension (and must remain on
             the team's Active List for the first five games).</li>
        <li><strong>NBA Draft List</strong>: The NBA Draft List contains the
             players with whom the team holds exclusive negotiating rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Voluntarily Retired List</strong>: A player who wishes to
             retire while under contract may be placed on his team's Voluntarily
             Retired List if both the team and player agree. Such players cannot
             return to active status for one year without the unanimous consent
             of the NBA Board of Governors (see question number <a href="#Q61">61</a>),
             and cannot be traded. By utilizing the Voluntarily Retired List
             rather than agreeing to a buyout (see question number
             <a href="#Q66">66</a>), the team is left with some ongoing rights
             -- for example, the player is not able to sign with another team.</li>
        <li><strong>Armed Services List</strong>: Used for players who are on
             active duty in their country's armed services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Injured Reserve is the former name of the Inactive List. It was
        originally intended for players who were injured and unable to play,
        however teams often used it as a convenient place to stash extra
        players. While a medical reason was required for players to be put
        on Injured Reserve, the league did not insist on an independent
        physician confirming the diagnosis. Thus it was common for a
        seemingly healthy player to suddenly develop "back spasms"
        right before rosters were cut to 12 players, and spend the entire
        season on Injured Reserve as a result. With the 1995 CBA they gave
        up the ghost, dropped the medical requirement, and changed the
        designation to "Inactive List." (The cynic will note that
        marginal NBA players seem to have a lot fewer back spasms nowadays.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Players on standard NBA contracts who are assigned to the G-League
        (see question number <a href="#Q81">81</a>) are automatically placed
        on their team's Inactive List.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since players who are on the Two-Way, Suspended, NBA Draft, Voluntarily
        Retired or Armed Services lists are on neither the Active nor Inactive List,
        these players are ignored for roster size limitations. For example, in
        early 2015 the Sixers had 15 players on its roster, and had placed
        Andrei Kirilenko on its Suspended List. This freed up a roster spot for
        the team to acquire Jared Cunningham from the Clippers.

      <h4>80. What is a 10-day contract?</h4>

      <p>
        A 10-day contract is just that, a player contract which lasts ten
        days (or three games, whichever comes later). Teams may sign players
        to 10-day contracts starting January 5 each season (even if January 5
        falls on a weekend or holiday). Teams cannot sign players to 10-day
        contracts that would extend past their last regular season game. In
        other words, after their 80th game or after the 10th day before their
        last regular season game (whichever comes first) teams can no longer
        sign 10-day contracts.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team may sign an individual player to two 10-day contracts in one season
        (they may or may not be consecutive). After the second 10-day contract,
        the team can only retain the player by signing him for at least the remainder
        of the season.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number of 10-Day contracts a team is allowed to have active is dependent
        on the number of players on its roster (counting active players, inactive
        players and other 10-day contracts, but not Two-Way contracts):
      </p>

      <table class="lefttable"><tbody>

      <p>
        The base salary in a 10-day contract is negotiable, although they are almost
        always signed for the minimum salary. The salary is then pro-rated for the
        number of days covered by the contract (10 days or three games, whichever is
        longer).
      </p>

      <p>
        A team cannot sign a 10-Day contract that is also a Two-Way contract.

      <h4>81. What is the NBA Developmental League (NBA G-League)?</h4>

      <p>
        The NBA Developmental League (also known as the NBA G-League, D-League
        or NBADL) is a separate league run in affiliation with the NBA. An NBA
        team may assign its players (who are on standard NBA contracts) to its
        affiliated NBA G-League team as follows:
      </p>

      <table class="lefttable"><tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Years of Exp.</th>
          <th>Assignment rule</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="center">0-2</td>
          <td>Can be assigned at any time</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="center">3+</td>
          <td>Can be assigned if the player and the union consent</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>

      <p>
        If an active player on a standard NBA contract is assigned to the G-League,
        he is automatically placed on his NBA team's Inactive List. There is no
        minimum or maximum length of an NBA G-League assignment, and players have
        48 hours to report to the NBA G-League team once they are assigned. Players
        continue to receive their NBA salary while assigned to the NBA G-League,
        but their performance in NBA G-League games does not count toward NBA
        incentives.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player on a standard NBA contract who is on a G-League assignment is
        suspended for less than 20 games, he loses 1/145 of his salary per game. If
        the suspension is for 20 or more games, he loses 1/110 of his salary per
        game. Players stay on the team's Two-Way list for their entire suspension.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two-Way players and Two-Way contracts are covered in question number
        <a href="#Q82">82</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        NBA G-League rosters are normally 10 players, but can expand to
        accommodate assigned NBA players and Two-Way players. In some cases
        where one team might be overstocked with assignees or players at a
        particular position, players might be reassigned to a different
        team. NBA teams do not control the playing time their assignees
        receive -- that is up to the G-League coaches.

    <div id="Q82" class="question">
      <h4>82. What is a Two-Way player?</h4>

      <p>
        A Two-Way player is a hybrid of a standard NBA player and a G-League player
        (see question number <a href="#Q81">81</a>). A player on a Two-Way contract
        is principally a G-League player, but he can play up to 50 games with his
        affiliate NBA team. His salary is 50 percent of the rookie minimum salary,
        and he can only play for the affiliated NBA team while on a Two-Way contract --
        he cant be poached by another NBA team.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Two-Way player differs from a regular G-League player because he receives a
        higher salary and can be called up to the parent NBA club while remaining under
        his Two-Way contract. A regular G-League player can sign with an NBA team at
        any time, which terminates his G-League contract. A Two-Way player differs from
        a standard NBA player in that he can play a maximum of 50 games with the parent
        parent NBA club. A player on a standard NBA contract can be assigned to his team's
        G-League affiliate, but continues to receive his NBA salary while on assignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams are allowed to have up to two players on Two-Way contracts at any time, and
        teams receive additional roster spots beyond the standard 15 in order to do so (see
        question number <a href="#Q79">79</a>). A Two-Way player can be signed starting
        on July 1 (during the July Moratorium), and can be signed through January 15. A
        player is ineligible to sign a Two-Way contract if he will have more than three
        years of NBA service at any point in the contract. A player cannot play under
        Two-Way contracts for the same team for more than three years total<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>


      <p>
        A Two-Way player must be on the NBA teams Active List or Inactive List (see
        question number <a href="#Q79">79</a>) when with his NBA team, or on the
        Two-Way List when assigned to the G-League (only during the NBA regular season
        or playoffs). A Two-Way player cant appear on the NBA teams playoff roster or
        play in a playoff game, but he can be on the NBA teams Inactive List during
        the playoffs, can travel and practice with the NBA team.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Two-Way player is signed using Exhibit 1B of the Uniform Player Contract. A
        Two-Way contract can be for one or two seasons.
      </p>


      <p>
        Prior to the 2020-21 season, and as defined in the CBA, a Two-Way player's NBA
        salary was the rookie minimum salary (see question number <a href="#Q22">22</a>),
        pro-rated per day, for each day he was with his NBA team (which included days on
        the team's Active List for an NBA game, or days he engaged in practice, drills,
        conditioning, workouts or travel with the NBA team). The player received a lower
        salary for each day he was not credited with an NBA day of service, according to
        the Two-Way scale. The Two-Way scale was originally set for the entire CBA, however
        beginning in 2020-21 the scale was replaced with 50 percent of the rookie minimum
        salary, and was no longer pro-rated.

      <p>
        A Two-Way contract cannot contain an option or ETO (see question number <a href="#Q57">57</a>),
        and cannot contain bonuses, incentives, deferred compensation, loans or advances (see question
        number <a href="#Q115">115</a>). A 10-Day contract (see question number <a href="#Q80">80</a>)
        cannot also be a Two-Way contract. An international player payment (see question number
        <a href="#Q77">77</a>) cannot be provided when signing a Two-Way contract. A Two-Way contract
        cannot be extended (see question number <a href="#Q58">58</a>) or renegotiated (see question
        number <a href="#Q59">59</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        A Two-Way player is not included in his teams Team Salary (see question number <a href="#Q13">13</a>),
        so teams dont need cap room or an exception to sign, acquire or convert (see question number
        <a href="#Q83">83</a>) a Two-Way contract. A player is not credited for a day of NBA service
        during training camp or the playoffs, or on days he is traveling between his NBA and G-League
        teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Two-Way players salary may be guaranteed (see question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>) for
        no more than $50,000, which is pro-rated if he signs after the start of the season. If a
        player is waived from a standard NBA contract with a guarantee greater than $50,000, then
        for the rest of that season he cannot play for that teams G-League affiliate or sign a
        Two-Way contract with that team.
      </p>

      <p>
        The payment schedule (see question number <a href="#Q115">115</a>) for a Two-Way player is
        24 semi-monthly paydays, with each paycheck including a fraction of his G-League salary,
        plus any NBA salary he earned during the previous pay period.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a Two-Way player is injured while providing playing services then while he is injured
        his salary is protected for up to his entire Two-Way salary, plus any NBA salary already
        earned, minus any G-League salary already earned.
      </p>

      <p>
        On January 20<sup>2</sup>  all Two-Way salaries become fully guaranteed for the remainder
        of that season. Two-Way players are guaranteed to receive their full Two-Way salary, plus
        any earned NBA salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Two-Way player can be traded 30 days after he is signed. A Two-Way player never creates
        a trade exception (see question number <a href="#85">85</a>) when he is traded. 
      </p>

      <p>
        When a Two-Way player becomes a free agent, his free agent amount (see question number
        <a href="#Q37">37</a>) is the one year veteran minimum salary. A player finishing a
        Two-Way contracts is subject to restricted free agency (see question number <a href="#Q44">44</a>)
        if he was on an NBA Active List or Inactive List for at least 15 days in the previous
        season. As with any other restricted free agent, the team must make a qualifying offer
        in order to retain its right of first refusal. The qualifying offer for a Two-Way player
        must be:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the player played two or three years on Two-Way contracts with the same team, the
            qualifying offer is a standard NBA contract at the minimum salary, with no bonuses of
            any kind, and with the Two-Way salary guaranteed. This also applies if the player is
            no longer eligible to sign a Two-Way contract.</li>
        <li>For all other Two-Way players, the qualifying offer is a Two-Way contract, with
            $50,000 guaranteed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The following rules also apply to Two-Way contracts:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If a player is a second-round pick, his team submits a required tender (retaining its
            draft rights to the player), the player signs his required tender, and the team
            subsequently waives the player, then that team is the only team that can sign or
            convert (see question number <a href="#Q83">83</a>) that player to a Two-Way contract

      <h4>83. Can a Two-Way player be converted to a regular NBA player? Can a regular
              NBA player be converted to a Two-Way player? What is Exhibit 10?</h4>

      <p>
        If a standard NBA contract includes an attachment called Exhibit 10, the team receives
        the right to convert the contract to a Two-Way contract. Whether or not an eligible
        contract includes an Exhibit 10 is a matter of negotiation between the player and team.
        To be eligible to contain an Exhibit 10, a contract must be for one season at the
        minimum salary, with no bonuses of any kind (other than an optional Exhibit 10 bonus),
        and no compensation protection (see question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>)<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        An Exhibit 10 bonus can pay the player from $5,000 to $50,000 if the player is waived
        by his NBA team, signs with the G-League, is assigned to the NBA team's G-League
        affiliate, and stays there at least 60 days. A team can only add an Exhibit 10 bonus
        if the team actually has a G-League affiliate team. An Exhibit 10 can also specify a
        Conversion Protection Amount between $5,000 and $50,000, which becomes compensation
        protection if the contract is converted to a Two-Way contract. If a contract contains
        an Exhibit 10 bonus it must also contain a Conversion Protection Amount in the same
        amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other rules related to Exhibit 10:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A team can have no more than six contracts that contain an Exhibit 10 in effect
            at any time.</li>
        <li>A contract must be converted to a Two-Way contract prior to the start of the
            regular season (including during the July Moratorium).</li>
        <li>A contract can have both an Exhibit 9 (limiting the team's liability in the
            event he is injured (see question number <a href="#Q70">70</a>) and an Exhibit
            10. If the contract is converted to a Two-Way contract, the Exhibit 9 becomes
            null and void.</li>
        <li>A standard NBA contract with an Exhibit 10 that is converted to a Two-Way
            contract can later be converted back to a standard NBA contract.</li>
        <li>If a second round draft pick signs his required tender (a contract offer the
            team submits in order to retain the player's draft rights) and is later waived,
            that team is the only team that can convert the player to a Two-Way player for
            the remainder of that season.</li>
        <li>Exhibit 10 bonuses are not counted as Team Salary (see question number
            <a href="#Q13">13</a>), but they are included in league-wide total salaries
            (see question number <a href="#Q15">15</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Any Two-Way contract can be converted to a standard NBA contract at the teams option.
        A Two-Way contract can be converted from the start of the July Moratorium through the
        day of the teams last regular season game in the last year of the Two-Way contract.
        Once converted, the contract becomes a standard NBA contract that is in effect for the
        remainder of the term of the Two-Way contract. The players salary becomes the NBA
        minimum salary based on his years of service (pro-rated based on when the contract is
        converted). If the contract contains an Exhibit 10 bonus, the bonus amount converts to
        a salary guarantee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a Two-Way contract is converted to a standard NBA contract, the regular trade
        restriction exists for the first three months or until December 15, whichever is later
        (see question number <a href="#Q101">101</a>). The three month period begins on the
        date the contract is converted.
      </p>

      <p>
        In lieu of converting a Two-Way contract to a standard NBA contract, teams and players
        are also free to negotiate and sign a standard NBA contract. If a new NBA contract is
        signed, the Two-Way contract becomes null and void.

      <h4>84. What are the rules regarding trades?</h4>

      <p>
        Teams under the salary cap may make trades as they please, as long
        as they don't finish more than $100,000 above the salary cap following
        any trade. But if a team finishes more than $100,000 over the cap, whether
        they started out above or below the cap, then an exception is required.
        An exception is the mechanism that allows a team to make trades or sign
        players and finish over the salary cap. Since most teams are usually
        over the salary cap, trades are usually completed using exceptions.
      </p>  
        
      <p>
         Some exceptions are available only for signing free agents, and those
         exceptions are covered in question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>. The
         exceptions available for making trades are as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Traded Player exception</strong> is the principal means
            through which most trades are made. It is described in question numbers
            <a href="#Q85">85</a>, <a href="#Q86">86</a> and <a href="#Q87">87</a>.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Minimum Player Salary exception</strong> can be used for either
            trades or signing free agents. It allows teams to acquire minimum-salary
            players. See question number <a href="#Q88">88</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Disabled Player exception</strong> also can be used for either
            trades or signing free agents. It allows teams to replace certain injured
            players (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a> for more information).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sometimes there are multiple ways to configure the same trade. For example,
        a minimum-salary player might be acquired using either the Traded Player
        exception or the Minimum Player Salary exception, or a two-for-two trade might
        also work as two separate one-for-one trades. Teams are allowed to choose
        the configuration that works best for them. See question number
        <a href="#Q90">90</a> for an example of this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trades require at least two teams, and in theory the maximum limit is
        the number of teams in the league -- i.e., it is possible (although very
        unlikely) for there to be a single trade in which every NBA team is involved.
        Each team in a trade must send something out <em>and</em> take something
        back, where the following requirements must be met:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>In all trades (no matter how many teams are involved), each team must
            send out <em>and</em> take back at least one of the following:
            <ul>
              <li>A player under contract (the player may be a Two-Way player).</li>
              <li>A future draft pick. If a pick is protected (see question number
                  <a href="#Q89">89</a>), then no more than 55 picks in a single
                  draft can be protected.</li>
              <li>The draft rights to an "NBA prospect" -- a player with a reasonable
                  chance of becoming an NBA player during his career, or a
                  contributing player in a reputable professional league (as
                  determined by the league office).</li>
              <li>The right to swap unencumbered picks in a future draft.</li>
              <li>$110,000 or more.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In addition to the above, in a three (or more) team trade, each team must
            "touch" at least two other teams in the trade. To qualify as a touch, at
            least one of the following must be sent (in either direction):
            <ul>
              <li>An active player contract</li>
              <li>At least $1.1 million cash</li>
              <li>A future pick that will actually be conveyed (for example, a team can't
                  meet the touching requirement by sending a top-55 protected pick, that
                  switches to $100,000 cash if it falls within the top 55)</li>
              <li>The draft rights to an actual NBA prospect (same description as above)</li>
            </ul>
            For example, a three-team trade in which Team A exchanges players with
            both Team B and Team C, but Teams B and C do not exchange assets, is
            illegal. However, the above trade is legal if Team B sends Team C an
            unprotected draft pick <em>or</em> Team C sends Team B one.
        </li>
        <li>Cash cannot be the only asset sent out in trade for a first round draft
            pick. In other words, teams can't "sell" their first round draft picks,
            but they can sell second round picks, player contracts or draft rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When teams wish to complete a trade they must set up a "trade call" with
        the league office. If the teams wish to complete the trade over a weekend
        they must notify the league office on Friday, otherwise the trade call
        cannot be held until the following Monday. The trade is not complete
        until all terms have been agreed to during the trade call.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the trade call the teams and the league office review:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The exact terms of the trade (players involved, cash, draft picks, etc.).</li>
        <li>Contract details for each player, including remaining seasons, salary
            and any trade bonuses.</li>
        <li>Health information for all players, including any factors that could
            affect a player's ability to play basketball at any point in his career.
            Teams <em>must</em> disclose any relevant health information.</li>
        <li>Insurance information, including any exclusions (see question number
            <a href="#Q73">73</a>).</li>
        <li>Each team's responsibilities and understandings.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Following the trade call each team sends the league office an email with
        the terms of the transaction, and the league office sends the involved
        teams instructions for conditions that must be satisfied before the trade
        becomes official (such as physical exams). When all conditions have been
        satisfied, the league office sends another email notifying the teams that
        the trade is complete. Any term or condition that is not specified in the
        trade call is not enforceable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Players must be notified of a trade no later than one hour after the trade
        call, and no less than one hour before any public announcement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Players cannot play, practice or work out with their new teams until the
        league office notifies the teams that the trade is complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team misrepresents or fails to disclose any pertinent information
        during the trade call, the Commissioner can impose penalties including
        a fine up to $1 million, suspension of the team executives who were
        involved, rescinding the trade, and/or the forfeit of draft picks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traded players must report to their new teams within 48 hours of receiving
        notice of an in-season trade, or within one week if the trade occurred
        during the offseason. If a player fails to report to his new team following
        a trade it can be deemed conduct prejudicial to the NBA, and subject the
        player to a fine and/or suspension.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since salary can be deferred or paid on an alternate schedule (see question
        number <a href="#Q115">115</a>), a team can trade a player to whom it owes
        salary for services rendered prior to the trade. When this happens, the team
        sends any back salary to the player's new team, and the new team pays the 
        player.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a player is traded, his full season salary is transferred to the team
        salary of his new team, and he counts $0 toward his old team's team salary.
        The exception is when determining whether teams have met their minimum team
        salary obligations (see question number <a href="#Q14">14</a>). For minimum
        team salary purposes the salary of a traded player is divided among the teams
        for which he played. For example, if a $10 million player is traded exactly
        60% of the way through the season, then the player's original team counts
        $6 million of the player's salary for minimum team salary purposes, and the
        player's new team counts $4 million of the player's salary for minimum team
        salary purposes. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q85" class="question">
      <h4>85. What is the Traded Player exception?</h4>

      <p>
        As described in question number <a href="#Q84">84</a>, exceptions
        are the mechanisms that allow teams to sign players or make trades that
        leave them above the salary cap. Any trade which leaves the team over
        the salary cap requires an exception -- even if the team is moving
        downward in salary. For example, if the salary cap is $100 million, a
        team has a team salary of $105 million, and they want to trade a $10
        million player for a $6 million player, they still have to use an
        exception. Even though their team salary is decreasing by $4 million
        as a result of the trade, the fact that they would finish over the
        salary cap ($101 million) means that an exception is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Traded Player exception is the primary means by which teams over the
        cap complete trades. It allows teams to make trades that leave them over
        the cap, but it places several restrictions on those trades. Trades using
        the Traded Player exception fall into two categories:
        <strong>simultaneous</strong> and <strong>non-simultaneous</strong>. As
        its name suggests, a simultaneous trade takes place all at once. Teams
        can trade players together and acquire considerably more salary than
        they trade away in a simultaneous trade. Simultaneous trades are
        described in question number <a href="#Q86">86</a>. A
        non-simultaneous trade may take up to a year to complete, but the team
        can only trade away one player, and its team salary can increase by no
        more than $100,000 as a result of the trade. Non-simultaneous trades
        are described in question number <a href="#Q87">87</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>simultaneous trade</strong> gives the team more money but less
            time</li>
        <li>A <strong>non-simultaneous trade</strong> gives the team more time but
            less money</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A player's trade value is typically the same as his Team Salary amount, but
        there are situations where the outgoing value can be different:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For contracts signed under the current CBA, the outgoing salary for trade
            purposes only includes earned or guaranteed base salary -- it does not
            include any unearned salary that is not guaranteed for lack of skill or
            injury/illness (see question number <a href="#Q63">63</a>). For example,
            in a contract signed in 2018 with a base salary of $10 million with $6
            million guaranteed for lack of skill, the player's outgoing salary for
            trade purposes would be $6 million (as long as he hadn't already earned
            more than $6 million of his salary). Starting January 10 all base salary
            becomes fully guaranteed for the remainder of that season, so the player's
            full base salary is used for trade purposes. After a team's season ends
            (and through June 30), they use the lesser of the full salary for the
            current season and the guaranteed base salary for the upcoming season.</li>
        <li>For contracts and extensions signed under the <em>previous</em> CBA, they
            use the player's base salary and likely bonuses (not unlikely bonuses),
            without regard to whether the salary is guaranteed.</li>
        <li>For a minimum-salary player with more than two years in the league and
            playing on a one-year contract, the minimum salary for a two-year player
            is used.</li>
        <li>For players who were subject to the Gilbert Arenas provision (see question
            number <a href="#Q43">43</a>), the cap amount for the trading team is used,
            which may be either the actual salary or average salary for the contract.</li>
        <li>For sign-and-trade transactions (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>),
            the outgoing salary for players who are subject to what was previously
            referred to as Base Year Compensation is either the previous salary or 50% of the
            new salary, whichever is greater (see question number <a href="#Q93">93</a>).</li>
        <li>Two-way players have an outgoing trade value of $0.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Likewise, a player's incoming salary for the receiving team can also vary:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For players traded after their rookie extension is signed but before it takes
            effect, the trade value for the receiving team is the average of the salaries
            in the last year of the rookie scale contract and each year of the extension
            (see question number <a href="#Q91">91</a>).</li>
        <li>For contracts with trade bonuses, the player's incoming salary contains a
            pro-rated portion of the trade bonus (see question number <a href="#Q100">100</a>).</li>
        <li>Performance incentives that are team-based, and based on the previous-season
            performance of the team are recomputed when the player is traded, and may change
            from likely to unlikely, or from unlikely to likely. If this happens, the player's
            incoming salary will be different from his outgoing salary (see question number
            <a href="#Q74">74</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It is important to view a trade separately from each team's perspective,
        rather than as a single, unified transaction. This is because the same
        trade may be organized differently according to each team's needs. For
        example, a trade might be classified as a simultaneous trade from one
        team's perspective, but from the other team's perspective it's actually
        broken into two separate trades, one simultaneous and the other
        non-simultaneous, completing a trade they started months earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several restrictions on trades (either simultaneous or
        non-simultaneous) which are described in other questions in this FAQ.

        Also be aware that while the term "Traded Player exception"
        refers to the entire exception which allows teams to make trades above
        the salary cap (including both simultaneous and non-simultaneous
        trades), it is also commonly used to refer to the one-year monetary
        credit teams receive while a non-simultaneous trade is pending completion.
        Be aware of this potential ambiguity. In this document "Traded Player
        exception" is used to refer to the exception, and "trade
        exception" is used to refer to the one-year credit.

      <h4>86. How do simultaneous trades work? How much salary can a team take back in a simultaneous trade?</h4>

      <p>
        A simultaneous trade takes place all at once. The amount of salary a
        team can take back in a simultaneous trade depends on the amount of
        outgoing salary<sup>1</sup> and whether the team is a taxpayer.<sup>2</sup>
        They always use the post-trade team salary when looking at whether a team
        is a taxpayer, so a team under the tax level would be considered a
        taxpayer if the trade takes them over the tax level.<sup>3,4</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        For non-taxpaying teams (again, they must be under the tax level <em>after</em>
        the trade), the salaries that can be acquired depend on the total salaries
        the team is trading away:
      </p>

      <table class="lefttable">
        <caption>Non-Taxpaying Teams</caption>
        <tbody><tr>
          <th>Outgoing salary</th>
          <th>Maximum incoming salary</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$0 to $6,533,333</td>
          <td>175% of the outgoing salary, plus $100,000<sup>5</sup></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$6,533,334 to $19.6 million</td>
          <td>The outgoing salary plus $5 million<sup>5</sup></td>

        <tr>
          <td>$19.6 million and up</td>
          <td>125% of the outgoing salary, plus $100,000</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>

      <p>
        Taxpaying teams can take back up to 125% of their outgoing salaries,
        plus $100,000, no matter how much salary the team is sending away. For
        example, a taxpaying team trading away $10 million in salaries can
        acquire one or more replacement players making up to $12.6 million.
      </p>

      <table class="lefttable">
        <caption>Taxpaying Teams</caption>
        <tbody><tr>
          <th>Outgoing salary</th>
          <th>Maximum incoming salary</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Any</td>
          <td>125% of the outgoing salary, plus $100,000</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>

      <p>
        If a taxpaying team trades away a $10 million player, they can take back
        one player making $12.6 million or less, two $6 million players, three
        $4 million players, etc. However, there must be enough roster spots for
        the incoming players. A team with a full roster of 15 players cannot trade
        one player for two players without first waiving a player on its roster
        (or sending him away in another trade). This team could not acquire two
        players and simultaneously waive one of the incoming players.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams can send out more than one player in the same simultaneous trade,
        "aggregating" their salaries in order to acquire a replacement player
        with a higher salary than can be acquired by trading any outgoing player
        alone. For example, since the most a taxpaying team can receive for a $10
        million player is $12.6 million, it cannot trade its $10 million player
        for another team's $15 million player. However, it can aggregate the
        salary of its $10 million player with that of another player making $2
        million. With the combined $12 million in outgoing salaries the team can
        receive up to $15.1 million in return, which lets them trade for the $15
        million player. An aggregated trade must be simultaneous -- aggregated
        non-simultaneous trades are not allowed. Also, if a team used an exception
        to acquire a player (which means it acquired the player by any means other
        than using cap room), it cannot include that player in an aggregated trade
        for two months.<sup>6</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoiding aggregation (where possible) can be advantageous to a
        non-taxpaying team. Suppose the team wants to trade two players who
        make $10 million each. By aggregating the team can take back 125% plus
        $100,000 of the aggregated $20 million (see the chart above), or $25.1
        million. But if the team trades the players individually -- without
        aggregation -- it can take back $15 million for each player, for a
        total of $30 million. The other advantage to avoiding aggregation
        is that trades of individual players can be non-simultaneous,
        possibly gaining the team a trade exception (see question number
        <a href="#Q87">87</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        As described in question number <a href="#Q84">84</a>, a team below the
        cap may disregard salaries when making trades, as long as the team
        finishes no more than $100,000 above the cap as the result of a trade.
        However, a team below the cap can choose to use the trade rules for teams
        above the cap if it works to the team's advantage. For example, if a team
        is $1 million below the cap, then by using the trade rules for teams below
        the cap it can trade an $8 million player for a player making up to $9.1
        million. By using the rules in place for teams above the cap, the team
        could trade the $8 million player for a player making up to $13 million.

      <h4>87. What is a non-simultaneous trade?</h4>

      <p>
        In some cases, teams have up to one year to acquire the replacement
        player(s) to complete a trade. These trades are considered
        <i>non-simultaneous</i>. In a non-simultaneous trade, a team can
        acquire only up to 100% plus $100,000 of the outgoing salary<sup>1</sup>
        (as opposed to a higher amount in a simultaneous trade). A trade in which
        salaries are aggregated (see question number <a href="#Q86">86</a>)
        cannot be non-simultaneous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is an example of a non-simultaneous trade: a team trades away a
        $2 million player for a $1 million player. Sometime in the next year,
        they trade a draft pick (with zero trade value itself) for a $1.1
        million player to complete the earlier trade. They ended up acquiring
        $2.1 million in salary for their $2 million player -- they just didn't
        do it all at once, or even necessarily with the same trading partner.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the above example, following the initial trade of the $2 million player
        for the $1 million player, it was like the team had a $1 million "credit"
        which was good for one year<sup>2</sup>, with which they could acquire
        salaries without having to send out salaries to match. As with simultaneous
        trades, teams are allowed to acquire an extra $100,000 -- so a $1 million
        credit can be used to acquire $1.1 million in salaries. This credit is often
        referred to as a <i>Traded Player exception</i> or a <i>trade exception</i>,
        but be aware that the CBA uses the name "Traded Player exception" to refer
        to the entire exception which allows teams to make trades above the salary
        cap (including both simultaneous and non-simultaneous trades). In this
        document "Traded Player exception" is used to refer to the exception, and
        "trade exception" is used to refer to the one-year credit.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several common misconceptions about trade exceptions and
        non-simultaneous trades:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Teams cannot use trade exceptions to sign free agents; they can be
            used only to acquire existing contracts from other teams. However, a
            team can acquire a free agent using a trade exception if he is signed
            by his prior team and traded in a sign-and-trade transaction (see
            question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>).</li>
        <li>Trade exceptions are never traded from one team to another. Sometimes
            it appears like this is happening when one team uses a trade exception
            to acquire salary without sending salary away, and the other team
            gains a trade exception in the same transaction because they sent away
            salary without receiving salary in return. However, the trade exception
            the first team uses and the trade exception the second team gains are
            two distinct trade exceptions.</li>
        <li>Teams cannot combine trade exceptions with other exceptions (such
            as the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception or a taxpaying team's 125%
            plus $100,000 margin from another simultaneous trade) in order to
            trade for a more expensive player. For example, a taxpaying team
            with a $1 million trade exception cannot combine it with their $2
            million player to trade for a $3 million player (see question number
            <a href="#Q90">90</a> for more information on combining exceptions).</li>
        <li>A common misconception is that players cannot be traded together in a
            non-simultaneous trade. This is not true -- players can be traded
            together as long as the outgoing salaries are not aggregated. For example,
            trading two $10 million players for a $20 million player requires
            aggregation, and therefore must be simultaneous. But trading two $10
            million players for a $12 million player can be accomplished without
            aggregation -- one of the $10 million players would be used to acquire
            the $12 million player in a simultaneous trade, and the other $10
            million player would be traded for "nothing," in a non-simultaneous
            trade, gaining the team a $10 million trade exception.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Here is a more complicated example of a legal non-simultaneous trade: Team A
        is a taxpaying team with a $4 million trade exception from a previous trade,
        and a $10 million player it currently wants to trade. Team B is a taxpaying
        team with three players making $4 million, $5 million and $7 million, and these
        two teams want to complete a three-for-one trade with these four players. This
        trade is legal -- the $5 million and $7 million players together make less than
        the 125% plus $100,000 allowed for the $10 million player ($12.6 million), and
        the $4 million player fits within the $4 million trade exception. So the $4
        million player actually completes the previous, non-simultaneous trade, and
        Team A is left trading its $10 million player for Team B's $5 million and $7
        million players in a separate, simultaneous trade. From Team B's perspective
        there is also a simultaneous and a non-simultaneous trade -- it aggregates its
        $4 million and $5 million players to acquire Team A's $10 million player in a
        simultaneous trade, and it sends the $7 million player to Team A for "nothing"
        in a separate non-simultaneous trade, thereby receiving a $7 million trade
        exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams can consume only <em>part</em> of a trade exception, in which case
        they can use the remainder in a future trade. For example, if a team
        trades a $4 million player for a $2 million player, they gain a $2 million
        trade exception. If they later trade a draft pick for a $1 million player,
        they still have $1 million left over to acquire more players and complete
        the earlier trade (until one year from the date of the original trade).
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams that are under the cap when initiating a trade cannot receive a trade
        exception, even if they end up over the cap as a result of the trade.

      <h4>88. How are minimum-salary players handled in trades?</h4>

      <p>
        The "Minimum Player Salary exception" allows teams to acquire
        minimum-salary players<sup>1</sup> without regard to salary matching under
        the Traded Player exception (see question number <a href="#Q85">85</a>).
        For example, a team over the cap can trade a second round draft pick to
        another team in exchange for a minimum-salary player, even if he is a
        10-year veteran earning over $2 million.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a team acquires multiple players in the same trade, it essentially
        ignores the incoming salary for all minimum-salary players, since they
        fall under the Minimum Player Salary exception. Suppose a taxpaying team
        is over the cap and trades a $5 million player, receiving in return a $6 million
        player and two players earning $1.5 million each on minimum-salary contracts.
        The team trading the $5 million player can accept only $6.35 million in
        return (125% plus $100,000 of $5 million), and the three incoming players
        combine for $9 million in salary. However, the two $1.5 million players are
        covered by the Minimum Player Salary exception, so only the $6 million player
        is traded with the Traded Player exception. Since $6 million is within the
        team's $6.35 million limit using the Traded Player exception, the trade
        is allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trade bonuses are allowed in minimum salary contracts, but the bonus
        doesn't vest until a trade actually occurs -- so such a contract is
        considered to be a minimum salary contract for signing purposes. However,
        the bonus takes effect when the player is traded, so the receiving team
        must use some means other than the Minimum Player Salary exception to
        complete the trade. If no other means are available, the player can elect
        to waive his trade bonus so the trade complies with the Minimum Player
        Salary exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams trading away minimum-salary players <em>do</em> count their
        salaries (the portion not paid by the league -- see question number
        <a href="#Q15">15</a>) as outgoing salary when comparing salaries for trade.

      <h4>89. How are draft picks handled in trades? What is the Ted Stepien rule?</h4>

      <p>
        Draft picks (both first and second round) count $0 for salary matching
        purposes. This is true both before and after the draft, until the player
        signs a contract. This can make it very difficult to construct a trade
        that is equitable in both trade value and basketball value. For example,
        Vancouver selected Steve Francis with the #2 pick in the 1999 draft, and
        subsequently traded his draft rights to Houston. When the trade was finally
        engineered, it included three teams (Orlando was also involved), 11 players
        (including Francis) and two future draft picks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the draft pick signs a contract, his actual salary becomes his trade
        value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that even though a draft pick's trade value (for salary matching
        purposes) is $0, a first round pick is included in team salary at 120% of
        his scale amount once he is selected in the draft, until he signs a contract
        with the team holding his draft rights or with a non-NBA team (see question
        number <a href="#Q47">47</a>) or agrees in writing not to sign an NBA contract
        that season (see question number <a href="#Q13">13</a>). If an unsigned first
        round draft pick is traded, then 120% of his scale amount is included in the
        acquiring team's team salary as soon as the trade is completed. An unsigned
        second round pick does not count toward team salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "Seven Year Rule" allows teams to trade draft picks up to seven
        drafts into the future (for example, if this is the 2017-18 season,
        then a 2024 pick can be traded, but a 2025 pick cannot). It is common to
        "protect" picks depending on their position (for example, "we keep it if
        it falls #1 through #14, otherwise you get it"), although no more than
        55 picks in a single draft can be protected (for example, a top-55
        protected pick is legal, but a top-56 protected pick is not). This helps
        to avoid a repeat of some unfortunate past trades, such as the 1980 trade
        between the Cavs and Lakers where LA received what turned out to be the
        first overall pick in the 1982 draft, which they used to select James
        Worthy. It is common for these protections to relax over several years. For
        example, a team might convey its own pick in the first draft in which it
        is not a protected pick, where a protected pick is defined as picks 1-14
        in 2018; 1-10 in 2019; 1-6 in 2020; and unprotected in 2021. If the team's
        picks in 2018, 2019 or 2020 fall within the protected range, then they
        keep it; otherwise it is conveyed to the other team. If they make it
        to 2021 without having conveyed a pick, then the other team gets their 2021
        pick unconditionally.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team may protect its pick through all seven upcoming drafts. However, if
        a protected pick is not conveyed by the seventh draft, the obligation to
        convey a pick either must extinguish after the seventh draft, or convert to
        a permissible alternative (such as a second round pick).
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams are restricted from trading away future first round draft picks in
        consecutive years. This is known as the "Ted Stepien Rule." Stepien owned
        the Cavs from 1980-83, and made a series of bad trades (such as the 1980
        trade mentioned above) that cost the Cavs several years' first round picks.
        As a result of Stepien's ineptitude, teams are now prevented from making
        trades which might leave them without a first round pick in consecutive
        future years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Stepien rule applies only to <em>future</em> first round picks. For
        example, if this is the 2017-18 season, then a team can trade its 2018
        first round pick without regard to whether they had traded their 2017
        pick, since their 2017 pick is no longer a future pick. But they can't
        trade away both their 2018 and 2019 picks, since both are future picks.
        Teams sometimes work around this rule by trading first round picks in
        alternate years, or by giving one team the right to swap picks with the
        other.
      </p>

      <p>
        When dealing with protected picks, the Stepien rule is interpreted to
        mean that a team can't trade a pick if there is any chance at all that
        it will leave the team without a first round pick in consecutive
        future drafts.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team trades two future first round picks and the first of those
        picks is protected, then that pick would be conveyed in the first draft
        in which the protection does not apply (as described above), and the
        second pick would be conveyed two years after the first pick is conveyed.
        But since both picks must be conveyed within seven years, the protection
        on the first pick cannot last longer than four years (i.e., the first
        pick must be conveyed by the fifth year).
      </p>

      <p>
        A team can have up to two picks with this two-year waiting period in
        effect at any time. In order to have two such picks with subsequent
        conveyance, the protection on the first trade cannot last longer than
        two years (i.e., the first pick must be conveyed by the third year,
        so the first subsequent pick is conveyed by the fifth year, and the
        second subsequent pick is conveyed by the seventh year).
      </p>

      <p>
        Other rules that pertain to trading draft picks:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Teams cannot trade future picks not already in their possession.
            For example, a team cannot make a trade in 2017 that conveys the
            lesser of any 2020 first round pick in its possession on the date
            of the 2020 draft, and subsequently acquire a pick to send.</li>
        <li>A team can add protection to a pick it acquires in trade, as
            long as they received the pick as an unconditional pick. For
            example, Team A can receive an unprotected first round pick from
            Team B, and subsequently trade the pick to Team C, protected for
            picks 1-14. A team cannot add protections to a pick that already
            had protections when it was received. For example, Team A cannot
            receive a pick that is protected for picks 1-5 from Team B, and
            then add further protections when trading it to Team C. However,
            Team A could receive an unconditional pick from Team B, then trade
            it to Team C, protected for picks 1-14, and also to Team D,
            protected for picks 15-30 (i.e., Team D gets the pick if it's in
            the lottery, and Team C gets the pick if it isn't in the lottery).</li>
        <li>Teams cannot subsequently acquire picks to change the "first
            allowable draft" per the Stepien rule. For example, suppose a team
            trades away two picks, with the first being a conditional pick and
            the second in the first allowable draft after the first pick is
            conveyed. If the first pick is conveyed in 2018, then the first
            allowable draft in which the second pick can be conveyed is 2020.
            If the team subsequently acquires a 2019 pick from another team
            (so it has two picks that year), the first allowable draft for the
            conveyance of the second pick remains 2020.</li>
        <li>Any or all teams in a trade may be granted the one-time option to
            defer the conveyance or receipt of a pick for one year (only). For
            example, a trade between Miami and Orlando that includes Miami's
            2019 first round draft pick might provide Miami with the option to
            defer the pick to 2020. In addition:

            <ul>
              <li>A team can exercise a pick deferment only once.</li>
              <li>The conveyance of a pick can be deferred for only one year.</li>
              <li>A protected pick (as described above) cannot be deferred.</li>
              <li>The deferment is subject to the Seven Year Rule. A pick in
                  the seventh year following a trade cannot be deferred.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Except for pick protection and the one-time option to defer the
            conveyance of a pick as described above, trades must specify the
            precise year in which a pick is to be conveyed.</li>
        <li>The year of any alternative consideration must also be specified. For
            Example, if a traded first round pick is protected for picks 1-14 in
            2018 and converts to two second round picks if it is not conveyed,
            the years of those second round picks must be specified.</li>
        <li>A traded draft pick cannot have protection based on draft position
            <em>and</em> a one-time option to defer.</li>
        <li>Teams are required to have only <em>a</em> first round pick, and not
            necessarily <em>their own</em> first round pick. Teams may trade away
            their own future picks in consecutive years if they already own another
            team's unconditional first round pick in one of those years. For
            example, if this is the 2017-18 season and a team has already traded
            away its 2019 first round pick, it cannot trade its 2018 pick. However,
            if it acquires another team's first round pick in either 2018 or 2019,
            its own 2018 pick can then be traded.</li>
        <li>A team cannot sign its draft pick and immediately trade the player in a
            sign-and-trade arrangement (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>).</li>
        <li>A pick cannot be traded on the day of the draft before the pick is made.</li>
        <li>Lottery picks cannot be traded from 6:00 PM on the day before the draft
            lottery until the lottery is complete.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>90. Can exceptions be combined when making trades?</h4>

      <p>
        Only to a very limited extent -- teams can combine exceptions in
        the same trade if they are used on different players. Teams cannot
        combine exceptions in order to acquire one player. For example, a
        taxpaying team may trade a $5 million player for a $5.5 million
        player and two veterans earning approximately $1.5 million each on
        minimum-salary contracts. The Minimum Player Salary exception is used
        for the two minimum-salary players, and the $5.5 million player is
        acquired using the Traded Player exception ($5.5 million is within
        125% plus $100,000 of $5 million). This is allowed because two
        exceptions were not combined to acquire any one player.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other legal combining of exceptions is aggregation, as described
        in question number <a href="#Q86">86</a>, where the outgoing salaries
        of multiple players sometimes can be combined in a single simultaneous
        trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if that team has a $5 million player and a $1 million trade
        exception from a previous trade, it cannot add the trade exception
        to the 125% plus $100,000 margin from their $5 million player
        ($6.35 million), in order to trade for a player making $7 million.
        This cannot be done, as it would invoke using two exceptions on the
        same player.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team has two trade exceptions from previous non-simultaneous
        trades, they can't combine them into one larger trade exception.
        Suppose a team trades a $5 million player for a $4 million player
        (generating a $1 million trade exception) and separately trades
        a $3 million player for a $1 million player (generating a $2
        million trade exception). They cannot combine the two into a single
        $3 million trade exception. A rule of thumb is that a trade
        exception can only be used to acquire a player making up to the
        amount of the exception plus $100,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        (See question numbers <a href="#Q85">85</a> and <a href="#Q87">87</a>
        for more information on the Traded Player exception and non-simultaneous
        trades. See question number <a href="#Q88">88</a> for more information on
        the Minimum Player Salary exception.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The legal combining of exceptions sometimes gives the appearance of
        teams getting away with illegal trades. For example, as detailed in
        question number <a href="#Q101">101</a>, when a team acquires a player
        in trade using an exception (and not cap room), the team cannot aggregate
        that player's salary in trade for two months. For example, New Orleans
        acquired Jerryd Bayless from Portland on October 23, 2010, and traded him
        with Peja Stojakovic to Toronto on November 20, 2010. This trade did not
        violate the two-month rule because New Orleans did not aggregate the salaries
        of Bayless and Stojakovic to acquire any of the Toronto players.

      <h4>91. What is the Poison Pill Provision?</h4>

      <p>
        "Poison Pill" isn't a defined term in the CBA, but there are a couple
        situations that are commonly referred to as a poison pill -- meaning
        a contract clause that creates a potential difficulty because the cap
        accounting can vary from the norm.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first is when a team extends a first round draft pick's rookie scale
        contract (see question number <a href="#Q58">58</a>) and then trades the
        player between the date the extension is signed and the date it takes effect.
        When this happens, the player's trade value for the receiving team is the
        <em>average</em> of the salaries in the last year of the rookie scale contract
        and each year of the extension. The sending team uses the player's actual
        salary when calculating their total outgoing salary, and uses the current-year
        maximum salary in place of the (unknown) maximum salary for a future season,
        if necessary<sup>1</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if a player on the last year of his rookie scale contract earns
        $5 million in 2018-19, and his contract is extended for four seasons starting
        at $10 million, with 5% raises, then his salary in each season will be:

      <p>
        If this player is traded during the 2018-19 season, then his outgoing
        salary from the sending team's perspective is his actual salary -- $5
        million. But the player's incoming salary from the receiving team's
        perspective is $9.6 million -- the average of all five seasons. Such
        a player would be very difficult to trade -- a legal trade can only be
        accomplished if both teams add additional salary to the transaction,
        or if they include a third team that is able to absorb excess salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Gilbert Arenas provision (see question number <a href="#Q43">43</a>)
        also has been described as containing a poison pill. This is in reference
        to the third season of contracts signed according to this provision, which
        can contain substantially higher salaries than the first two seasons.
        Houston used this provision to its advantage when signing Jeremy Lin
        and Omer Asik in 2012. However, the impact of this poison pill was
        reduced in the 2017 CBA, when matching teams were given the ability to
        choose whether the actual or average salary counted toward their team
        salary.

      <h4>92. Can a free agent be signed and immediately traded?</h4>

      <p>
        The sign-and-trade rule allows teams to re-sign their own free agents for
        trading purposes. Under this rule the player is re-signed and immediately
        traded to another team. This is done by adding a clause to the contract
        stipulating that the contract is null and void if the trade to the specific
        team is not completed within 48 hours. A sign-and-trade is treated like a
        single, atomic transaction, and not two separate transactions between which
        one party can change its mind -- if the trade is not completed, then the
        signing is invalidated.
      </p>

      <p>
        To qualify for a sign-and-trade, all of the following must be true:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The player must re-sign with his prior team -- a team cannot include
            another team's free agent in a sign-and-trade.</li>
        <li>The player must finish the preceding season with that team (deals are
            no longer allowed that sign-and-trade players who are out of the league,
            such as the sign-and-trade that sent Keith Van Horn from Dallas to New
            Jersey as part of the Jason Kidd trade in 2008).</li>
        <li>The player cannot be a restricted free agent who has signed an
            offer sheet with another team (see question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>).</li>
        <li>The team receiving the player cannot be above the "Apron" (see question
            number <a href="#Q20">20</a>) at the conclusion of the trade<sup>1, 2</sup>.
            A team above the Apron can receive a player in a sign-and-trade if the
            trade reduces the team's payroll and the team finishes the trade below
            the Apron.</li>
        <li>The team cannot receive a player in a sign-and-trade if they have used
            the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>)
            that season.<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>The trade must be completed prior to the first game of the regular
            season (sign-and-trades are not allowed once the season begins).</li>
        <li>The player cannot be signed using the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level
            exception, the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, or any exception
            that cannot be used to offer a three-year contract (see question
            number <a href="#Q25">25</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A sign-and-trade deal can be made with a free agent who has been renounced (see
        question number <a href="#Q39">39</a>), as long as all the above criteria are
        met. Sign-and-trade contracts must be for at least three seasons (not including
        any option year) and no longer than four seasons<sup>3</sup>. The first year of
        the contract must be fully guaranteed, but the remaining seasons can be
        non-guaranteed. The combination of a three-year minimum with a one-year guarantee
        ensures that the player's new team cannot acquire the player's Bird rights any
        sooner than if they had signed him directly (if they wanted to re-sign him in
        less than three years they would first have to waive him, and lose any Bird
        rights -- see question number <a href="#Q32">32</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        A Designated Veteran contract cannot be used in a sign-and-trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        The starting salary in a contract signed for a sign-and-trade may be any
        amount up to the player's maximum, however if the player meets the 5th Year
        30% Max criteria (see question number <a href="#Q24">24</a>) he cannot
        receive a salary greater than 25% of the cap. Raises are limited to 5%.
        The player also may be considered to have a lower outgoing salary for trade
        purposes, which can complicate the trade (see question number
        <a href="#Q93">93</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If a sign-and-trade contract contains a signing bonus, then either team
        can pay it. By default the team that signs the player pays the signing
        bonus (as with any other contract), but since a sign-and-trade is in
        essence a contract with the receiving team, the teams can agree that
        the receiving team will pay it. Any portion that is paid by the signing
        team counts toward the team's annual limit for cash included in a
        trade (see question number <a href="#Q98">98</a>), which in effect
        limits the portion of the signing bonus that can be paid by the signing
        team.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a sign-and-trade contract contains a trade bonus, then the bonus is
        not earned upon the trade that accompanies the signing, but rather on the
        first subsequent trade. See question number <a href="#Q96">96</a> for
        more information on how long a team must wait before they can trade a
        player.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team acquires a player in a sign-and-trade, then the Apron effectively
        becomes a hard cap for the remainder of that season. See question number
        <a href="#Q20">20</a> for details.

      <h4>93. What is "Base Year Compensation?" How does it affect trades?</h4>

      <p>
        Base Year Compensation (BYC) is mostly an artifact of previous
        collective bargaining agreements. Its intent was to prevent teams
        from signing free agents to new contracts with salaries specifically
        intended to help facilitate trades. BYC was triggered when a team
        was over the cap and re-signed a player using the Larry Bird or
        Early Bird exception with a raise over 20%. Once triggered, BYC
        temporarily lowered the player's outgoing salary for salary-matching
        purposes (only), and therefore reduced or eliminated teams' ability
        to target salaries for trade purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2011 CBA mostly eliminated BYC -- in fact, the term "Base Year
        Compensation" was removed from the agreement entirely. The rules
        formerly known as BYC now apply under just one circumstance -- during
        sign-and-trade transactions (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>).
        If a team re-signs its Larry Bird or Early Bird free agent in order
        to trade the player in a sign-and-trade transaction, the player's new
        salary is greater than the minimum, he receives a raise greater than
        20%, and the team is at or above the cap immediately after the
        signing<sup>1</sup>, then the player's outgoing salary for trade
        purposes is either his previous salary or 50% of his new salary,
        whichever is greater. The team receiving the player always uses his
        new salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, a player made $5 million last season, is a Larry Bird
        free agent, and re-signs with his previous team for $10 million. The
        team is a taxpayer, and therefore is over the cap following the signing.
        The signing is part of a sign-and-trade transaction for another team's
        $10 million player. Since the BYC conditions were satisfied the player's
        outgoing salary for the trade portion of this sign-and-trade transaction
        is $5 million. This trade therefore would not be allowed, even though
        the players' new salaries match, since a taxpaying team cannot trade a
        $5 million player for a $10 million player. The highest salary this team
        could acquire in a sign-and-trade arrangement is $6.35 million<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a sign-and-trade is complete, the player's actual salary is
        included in his new team's team salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        In lieu of the previous BYC rules for ordinary trades, teams are now
        prohibited from trading players for three months or until January 15
        (whichever is later), instead of December 15, when the signing satisfies
        the BYC critieria<sup>3</sup> (see question number <a href="#Q101">101</a>).
        The extension to January 15 applies to both sign-and-trade transactions
        and regular signings.

    <div id="Q94" class="question">
      <h4>94. Why would teams or players want to do a sign-and-trade?</h4>

      <p>
        Teams benefit because they can get something in return for players they
        otherwise would lose to free agency. For players the benefits are limited,
        because a player can receive no bigger contract via sign-and-trade than
        he can get by signing with his new team directly (four years, 5% raises),
        and can receive a larger Bird contract or Designated Veteran contract only
        when staying with his previous team. It also is much simpler for the
        player to sign directly with his new team, as a sign-and-trade has to be
        agreed to by three parties rather than two. A player really only needs
        to seek a sign-and-trade if he wants to go to a team that is capped-out
        (or doesn't have enough cap room to give the player a high enough salary)
        and can't sign him directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another factor encouraging a player <em>not</em> to seek a sign-and-trade is
        that his new team might be weakened by losing players or draft picks in the
        trade. So while a sign-and-trade is a useful tool when the team does not
        have the cap room to sign the player directly, the player and his new team
        have little reason to seek a sign-and-trade when the player can be signed
        without involving his previous team.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Q95" class="question">
      <h4>95. Can a player be given an extension and traded at the same time?</h4>

      <p>
        Similar to a sign-and-trade arrangement (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>),
        a team may sign an eligible player to an extension (see question number
        <a href="#Q58">58</a>) and immediately trade him to another team. Such
        an "extend-and-trade" is limited to three seasons, which include any
        seasons remaining on the player's current contract<sup>1</sup>. The salary
        in the first season of the extension can have a 5% raise over the last
        season of the existing contract, and subsequent raises are limited to
        5% of the salary in the first season of the extension. The 5% limit also
        applies to both likely and unlikely bonuses.
      </p>

      <p>
        A player cannot be traded in an extend-and-trade after the season (for
        example, on draft day) in the last season of his contract, or in any season
        that <em>might</em> be the last season due to an option or ETO.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since an extend-and-trade has greater limits than a regular extension (three
        seasons<sup>2</sup> and 5% raises vs. four seasons<sup>2</sup> and 8% raises)
        the rules restrict teams from extending and trading the player in separate
        transactions in order to circumvent these limits. If a team extends a player
        beyond the limits of an extend-and-trade (for example, if they sign a player
        to a four-year extension), they can't trade the player for six months.
        Conversely, a team cannot extend a player it receives in trade for six months,
        if the extension exceeds the limits of an extend-and-trade<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Extend-and-trade transactions are rare. To date they have only been used for
        Kevin Garnett (traded from Minnesota to Boston in 2007) and Carmelo Anthony
        (traded from Denver to New York in 2011).
      </p>

      <p>
        A rookie scale contract (see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>) <em>can</em>
        be extended and traded in an extend-and-trade transaction, although there is
        no benefit to doing so. A rookie scale extension can be signed immediately
        after the player is traded (such as with James Harden's trade to the Rockets in
        2012), and a rookie scale extension (see question number <a href="#Q58">58</a>)
        can be much larger than the extension allowed through an extend-and-trade.

      <h4>96. When can a team trade a free agent it signs? Do they have to keep him forever?</h4>

      <p>
        Generally a team only has to keep a player for three months after signing a
        contract or December 15<sup>1</sup> of that season, whichever is later. This
        does not apply to draft picks, who can be traded 30 days after signing (even
        if signed using cap room in a later season -- see question number
        <a href="#Q49">49</a>). For sign-and-trade transactions, the initial trade
        which completes the sign-and-trade obviously is allowed, even though it occurs
        right after the player is signed. The trade restriction in a sign-and-trade
        applies to the first <em>subsequent</em> trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Two-Way contract (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>) can be traded
        30 days after it is signed. If the Two-Way contract is converted to a standard
        NBA contract it adopts the standard rule of not being tradable for three months

        the date the contract is converted.

        Players can be traded for cash, and cash can be included in trade packages.
        The amount of cash a team can pay or receive per season is limited to the
        "Maximum Annual Cash Limit," which is $5.1 million in 2017-18, with the 
        amount in each subsequent season determined by applying the percentage
        change in the salary cap to the previous amount. For example, if the salary
        cap increases by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the Maximum Annual Cash
        Limit will increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19.

      <p>
        There are two separate limits, one for the cash a team <em>pays</em> as part of
        trades each season, and the other for the cash a team <em>receives</em> as part
        of trades each season. For example, in 2017-18 a team may pay up to an aggregate
        $5.1 million in all trades it makes during the season, and it may receive up to
        an aggregate $5.1 million in all trades it makes during the season.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cash applies to the current season's limit even if it changes hands in a
        future season. For example, suppose a team trades a draft pick that is top-20
        protected this season, top-10 protected next season, and converts to $1 million
        cash if a pick is not conveyed by next season. $1 million is applied to the
        team's Maximum Annual Cash Limit for the current season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cash is NOT considered when matching salaries under the Traded Player exception.
        For example, a taxpaying team cannot add $3 million cash to a trade of their
        $5 million player in order to acquire a $10 million player.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a sign-and-trade arrangement, if the contract contains a signing bonus,
        then any amount of this bonus paid by the signing team counts toward the team's
        Maximum Annual Cash Limit (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>).

    </div>

    <div id="Q99" class="question">
      <h4>99. Can players be given a bonus when they are traded?</h4>

      <p>
        Teams are permitted to write a bonus called a "trade bonus" (sometimes
        referred to as a "trade kicker") into contracts. This bonus is paid to
        the player when he is traded, but only upon his first trade and not upon
        any subsequent trades (in the case of a sign-and-trade, they don't count
        the initial trade when the contract is signed). The trade bonus is paid
        by the team trading away the player. The trade bonus can be defined as
        a specific dollar amount, a specific percentage of the remaining value
        of the contract, or some combination (for example, "$1 million or 10%
        of the remaining value of the contract, whichever is less"). In either
        case, the actual amount cannot exceed 15% of the remaining value of the
        contract. For example, suppose a player has a four-year contract that
        pays $10 million per year. This player also has a $5 million trade
        bonus. Since the trade bonus is limited to 15% of the remaining value
        of the contract, the actual value of the bonus varies from year to year,
        as follows (the bonus pro-rates during the season, so these amounts are
        exact only at the start of each season):

    <div id="Q100" class="question">
      <h4>100. How do trade bonuses affect team salary and trades?</h4>

      <p>
        The value of a trade bonus is applied to the team salary among the remaining
        seasons of the contract (excluding non-guaranteed seasons -- see question
        number <a href="#Q63">63</a>, and seasons following an Option or ETO -- see
        question number <a href="#Q57">57</a>), in proportion to the percentage of
        salary in each of those seasons that is guaranteed. For example, suppose the
        player from question number <a href="#Q99">99</a> is traded at the start of
        the third season of his contract. Per the chart in that question, the actual
        value of his trade bonus at that time is $3 million. If every season of the
        contract is fully guaranteed and there is no Early Termination Option, then
        $1.5 million of the trade bonus is charged to each of the final two seasons
        of the player's contract. The allocation is <em>not</em> proportionate to the
        salary itself, but rather to how much of the salary is guaranteed. If the
        fourth season was only 50% guaranteed, then two-thirds of the bonus would be
        allocated to the third season, and one-third to the fourth season.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the special case of a contract where all additional seasons are non-guaranteed,
        the entire trade bonus is applied to the cap in the season in which the trade
        occurred.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a contract that contains a trade bonus is extended, and the trade bonus is
        removed from the extension, then the value of the trade bonus is applied to
        the team salary across the remaining seasons of the original contract, and not
        across the extension.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trade bonuses can be a nuisance. When a team trades for a player with a trade
        bonus, it must count the portion of the bonus that applies to team salary in
        that season as incoming salary. Let's say a taxpaying team wants to trade its
        $9 million player for the player used in the example above, in the third season
        of that player's contract. Assuming there is no Early Termination Option or
        non-guaranteed season, $1.5 million of the trade bonus counts in the current
        season, so the trade cannot be made. The team trading the $9 million player can
        accept up to $11.35 million in return (see question number <a href="#Q85">85</a>),
        but the player with the trade bonus counts as $11.5 million in incoming salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The CBA allows the player to waive all or part of his trade bonus, at his
        discretion. To make the above trade work, the player could choose to waive
        $300,000 of his $3 million trade bonus. The bonus would then be worth $2.7
        million, and $1.35 million of that would be charged to the current season.
        The player would therefore count $11.35 million as incoming salary, which
        exactly matches the maximum the other team can accept in return for their
        $9 million player.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another potential difficulty is that a team trading a player with a trade
        bonus uses the player's pre-trade salary (without the bonus), when comparing
        salaries for trade. Here is another example, using the same player as before
        (assume the player's team is a taxpayer, and can accept 125% plus $100,000 of
        the player's outgoing salary). This time, let's assume our player has no
        guarantee in the fourth season of his contract, so if he is traded during the
        third season, the entire bonus is allocated to that season. This means that
        following a trade, $13 million would be included in his new team's team salary.
        Suppose a taxpaying team wants to trade their $13 million player for this
        player. That team has $13 million outgoing and $13 million incoming, so there
        is no problem on their end. But our player counts as $10 million in outgoing
        salary, so the most we can accept in return is $12.6 million. This means the
        trade doesn't work from our end. And in this case, waiving a portion of the
        trade bonus will not help.
      </p>

      <p>
        A player's salary added to his trade bonus cannot exceed the maximum salary
        for that season (based on his years of service). For example, in 2017-18
        the maximum salary for a player with 7-9 years of service is $29,727,900.
        If such a player has a $28 million salary and a $2 million trade bonus,
        then his trade bonus is pared down to $1,727,900 when he is traded<sup>1</sup>.
        This happens automatically -- the player has no say in the matter. The same
        is true for trades of rookie scale contracts that include a trade bonus.
        If the salary added to the trade bonus exceeds 120% of the player's scale
        salary amount (see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>) the trade bonus
        is reduced automatically when the player is traded.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no recomputation of the allocation of a trade bonus based on
        whether the player does or does not invoke an option or ETO. For example,
        if a player with a five-year contract and an ETO following the fourth
        season is traded during the fourth season of his contract, then his
        entire trade bonus is charged to the team salary that season. If the
        player does not invoke his ETO that summer (locking in the fifth season),
        the allocation of the trade bonus does not change -- none of the bonus is
        charged to the fifth season. In other words, the allocation of a trade
        bonus always reflects the state of the contract at the time of the trade.

      <h4>101. When <i>can't</i> a player be traded? Can players be given "no-trade"
          clauses in their contracts?</h4>

      <p>
        A "no-trade" clause prevents the team from trading the player without the
        player's consent. A no-trade clause can be negotiated into a new
        contract<sup>1</sup> if the player has been in the NBA for at least eight
        seasons, and has played for the team with which he is signing for at least
        four seasons<sup>2</sup>. They don't have to be the four most recent
        seasons -- for example, Horace Grant received a no-trade clause from Orlando
        when he signed with them in 2001. He had played for Orlando for the requisite
        four seasons, but had played for Seattle and Los Angeles in the interim. Few
        players ever have one of these negotiated no-trade clauses.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player with a negotiated no-trade clause consents to a trade and is
        traded, his no-trade clause remains in effect with his new team.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two additional circumstances in which a trade requires the
        player's consent:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>When the player is playing under a one-year contract (excluding any
            option year) and will have Larry Bird or Early Bird rights at the
            end of the season. This includes first round draft picks following
            their fourth (option) season, who accept their team's qualifying
            offer for their fifth season. When the player consents to such a
            trade, his Larry Bird/Early Bird rights are not traded with him,
            and instead becomes a Non-Bird free agent<sup>3</sup>. The player's
            consent is also required for any subsequent trades that season.</li>
        <li>For one year after exercising the right of first refusal to keep a
            restricted free agent. The player must consent to a trade to any
            team, although he cannot be traded to the team that signed him to
            the offer sheet.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In addition, teams cannot trade players under the following circumstances:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For two months after receiving the player in trade, if the trade aggregates
            the player's salary with the salaries of other players. However, the team
            is free to trade the player immediately, either by himself or without
            aggregating his salary with other salaries. This restriction applies only
            to players who were acquired using an exception (and not cap room). (Also
            see question number <a href="#Q90">90</a>.)</li>
        <li>When the trade deadline has passed. Teams are free to make trades
            again once their season has ended<sup>4</sup>, but cannot trade players
            whose contracts are ending or could end due to an option or ETO.</li>
        <li>For three months or until December 15 of that season (whichever is
            later) after signing a contract as a free agent or matching an offer sheet
            to a restricted free agent. This obviously does not apply to the trade
            completing a sign-and-trade transaction (see question number
            <a href="#Q92">92</a>).</li>
        <li>For three months or until December 15 of that season (whichever is
            later) after converting a Two-Way contract to a standard contract (see
            question number <a href="#Q83">83</a>), with the three months beginning
            on the date the contract is converted.</li>
        <li>For three months or until <em>January</em> 15 of that season (whichever
            is later) after re-signing a free agent with Larry Bird or Early Bird
            rights, if the team is over the cap, the player's new salary is above
            the minimum, and he receives a raise greater than 20%.</li>
        <li>For 30 days after signing as a draft pick. This applies even for later-signed
            first round picks, who are signed using cap room at least three seasons
            after they are drafted (see question number <a href="#Q49">49</a>).</li>
        <li>For 30 days after signing a Two-Way contract (see question number
            <a href="#Q82">82</a>).</li>
        <li>For one year after signing a player to a Designated Veteran contract or
            extension (see question number <a href="#Q24">24</a>).</li>
        <li>For six months after signing a player to an extension that is over the
            limit (in terms of years, salary or raises) for an extend-and-trade
            transaction<sup>5</sup> (see question number <a href="#Q95">95</a>).</li>
        <li>After claiming a player on waivers, for 30 days if the player was
            claimed during the season. If the player was claimed during the offseason,
            he cannot be traded until the 30th day of the following season.</li>
        <li>A team cannot reacquire a player it traded away during the same season
            (a season for this purpose being defined as starting on the first day of
            the regular season and ending on the last day of the Finals). If the player
            was traded between seasons (i.e., from the first day after the Finals to the
            last day prior to the start of the next regular season), it cannot reacquire
            the player prior to the end of the next season. If he is waived by his new
            team, then he cannot re-sign with his original team until the one-year
            anniversary of the trade, or until the July 1 following the end of his
            contract, whichever comes first<sup>6</sup>. However, if a team trades a
            player's draft rights, it <em>can</em> reacquire the player during the same
            season.</li>
        <li>A team cannot acquire players during a season when they do not have room
            on their 15-man roster, even if they intend to waive an incoming player
            immediately. For example, a team with 14 players cannot trade one player
            for three, while simultaneously waiving an incoming player to remain at
            15 players<sup>7</sup>.</li>

      <h4>102. I keep hearing about teams wanting to acquire "ending contracts" in trades.
          What are they, and why are they so valuable?</h4>

      <p>
        Sometimes teams get locked into long-term financial commitments from which they
        later want to extricate themselves. Typically this is when they have players with
        expensive, long-term contracts, but have no real hope of contending before those
        contracts run out. These teams usually have little hope of having cap room to sign
        free agents, and may be facing large luxury tax payments as well (see question
        number <a href="#Q18">18</a>). But if such a team were to trade a high-salaried
        player for a player with a similar (or even higher) salary who is in the last year
        of his contract, then they would be able to rid themselves of that financial
        obligation the following summer. This could get the team below the tax level, or
        even create enough cap room with which to sign a productive free agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that some players who aren't necessarily trade-worthy from a basketball
        standpoint become valuable trade commodities from a financial standpoint. A
        team might be able to parlay mediocre players with ending contracts into a much
        better basketball player or draft picks, as long as they are willing to assume a
        long-term financial obligation. One such trade occurred in June 2017 when Brooklyn
        sent Brook Lopez and his ending contract (along with a late first round draft
        pick) to the LA Lakers for Timofey Mosgov (who had three years and $48 million
        remaining on his contract) and D'Angelo Russell (the 2nd overall pick in the 2015
        draft). For the Lakers, Russell was the price for unloading Mosgov's awful contract
        in order to reduce their team salary for the 2018 offseason.
      </p>

      <p>
        A similar technique involved trading players with high salaries and small
        guarantees, such as when Cleveland traded Brendan Haywood to Portland in 2015.
        However, for contracts signed during the current CBA only the guaranteed portion
        of the player's salary is counted as outgoing salary for trade purposes, so the
        usefulness of these contracts as trade chips is reduced<sup>1</sup> (see question
        number <a href="#Q85">85</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that players with ending contracts (including players whose contracts
        <em>might</em> end due to an option or ETO) cannot be traded after the trade
        deadline (players whose contracts are not ending can be traded after the last
        day of the team's season and before July 1 -- see question numbers
        <a href="#Q101">101</a> and <a href="#Q104">104</a>).

          <td>After this loophole was addressed, the Rockets tried to exploit likely
              bonuses in a similar manner, by signing Nene to a $10 million salary, but
              with all but the minimum salary in the form of bonuses that vested with
              games played (by Nene) and team wins. Since the bonus thresholds were less
              than the number of games in which Nene played and the number of games the
              team won in the previous season, they were deemed likely, and included in
              Team Salary. As such, they would have counted as outgoing salary in a
              trade. The idea was to trade Nene before the bonuses vested, which would
              have allowed the Rockets to acquire a high salary in return (up to $15
              million), but the receiving team could waive him and only be responsible
              for the minimum salary plus any bonuses that already had vested at the
              time of the trade. However, the league stepped-in and ruled that Nene's
              outgoing salary in any trade would not include these bonuses, which

      <h4>103. How are teams able to trade players who are out of the league, like Dallas did with
          Keith Van Horn?</h4>

      <p>
        The short answer is: they can't. Prior to the 2011 CBA teams were allowed to
        sign-and-trade (see question number <a href="#Q92">92</a>) any player to
        whom they had Bird rights. Bird rights don't automatically go away once the
        player is out of the league (see question number <a href="#Q32">32</a> for
        details), so many teams continue to hold Bird rights to players who have
        long since retired.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams were able to take advantage of the Bird status of retired players
        when they needed to include extra salary in order to make a trade legal
        (see question number <a href="#Q85">85</a>). By signing players out of
        retirement the teams were able to complete the trades, and since a
        sign-and-trade requires only the first year of the contract to be
        guaranteed, it was like they were trading an expiring contract (see
        question number <a href="#Q102">102</a>). This kind of trade occurred twice
        during the 2007-08 season, when Dallas re-signed Keith Van Horn (who had
        been out of the league since 2006) and sent him to New Jersey as part of
        a package to acquire Jason Kidd, and the LA Lakers re-signed Aaron McKie
        and sent him to Memphis as part of a package to acquire Pau Gasol.
      </p>

      <p>
        The league put a stop to this in the 2011 CBA by restricting
        sign-and-trades to players who finished the prior season on the team's
        roster. A player can no longer be included in a sign-and-trade if he has
        been out of the league.

    <div id="Q104" class="question">
      <h4>104. What is the trade deadline?</h4>

      <p>
        The trade deadline is defined as 3:00 PM Eastern Time on the 10th day prior
        to All-Star Sunday -- i.e., the Thursday of the second week prior to the
        All-Star game. This is the point during the season after which trades are
        prohibited. The prohibition on trades lasts until the day following the
        team's final game of the season (see question number <a href="#Q101">101</a>),

      <h4>105. What is the July Moratorium?</h4>

      <p>
        It is a "negotiation" period during early July in which teams may not sign
        most free agents or make trades. Teams may negotiate with free agents beginning
        July 1<sup>1</sup>, but they have to wait until the Moratorium ends before
        signing a contract. Any verbal agreements that are struck during the Moratorium
        are still characterized as negotiations, do not count toward team salary, and
        are not binding on either party. Since these agreements are not official or
        binding, either side may back out, with no repercussions<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The July Moratorium lasts from 12:01 AM Eastern Time on July 1 to 12:00 PM Eastern
        time on July 6 each season -- even if these dates fall on weekends or holidays.
        The salary cap and tax level take effect on July 1, coinciding with the start of
        the Moratorium. Exceptions (see question number <a href="#Q25">25</a>) arise on
        July 1 as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few types of signings that are allowed to take place during the
        July Moratorium:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Teams may sign their first round draft picks (to a standard rookie "scale"
            contract -- see question number <a href="#Q47">47</a>)</li>
        <li>A second round draft pick can accept a <strong>required tender</strong>,
            which is a one-year contract offer teams must submit to retain their
            rights to the player.</li>
        <li>A restricted free agent can accept a <strong>qualifying offer</strong>
            from his prior team (see question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>).</li>
        <li>A restricted free agent finishing the fourth season of his rookie "scale"
            contract can accept a <strong>maximum qualifying offer</strong> (see question
            number <a href="#Q42">42</a>).</li>
        <li>A restricted free agent may sign an <strong>offer sheet</strong> with a new
            team (see question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>), although the 48-hour 
            matching period does not begin until the conclusion of the Moratorium.</li>
        <li>Teams may sign players to minimum salary contracts for one or two seasons,
            with no bonuses of any kind.</li>

      <h4>106. Can teams find loopholes in the CBA and do things the league never intended
          to allow? What is circumvention?</h4>

      <p>
        As any league executive will tell you, the CBA isn't a list of the things teams
        <em>can't</em> do; it's a list of the things teams <em>can</em> do. The league
        operates in a "disallow by default" mode -- actions are not allowed except where
        the CBA specifically permits them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, teams aren't allowed to put anything into a player's contract that
        wasn't negotiated between the league and players association and included in the
        CBA. For example, a team signing a known drug offender can't insist on a
        "one strike and you're out" policy or that the player attend mandatory drug
        counseling -- instead they must follow the negotiated drug program (see question
        number <a href="#Q109">109</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2019 the league also approved new measures to reduce circumvention and tampering
        (see question number <a href="#Q111">111</a>) such as inappropriate communications
        between teams and the agents of free agents to-be before the opening of free agency
        on July 1. Team executives are now required to save all communications with agents
        and other teams for one year, and the league now conducts random audits of five
        teams' communications each year. Penalties for violations can now include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fines up to $10 million</li>
        <li>Forfeiture of draft picks</li>
        <li>Suspension of team executives</li>
        <li>Voiding of player contracts</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The CBA also has a general prohibition on circumvention which states that the rules
        exist to preserve the benefit derived by the teams and players, and that nobody
        shall do anything to defeat or circumvent the intent of the agreement. The league
        can use this prohibition to disallow a signing or trade that they feel circumvents
        the CBA, even though it is not specifically prohibited by the agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examples of conduct considered to be circumvention include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A team owner allowing a player to invest in a business or investment
            fund controlled by the owner or a friend of the owner.</li>
        <li>A team executive assisting a player in obtaining a product endorsement.</li>
        <li>Any "under the table" promises for a future contract (see question number
            <a href="#Q30">30</a>).</li>
        <li>A team's arena renting retail space to a player on the team.</li>
        <li>A team selling a sponsorship to a business in which a player has an interest.</li>
        <li>A team hiring a player's relative or business partner as an employee.</li>
        <li>A team owner allowing a player the use of his private plane.</li>
        <li>A company affiliated with a team's owner making a home available to one
            of the team's players.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Whenever a contract is signed, extended, renegotiated or otherwise amended,
        the team, player, and player's agent must certify, under penalty of perjury,
        that there are no side agreements or understandings of any kind relating to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Any future contract, or future extension, renegotiation or amendment of
            the player's current contract.</li>
        <li>Any outside compensation, investment, business opportunity or anything
            else of value furnished to the player or any other person or entity
            controlled by, related to, or acting on behalf of the player.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The intent of these rules is to ensure that the only agreement from which either
        the player or the team can benefit is the current, signed player contract. The
        rules extend to sponsors, business partners and other team affiliates, and to
        player agents, representatives and family members.

      <h4>107. How does player discipline work? Can teams fine or suspend players for any reason?
               Do fines and suspensions apply to team salary?</h4>

      <p>
        The league or a player's team can levy a fine and/or suspension for
        breaking league or team rules<sup>1</sup>, respectively. Generally the
        league and the team do not both discipline a player for the same violation,
        and the league retains the right to rescind any team discipline within 48
        hours and impose its own. However, there are a few exceptions where a
        player can be disciplined by both the league and his team -- when the
        egregious nature of the act or conduct is so lacking in justification
        as to warrant a double penalty. The CBA does not give a complete list
        of reasons for which a player can be fined or suspended, although some
        are specified:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Missing the rookie transition program: Five game suspension.</li>
        <li>Failure to attend a promotional appearance: $20,000 fine.</li>
        <li>Failure to attend a media training session: $20,000 fine.</li>
        <li>Failure to attend a "Business of Basketball" program: $5,000 fine.</li>
        <li>Failure to attend an anti-gambling training session: $20,000 fine.</li>
        <li>Failure to attend a licensing appearance: Fine up to $20,000.</li>
        <li>Failure to attend a "mandatory program": $20,000 fine.</li>
        <li>Intentional failure or refusal to render the services required under
            the player's contract or the CBA: Suspension (length unspecified).</li>
        <li>Missed practice: $2,500 for the first occurrence, $5,000 for the second,
            $7,500 for the third, and greater discipline, including suspension, for
            subsequent missed practices.</li>
        <li>Failure to report following a trade: Penalty (unspecified) from
            both the league <em>and</em> the player's new team.</li>
        <li>Failure to cooperate with investigations of alleged player misconduct:
            Fine or suspension (amount/length unspecified).</li>
        <li>Failure to pay union dues: Suspension until the requirement is
            satisfied.</li>
        <li>Failure to report for an NBA Developmental League assignment: Suspension
            until the player reports.</li>
        <li>Violation of NBA Developmental League's league or team rules: (Penalty
            unspecified).</li>
        <li>Any violation of team rules: (Penalty unspecified).</li>
        <li>Wagering on NBA games: Fine, suspension or disqualification.</li>
        <li>Player not in good physical or mental condition, and unfit to play skilled
            basketball<sup>2</sup>: Suspension until ready to play.</li>
        <li>Conduct against the best interests of the NBA or basketball: Fine up
            to $50,000 and/or suspension.</li>
        <li>Not paying hotel incidentals while on road trips: $100 file for the first
            two occurrences, increasing penalties for subsequent occurrences.</li>
        <li>Tampering or unauthorized agreement: See question number <a href="#Q111">111</a>.</li>
        <li>Unlawful violence (convicted of a violent felony): 10 games minimum
            suspension.</li>
        <li>Failure to attend a clinical evaluation or counseling per the "Counseling
            for Violent Misconduct" program: $10,000 per day fine after the first 72
            hours.</li>
        <li>Violations of the drug program: See question number <a href="#Q109">109</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The money from fines and suspensions is put to good use -- it's given to
        charities of the NBA's and players association's choosing. Players are not
        paid while they are suspended -- for each missed game, the player is docked
        a portion of his salary, whether suspended for a preseason, regular season or
        postseason game (see question number <a href="#Q13">13</a> for information
        on how suspensions impact team salary) as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the suspension is less than 20 games, 1/145 of his base compensation.</li>
        <li>If the suspension is 20 or more games, or an indefinite suspension that
            lasts at least 20 games, 1/110 of his base compensation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Suspensions for Two-Way players (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>)
        depend on the player's status and the type of suspension:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the player was on the Two-Way list when suspended:
          <ul>
            <li>If the suspension is less than 12 games, 1/88 of his G-League salary per
                G-League game.</li>
            <li>If the suspension is 12 games or more, 1/67 of his G-League salary per
                G-League game.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the player was on the Active List when suspended, and the suspension was
            an NBA suspension, he stays on the active list for five games and loses one
            of the following amounts, then is transferred to the Two-Way list and his
            suspension continues at the G-League rate for each additional missed NBA game.
          <ul>
            <li>If the suspension is less than 20 games, 1/145 of his NBA salary per
                NBA game.</li>
            <li>If the suspension is 20 games or more, 1/110 of his NBA salary per
                NBA game.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the player was on the Inactive List when suspended, and the suspension was
            an NBA suspension, he is transferred to the Two-Way list and the suspension
            proceeds at the G-League rate.</li>
        <li>If the suspension was a team suspension (whether the player was on the Active
            or Inactive List), he <em>may</em> be placed on the Two-Way list for all or
            part of the suspension. The suspension amount depends on which list he is on
            (NBA or G-League).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If an NBA player is suspended while on a G-League assignment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the suspension is less than 20 games, 1/145 of his salary per game.</li>
        <li>If the suspension is 20 games or more, 1/110 of his salary per game.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A suspended player <em>can</em> be traded.
      </p>

      <p>
        The league and union have agreed to bargain over new player conduct rules
        beginning in 2017-18.

      <h4>108. Can fines or suspensions be appealed?</h4>
    
      <p>
        Players are allowed to appeal fines and suspensions. If the penalty from
        league discipline is less than the following, then the appeal is heard by
        the Commissioner. If the penalty exceeds these amounts, or if the player
        and players association are dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision,
        the appeal is heard by the league's grievance arbitrator:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For on-court<sup>1</sup> conduct or in-game conduct involving another
            player, a fine of $50,000 and/or a suspension of 12 games.</li>
        <li>For issues related to the integrity of, or confidence in the game of

      <h4>109. What is the league's drug program?</h4>

      <p>
        The NBA conducts random testing of its players, and provides both treatment
        programs and penalties for players who test positive for prohibited
        substances, which are classified into the following categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drugs of Abuse:</strong> Amphetamines and similar drugs, cocaine,
            LSD, opiates such as heroin, codeine and morphine, and PCP</li>
        <li><strong>SPEDs:</strong> Steroids, performance-enhancing drugs, masking
            agents, and diuretics</li>
        <li><strong>Marijuana</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Human Growth Hormone (HGH)</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Testing falls into two categories: reasonable cause and random. Reasonable
        cause testing occurs when the league or players association provides the
        program's independent expert with information about a player's use, possession
        or distribution of prohibited substances, and the expert believes that
        reasonable cause exists to order testing. If reasonable cause is found to
        exist, the player can be tested without notice up to four times in a six
        week period. Players can be subjected to random testing up to four times
        during a season (two times for HGH) and up to two times during an offseason
        (one time for HGH; offseason testing is conducted for SPEDs, HGH and diuretics
        only). League-wide, the program will not conduct more than 1,525 tests during
        a season or more than 600 tests during an offseason. Players who have entered
        a drug program can also be directed for testing if they miss a game, miss two
        team flights and/or practices in a seven-day period, or are charged in a court
        of law with driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Test samples are split into an "A" sample and a "B" sample, with the "A" sample
        submitted for laboratory testing. If a player's "A" sample results in a positive
        test, the player can request that his "B" sample also be tested, at a different
        lab than the one that tested his "A" sample. A test is also considered to be
        positive if the player fails or refuses to submit for testing, fails to
        cooperate with the testing process, or tries to cheat. The program's medical
        director reviews all positive tests before the results are official.
      </p>

      <p>
        Players can come forward voluntarily for a problem involving the use of a drug
        of abuse or marijuana (but not SPEDs). A player who comes forward voluntarily
        will enter the appropriate education, treatment and counseling program, and
        will not be penalized for coming forward (although he may be penalized for
        failure to comply with his program or for advancing a stage under stage two
        of the Drugs of Abuse program).
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player tests positive for a drug of abuse, whether through reasonable cause
        testing or random testing, he is dismissed from the league<sup>1</sup>, and he
        enters the first stage of the Drugs of Abuse program. If a player tests positive
        for marijuana, SPEDs, HGH or diuretics<sup>2</sup>, he enters the appropriate
        program where evaluation, treatment and further testing commence. The player
        also suffers the penalties associated with his specific program:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drugs of Abuse program:</strong> There are two stages to the Drugs
            of Abuse program. First-time patients enter Stage 1 of the program. A player
            who has already completed Stage 1 enters Stage 2. A player who has already
            completed Stage 2 is dismissed from the league<sup>1</sup>. A player in the
            program can also advance one stage for disregarding his treatment program.
            Players continue to receive their salary in Stage 1. Players in Stage 2 are
            suspended during their inpatient care and for at least six months of their
            aftercare, until the medical director certifies that the player is ready to
            play. Players who fail to comply with their program are suspended in Stage
            1, and dismissed from the league in Stage 2<sup>1</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Marijuana program:</strong> In addition to NBA testing, a player
            also enters the Marijuana program if he is convicted of possession or use
            of marijuana by a court of law. There is no limit to the number of times a
            player can enter the Marijuana program. Penalties in the Marijuana program
            are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>First violation: No additional penalty.</li>
              <li>Second violation: $25,000 fine.</li>
              <li>Third violation: Suspended five games.</li>
              <li>Subsequent violations: Suspended an additional five games (10, 15,
                  etc.) for each subsequent violation.</li>
            </ul>
            Players who fail to comply with their program are fined $10,000, with
            increasing penalties for continued failure.</li>
        <li><strong>SPED program:</strong> For the first violation, the player is
            suspended 25 games and referred to the SPED program. For the second
            violation, the player is suspended 55 games and referred or re-referred
            to the SPED program. For the third violation, the player is dismissed
            from the league<sup>1</sup>. Players who fail to comply with their
            program are suspended for 25 games (if not previously suspended for 25
            games), 55 games (if not previously suspended for 55 games), or dismissed
            from the league<sup>1</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>HGH program:</strong> A positive test for HGH is treated as a
            positive test for SPEDs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Players are also dismissed from the league if they are convicted in a court
        of law of distributing drugs, of if they are convicted of the use or possession
        of a prohibited substance other than marijuana<sup>1</sup>. When a player is
        dismissed from the league his contract is voided (see question number
        <a href="#Q112">112</a>), and he is disqualified from playing in the NBA for
        at least two years. The exception is in the case of a first-year player who
        was caught through random testing, in which case the dismissal lasts for one
        year, and the player must enter the Drugs of Abuse program. An application
        for reinstatement is subject to the approval of the league and players
        association. Once reinstated, any subsequent dismissal from the league is final.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player provides "clear and convincing" evidence to the league's grievance
        arbitrator that he was not at fault or negligent for the presence of a drug of
        abuse or SPED, the grievance arbitrator has the authority to reduce or rescind
        the player's penalty. This can apply under unusual circumstances, such as when
        the player had no reason to know or suspect that he was taking a prohibited
        substance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams and players are not allowed to override any portion of the drug program.
        For example, a team is not allowed to sign a player with a history of marijuana
        abuse on the stipulation that "one strike and he's out."

      <h4>110. What is the league's domestic violence program?</h4>

      <p>
        The league's domestic violence program addresses cases of domestic violence,
        child abuse and sexual assault, and covers such cases wherever they occur.
        The focus of the program is prevention through educational programs and
        awareness training. There is a hotline established for players, families and
        other victims.
      </p>

      <p>
        The league or players association may refer players to the program through
        a disciplinary determination made by the Commissioner, or as the result of
        a criminal conviction. A player also can voluntarily seek assistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The program is overseen by a policy committee consisting of two NBA
        representatives, two players association representatives, and three
        independent experts. When a player is referred to the program an expert
        conducts an evaluation, and a treatment and accountability plan is
        developed. The policy committee oversees compliance and certifies when
        the player has completed the program.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player fails to comply with the program without a reasonable explanation
        the NBA is notified and the player is warned. If he fails to heed the warning,
        he is then fined $10,000 per further day of non-compliance. If there is a
        <em>substantial</em> non-compliance or willful disregard, the penalties
        increase to a one-game suspension, followed by successively longer suspensions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an investigation is pending the Commissioner can put the player on
        administrative leave with pay, but only when justified by criteria such as
        the nature and severity of the allegations, the player's history of prior
        conduct, and the risk of reputational damage to the NBA or to the player's
        team.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a positive finding the Commissioner can fine, suspend or disqualify
        the player from the league, and the policy committee can also require
        training, education, counseling and/or community service. The penalties
        are determined on a case-by-case basis, and the Commissioner can take
        into account both aggravating and mitigating factors. Aggravating factors
        include prior allegations or convictions for prohibited conduct, the use
        of weapons or other means of coercion, the use or threat of force or
        violence, the vulnerability of the victim, the presence of minors, and
        the nature and extent of any injuries. Mitigating factors include the
        acceptance of responsibility, evidence of self-defense, voluntary
        participation in treatment or counseling programs, and the player's
        character and reputation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The domestic violence program and policies also apply to NBA players and
        Two-Way players on a G-League assignment.

      <h4>111. What is tampering?</h4>

      <p>
        Tampering is when a player or team directly or indirectly entices,
        induces or persuades anybody (player, general manager, etc.) who is
        under contract with another team in order to negotiate for their
        services. The NBA may impose suspensions and/or fines if tampering
        is discovered, however the league's practice has been to wait until
        a team lodges a complaint before investigating (but that's not to
        say they don't continue to monitor the league and won't take action
        independently if they discover that tampering has occurred). Here
        are some examples:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Miami Heat were discovered to have tampered with Pat Riley in
            1995 by negotiating with Riley while he was the head coach of the
            New York Knicks. The Heat "settled," and avoided
            league-imposed penalties, by compensating the Knicks with $1
            million and their first round draft pick in 1996.</li>
        <li>The league fined three teams (Hawks, Kings and Rockets) because
            of team statements to the media, team emails to prospective season
            ticket purchasers, and articles posted on team websites related
            to players under contract with other teams, but who would become
            free agents that summer. For example, Kings coach Michael Malone
            stated in a press conference that "Chris Paul would look pretty
            good in a Sacramento Kings uniform."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You may have noticed that when general managers and other team personnel
        talk to the press, they are careful to avoid talking about specific
        players who play for other teams. They do this in order to avoid tampering.
        The only allowed response when talking about players under contract with
        other teams is to decline comment.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2019 the league implemented stricter measures to curtail tampering and
        circumvention. See question <a href="#Q109">109</a> for more details.

      </p>

      <p>
        Player-to-player tampering is considered to be a relatively common
        occurrence, and while technically illegal, it is rarely addressed by the
        league. For instance during the 2016 playoffs, Mavericks player Chandler
        Parsons referred to Rockets player Dwight Howard saying, "[. . .] I think
        he can still be a player in this league. And I think he's going to leave
        Houston, so why not come here?" Former Commissioner David Stern clarified
        in 2012 that such player-to-player recruitment is generally "not tampering
        or collusion that is prohibited."

    <div id="Q112" class="question">
      <h4>112. What does it mean when a contract is voided?</h4>

      <p>
        It's when a contract is canceled, i.e., rendered "null and void" because its
        terms were broken. This is not the same as merely terminating a contract by
        waiving the player (see question number <a href="#Q64">64</a>). When a player
        is waived, some of the terms of the contract remain in effect -- for example,
        the player is still paid any remaining guaranteed salary. When a contract is
        voided, <em>none</em> of its terms remain in effect. It's treated the same
        as if the contract had never existed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contracts might be voided under the following circumstances:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>At the start of a contract, if a player fails his physical examination.
            For example, Ronny Turiaf's initial contract with the Lakers in 2005 was
            voided when his physical examination uncovered a heart abnormality.</li>
        <li>At the start of a contract, if the contract is disapproved by the league.
            For example, the league will disapprove a new contract if its first
            year salary is higher than the player's maximum, or greater than the
            team's room.</li>
        <li>If the "trade" portion of a sign-and-trade transaction is not completed
            within 48 hours.</li>
        <li>When a player is disqualified from the league per the terms of the league's
            drug program (see question number <a href="#Q109">109</a>).</li>
        <li>When certain instances of circumvention are discovered (see question
            numbers <a href="#Q29">29</a>, <a href="#Q30">30</a> and
            <a href="#Q106">106</a>), at the Commissioner's discretion.</li>
        <li>When the player violates Paragraph 16 of the standard NBA contract. The
            team can void the contract when the player:
            <ul>
              <li>Fails, refuses, or neglects to conform his personal conduct to standards
                  of good citizenship, good moral character (defined as not engaging in
                  acts of moral turpitude, whether or not these acts constitute a crime),
                  and good sportsmanship.</li>
              <li>Commits a significant and inexcusable physical attack against any official
                  or employee of the team or the NBA (other than another player), or any
                  person in attendance at any NBA game or event. The determination as to 
                  whether the attack was significant and inexcusable considers the totality
                  of the circumstances, such as the nature of any provocation.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>When the player is in violation of sections of Article 35 of the NBA Constitution
            dealing with game fixing and gambling on NBA games.</li>
        <li>During the 2011 lockout, the league suggested it had the power to void all
            player contracts. Their reasoning was that player contracts existed under
            the purview of the CBA, and without a CBA, all player contracts were
            unenforceable. It is unclear whether the league actually would have tried
            to void all player contracts had the lockout continued, and if they did so,
            if they would have prevailed in court.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Any attempt at voiding a contract likely would be met with a grievance filed
        by the players association on behalf of the player. Grievance arbitrators have
        consistently denied attempts to void contracts. For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Boston Celtics were not allowed to void Vin Baker's contract in
            2004, despite his alcohol abuse preventing him from playing, and his
            failure to comply with his treatment program.</li>
        <li>The Golden State Warriors were not allowed to void Latrell Sprewell's
            contract in 1997 after he choked his coach, P.J. Carlesimo.</li>

    <div id="Q114" class="question">
      <h4>114. How does it work when the league expands? Can the league also contract?</h4>

      <p>
        To supply an expansion team with its initial complement of players,
        the league holds an expansion draft<sup>1</sup> prior to that year's
        NBA draft. Existing teams are allowed to protect up to eight players 
        (including restricted free agents) from being selected in the expansion
        draft, but every team must expose at least one player who can't possibly
        become a free agent as the result of the exercise or non-exercise of
        an option or ETO. Unrestricted free agents can neither be protected
        from nor selected in the expansion draft, and are essentially ignored.
        Restricted free agents (see question number <a href="#Q42">42</a>) may
        be selected, but become unrestricted free agents upon selection (with
        the caveat that they cannot then re-sign with the team from which
        they came). No team may lose more than one player in an expansion draft.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some players <em>may</em> become unrestricted free agents due to the
        invocation or non-invocation of an option or ETO (see question number
        <a href="#Q57">57</a>). The league uses their status on the day of the
        expansion draft -- i.e., if a player has invoked his option or ETO by
        the day of the expansion draft, then he is treated as a free agent. If
        a player has not invoked an option or ETO by the day of the expansion
        draft, then he is treated as being under contract (so it is possible
        for an expansion team to select a player in the expansion draft who
        then invokes his option, becomes an unrestricted free agent, and signs
        elsewhere).
      </p>

      <p>
        If a team is over the cap and loses a contracted player (not a restricted
        free agent) to an expansion team, they receive a trade exception (see
        question number <a href="#Q87">87</a>) equivalent to the selected player's
        salary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Existing teams are allowed to compensate expansion teams (usually with
        draft picks), in exchange for selecting or not selecting particular
        players in the expansion draft. For example, in the 1995 expansion draft
        (when Vancouver &amp; Toronto entered the league), Orlando left Darrell
        Armstrong, Anthony Avent, Rodney Dent and Geert Hammink unprotected, but
        did not want to lose either Armstrong or Hammink. They gave Vancouver
        their 1996 second round pick in exchange for Vancouver selecting Dent
        with the second pick in the expansion draft. With Dent selected by
        Vancouver, Armstrong and Hammink became ineligible.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is also common to see teams leave a desirable player unprotected,
        hoping that the player's age and/or high salary will dissuade the
        expansion team from selecting him. This allows those teams to protect
        an additional player whom they might have been more likely to lose.
        Or in some cases, they might dangle a high-priced player <i>hoping</i>
        the expansion team takes him off their hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Expansion teams have a lower salary cap for the first two years of
        their existence. In their first year, their salary cap is 80% of the
        salary cap for the rest of the league. In their second year, it's 90% of
        the salary cap for the rest of the league. Beginning with their third
        season, they have the same salary cap as the other teams. Their minimum
        team salary (see question number <a href="#Q14">14</a>) is also lower
         by a commensurate amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        Expansion teams often have restrictions placed on their draft position
        in their first few seasons. For example, Charlotte was assigned the #4
        pick in the 2004 NBA draft, and Vancouver &amp; Toronto could not
        receive the #1 pick in the NBA draft for their first four seasons in
        the league.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an expansion team drafts a player in the expansion draft and waives
        him prior to the first day of the season, then that player's salary
        does not count toward team salary (although they still have to pay
        him). This provides some protection against bad decisions made in
        the expansion draft -- an expansion team could select a player, later
        decide they don't really want him, and waive him without their team
        salary being negatively affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most league calculations (average salary, total benefits, total
        salaries, BRI, salary cap) simply ignore expansion teams (and the
        players on those teams) for two years. For example, the league
        calculates the average salary by adding up the team salaries for every
        team, and dividing by an amount equal to the number of teams times
        13.2 (see question number <a href="#Q31">31</a>). For this calculation
        the total of the team salaries does not include team salaries from
        expansion teams in their first two seasons, nor does the number of
        teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basketball Related Income (BRI) does not include the fee expansion
        teams pay to join the league.
      </p>

      <p>
        The league also reserves the right to contract (reduce the number of
        teams in the league) if necessary. The league needs to provide the
        players association with written notice of any decision to contract,
        and the two sides will negotiate to agree on the effects of contraction
        on the players and the procedures to be followed.

      <h4>115. Are players paid on a regular schedule? Are there other ways to pay players beside regular paychecks?</h4>

      <p>
        The league's standard paydays are on the 1st and 15th of each month,
        beginning November 15. The default is 24 paychecks paid over one calendar
        year. Teams and players whose salaries are over the minimum salary can
        agree to a 12-check or 36-check schedule, paid over six months or 18 months,
        respectively. Two-Way players (see question number <a href="#Q82">82</a>)
        are paid on a 24-check schedule over one calendar year. Each Two-Way
        player's paycheck contains a portion of his Two-Way salary plus the NBA
        salary for each day of NBA service during the preceding pay period.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are various ways for players to be paid at times other than the
        standard paydays, including signing bonuses, advances, loans, and deferred
        compensation. However, players must be paid at least 20% of their base
        compensation, not including bonuses, on regular league paydays. Players
        cannot have signing bonuses, advances, loan repayment schedules or deferred
        compensation that cause this rule to be violated.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Signing bonuses:</strong> A player can be paid a portion of
            his total contract as soon as it is signed. See question number
            <a href="#Q75">75</a> for more information.</li>
        <li><strong>Advances:</strong> No salary can be paid before July 1 of
            the season in which it is earned, but players can be advanced some
            their salary before the first league payday on November 15. Except
            in the case of a minimum-salary player, the salary advance is
            limited to either 80% of the player's guaranteed salary, or 50%
            of his base salary, whichever is less. In addition, no more than
            25% of the player's base salary can be paid prior to October 1.
            For minimum-salary players the salary advance is limited to either
            80% of the player's guaranteed salary, or 7.5% of his base salary,
            whichever is less, and the advance is deducted from the player's
            November 15 paycheck (and December 1, if necessary).</li>
        <li><strong>Loans:</strong> Players may be given loans which must be
            repaid out of their salary. The amount of a loan can't exceed the
            player's remaining amount of guaranteed salary for that season,
            although the loan can be repaid over the number of remaining
            seasons that are fully guaranteed (and don't follow options or
            ETOs). For example, a player with three fully-guaranteed years
            remaining on his contract at $10 million per season can be loaned
            $10 million, and repay the loan over three years. Loans may not
            be given to minimum-salary players. If the player is not charged
            interest, or the interest rate is below the market rate<sup>2</sup>,
            the difference is considered to be salary and is included in team
            salary. Any loan forgiveness is considered to be a contract
            renegotiation. Loans are not permitted in rookie scale contracts
            for first round draft picks.</li>
        <li><strong>Deferred compensation:</strong> Up to 25% of a player's
            compensation can be deferred, and paid after May 1 of the following
            season. Deferred compensation is included in team salary in the
            season in which it is <em>earned</em>, not the season in which it
            is <em>paid</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When a player is waived he continues to be paid his guaranteed salary.

      <h4>116. How do I find out the salary for a specific player?</h4>

      <p>
        The NBA does not publish player salaries. However, a number of unofficial
        sources exist, and Basketball Insiders is the source of NBA salaries that
        is endorsed by the author of this FAQ: <a href="http://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba-team-salaries-at-a-glance/">Basketball Insiders</a>.

    <div id="Q117" class="question">
      <h4>117. The league instituted a dress code for players. Do they have the right to do that?</h4>

      <p>
        The league has broad powers which enable them to institute a dress code
        (and the players association has always acknowledged the league's right
        to do so). For example, every player's contract contains a provision
        which states that the player agrees to be "neatly and fully attired
        in public." In addition, the Commissioner has the general power to
        penalize players for conduct (which would include dress) detrimental to
        the league's best interests.

    <div id="Q118" class="question">
      <h4>118. What does it mean when the players union decertifies? Why would
          they want to do that? What effect does it have?</h4>

      <p>
        Decertification and disclaimer of interest are similar processes to end a
        union's authority to collectively bargain on behalf of its members. A
        decertification is issued by the union members, while a disclaimer of
        interest is issued by the union itself. They are tactics sometimes employed
        (or at least threatened) by player unions in the event of a difficult labor
        situation. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Antitrust laws are at odds with labor laws -- while antitrust laws prohibit
        cooperation among competitors and agreements that are anticompetitive, labor
        laws encourage cooperation among competitors -- such as forming unions and
        bargaining collectively. This tension is resolved with the "non-statutory
        labor exemption," which exempts collective bargaining agreements from the
        antitrust provisions. The NBA draft and restrictions on salaries and free
        agency are immune from the antitrust laws so long as they are part of the CBA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Courts have ruled (with the NFL) that the non-statutory labor exemption
        shield continues even after the CBA expires, so long as a "labor
        relationship" still exists. But if the players decertify or the union
        disclaims interest -- ending the union's collective bargaining rights and
        turning it into a non-union trade association -- it ends this continuing
        labor relationship and opens the league to an antitrust suit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NBA players association threatened to decertify in both 1995 and
        1998, but ultimately voted against it both times. The union <em>did</em>
        disclaim interest during the 2011 labor dispute (see question number
        <a href="#Q7">7</a>), filing an antitrust suit shortly afterward. The
        suit was settled over the following days (ending the labor dispute),
        and the players voted to re-certify the union in order to conclude their
        labor negotiations and settle on a new CBA.

      <h4>121. Can I get a copy of the actual Collective Bargaining Agreement?</h4>

      <p>
        The Collective Bargaining Agreement is a very long legal contract between
        the league and the Players Association, and is written in dense legalese.
        It is my hope that this FAQ answers all your questions. However, if you
        really want the CBA, it is available from the players association's web
        site at <a href="http://www.nbpa.com/cba/">http://www.nbpa.com/cba/</a>.
        It is also available through the University of New Hampshire School of Law's
        Sports and Entertainment Law Institute web site, at
        <a href="https://ipmall.law.unh.edu/content/unh-sports-law-repository-collective-bargaining">https://ipmall.law.unh.edu/content/unh-sports-law-repository-collective-bargaining</a>.
        In addition, members of the media with an account on the NBA's "Media
        Central" website can download it there. Bound copies of the CBA are no
        longer available from the league office.
      </p>

      <p>
        The CBA doesn't answer every possible question. Many of the league's rules,
        policies and procedures are contained in these documents:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>The NBA Constitution and By-Laws</em> defines the NBA as an entity
            at its highest levels, and how teams operate within the scope of the
            NBA.</li>
        <li><em>The NBA Operations Manual</em> is updated annually and describes
            in detail how the league operates, including all the rules regarding
            game operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These documents are separate and apart from whatever contracts the league
        may make with other entities such as the players association. It has always
        been possible for the public to obtain the CBA. The league kept the
        Constitution and By-Laws confidential until the Donald Sterling situation
        occurred in 2014, after which it was made publicly available at
        <a href="https://ak-static-int.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/NBA-Constitution-and-By-Laws.pdf">https://ak-static-int.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/NBA-Constitution-and-By-Laws.pdf</a>.
        The league continues to keep the Operations Manual confidential.

      <h4>122. What if this FAQ is wrong? How authoritative is this FAQ?</h4>

      <p>
        This FAQ has been fact-checked against the actual CBA, and I'm pretty
        confident about its accuracy. Still, this FAQ isn't necessarily 100%
        accurate. If you find any errors, please contact me at
        <a href="mailto:lmcoon@cox.net">lmcoon@cox.net</a> (please include the
        source of your information, if possible). You may also contact me if
        there are additional questions you would like to see added to this FAQ,
        or if you find any of the answers confusing and in need of clarification.
      </p>

      <p>
        The author of this FAQ is not employed by the NBA, any of its teams or
        the NBA players association.

    <div id="Q123" class="question">
      <h4>123. Can I e-mail you with other CBA-related questions?</h4>

      <p>
        Yes! But while I try to answer questions to the best of my ability,
        the number of questions I receive often overwhelms the amount of time
        I have for answering them. In addition some responses have to wait
        until I can verify facts with others, or get batched together so I
        can respond to a set of related messages all at once. Unfortunately,
        questions that are longer and involve a lot of thought, research
        and/or detail on my part tend to get answered less frequently than
        simple ones that I can answer off the top of my head.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a question, my first recommendation is that you make a
        reasonable effort to ensure the information you're looking for isn't
        already covered in the FAQ. Once you've done that, you'll probably
        find that your question will get answered sooner if you post it where
        other CBA-knowledgeable people will see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        One excellent venue for questions is Twitter. Follow me at
        <a href="http://www.twitter.com/LarryCoon">http://www.twitter.com/LarryCoon</a>.
        Questions posted to Twitter are usually answered more quickly, either
        by me or by someone else who sees your tweet, although the Twitter
        format precludes lengthy, detailed answers (which usually is a
        good thing).
      </p>

      <p>
        You might also try the CBA/Business discussion forum at RealGM.com:
        <a href="http://www.realgm.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=4">http://www.realgm.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=4</a>,
        which a number of CBA-knowledgeable people frequent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, if you're <em>really</em> interested in exploring this in depth
        (along with many other aspects of working in sports), I am the General
        Manager of <a href="http://www.sportsbusinessclassroom.com">Sports Business Classroom</a>,
        which is a week-long seminar held during the Las Vegas Summer League.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also recognize that some of you (members of the media, etc.) need this
        information as part of your job, and not simply because you're curious. I
        try to give these questions higher priority. Apologies in advance to
        anybody who gets put on the back burner as a result.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bottom line is that I get more questions than I have the ability to
        answer. Apologies to anyone who has sent me an e-mail and didn't receive
        a reply.

      <h4>125. Can you translate this FAQ into (name of language)? I'll even translate
          it for you!</h4>

      <p>
        I appreciate the fact that the NBA receives worldwide attention, that
        there are fans around the world interested in CBA-related matters, and
        that this has created a demand for this FAQ in languages other than
        English. I have received requests for translations in over a dozen
        different languages, usually accompanied by kind offers to provide the
        translation (which would be necessary, since I speak none of those
        languages).
      </p>

      <p>
        I had previously turned down all such requests because I had no way to
        ensure that a translation would be faithful and accurate, and because I
        had no way to ensure that translations would be kept up to date. However,
        these issues are not unique to this FAQ, and many others have successfully
        found ways to balance the needs of their audience with the need for accuracy.
        As a result, I have revised my translation policy, as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Permission is <em>not</em> granted to make or distribute English copies
            of this FAQ, whether as a mirror, paraphrase, modified for a specific
            audience, etc. The English language remains my exclusive purview for this
            FAQ. See the <a href="#copyright">copyright notice</a> for additional
            information.</li>
        <li>Permission is granted for readers to create translations of this FAQ in
            languages other than English, provided the translator and/or host of the
            translation agrees to all the terms of this policy.</li>
        <li>I will not create or host your translation. You must do both.</li>
        <li>I will not be able to assist you by verifying the correctness of your
            translation.</li>
        <li>You must state very clearly and prominently in your translation that it
            is a translation of an original English document that is written and
            copyrighted by Larry Coon, with a link to this FAQ. You must clearly
            indicate the date of your translation, and the date of the latest revision
            to this FAQ (which can be found in the revision history). This gives
            readers some indication that your translation may be out of date.</li>
        <li>You must agree to keep your translation up to date with changes to this
            FAQ. If you cannot continue to meet this requirement, you must find someone
            else who is able to do so, or delete your translation.</li>
        <li>You must e-mail me with the URL for your translation, the language in which
            it is written, and an indication that you agree to comply with the terms of
            this policy.</li>

      <h2>History of this FAQ, acknowledgements, and about the author:</h2>

      <p>
        An original NBA Salary Cap FAQ was written by Tony Minkoff and covered the
        1995 CBA. The original draft of this FAQ was based on Tony's original, and on
        several articles written by Garret Okamoto for totk.com (Top of the Key). An
        archive copy of Tony's original FAQ can be found
        <a href="http://www.ee.scu.edu/eefac/okamoto/webpage/garret/Lakers/lakers/capfaq.html">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first edition of this FAQ was published in 1999, covering the 1999 CBA. An
        archive copy can be found <a href="http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap99.htm">here</a>.
        Tony and Garrett participated with me on the research and draft review process,
        along with Patricia Bender, Josh Frankel, Jon Hamm, Jonathan Richards and Gary S.
        Simon. The suggestions and contributions of a number of people are also acknowledged
        in the revision history.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second edition of this FAQ was written in 2005, covering the 2005 CBA. An
        archive copy can be found <a href="http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap05.htm">here</a>.
        Ryan Hoak, Dan Hoelzl, Zev Iosupovici, Eric Pincus, Dan Rosenbaum and Andy Stein
        participated with me on the research and draft review process. The suggestions and
        contributions of a number of people are also acknowledged in the revision
        history.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third edition of the FAQ was completed in 2012 and covered the 2011 CBA. A
        number of people were kind enough to contact me to volunteer their services as
        I prepared this edition, and I was able to put some of them to good use. I'd
        especially like to thank Josh Berman for entering the rookie scale salary and
        index information, Zach Schreiber for checking the scale salaries, index, and
        links from one question to another, and Clint Peterson for updating Zev Iosupovici's
        original masthead graphic. My thanks also to Andy Stein, Edward Gleason, Brett
        Greenberg, Ryan Hoak, Bernie Lee, David Lord, Albert Nahmad and Eric Pincus for
        providing feedback and suggestions which helped improve the final product.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the fourth edition of the FAQ, covering the 2017 CBA.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summary, I'd like to collectively thank everybody whose contributions found
        their way into this FAQ over the years. Thanks also to my friends &amp; colleagues
        in the media who have been so kind as to inform the public of this FAQ's existence,
        and for the kind words they have written about the work I have done here.

        <br /><strong>Andy Stein:</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        My friend Andy Stein passed away on December 28, 2015. If you have reviewed the revision
        history of this FAQ you have seen his name all over it -- indeed, Andy's fingerprints are
        all over this entire document. Andy was one of a handful of people who have shared a keen
        interest in this topic, and he participated with me in the development of this FAQ for over
        a decade. He was whip smart, logical and insightful, and helped me work through almost
        every difficult CBA-related issue I encountered. He also was usually the first set of eyes
        to look over anything new I wrote, because I knew he'd immediately spot any issues, no matter
        how subtle. Andy had long been retired, after a career that included a stint in the Carter
        White House, and he also worked in an agency representing NBA players. More recently he had
        the opportunity to do some contract work with an NBA team when a mutual friend took over as
        the General Manager. Andy was a true gentleman, scholar and friend. He will be missed, and
        future versions of this FAQ will suffer from his absence.

        by both education and trade. He works in IT management at University of California, Irvine,
        and has also taught university Computer Science courses, specializing in database theory.
        A lifelong NBA fan, he assimilated a working knowledge of the league's salary cap and trade
        rules, eventually organizing this knowledge into the Salary Cap FAQ to provide "the
        kind of reference I was looking for when I was trying to figure it all out."

        approach to learning the CBA, and includes more than 11 hours of video instruction in 23 modules,
        along with references, key terms sheets, transcripts, quizzes, exercises and a final exam. Since the
        course is taught using on-demand video, students can learn at their own pace, and return to modules
        again and again.

                          passes through the atmosphere a number of things take
                          place (see <a href="7h_1.html"><b>Figure
                        7h-1</b></a>). A portion of the energy (26% globally)
                        is <a href="../physgeoglos/r.html#reflection_atmospheric"><b>reflected</b></a> or <strong><a href="../physgeoglos/s.html#scattering_atmospheric">scattered</a></strong> back
                        to space by clouds and other atmospheric particles. About
                        19% of the energy available is absorbed by clouds, gases
                        (like <a href="../physgeoglos/o.html#ozone"><b>ozone</b></a>),
                        and particles in the atmosphere. Of the remaining 55%
                        of the solar energy passing through the Earth's atmosphere,
                        4% is reflected from the surface back to space. On average,
                        about 51% of the Sun's radiation reaches the surface.
                        This energy is then used in a number of processes, including
                        the heating of the ground surface; the melting of ice

  The heating of the ground by sunlight causes the Earth's surface to become
  a radiator of energy in the longwave band (sometimes called <a href="../physgeoglos/i.html#infrared_radiation"><b>infrared
  radiation</b></a>). This emission of energy is generally directed to space
  (see <a href="7h_2.html"><b>Figure 7h-2</b></a>). However, only a small portion
  of this energy actually makes it back to space. The majority of the outgoing
  infrared radiation is absorbed by the <a href="../physgeoglos/g.html#greenhouse_gases"><b>greenhouse

                        greenhouse gas molecules begin radiating longwave energy

                        greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. All of the
                        major greenhouse gases have increased in concentration
                        since the beginning of the <a href="../physgeoglos/i.html#industrial_revolution"><b>Industrial
                        Revolution</b></a> (about 1700 AD). As a result of these
                        higher concentrations, scientists predict that the greenhouse
                        effect will be <b><em>enhanced</em></b> and
                        the Earth's climate will become warmer. Predicting the
                        amount of warming is accomplished by
						<a href="http://pcs.co.uk">computer</a> modeling.
                        Computer models suggest that a doubling of the concentration
                        of the main greenhouse gas, <a href="../physgeoglos/c.html#carbon_dioxide"><b>carbon
                        dioxide</b></a>, may raise the average global temperature
                        between 1 and 3&deg; Celsius. However, the numeric equations
                        of computer models do not accurately simulate the effects
                        of a number of possible <a href="../physgeoglos/n.html#negative_feedback"><b>negative
                        feedbacks</b></a>. For example, many of the models cannot
                        properly simulate the negative effects that increased
                        cloud cover would have on the radiation balance of a
                        warmer Earth. Increasing the Earth's temperature would
                        cause the oceans to evaporate greater amounts of water,
                        causing the atmosphere to become cloudier. These extra
                        clouds would then reflect a greater proportion of the
                        Sun's energy back to space reducing the amount of solar
                        radiation absorbed by the atmosphere and the Earth's
                        surface. With less solar energy being absorbed at the
                        surface, the effects of an enhanced greenhouse effect
                        may be counteracted.</font></p>

                        to the <b><em>enhancement</em></b> of
                        greenhouse effect is still yet to be quantified. <br>
                        <br>
  Average concentrations of atmospheric <a href="../physgeoglos/c.html#carbon_dioxide"><b>carbon
  dioxide</b></a> in the year 2005 were about 380 parts per million (see <a href="7aCO2.html"><b>Figure
  7a-1</b></a>). Prior to 1700, levels of<b> </b>carbon dioxide were about 280
  parts per million. This increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is primarily
  due to the activities of humans. Beginning in 1700, societal changes brought
  about by the <a href="../physgeoglos/i.html#industrial_revolution"><b>Industrial
  Revolution</b></a> increased
  the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. The major sources of
  this gas include fossil fuel combustion for industry, transportation, space
  heating, electricity generation and cooking; and vegetation changes in natural
  prairie, woodland, and forested ecosystems. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion
  account for about 65% of the extra carbon dioxide now found in our atmosphere.
  The remaining 35% is derived from deforestation and the conversion of prairie,
  woodland, and forested ecosystems primarily into agricultural systems. Natural
  ecosystems can hold 20 to 100 times more carbon dioxide per unit area than
  agricultural systems. <br>
              <br>
  Artificially created <a href="../physgeoglos/c.html#chlorofluorocarbons"><b>chlorofluorocarbons</b></a> are
  the strongest greenhouse gas per molecule. However, low concentrations in the
  atmosphere reduce their overall importance in the <b><em>enhancement</em></b> of
  the greenhouse effect. Current measurements in the atmosphere indicate that
  the concentration of these chemicals may soon begin declining because of reduced
  emissions. Reports of the development of ozone holes over the North and South
  Poles and a general decline in global stratospheric ozone levels over the last
  two decades has caused many nations to cutback on their production and use
  of these chemicals. In 1987, the signing of the <a href="../physgeoglos/m.html#montreal_protocol"><b>Montreal
  Protocol</b></a> agreement by forty-six nations established an immediate timetable
  for the global reduction of chlorofluorocarbons production and use. <br>
              <br>
  Since 1750, <a href="../physgeoglos/m.html#methane"><b>methane</b></a> concentrations
  in the atmosphere have increased by more than 150%. The primary sources for
  the additional methane added to the atmosphere (in order of importance) are
  rice cultivation, domestic grazing animals, termites, landfills, coal mining,
  and oil and gas extraction. Anaerobic conditions associated with rice paddy
  flooding results in the formation of methane gas. However, an accurate estimate
  of how much methane is being produced from rice paddies has been difficult
  to obtain. More than 60% of all rice paddies are found in India and China
  where scientific data concerning emission rates are unavailable. Nevertheless,
  scientists believe that the contribution of rice paddies is large because this
  form of crop production has more than doubled since 1950. Grazing animals release
  methane to the environment as a result of herbaceous digestion. Some researchers
  believe the addition of methane from this source has more than quadrupled over
  the last century. Termites also release methane through similar processes.
  Land-use change in the tropics, due to deforestation, ranching, and farming,
  may be causing termite numbers to expand. If this assumption is correct, the
  contribution from these insects may be important. Methane is also released
  from landfills, coal mines, and gas and oil drilling. Landfills produce methane
  as organic wastes decompose over time. Coal, oil, and natural gas deposits
  release methane to the atmosphere when these deposits are excavated or drilled. <br>
              <br>
  The average concentration of <a href="../physgeoglos/n.html#nitrous_oxide"><b>nitrous
  oxide</b></a> in the atmosphere is now increasing at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3%
  per year. Sources for this increase include land-use conversion; fossil fuel
  combustion; biomass burning; and soil fertilization. Most of the nitrous oxide
  added to the atmosphere each year comes from deforestation and the conversion
  of forest, savanna and grassland ecosystems into agricultural fields and rangeland.
  Both of these processes reduce the amount of nitrogen stored in living vegetation
  and soil through the decomposition of organic matter. Nitrous oxide is also
  released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels and biomass are burned. However,
  the combined contribution of these sources to the increase of this gas in the
  atmosphere is thought to be minor. The use of nitrate and ammonium fertilizers
  to enhance plant growth is another source of nitrous oxide. Accurate measurements
  of how much nitrous oxide is being released from fertilization have been difficult
  to obtain. Estimates suggest that the contribution from this source may represent
  from 50% to 0.2% of nitrous oxide added to the atmosphere annually. <br>
              <br>
              <a href="../physgeoglos/o.html#ozone"><b>Ozone's</b></a> role
              in the enhancement of the greenhouse effect has been difficult
              to determine scientifically. Accurate measurements of past long-term
              (more than 25 years in the past) levels of this gas in the atmosphere
              are currently unavailable. Concentrations of ozone gas are found
              in two different regions of the Earth's atmosphere. The majority
              of the ozone (about 97%) found in the atmosphere is localized
              in the <a href="../physgeoglos/s.html#stratophere"><b>stratosphere</b></a> at
              an altitude of 15 to 55 kilometers above the Earth's surface. In
              recent years, the concentration of the <a href="../physgeoglos/o.html#ozone"><b>stratospheric
              ozone</b></a> has been decreasing because of the buildup of <a href="../physgeoglos/c.html#chlorofluorocarbons"><b>chlorofluorocarbons</b></a> in
              the atmosphere (see <a href="7e.html"><b>Lecture 7e</b></a>). Since
              the late 1970s, scientists have discovered that <a href="../physgeoglos/t.html#total_column_ozone"><b>total
              column ozone</b></a> amounts over Antarctica in the springtime
              have decreased by as much as 70%. Satellite measurements have
              indicated that the zone from 65&deg; North to 65&deg; South latitude
              has had a 3% decrease in stratospheric ozone since 1978. Ozone
              is also highly concentrated at the Earth's surface. Most of this
              ozone is created as an artificial by product of <a href="../physgeoglos/p.html#photochemical_smog"><b>photochemical
              smog</b></a>.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font size="+1">In summary, the <b><em>greenhouse
                            effect</em></b> causes the atmosphere to trap more
                            heat energy at the Earth's surface and within the
                            atmosphere by absorbing and re-emitting longwave
                            energy. Of the longwave energy emitted back to space,
                            90% is intercepted and absorbed by greenhouse gases.
                            Without the greenhouse effect the Earth's average
                            global temperature would be -18&deg; Celsius, rather
                            than the present 15&deg; Celsius. In the last few
                            centuries, the activities of humans have directly
                            or indirectly caused the concentration of the major
                            greenhouse gases to increase. Scientists predict
                            that this increase may <b><em>enhance</em></b> the
                            greenhouse effect making the planet warmer. Some
                            experts estimate that the Earth's average global
                            temperature has already increased by 0.3 to 0.6&deg; Celsius,
                            since the beginning of this century, because of this
                            enhancement. Predictions of future climates indicate
                            that by the middle of the next century the Earth's
                            global temperature may be 1 to 3&deg; Celsius higher
                            than today. </font></p>

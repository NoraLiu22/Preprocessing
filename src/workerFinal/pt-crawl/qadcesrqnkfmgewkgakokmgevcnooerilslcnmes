Sections I and II</h2>

<center>
<h3>Section I.<br>
Invasion &amp; Occupation of Manchuria<br>
The China War and Its Phases</h3>
</center>

The war which Japan waged against China, and which
the Japanese leaders falsely described as the "China
Incident" or the "China Affair", began on the night
of 18 September 1931 and ended with the surrender of
Japan in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. The first phase
of this war consisted of the invasion, occupation and
consolidation by Japan of that part of China known as
Manchuria, and of the Province of Jehol. The second
phase of this war began on 7 July 1937, when Japanese
troops attacked the walled city of Wanping near Peiping
following the "Marco Polo Bridge Incident", and consisted
of successive advances, each followed by brief
periods of consolidation in preparation for further
advances into Chinese territory. Some of the Accused
were active in this war form the very beginning, some
participated as the war progressed. SHIRATORI stated
during the course of his lecture, "The Trend of the
Great War", which was published in the <i>Diamond Magazine</i>
for June 1940, "It is not too much to say that the fuse
of the European War was first attached by the China Incident".

<h3>Japan's Foothold in Manchuria<br>
at the Beginning of the China War</h3>
</center>

The position of Japan in Manchuria as at 18
September 1931 is described by the Lytton Commission in
terms with which the Tribunal entirely agrees:

<p><center><i>--521--</i></center><hr><a name=page522></a><p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
These treaties and other agreements gave to Japan an important
and unusual position in Manchuria. She governed the
leased territory with practically full rights of sovereignty.
Through the South Manchurian Railway, she
administered the railway areas, including several towns
and large sections of such populous cities as Mukden
and Changchun; and in these areas she controlled the
police, taxation, education, and public utilities. She
maintained armed forces in many parts of the country:
the Kwantung Army in the Leased Territory, Railway
Guards in the railway areas, and Consular Police throughout
the various districts. This summary of the long
list of Japan's rights in Manchuria shows clearly the
exceptional character of the political, economic and
legal relations created between that country and China
in Manchuria. There is probably nowhere in the world
an exact parallel to this situation, no example of a
country enjoying in the territory of a neighboring State
such extensive economic and administrative privileges.
A situation of this kind could possible be maintained
without leading to incessant complications and disputes
if it were freely desired or accepted on both sides,
and if it were the sign and embodiment of a well considered
policy of close collaboration in the economic
and in the political sphere. But, in the absence of
these conditions, it could only lead to friction and conflict.
</blockquote>
<p>
The situation was not "freely desired and
accepted on both sides", and the friction inevitably
followed. By the use of force or the threat of force,
Japan had secured concessions from China in the days of
her weakness; the resurgent nationalism of China

<p><center><i>--522--</i></center><hr><a name=page523></a><p>
<blockquote>

resented the losses which the decadent Empire of China
had been unable to avoid. A more powerful factor, and
ultimately the decisive factor in producing the
friction, began to emerge as Japan, non longer satisfied
with the rights she had gained, south their enlargement
on a scale which in the end involved the conquest of
Manchuria. This policy on the part of Japan to seek
enlargement of her rights and interests in China was
first authoritatively announced in the time of the
Tanaka Cabinet.

<center>
<h3>The Tanaka Cabinet and its "Positive Policy"</h3>
</center>

The political atmosphere had been tense in
Japan before the formation of the Tanaka Cabinet, which
came into power in 1927 advocating the so-called
"Positive POlicy{ toward China. The military group
attributed what they termed the weakened condition of
Japan at that time to the liberal tendencies of the
Government as evidenced by the "Friendship Policy" advocated
by Foreign Minister Shidehara. The "Friendship
Policy", which was thus displaced, had been in force
since the Washington Conference of 1922. The "Positive
Policy", advocated by Premier Tanaka, was to expand
and develop the special rights and privileges, which
Japan claimed to have acquired in Manchuria, through
collaboration with Manchurian authorities, especially
Marshal Chang Tso-lin, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Chinese North-Eastern Frontier Army and Chief of the
Administration of Manchuria and Jehol. Premier Tanaka
also declared that although Japan would respect the
sovereignty of China over Manchuria and would do everything
possible to enforce the "Open Door POlicy" in

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--523--</i></center><hr><a name=page524></a><p>
<blockquote>

China, she was fully determined to see that no state
of affairs arose in Manchuria which would disturb the
local tranquility and put Japan's vital interests in
jeopardy. The Tanaka Government placed great emphasis
upon the necessity of regarding Manchuria as distinct
from the rest of China and declared that, if disturbances
spread to Manchuria and Mongolia from other parts
of China, Japan would defend her interests in those
districts by force. The policy thus involved an expressed
intention to secure further rights in a foreign
country and an implied claim of right to preserve internal
peace and order in that foreign country.

<center>
<h3>Agitation in Support of the "Positive Policy"</h3>
</center>

Such organizations as the <i>Kokurtukai</i> (Black
Dragon Society) and the <i>Kokuhonsha</i> (Foundation of the
State Society) as well as such writers as Dr. Okawa
(the former Accused) agitated strongly in Japan for the
enforcement of Japan's special rights and privileges in
China by force of arms if necessary.
<p>
The Black Dragon Society had been formed on
3 February 1901 at Kanda, Japan, to promote nationalism
and anti-Russian and anti-Korean sympathies. It
had advocated annexation of Korea, and in general
supported the expansionist aspirations of Japan.
<p>
The Foundation of the State Society had been
formed on 20 December 1920 to foster the spirit of
nationalism and disseminate propaganda. It kept in
close touch with the military and published a magazine
to present its ideas to the public. HIRANUMA was
President and KOISO and ARAKI were Members of the Society.
<p>
Dr. Okawa was a trusted employee of the South

<blockquote>

Manchurian Railway Company, and had been a Director of
the East Asia Research Institute established by the
Railway Company to study the economic situation in
Manchuria. He had published several books before the
formation of the Tanaka Cabinet. <i>Sato Shinen's Ideal
State,</i> published by him in 1924, stated: that
according to Sato, Japan being the first country in
the world to be created. it was the foundation of all
nations and therefore had the divine mission to rule
all nations. The book advocated the occupation of
Siberia to prevent the southward advance of Russia,
and the occupation of the South Sea Islands to prevent
the northward advance of Britain. He published <i>Asia,
Europe and Japan,</I> in 1925. In that book, he maintained
that the League of Nations was organized to maintain
eternally the status quo and further domination of the
World by the Anglo-Saxons. He predicted that a war
between the East and the West was inevitable. Providence
was trying to elect Japan as the champion of Asia,
he asserted. Japan should endeavor to fulfill that
sublime mission by developing a strong materialistic
spirit, he advised. Dr. Okawa had been the organizer
of many societies, including the <i>Kochisha,</I> one principle
of which was the liberation of the colored races and
the unification of the World. The political philosophy
of Dr. Okawa had appealed to certain of the Military
who had adopted him as their spokesman among the
civilians and often invited him to deliver lectures at
the Army General Staff meetings. Dr. Okawa became intimately
acquainted with the Accused KOISO, ITAGAKI,
DOHIHARA and other Army leaders.

<h3>The Tsinan Incident</h3>
</center>

Marshal Chang Tso-lin, having declared Manchuria
independent of the Central Government of China at the
time of the Washington Conference, and made himself master
of Manchuria, decided to extend his authority further
into China proper and moved his headquarters to Peking.
The policy of the Tanaka Cabinet, being based on the plan
of collaboration with the Marshal, depended on the success
of the Marshal in maintaining his leadership in
Manchuria. Premier Tanaka repeatedly advised the
Marshal to abandon his ambitions to extend his authority
outside Manchuria; but the Marshal resented and refused
this advice. Civil war between Chang Tso-lin and the
Nationalist Government of China followed. In the spring
of 1928, when the nationalist armies of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek were marching on Peking and Tientsin to
drive out the army of Chang Tso-lin, and force it back
into Manchuria, Premier Tanaka issued a declaration to
the effect that Japan would maintain peace and order in
Manchuria and was prepared to prevent a state of affairs
which would endanger the interests of Japan in Manchuria.
The Premier then sent a message to the Chinese generals,
in effect telling them that the Japanese would oppose any
invasion of Manchuria, including the definite statement
that the Japanese would prevent defeated troops or those
in pursuit from entering Manchuria. Even before the civil
war spread to Manchuria, Japanese troops were sent to
Tsinan in Shantung Province. A conflict ensued known as
the Tsinan Incident, which aroused public opinion in Japan
in favour of protection of Japanese rights in Manchuria.
The Black Dragon Society held mass-meetings all over
Japan in an effort to fan national resentment against
China to the war pitch.

<h3>Murder of Marshal Chang Tso-lin</h3>
</center>

Marshal Chang Tso-lin had not only disregarded
the advice of Premier Tanaka in attempting to extend his
authority south of the Great Wall, but had shown increasing
unwillingness to allow Japan to exploit China by the
privileges she derived from various treaties and agreements.
This attitude of the Marshal had caused a group
of officers in the Kwantung Army to advocate that force
should be used to promote the interests of Japan in
Manchuria, and to maintain that nothing was to be gained
by negotiating with the Marshal; however, Premier
Tanaka continued to collaborate with the Marshal,
relying upon the threat of force rather than its actual
use to attain his objective. This resentment of the
Marshal by certain officers of the Kwantung Army became
so intense that a senior staff officer of that army,
Colonel Kawamoto, planned to murder the Marshal. The
purpose of the murder was to remove him as the obstacle
to the creation of a new state in Manchuria, dominated
by Japan, with the Marshals' son, Chang Hsueh-liang, as
its nominal head.
<p>
In the latter part of April 1928, the Marshal was
defeated by the nationalist armies of Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek. Premier Tanaka advised him to withdraw into
Manchuria behind the Japanese lines before it was too
late. The Marshal resented this advice, but was forced
to follow it. The Kwantung Army, in accordance with
Tanaka's declaration, that Japan would prevent defeated
troops form entering Manchuria, was engaged in
disarming Chinese troops retreating toward Mukden
from Peking. The Japanese 20th Engineer
Regiment, which had arrived at Mukden from Korea, mined the
railroad with dynamite and a Japanese Captain placed his

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--527--</i></center><hr><a name=page528></a><p>
<blockquote>

soldiers in position around the mine. On 4 June 1938,
when the Marshal's train reached the mine, which was
located at the point where the Peking-Mukden Railway
passes underneath the South Manchurian Railway, there
was an explosion. The Marshal's train was wrecked and
Japanese soldiers began firing upon the Marshal's
bodyguard. The Marshal was killed as planned. An
attempt was made to obtain an order to muster the
entire Kwantung Army into action and exploit the incident
and attain its original purpose, but the effort
was thwarted by a staff officer who apparently did not
understand the real purpose of those desiring the
issuance of the order.
<p>
The Tanaka Cabinet was taken by surprise and
greatly embarrassed as it saw its program endangered by
this murder of the Marshal. Premier Tanaka made a full
report to the Emperor and obtained his permission to
court-martial those responsible. Upon his return from
the palace, he summoned the Minister of War and other
members of his Cabinet and sated that he was determined
to discipline the Army. Those present agreed, but when
the Minister of War took the matter up with his Ministry,
he suggested that strong opposition on the part of
the General Staff should be encouraged. Thereafter, the
Minister of War reported to the Premier that the opposition
of the Army General Staff was based on the
idea that to court-martial those responsible would force
the Army to make public some of its military secrets.
This was the first time, according to the testimony of
former Navy Minister Okada, that the Army had projected
itself into the formulation of government policy.
<P>
It was at this time that DOHIHARA appeared upon a
scene in which he was to play an important part. He had

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--528--</i></center><hr><a name=page529></a><p>
<blockquote>

spent approximately eighteen years in China prior to the
murder of Marshal Chang Tso-lin as aide to General Benzai,
who had acted as advisor to various Chinese leaders. On
17 March 1928, DOHIHARA had requested and received permission
from the Emperor to accept an appointment as aided
to Matsui, Nanao, who was advisor to the Marshal. DOHIHARA
reported for duty under the appointment and was present
in Manchuria when the Marshal was killed.

<center>
<h3>Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang, the Young Marshal</h3>
</center>

The Young Marshal, Chang Hsueh-liang, succeeded
his father; but he proved to be a disappointment to the
Kwantung Army. He joined the Koumintang Party in December
1928; and anti-Japanese movements began to be promoted
on an organized scale and gained greatly in
intensity. The movement for the recovery of Chinese
national rights gained strength. There was a demand for
the recovery of the South Manchurian Railway and, in
general, for the limitation of the Japanese influence
in Manchuria.
<p>
In July 1928, soon after the murder of Marshal
Chang Tso-lin, Premier Tanaka had sent a personal representative
to negotiate with the Young Marshal. The
representative had been instructed to inform the Young
Marshal that Japan regarded Manchuria as her outpost, and
that the Japanese Government would like to cooperate
with him "behind the scenes" and was prepared to spare
no sacrifice under the Cabinet's "Positive Policy" to
prevent an invasion of Manchuria by the Chinese Nationalist
Armies. The Young Marshal's answer was to join the
Koumintang as related.

<center>
<h3>Japanese-Chinese Relations Strained</h3>
</center>

Japanese-Chinese relations in Manchuria became
extremely aggravated. The Japanese claimed several violations

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--529--</i></center><hr><a name=page530></a><p>
<blockquote>

of the "Trade Treaty" with China. The Chinese
proposal to construct a railroad parallel to the South
Manchurian Railroad, the claim that there was illegal
taxation of Japanese in Manchuria, the claim of oppression
of Koreans, and the denial of the right of Japanese
subjects to lease land in Manchuria, were all "Manchurian
Problems" according to the Japanese agitators.
The Military advocated Japanese occupation of Manchuria.
They maintained that diplomatic negotiations were useless
and that armed force should be used to drive the
Chinese from Manchuria and set up a new regime under
Japanese control. ITAGAKI, who had been appointed a
staff officer of the Kwantung Army in May 1929, was
one of those who advocated the use of force. Dr. Okawa,
who had visited Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang and attempted
to negotiate with him on behalf of the South Manchurian
Railway, returned to Japan and engaged in a tour of over
fifty prefectures in April 1929, giving lectures and
showing pictures. The Army General Staff, of which MINAMI
was Vice-Chief, began to cooperate with Dr. Okawa and
to aid him in his propaganda program to instigate the people
to take action against China. The Army General Staff
also began to study plans for operations in Manchuria and
to declare that Manchuria was the "lifeline" of Japan.

<center>
<h3>Resignation of the Tanaka Cabinet</h3>
</center>

The efforts of the Tanaka Cabinet to punish
those responsible for the murder of Marshal Chang
Tso-lin had alienated the Military. This group had
joined with Dr. Okawa to create opposition among the
civilians to the Cabinet, and had seized upon the
signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-15 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-15</a>),
which they claimed violated the Japanese

<p><center><i>--530--</i></center><hr><a name=page531></a><p>
<blockquote>

Constitution, as well as the terms approved by the Cabinet
for the settlement of the Tsinan Incident, which they
claimed were a disgrace to Japan, as opportunities to
embarrass the Cabinet. The pressure became so great that
on 1 July 1929, the Cabinet resigned.
<p>
The resignation of the Tanaka Government was a
distinct victory for the Military and their civilian
spokesman, Dr. Okawa. From this time on, the influence of
this element on government policies was to become stronger,
and their insistence that Japan should occupy Manchuria
by force and establish a puppet government there was to
bear fruit. Dr. Okawa became recognized as a political
leader; and the South Manchurian Railway Company officials,
realizing his value to them, divorced the East Asia Research
Institute from the Company and created a Foundation
in July 1929 to assist him in his work of investigating and
molding public opinion in support of the Army's plan
to occupy Manchuria.

<center>
<h3>Reinstatement of the "Friendship Policy"</h3>
</center>

The Hamaguchi Cabinet, which followed the Tanaka
Cabinet, was formed on 2 July 1929; and Baron Shidehara, who
continued to advocate the "Friendship Policy" toward China,
was selected by Premier Hamaguchi as his Foreign Minister.
The "Friendship Policy" rested upon good will and friendship
as distinguished form the "Positive Policy" of the
Tanaka Cabinet, which rested upon the threat of military
force. As a result of the "Friendship Policy", Chinese
boycotts of Japanese trade steadily decreased and normal
peaceful relations might have prevailed but for violent
agitation on the party of the Military.

<h3>Hashimoto and the Cherry Society</h3>
</center>

In his book, <i>The Road to the Reconstruction of
the World,</i> HASHIMOTO, in discussing his tour of duty
of three years in Istanbul as Military Attach&eacute; discussed
the political condition of other countries and
said: "I was clearly conscious that Japan was the
only country within the whirlpool of world movement
that stood within the bounds of liberalism. I considered
if Japan goes on under the present condition,
she would drop from the ranks in the community of
nations. At this time, fortunately, I was ordered
to go back (to Japan). During my thirty days' voyage,
I pondered on how to reform Japan and as a
result, I succeeded in drawing a definite plan to
a certain degree. On returning to the Army General
Staff Office, my former haunt, I devised several

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--532--</i></center><hr><a name=page533></a><p>
<blockquote>

schemes in order to put my ideas into execution."
HASHIMOTO was attached to the Army General Staff on
30 January 1930.
<p>
Between 1-10 September 1930, a score or more
of army captains who had recently graduated from the
Army Staff College, met at the Army Club in Tokyo under
the sponsorship of Lt. Colonel HASHIMOTO and decided to
organize a research organization to study Manchurian and
Mongolian questions and the internal reorganization of
the country. The Society's ultimate objective was later
announced to be national reorganization, by armed force
if necessary, in order to settle the so-called "Manchurian
Problem" and other pending issues. The name <i>Sakurakai</i>
(Cherry Society) was given to the organization; and its
membership was limited to army officer on the active
list with rank of Lt. Colonel or under, who were concerned
about national reorganization.

<center>
<h3>Manchuria as Japan's "Lifeline"</h3>
</center>

Dr. Okawa, with the aid of the East Asia Research
Foundation and the officers of the Army General
Staff, had his propaganda campaign in full blast when
HASHIMOTO returned to the General Staff Office. Propaganda
was being disseminated through the newspapers
and other media to establish the idea that Manchuria was
Japan's "Lifeline", and that a stronger policy in connection
therewith should be adopted. The military leaders
issued instructions that all editorial writers,
ultra-nationalistic speakers, etc., should unite to establish
public opinion for more aggressive action in
Manchuria. The MIlitary argued that Manchuria was Japan's

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--533--</i></center><hr><a name=page534></a><p>
<blockquote>

"Lifeline", and that Japan must expand into Manchuria,
develop it economically and industrially, set it up as a
defence against Russia, and protect the rights of Japan
and its nationals there as Japan was entitled to do under
existing treaties. An appeal to emotion was made; it
being said that Japanese blood had been shed in Manchuria
in the Russo-Japanese War, and that by reason of that
sacrifice, Japan was entitled to control Manchuria. The
railroad question was still a burning issue; and Dr.
Okawa insisted that Manchuria should be separated from
Nanking and placed under Japanese control to create a
land founded on the "Kingly Way".
<p>
HASHIMOTO in his book, <i>The Inevitability of
Renovation,</i> has explained well the meaning of the term
"Kingly Way". He said, "It is necessary to have politics,
economics, culture, national defense, and everything else,
all focused on one, the Emperor, and the whole force of
the nation concentrated and displayed from a single point.
Especially the political, economic and cultural lines
which had been organized and conducted by liberalism and
socialism in the past should be reorganized according to
the principle of oneness in the Imperial Way, that is to
say <i>Kodo Ittai Shugi.</i> This system is the strongest and
the grandest of all. There are mony countries in the
world, but there is absolutely no nation that can compare
with our national blood solidarity which makes possible
a unification like ours with the Emperor in the center".
<p>
It was Okawa's idea that after an independent
Manchuria had been established on the "Kingly Way", with
an incomparable relation between Manchuria and Japan,
Japan could assume the leadership of the peoples of Asia.

<blockquote>

A General Investigation Section was created in
the General Staff on 1 April 1930, as the Investigation
Section of the Kwantung Army was considered insufficient
to probe into the resources of Manchuria, the sentiments
of the people and other kindred subjects of investigation.
<p>
Around the headquarters of the Kwantung Army at
Port Arthur, the chief topic of conversation among the
staff officers in those days was the "Manchurian Problem".
ITAGAKI, who was one of those staff officers, had some
definite ideas for solving the problem, which he expressed
to a friend during the month of May 1930. ITAGAKI
said that there were many 8unsolved problems between China
and Japan, that they were so serious that they could not
be solved by diplomatic means, and that there was no alternative
but to use force. He expressed the opinion
that Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang should be driven from Manchuria
so that a new state might be established in accordance
with the principles of the "Kingly Way".

<h3>Assassination of Premier Hamaguchi</h3>
</center>

On 4 November 1930, Premier Hamaguchi was on
the platform of the Tokyo Railway Station when, in the
words of Foreign Minister Shidehara, "He was shot by a
silly young man". The Premier was not killed instantly;
but his wound was such that it was necessary for Foreign
Minister Shidehara to act as Prime Minister until the
Hamaguchi Cabinet resigned on 13 April 1931. The Premier
succumbed to his wounds and died on 26 August 1931. Acting
Prime Minister Shidehara caused an investigation to
be made and determined that the assassination of Premier
Hamaguchi was caused by dissatisfaction with the Premier's

Naval Disarmament Policy.
<p>
The London Naval Limitations Treaty had been
signed on 22 April 1930. This treaty was in line with
the policy of national economy and reduction of armaments
which accompanied the Premier's "Friendship POlicy".
Also in line with this policy was the reduction
fo the Army from 21 divisions to 17 divisions. The
signing of the London Treaty made the young navy officers
indignant. The Black Dragon Society began to hold mass=meetings
in protest. The Privy Council, of which HIRANUMA
was Vice-President, was strongly against the Treaty
and was taking the attitude that the Cabinet had usurped
the powers and prerogatives of the Military in concluding
the Treaty. It was in the midst of this violent political
argument that the assassination had occurred.

<center>
<h3>The March Incident</h3>
</center>

A military coup d'etat was planned to occur on
20 March 1931. The affair came to be known as the "March
Incident". The continual agitation and dissemination of
propaganda by the Army General Staff had its effect; and
as testified by Baron Okada, who was a member of the
Supreme War Council at that time, it was generally understood
that it was only a question of time until the Army
would undertake the occupation of Manchuria. Before
the Army could move into Manchuria, it was thought
necessary to place in power a Government favorable to
such action. At the time, the Hamaguchi Cabinet was in
power; and due to the attempted assassination of the
Premier, the chief exponent of the "Friendship Policy",
namely Foreign Minister Shidehara, was acting as Premier.

<blockquote>

HASHIMOTO's plan, which was approved by his superior
officers of the Army General Staff, including Ninomiya,
who was Vice-Chief of the Staff, and Tatekawa, who was
Chief of the Second Division of the Staff, was to start
a demonstration as an expression of disapproval of the
Diet. It was expected that a clash would occur with the
Police during the demonstration, and that this clash could
be expanded until the disorder would justify the Army in
establishing martial law, dissolving the Diet and seizing
the Government. KOISO, Ninomiya, Tatekawa and
others called upon War Minister Ugaki at his Official
Residence and discussed their plans with him, leaving
with the impression that he was a ready tool for
their scheme. Dr. Okawa was instructed to proceed
with the mass demonstration; and HASHIMOTO delivered
to him 300 practice bombs, which KOISO had secured
for use on that occasion. They were to be used to
spread alarm and confusion in the crowd and increase
the appearance of riot. However, Dr. Okawa in his
enthusiasm addressed a letter to War Minister Ugaki
in which he stated that the time was just ahead for
a great mission to descend upon Minister Ugaki; the War
Minister now realized the full import of the plot. He
immediately called in KOISO and HASHIMOTO and instructed
them to stop all further plans to use the Army to carry
out this revolution against the Government. The projected
coup d'etat was averted. KIDO, who was then
the Chief Secretary to the Lord Keeper of the Privy
Seal, was fully informed of the plot beforehand by a
friend, who suggested that the Imperial Household
should be advised.

</center>

Although the "March Incident" hastened the fall
of the Hamaguchi Cabinet, which was followed on 14 April
1931 by the formation of the Wakatsuki Cabinet, it did
not succeed in displacing the "Friendship Policy" fostered
by Baron Shidehara, for he was retained as Foreign
Minister by Premier Wakatsuki. General MINAMI, who had
been a War Councillor since his relief as Commander of
the Korean Army, was selected as War Minister. He replaced
General Ugaki, who was in disgrace with the Army
for having reduced the size of the Army and for having
refused to take part in the "March Incident". Ugaki resigned
from the Army and went into retirement.

<center>
<h3>The Wanpaoshan Incident</h3>
</center>

The "Friendship Policy" was destined to be put
to further tests, by two "Incidents", which had far-reaching
effect upon opinion in Japan. The first of these
"Incidents" occurred at Wanpaoshan, a small village located
some 18 miles north of Changchun, in Manchuria.
The village is located in a low marshy area alongside
the Itung River. A group of Koreans leased a large tract
of land near Wanpaoshan and prepared to irrigate the land
by digging a ditch several miles long, extending from the
Itung River across a tract of land, not included in their
lease, and occupied by Chinese farmers. After a considerable
length of the ditch had been constructed, the Chinese
farmers arose en masse and protested to the Wanpaoshan
authorities, who dispatched police and ordered the Koreans
to cease construction at once and leave the area occupied
by the Chinese. The Japanese Consul at Changchun also
sent policy to protect the Koreans. On 1 July 1931, after

<p><center><i>--538--</i></center><hr><a name=page539></a><p>
<blockquote>

negotiations had produced no results, the Chinese farmers
took matters into their own hands and drove the Koreans
from their lands and filled the ditch. During this
operation, Japanese Consular Police opened fire on the
Chinese farmers and drove them away, while the Koreans
returned and completed their irrigation project under
the protection of the Japanese police. No casualties
resulted from this "Incident", but the sensational accounts
of it printed in the Japanese and Korean Press
caused a series of anti-Chinese riots in Korea in which
Chinese were massacred and their property destroyed,
which in turn caused a revival of the anti-Japanese boycott
in China.
<p>
About this time, the War Ministry invited officials
of the South Manchurian Railway Company to discuss
"Manchurian Problems". At the discussions, MINAMI
represented the Army and stated that he had long recognized
the necessity of increasing the number of divisions
in Korea.

<h3>The Nakamura Incident</h3>
</center>

The killing of a Japanese Army captain by the
name of Nakamura, Shintaro, on 27 June 1931 by soldiers
under the command of Kuan Yuheng, Commander of the Third
Regiment of the Chinese Reclamation Army in Manchuria,
which killing did not become known to the Japanese until
about 17 July 1931, gave rise to the second "Incident".
Captain Nakamura, a regular Japanese Army officer, was
on a mission under orders of the Japanese Army. According
to the Chinese, he was armed and carried patent medicines,
which included narcotic drugs for non-medical purposes.
He was accompanied by three interpreters and

<p><center><i>--539--</i></center><hr><a name=page540></a><p>
<blockquote>

assistants, and represented himself as an "Agricultural
Expert". When he reached a point near Taonan, he and
his assistants were captured and shot; and their bodies
were cremated to conceal the evidence of the deed.
This "Incident" greatly aggravated the resentment of the
Japanese Military against the "Friendship Policy"; and
the Japanese Press repeatedly declared that "solution
of the Manchurian Problem ought to be by force!"

<center>
<h3>The Army Attitude Stiffened</h3>
</center>

The Army stiffened its attitude in regard to
reduction of armaments and the plan of the Finance Department
to economize, and threatened to appeal to the
Throne. The Foreign Minster was bitterly assailed in
the Press and by ultra-nationalists and the militarists
for "Shidehara's weak-kneed foreign policy". The Cherry
Society continued its agitation for the use of force.
The Black Dragon Society held mass-meetings. Dr. Okawa
stepped up the tempo of his propaganda. He was conducting
a campaign of public speeches and publications to
build up sentiment in support of the movement to occupy
Manchuria. He made a speech along this line at the
Naval Academy. The Army was completely out of control
and could not be restrained. The Chiefs of Staff  held
a conference and decided that since one could not tell
what Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang would do, he should be
smashed firmly and without hesitation. Dr. Okawa confided
in a friend that he and Colonel ITAGAKI and certain
other Army officers would bring about an "Incident" in
Mukden later on that would solve all "Manchurian Problems".
KIDO admits that Baron Harada informed him of a

<p><center><i>--540--</i></center><hr><a name=page541></a><p>
<blockquote>

plot to this end on the part of the military officers in
Manchuria as early as 23 June 1931.
<p>
On 4 August 1931, MINAMI addressed a conference
of Army Commanders and Commanding Generals. he
said, "Some observers, without studying the conditions
of neighboring foreign countries, hastily advocate
limitation of armaments and engage in propaganda
unfavourable to the nation and the Army. Manchuria and
Mongolia are very closely related to our country from
the viewpoint of our national defense as well as
politics and economics, It is to be regretted that
the recent situation in that part of China is following
a trend unfavourable to our Empire. In view of the
situation, I hope you will execute your duty in educating
and training the troops with enthusiasm and sincerity
so that you may serve the cause of His Majesty
to perfection".
<p>
The Citizens' disarmament League took issue with
MINAMI on this speech and addressed a letter to him in
which they accused him of spreading propaganda in the
Army in violation of the Military Criminal Code.
<p>
Lt. Colonel HASHIMOTO and Lt. Colonel Shigeto,
who was also a member of the Cherry Society, dined at
the home of friend, Fujita, in Tokyo, during August
1931. During the course of the meal, the "Manchurian
Problem" was discussed and the two Lt. Colonels agreed
that positive action should be taken in Manchuria. A
few days later, Lt. Colonel Shigeto appeared at the home
of Fujita and deposited a large sum of money for safe-keeping.
During the following days, this fund was drawn
upon by SHigeto in varying amounts. After the "Mukden
Incident", Fujita called at the home of Shigeto and
exclaimed, "You have accomplished what you were contemplating

in Manchuria!" Shigeto replied, "Yes!" and
smiled; he then added, "We will expel Chang Hsueh-liang
from Manchuria and bring Pu Yi to Manchuria
and install him as Governor of the Far Eastern
Provinces!" Upon questioning HASHIMOTO, Fujita
received the reply, "Yes, things have come to pass
where they should come!"

<h3>Dohihara Investigated</h3>
</center>

Colonel DOHIHARA, who had been attached to the
Army General Staff since his return from China in March
1929, was sent by the Chief of the General Staff to
investigate the death of Captain Nakamura. Although
his mission was ostensibly to investigate Captain
Nokamura's death, his real mission appears to have been
to determine the strength, state of training and condition
of the Chinese armies and the efficiency of their communication
system. He departed from Tokyo in July 1931,
and traveled by way of Shanghai, Hankow, Peiping and
Tientsin before reporting to Mukden. He admits that the
investigation of the Nakamura Incident was only one of
the  missions that took him to China. Although the Headquarters
of the Kwantung Army was in Port Arthur, the
Headquarters of the Special Services Organization of that
Army was in Mukden. DOHIHARA arrived at Mukden on 18
August 1931 and took command of the Special Service Organization.

<center>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shidehara Also Investigated</h3>
</center>

Foreign Minister Shidehara, anxious to enforce
his "Friendship Policy" in Manchuria and give the Army
no occasion to capitalize on the "Nakamura Incident",
dispatched Consul-General Hayashi from Tokyo on 17 August
1931 with instructions to investigate and settle the
affair. The Consul-General called upon the Chinese
Governor of Liaoning Province, who appointed a commission
to investigate and report upon the "Incident". This

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--543--</i></center><hr><a name=page544></a><p>
<blockquote>

Commission reported on 3 September 1931; but its report
was unsatisfactory to the Chinese authorities. On the
4th of September, Consul-General Hayashi was informed
by General Yung Chen, the Chinese Chief of Staff, that
the report of the Commission was indecisive and unsatisfactory
and that it would be necessary to conduct a
second enquiry. Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang, who was
sick in a hospital at Peping, was advised of the situation;
and he immediately ordered a new Commission to
be appointed and instructed to investigate the death of
Captain Nakamura. At the same time, he sent Major
Shibayama to Tokyo to confer with Foreign Minister
Shidehara and make it clear that he desired to settle
the case amicably. In the meantime, he had sent a high
official to Tokyo to confer with Baron Shidehara and
ascertain what common ground could be found for the
settlement of various Sino-Japanese issues then outstanding.

<center>
<h3>Dohihara Reported to the Army General Staff</h3>
</center>

Colonel DOHIHARA returned to Tokyo early in
September to report to the Army General Staff. After his
return,the Press freely published references to the
fact that it had been decided to use force to settle all
pending issues in Manchuria as recommended by Colonel
DOHIHARA. THe Press also stated that conferences were
being held between the War Ministry and the Army General
Staff to arrange definite instructions to be given to
Colonel DOHIHARA. These publications may or may not be
factually accurate. They were not officially denied.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--544--</i></center><hr><a name=page545></a><p>
<blockquote>

They fanned the rising flame of Japanese opinion in
favoring the use of force against China. It is
established that Colonel DOHIHARA disagreed with Consul-General
Hayashi regarding settlement of the Nakamura
Incident and continued to question the sincerity of the
Chinese efforts to arrive at a satisfactory solution
of the case. War Minister MINAMI later confided in a
friend that at the time he had advocated decisive
settlement of the "Manchurian Problem" in line with
Army opinion. KIDO, as Chief Secretary to the Lord
Keeper of the Privy Seal, noted in his diary on 10
September 1931 that he agreed with the theory that "self-defensive"
action might be unavoidable in connection
with Manchuria according to future developments.

<center>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shidehara Continued Efforts at Mediation</h3>
</center>

Rumors were current in Tokyo that the Army was
planning an "Incident" in Mukden, and these rumors were
heard by Foreign Minister Shidehara. In fact, Shidehara
stated, "Shortly before the Manchurian Incident, as
Foreign Minister, I received confidential reports and
information that the Kwantung Army was engaged in
amassing troops and bringing up ammunition and material
for some military purpose, and knew from such reports
that action of some kind was contemplated by the Military Clique".
<p>
It now appears from the evidence adduced before
this Tribunal--though these facts were not known to
Shidehara at the time--that Lieutenant, or Captain,

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--545--</i></center><hr><a name=page546></a><p>
<blockquote>

Kawakami, who was stationed at Fushun in command of a
detached company of the second battalion of the Independent
Infantry Garrison, had received orders from the Commander-in-Chief
of the Kwantung Army which involved the
absence of himself and his company from Fushun. The
remaining companies of this battalion were stationed at
Mukden and took part in the attack on the Chinese Barracks
at Mukden on the 18th of September. The full content of
the orders which Kawakami had received form the Commander-in-Chief
is not established, but they involved that
Kawakami and his company should entrain and leave Fushun
upon the occurrence of a certain emergency. Thereupon,
Kawakami assembled the Japanese police, ex-servicemen,
and civilians at Fushun and asked them what they would do
if on 18th September 1931 an event occurred in Mukden which
required him and his company to leave Fushun. He is said
to have been anxious about defense at Fushun should he
and his company leave that city. He also assembled the
officials of the Railway at Fushun. He told them that
some acute situation might arise after the 17th of
September and that arrangements ought to be made about
trains at Fushun. It appears that up till that time no
arrangement had been made for having a night train standing
by at Fushun to move troops in case of emergency, and
Kawakami desired that such provision should be made.
<p>
The cased for the defence in regard to this
most significant affair is that Kawakami had no orders
which related specifically to the 18th of September; that
his orders were general, to take certain action if and
when an emergency occurred; that upon a review of the
situation, Kawakami speculated that the emergency might
occur about the 18th of September; and that this guess

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--546--</i></center><hr><a name=page547></a><p>
<blockquote>

of his along accounts for his mention of that date, when
speaking to the people at Fushun. Thus, according to the
defence, Kawakami guessed the exact date on which the
Chinese would deliver a surprise attack on the Japanese
troops at Mukden. Upon a consideration of all the facts
relating to the incident of 18th September, the Tribunal
unhesitatingly rejects this explanation and hold that
Kawakami had orders to take certain action in an emergency,
which would occur on the night of the 18th of September,
and was concerned since there was no provision for leaving
a train available at Fushun at night.
<p>
Upon receiving the report from Hayashi, Shidehara
called upon War Minister MINAMI and strongly protested
against the report. In the meantime, SHIGEMITSU was holding
conferences with Mr. T.V. Soong, who was Finance
Minister of the Republic of China, and they had agreed to
meet in Mukden on 20 September 1931, and confer with Marshal
Chang Hseuh-liang and Count Uchida, who was President
of the South Manchurian Railway Company, in an effort
to settle all outstanding differences between Japan and
the Marshal.

<center>
<h3>Night Maneuvers by the Kwantung Army</h3>
</center>

The Kwantung Army had begun carrying out night
maneuvers on 14 September 1931 in the vicinity of the
barracks of the 7th Chinese Brigade. These barracks
were located near the tracks of the South Manchurian
Railway, a short distance north of Mukden.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--547--</i></center><hr><a name=page548></a><p>
<blockquote>

The maneuvers involved vigorous rifle and machine-gun fire,
and the 10,000 men of the 7th Brigade had been confined to
barracks on orders of Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang in order to
avoid a clash between them and the Japanese. These maneuvers
continued up to and including the night of 18 September 1931.
<p>
Mr. Morishima, a member of the staff of the Consulate
who had been working with Hayashi in an attempt to settle
the Nakamura Incident, learned that the Kwantung Army Units
stationed at the important coal mining district of Fushun
would execute a maneuver which contemplated the occupation
of Mukden, leaving Fushun at about 11:30 p.m. on the night
of 18 September 1931.

<center>
<h3>Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang's Commission Returned to Mukden</h3>
</center>

Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang's Commission, which had been
investigating the Nakamura Incident, returned to Mukden on
the morning of 16 September 1931. The Japanese Consul-General
called upon General Yung Chen, the Chinese Chief of
Staff, on the afternoon of 18 September 1931, and the latter
stated that Commander Kuan Yuheng had been brought to Mukden
on 16 September 1931, charged with the responsibility for
the murder of Captain Nakamura and would be immediately
tried by a court-martial. It appeared that the case would
be settled. However, the conference between the Consul and
General Yung was adjourned at about 8 p.m., because it was
felt that since a member of the Military was involved, it
would be necessary to confer with appropriate representatives
of the Kwantung Army before any further representations
could be made to the Chinese officials.
<p>
Mr. Morishima, of the Consulate, was detailed to arrange
for the attendance of appropriate military representatives
at a further conference, which was to be held later in the

evening. He endeavored to contact Colonel DOHIHARA, and
Major Hanaya; however, he was unable to locate either of
them or any other office of the Special Service Office,
although he sought them at their respective hotels, offices,
billets and other places which they frequented. He reported
this to the Consulate and retired to his quarters.

<center>
<h3>Minami's Emissary Went Astray</h3>
</center>

General Tatekawa of the Army General Staff arrived in
Mukden via the Antung-Mukden Railway at 1:00 p.m. on 18
September 1931. He had been sent to Manchuria to make an
inspection for the Army General Staff; and War Minister
MINAMI, acting on Foreign Minister Shidehara's protest
against the rumor that the army planned an "Incident" at
Mukden for the 18th, had instructed Tatekawa to stop that
plot. MINAMI's denial that he gave this order to Tatekawa
is disproved by the subsequent statements of MINAMI and by
other statements of Tatekawa. The Kwantung Army Commander
Honjo, who had just completed an inspection of his troops
and installations, was delivering an address to the 2nd
Division at Liaoyang when he received a telegram from his
Chief-of-Staff, Miyake, in Port Arthur, informing him of
Tatekawa's visit and suggesting that Staff Officer ITAGAKI
or Staff Officer Ishihara be detailed to meet Tatekawa and
escort him on his inspection tour.
<p>
Colonel ITAGAKI was detailed and proceeded form Liaoyang
to Mukden; and upon his arrival, went to the Shinyokan
Inn. DOHIHARA's assistant, Major Hanaya, of the Special
Service Office in Mukden, met General Tatekawa and escorted
him to join Colonel ITAGAKI at the Inn, where
Colonel ITAGAKI and he dined that evening.
According to ITAGAKI, General Tatekawa complained
that he had not been able to rest on his trip and

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--549--</i></center><hr><a name=page550></a><p>
<blockquote>

was not inclined to discuss business immediately, but did
state that the superiors were worrying about the careless
and unscrupulous conduct of the young officers. To this,
ITAGAKI replied that there was no need to worry about that,
and that he would hear the General at leisure the next day.
After dinner, ITAGAKI took his leave of General Tatekawa
and went to the Special Service Office, arriving there
about 9 p.m. General Tatekawa later told a friend that he
had no desire to interfere with any proposed "Incident" and
had allowed himself to be decoyed to the Inn, where he was
entertained by geisha girls while he listened to the
sound of firing in the distance and later retired and slept
soundly until called in the morning.

<center>
<h3>The Mukden Incident</h3>
</center>

At 9 o'clock in the evening of 18 September 1931,
Officer Liu, at the barracks of the 7th Chinese Brigade,
reported that a train composed of three or four coaches,
but without the usual type of locomotive, had stopped on
the South Manchurian Railway opposite the barracks. At 10
p.m., the sound of a loud explosion was heard, immediately
followed by rifle fire. The Japanese account is that Lt.
Kawamoto, of the Kwantung Army, with six men under his command,
was on patrol duty, practising defence exercises
along the track near the place where the explosion occurred,
that he heard the explosion; that his patrol turned and
ran back about 200 yards and found that a portion of one of
the rails had been blown out; that while on the site of
the explosion, the patrol was fired upon from the
fields on the east side of the tracks; that at that
moment, the regular southbound train, due in Mukden
at 10:30 p.m., was heard approaching; and that the train

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--550--</i></center><hr><a name=page551></a><p>
<blockquote>

passed over the damaged rail without mishap to
arrive in Mukden on time. Captain Kawashima and
his company arrived at 10:50 p.m. and the Battalion
Commander Lieutenant Colonel Shimamoto commanding
the Second Battalion of the Independent Infantry
Garrison ordered two more companies to proceed
to the spot. They arrived about midnight.
Another company at Fushun, which was an hour-and-a-half
away, was ordered to proceed to the spot
also. This is the Company of Kawakami, who had
long ago announced that he and his Company would
have to leave Fushun on the night of the 18th.
The barracks of the 7th Chinese Brigade were
glittering with electric lights, but the Japanese
attacked the barracks without hesitation at 11:30
p.m., employing artillery as well as rifles and
machine-guns. Most of the Chinese soldiers
escaped from the barracks and retreated to
Erhtaitze, to the northeast; however, the Japanese
claim they buried 320 Chinese soldiers and captured
20 wounded. The loss to the Japanese
was two privates killed and 22 wounded. Colonel
Hirata commanding the 29th Regiment received a
telephone message at 10:40 p.m. from Lt. Colonel
Shimamoto informing him of the explosion on the
railroad and the plan to attack the barracks.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--551--</i></center><hr><a name=page551-A></a><p>
<blockquote>

Colonel Hirata immediately decided to attack
the walled city of Mukden. His attack commenced
at 11:30 p.m. No resistance was offered, the only
fighting that occurred was with the police, of
whom approximately 75 were killed. The 2nd
Division and part of the 16th Regiment left
Liaoyang at 3:30 a.m. of the 19th and arrived at
Mukden at 5 a.m. The arsenal and aerodrome were
captured at 7:30 a.m. Colonel ITAGAKI later
admitted that heavy guns, which had been secretly
installed in the Japanese Infantry Compound on
the 10th, had proven useful in the bombardment
of the airfield after the fighting got under
way. After ITAGAKI took leave of General
Tatakawa, he went to the Special Service Office.
There, according to him, he was informed by
Colonel Shimamoto of his decision to
attack the barracks of the 7th
Chinese Brigade and by Colonel Hirata of his

<p><center><i>--551-A--</i></center><hr><a name=page552></a><p>

decision to attack the walled city of Mukden. ITAGAKI says
that he accepted their decisions and took steps to report
to the Commander-in-Chief at Port Arthur.

<center>
<h3>Itagaki Refused to Negotiate</h3>
</center>

In the meantime, at 10:30 o'clock in the evening of 18
September 1931, Mr. Morishima of the Japanese Consulate,
received a telephone call from the Army Special Service Office
in Mukden advising him that an explosion had occurred
on the South Manchurian Railway and that he should report
to the Special Service Headquarters in Mukden. He arrived
at 10:45 and found ITAGAKI and Major Kanaya and some others
there. ITAGAKI stated that the Chinese had exploded the
railroad, that Japan must take appropriate military action,
and that orders had been issued to that effect. Mr. Morishima
tried to persuade ITAGAKI that they should rely upon
peaceful negotiations to adjust the matter. ITAGAKI then
reprimanded him and wanted to know if the office of the
Consul-General intended to interfere with the right of
military command. Mr. Morishima insisted that he was certain
the matter could be adjusted amicably through normal
negotiations. At that point, Major Hanaya unsheathed his
sword in an angry gesture and stated that if Morishima insisted,
he should be prepared to suffer the consequences.
Hanaya also stated that he would kill anyone who endeavored
to interfere. That broke up the conference.
<P>
The Japanese Consulate received many requests during
the night from the Supreme Advisor for Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang
imploring the office of the Consul-General to persuade
the Japanese Army to cease attacks. All these representations
were communicated to the military, but to no avail, and
the fighting continued. The Consul-General talked over the

<p><center><i>--552--</i></center><hr><a name=page553></a><p>
<blockquote>

telephone a number of times during the night of the 18th
and morning of the 19th with Colonel ITAGAKI in an effort
to persuade him to cease the fighting, but Colonel ITAGAKI
remained defiant and consistently informed the Consul-General
that he should cease interference with the
right of military command. Consul-General Hayashi on
the morning of 19 September 1931 cabled Foreign Minister
Shidehara, "In view of the fact that it was proposed
several times from the Chinese side that this matter be
settled in a peaceful way, I 'phoned to Staff Officer
ITAGAKI and said that since Japan and China had not yet
formally entered into a state of war and that, moreover,
as China had declared that she would act upon the non-resistance
principle absolutely, it was necessary for
us at this time to endeavor to prevent the aggravation
fo the 'Incident' unnecessarily, and I urged that the
matter be handled through diplomatic channels, but the
above mentioned Staff Officer answered that since this
matter concerned the prestige of the State and the Army,
it was the Army's intention to see it through thoroughly."

<center>
<h3>The Mukden Incident Was Planned</h3>
</center>

The evidence is abundant and convincing that the
Mukden Incident" was carefully planned beforehand by
officers of the Army General Staff, officers of the
Kwantung Army, members of the Cherry Society,
and others. Several of the Participators in the
plan, including HASHIMOTO, have on various occasions
admitted their part in the plot and have stated
that the object of the "Incident" was to afford an
excuse for the occupation of Manchuria by the Kwantung
Army, and the establishment of a new State there based on
the "Kingly Way" and subservient to Japan. In Japan,

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--553--</i></center><hr><a name=page554></a><p>
<blockquote>

General Tatekawa of the Army General Staff was the leader.
This was the same Tatekawa whom MINAMI, on Shidehara's
complaint, sent to Mukden to stop the plot, the same
Tatekawa who had no desire to interfere with any proposed
incident. In Manchuria, ITAGAKI was the principal
figure. The case which has been presented to the Tribunal
as a general defence of the actions of the Japanese on
the night of 18th September and as a particular defence
of those who, like ITAGAKI, were in action on that night
is this: it is said that previous to that night, Chinese
troops in Manchuria had increased so that the Japanese
troops in Manchuria, who numbered only some 10,000 men,
then faced a hostile army which numbered some 200,000
men and was superior in equipment to the Japanese; it
is said that the disposition of the Chinese troops had
recently been changed so that the japanese troops,
widely dispersed in groups along the railway line, faced
concentrations which threatened their annihilation; it
is said that the behaviour of the Chinese troops towards
the Japanese troops was provocative and insulting; it
is said that all indications pointed to an unprovoked
attack by the Chinese troops upon the Japanese troops,
in which the latter would be overwhelmed, unless decisive
counter-action was promptly taken. Therefore,
it is said, a plan was drawn up whereby, if the Chinese
attacked, the Kwantung Army would concentrate its main
forces in the vicinity of Mukden and deliver a heavy
blow to the nucleus of the Chinese forces in the vicinity
of Mukden, and thus by sealing the fate of the
enemy, would settle the matter within a short period.
It was a part of this plan that two heavy guns should be
secretly set up in the Mukden Independent Garrison Barracks.
Such is the testimony of ITAGAKI. When therefore,
says ITAGAKI, he heard on the night of 18th September of

the blowing up of the railway and the fighting outside the
Chinese Barracks, it was apparent that this was a planned
challenge on the part of the Chinese Regular Army against
the Japanese Army and he approved of the decisions to attack
the Chinese Barracks and the walled city of Mukden, because
it was absolutely necessary and in line with the plan of
operations of the Army drawn up in case of emergency.
<P>
The picture thus painted is that of a planned attack by
the Chinese Army, overwhelmingly superior in numbers, upon
some 1500 Japanese troops in the vicinity of Mukden; of a
surprise attack upon an unanticipated occasion; and of a
swift counter-attack by the Japanese troops at the nucleus
of the superior forces, whereby they were routed. The picture
is false save in the one particular, that Mukden was
captured and the Chinese troops driven away.
<P>
The Chinese troops had no plan to attack the Japanese.
They were caught unprepared. In the attack on the Barracks,
where there were thousands of Chinese troops, the Japanese
fired form the darkness upon the brightly lit Barracks and
met with trifling resistance, mainly from some Chinese
troops who were cut off in their attempt to escape. In
their capture of the city of Mukden, they met only negligible
resistance on the part of some police.
<P>
There is no question of the Japanese being surprised by
the events of that night. For some time before 18 September
1931, rumors were current in Japan that the Army was planning
an "Incident" in Mukden. Lieutenant Kawakami at Fushun
had revealed that an "event" might occur in Mukden on 18
September 1931. Consul-General Hayashi had telegraphed to
the Foreign Minister the news that the Company Commander
of a Japanese Unit at Fushun had said that within a week a
big "Incident" would break out. Morishima, a member of the
staff of the Japanese Consulate at Mukden, had learned that

<p><center><i>--555--</i></center><hr><a name=page556></a><p>
<blockquote>

Kwantung Army units stationed at Fushun would execute a
manoeuvre which contemplated the occupation of Mukden,
leaving Fushun about 11:30 on the night of 18 September
1931. The Foreign Minister attached so much credence to
the information he had that he complained to the War
Minister and persuaded the latter to dispatch General
Tatekawa to Manchuria to "stop the plot", a General who,
having non desire to interfere with any proposed
:incident" failed to fulfill his mission. And when, as
the Japanese allege, a patrol of a Lieutenant and six
men was fired on in the dark of the night of 18 September
1931, all the Japanese forces in Manchuria were brought
into action almost simultaneously on that night over
the whole area of the South Manchuria Railway from
Changchun to Port Arthur, a distance of approximately
400 miles. The Chinese troops at Antung, Yingkow,
Liaoyang and other smaller towns were overcome and disarmed
without resistance. The Japanese Railway Guards
and gendarmerie remained in these places and the units
of the 2nd Division at once concentrated at Mukden to
take part in the more serious operations. ITAGAKI was
at the Special Service Office at Mukden to approve the
initial attacks by the Japanese, and to resist all efforts
by the Japanese Consul-General Hayashi and the Japanese
Consul Morishima to persuade him to stop the fighting,
notwithstanding that the Consul-General informed him
that China had declared that she would act on the
principle of non-resistance. Even among the Japanese
there were those who believed that the "Incident" was
planned by the Japanese. A year after it happened, we
find the Emperor inquiring if the "Incident" was the
result of a Japanese plot, as rumored. The Tribunal
rejects the Japanese contention and holds that the
so-called "Incident" of 18 September 1931 was planned
and executed by the Japanese.

Preparation for war in China was not confined to the
Kwantung Army. In Japan, an unusual shift of personnel
occurred on 1 August 1931 as if in anticipation of coming
events. Such trusted officers as OSHIMA, KOISO, MUTO,
UMEZU, HATA and ARAKI, were included in this personnel
shift. OSHIMA was appointed a Chief of Section in the
army General Staff, a Member of the Military Technical
Council, and Liaison Officer to the Navy General Staff;
KOISO was appointed a Lt. General; MUTO was relieved as an
instructor in Strategy at the Military Staff College and

<h3>General Honjo Assumed Command at Mukden</h3>
</center>

Colonel ITAGAKI, who, as senior staff officer on the
spot, had been in active command at Mukden during the
"Incident", was relieved by General Honjo, who arrived
at Mukden at noon on 19 September 1931 and rapidly
expanded the "Mukden Incident" into what came to be known
as the "Manchurian Incident".
<p>
Honjo had returned to Port Arthur, after delivering
his address to the 2nd Division, the Division which
attacked Mukden, arriving at Port Arthur about 9 p.m. on
18 September 1931. Honjo had received the first news of
the fighting at Mukden at about 11 p.m. from a newspaper
agency. He immediately went to Kwantung Army Headquarters
in Port Arthur, where he issued orders that action should
follow the operational plans already established. It is

stated in evidence that a few minutes after midnight on
the 18th, a second telegram form the Special Service Office
at Mukden was received at the Kwantung Army Headquarters
reporting that the fighting had become more widespread
and that the Chinese forces were bringing up reinforcements.
if a telegram to this effect was received, there
was no basis in fact for the statement that the Chinese
forces were bringing up reinforcements. They were in full
retreat from the Japanese attack. Honjo's staff advised
that he should "mobilize the whole of the Japanese military
might to seal the fate of the enemy in the shortest
possible time". Honjo replied, "Yes, let it be done".
Orders were immediately issued bringing into action all
Japanese forces in Manchuria; the Japanese Garrison Army
in Korea was asked to send reinforcements in accordance
with the pre-arranged plan; and the Second Overseas Fleet
was requested to sail for Yingkow. Under these orders,
all the Japanese forces in Manchuria, and some of those
in Korea, were brought into action almost simultaneously
on the night of 18 September 1931 over the whole are of
the South Manchurian Railway from Changchun to Port Arthur.
<p>
Upon arriving at Mukden, General Honjo set up a
command post at the railway station and declared to the
world his intention to wage a punitive war.

<h3>Minami Sanctioned the Kwantung Army Action</h3>
</center>

War Minister MINAMI sanctioned the action of the
Kwantung Army and acted as a buffer between that Army
and the Cabinet to prevent effective interference by the
Government. He received information of the situation at
Mukden in a telegram from the Special Service Office there
at about 3 a.m. on 19 September 1931. Premier Wakatsuki
first heard of the fighting when he received a telephone

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--558--</i></center><hr><a name=page559></a><p>
<blockquote>

call from MINAMI sometime between 6 and 7 o'clock on the
morning of 19 September 1931. The Premier called a meeting
of the Cabinet for 10 a.m. MINAMI sent Lt. General KOISO,
who was Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau of the War
Ministry, to act as Liaison Officer between the Army
General Staff and the Cabinet. At the Cabinet meeting,
MINAMI reported that the Chinese troops had fired on the
Japanese troops at Mukden and that their fire had been
returned. He characterized the action of the Japanese as
"an act of righteous self-defense". The Cabinet expressed
a desire that the affair be terminated at once. MINAMI
stated that he would investigate and report to the Cabinet.
The Cabinet then resolved upon a policy of non-expansion
of the "Incident". THe Premier called upon the Emperor at
1:30 o'clock that afternoon and informed him of the
situation and the decision of the Cabinet. The Emperor
agreed that the Army should not try to enlarge the situation,
but should stop further action as soon as it found itself
in an advantageous position. MINAMI dispatched Lt. Colonel
HASHIMOTO and two other officers of the Army General Staff
to Mukden for the announced purpose of communicating to the
Kwantung Army Commander the decision of the Government to
prevent the expansion of the "Incident".
<p>
The Army was not to be controlled; and the Premier
cast about desperately, but without success, for assistance
in enforcing this policy of non-expansion of the
"Incident". In an effort to find a way to control the
Army, the Premier held a meeting at 8:30 of the evening
of 19 September 1931 at the official residence of the
Minister of the Imperial Household; Senior Statesman
Prince Saionji's Secretary, Baron Harada, Chief Secretary
to the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal KIDO, the Grand
Chamberlain, the Vice-Grand Chamberlain, and the Military

<blockquote>

Aide-de-Camp to His Majesty, among others, were present.
The only suggestion came from KIDO, who proposed daily
meetings of the Cabinet. This suggestion proved to be
of no effect, since War Minister MINAMI reported at
each of these meetings that for "strategic and tactical"
considerations, it had been necessary for the Japanese
forces to pursue the Chinese troops a certain distance
further into Chinese territory, but that such action
was only "protective" and would in no sense be expanded.
However, at this very time, the Chinese had proposed
through Minister T.V. Soong that a powerful commission
be organized, consisting of both Japanese and Chinese,
in an effort to prevent further expansion of the conflict.
SHIGEMITSU, in reporting this proposal to
Foreign Minister SHidehara suggested that it be
accepted, if for no other reason than to strengthen
the position of the Japanese in regard to the "Incident".
Although Imperial Sanction was required under existing
regulations for the Korean Army to commence operations
outside Korea, the 39th Mixed Brigade of the 20th Division,
consisting of 4,000 men and artillery, which had
concentrated at Shingishu on the Korean frontier,
crossed the Yalu River into Manchuria on 21 September
1931, and arrived at Mukden around midnight of the same
day, without having received the Imperial Sanction;
nevertheless, the Cabinet decided on 22 September 1931
that the expenses incurred in this move should be
defrayed, and later the Imperial Sanction for this move

was obtained. This had not been reported to the Cabinet
by MINAMI. At the Cabinet meeting of 22 September 1931,
MINAMI made further excuses for allowing the Army to
continue its aggression. As Premier Wakatsuki says:
"Day after day expansion continued; and I had various
conference with War Minister MINAMI. I was shown
maps daily on which MINAMI would show by a line a
boundary which the Army would not go beyond, and
almost daily this boundary was ignored and further
expansion reported, but always with assurances that
this was the final move".

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--561--</i></center><hr><a name=page562></a><p>
<blockquote>

KIDO recorded in his diary, that during a discussion
by a group at the residence of Baron Harada, it was mentioned
that although the Emperor had approved the Cabinet's
policy of non-expansion, the Army had been indignant
that the Emperor had been induced by his personal
attendants to form such an opinion. It was decided by
this group that the Emperor had better say no more about
the Cabinet's policy; and that Elder Statesman Prince
Saionji had better remain out of Tokyo to avoid intensifying
the antipathy held for him by the Military Clique.
In this manner, MINAMI's effective cooperation with the
Army General Staff, through his Liaison Officer KOISO,
prevented the Government from enforcing its decision to
halt further expansion of the "Mukden Incident". This
is confirmed by an admission made by MINAMI after the
surrender that he had been in favor of the action taken
by the Kwantung Army.

<h3>Colonel Dohihara Returned to Mukden</h3>
</center>

Colonel DOHIHARA had completed his report to the
Army General Staff, recommended the solution of all
pending "Manchurian Questions" by the use of force as
soon as possible, and was on his way back to his Special
Service Office in Mukden to play the principal role in the
organization of the new State in Manchuria based on the
"Kingly Way", when the "Incident" occurred there.
DOHIHARA's extensive knowledge of China and its people,
gained over some eighteen years spent in active participation
in local politics as a Military Aide under
successive Chinese military leaders, qualified him
more than any other Japanese Army officer to act as
over-all advisor and coordinator in the planning, execution
and exploitation of the "Mukden Incident".

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--562--</i></center><hr><a name=page563></a><p>
<blockquote>

There can be no doubt that such was the part played by
DOHIHARA. His reconnaissance trip through China, with
a brief pause in Mukden before reporting to the Army
General Staff, and his return to Mukden on the eve of
the "Incident", together with his actions thereafter,
leave us with no other conclusion.

<center>
<h3>Colonel Dohihara as Mayor of Mukden</h3>
</center>

The organization of a provincial government for
Liaoning Province had proven to be a difficult one,
because Mukden was the center of the Province, and
during the fighting, most of the influential Chinese
had fled to Chinchow where they were continuing to
carry on the provincial administration. Chinese General
Tsanh Shih-yi, who was Governor of the Province and had
remained in Mukden, refused to cooperate with the Japanese
in the organization of a new provincial government;
for this, he was immediately arrested and confined in
prison. Being thus hindered by lack of cooperation
from the Chinese, the Japanese Army issued a proclamation
on 21 September 1931 installing Colonel DOHIHARA as
Mayor of Mukden; he proceeded to rule the city with
the aid of a so-called "Emergency Committee" composed
mostly of Japanese. By 23 September 1931, DOHIHARA had
made himself complete master of the city and was found
by visiting journalists in the Japanese Army Headquarters,
where he was acting as political representative
and spokesman for the Army. From this point on, the
organization of provisional governments for the three
Eastern Provinces made headway. On 23 September 1931,
Lt. General Hsi Hsia was invited to form a provisional
government for Kirin Province, and the next day, it

<p><center><i>--563--</i></center><hr><a name=page564></a><p>
<blockquote>

was announced that a provisional government had been
formed for Liaoning Province with Mr. Yuan Chin-hai
as Chairman of the "Committee for the Maintenance of
Peace and Order". THe Japanese Press hailed this
as the first step in a separatist movement.

<h3>Self-Government Guiding Board</h3>
</center>

The Self-Government GUiding Board was organized
by the Japanese Army in Mukden during the last half of
September 1931. The purpose of the Board was to start
an independence movement and spread it throughout Manchuria.
Colonel ITAGAKI was in charge of the Staff Section
having supervision over the Board; and Colonel
DOHIHARA, as head of the Special Service Office, supplied
the Board with all necessary confidential information
regarding the Chinese. Although the Chairman of
the Board was Chinese, approximately 90 per cent of the
personnel employed by the Board were Japanese residents
in Manchuria.
<p>
General Hsi Hsia accepted the Japanese invitation,
called a meeting of government organization and Japanese
advisors, and on 30 September issued a proclamation establishing
a provisional government for Kirin Province
under protection of the Japanese Army.
<p>
General Chang Ching-hui, Administrator of the
Special District, also called a conference in his office
at Harbin on 27 September 1931 to discuss the organization
of an "Emergency Committee of the Special District".
<p>
General Honjo took advantage of some minor disturbances
in the town of Chientao, in Kirin Province, to
announced that Japan would no longer recognize the government
of Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang and would not cease
operations until his power was completely broken.

<center>
<h3>Protests and Assurances</h3>
</center>

China lodged a protest with the League of Nations
against the action of Japan in Manchuria. The protest
was filed on 23 September 1931. The Council of the League
was assured by the Japanese Government that Japan had
started withdrawing her troops to the railroad zone and would

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--565--</i></center><hr><a name=page566></a><p>
<blockquote>

continue the withdrawal; upon this assurance, the
Council adjourned to meet again on 14 October 1931.
<p>
The United States of America also protested
against the fighting in Manchuria, and on 24 September
1931 called the attention of both Japan and China to
the provisions of the existing treaties. After a
Cabinet meeting that day, the Japanese Ambassador
in Washington delivered to the Secretary of State
of the United States a Note in which it was stated
among other things, "It may be superfluous to repeat
that the Japanese Government harbors no territorial
designs in Manchuria".

<h3>The October Incident</h3>
</center>

These assurances given to the League and to
the United States indicated that the Cabinet and the
Army did not agree upon a common policy in Manchuria.
It was this disagreement which caused the so-called
"October Incident". This was an attempt on the part
of certain officers of the Army General Staff and their
sympathizers to organize a coup d'etat to overthrow
the Government, destroy the political party system, and
establish a new Government which would support the
Army's plan for the occupation and exploitation of
Manchuria. The plot centered around the Cherry Society;
and the plan was to "cleanse the ideological and political
atmosphere" by assassinating the government leaders.
HASHIMOTO was the leader of the group and gave the
necessary orders for the execution of the scheme.
HASHIMOTO admitted that he originated the plot in early
October 1931 to bring about a Government headed by
ARAKI. KIDO was well informed of the proposed rebellion
and his only concern seems to have been to find a way
to limit the disorders to as to prevent widespread
damage and sacrifices. However, a certain Lt. Colonel
Nemoto informed the Police of the plot, and War Minister
MINAMI ordered the leaders arrested, thereby breaking
up the plot. SHIRATORI criticized MINAMI for opposing
the coup and declared that it was necessary to take
prompt acton so as to create a new regime in Manchuria;
and that if MINAMI had given his tacit approval to the
scheme, it would have facilitated a solution of the
"Manchurian Problem".

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--567--</i></center><hr><a name=page568></a><p>
<blockquote>

After the failure of the "October Incident",
rumors were heard to the effect that if the Central
Authorities in Tokyo did not support the Kwantung Army
in the execution of its plan to occupy all Manchuria
and establish a puppet State there, that Army would
declared itself independent of Japan and proceed with
the project. This threat appears to have been effective
in producing a change in the Government and its attitude.
<p>
The War Ministry began censoring the news; and
army officers called upon writers and editors, who
wrote or published anything unsatisfactory to the War
Ministry, and advised them that such writings were displeasing
to the War Ministry. Violent organizations
threatened editors and writers when they expressed
views contrary to that of the War Ministry.

<center>
<h3>Decision to Enthrone Pu Yi</h3>
</center>

After this change of attitude by the Japanese
Government, Colonel ITAGAKI and Colonel DOHIHARA
decided to return Henry Pu Yi, the deposed Emperor of
China, and enthrone him as emperor of Manchuria as an
emergency measure to combat the influence of Marshal
Chang Hseuh-liang, which was growing progressively
stronger with the unity between the Young Marshal and
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The new provisional
government operating under the protection of the
Japanese Army had succeeded in taking over all tax
collection and finance institutions and had further
strengthened its position by reorganization, but it was
having considerably difficulty due to the Marshal's
continued popularity. The Kwantung Army General Staff
became fearful that the provisional government set up

<p><center><i>--568--</i></center><hr><a name=page569></a><p>
<blockquote>

by them would conspire with the Marshal; therefore,
it was decided by Colonels ITAGAKI and DOHIHARA to
proceed at once with the organization of an independent
State by uniting the Three Eastern Provinces of
Heilungkiang, Kirin and Liaoning under the nominal
leadership of Henry Pu Yi, the dethroned Emperor of China.

<center>
<h3>Colonel Dohihara Proceeds to Return Pu Yi</h3>
</center>

DOHIHARA was dispatched by ITAGAKI to Tientsin
to return Pu Yi to Manchuria. ITAGAKI made all necessary
arrangements and gave DOHIHARA definite
instructions. The plan was to pretend that Pu Yi had
returned to resume his throne in answer to a popular
demand of the people of Manchuria, and that Japan had
nothing to do with his return, but would do nothing to
oppose the popular demand of the people. In order to
carry out this plan, it was necessary to land Pu Yi at
Yinkgow before that port became frozen; therefore, it
was imperative that he arrive there before 16 November 1931.
<p>
Foreign Minister Shidehara had learned of the
scheme to return Pu Yi to Manchuria and had instructed
his Consul-General at Tientsin to oppose the plan. On
the afternoon of 1 November 1931, the Consul-General
contacted DOHIHARA as instructed and tried every means
at his disposal to persuade him to abandon the plan,
but DOHIHARA was determined and stated that if the
Emperor was willing to risk his life by returning to
Manchuria, it would be easy to make the whole affair
appear to be instigated by the Chinese; he further
stated that he would confer with the Emperor; and if

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--569--</i></center><hr><a name=page570></a><p>
<blockquote>

the Emperor was willing, he would go through with the
scheme; but if the Emperor was not willing, then he
would leave with a parting remark that there would be
no such opportunity in the future for the Emperor, and
dispatch a telegram to the military authorities at Mukden
to the effect that he would consider an alternative as
the present plan was hopeless of success.
<p>
During the evening of 2 November 1931, DOHIHARA
visited Pu Yi and informed him as follows: Conditions
were favorable for Pu Yi's enthronement and the opportunity
should not be missed. He should make an appearance
in Manchuria by all means before 16 November
1931. If he did so appear, Japan would recognize him
as Emperor of an independent State and conclude a
secrete defensive and offensive alliance with the new
State. If the Chinese Nationalist Armies should attack
the new State, Japan's armies would crush them. Pu Yi
appeared willing to follow DOHIHARA' advice upon being
told that the Japanese Imperial Household favored his
restoration to the Throne.
<p>
The Consul-General continued his efforts to
dissuade DOHIHARA, but without results. On one occasion,
DOHIHARA threatened that it would be outrageous for
the Government to take the attitude of preventing Pb
Yi's return; and that if this should occur, the
Kwantung Army might separate from the Government and
no one could say what action it might take.
<p>
Some difficulty was encountered by DOHIHARA
in arranging the terms upon which Pu Yi was to return;
and a Chinese newspaper in Shanghai, under a Tientsin
date line fro 2 November 1931,

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--570--</i></center><hr><a name=page571></a><p>
<blockquote>

published a complete account of the scheme and alleged
that Pu Yi had refused DOHIHARA's offer. To hasten PU
Yi's decision, DOHIHARA resorted to all kinds of schemes
and intrigues. Pu Yi received a bomb concealed in a
basket of fruit; he also received threatening letters
from the "Headquarters of the Iron Blood Group", as well
as form others. DOHIHARA finally caused a riot to occur
in Tientsin on 8 November 1931 with the assistance of
certain underworld characters, secret societies and
rogues of the city, whom he supplied with arms furnished
by ITAGAKI. The Japanese Consul-General, in a
further attempt to carry out Shidehara's orders, warned
the Chinese Police of the impending riot; being
forewarned, they were able to prevent the riot from
being a complete success; but it served th throw
Tientsin into disorder.
<p>
This disorder continued, and during the riot on
the night of 10 November 1931, DOHIHARA secretly removed
Pu Yi from his residence to the pier in a motor
car guarded by a party equipped with machine-guns,
entered a small Japanese military launch with a few
plain-clothes men and four or five armed Japanese
soldiers and headed down the river to Tang-ku. At
Tang-ku, the party boarded the ship <i>Awaji Maru</i>
bound for Yingkow. Pu Yi arrived at Yingkow on 13
November 1931, and on the same day was taken to Tang-Kang-tzu,
where he was held in protective custody in
the Hotel Tai Sui Haku by the Japanese Army. An attempt
was made to cause it to appear that Pu Yi had
fled for his life as a result of threats and the riots
in Tientsin. No doubt, these served to hasten Pu Yi's
agreement with the terms offered by DOHIHARA.

<h3>Enthronement of Pu Yi Delayed</h3>
</center>

In an effort to prevent further aggravation of
Japan's position in the League and keep Japan's Representative
in a favorable position before the Council
during its deliberations, MINAMI advised the Kwantung
Army to delay the enthronement of Pu Yi. On 15 November
1931, he sent a telegram to General Honjo in which he
said: "Especially, to commit such hasty actions when
we have just begun to see the signs of favorable results
of our efforts to improve the atmosphere of the League
of Nations is by no means a wise policy. Therefore, for
the time being, we would like to have you lead the general
public in such a way so as not have Pu Yi connected in any
way, whether it be active or passive, with political problems.
Naturally, in establishing a new regime, if our
Empire takes the wrong attitude we must expect either an
intervention by the United States based upon the Nine-Power
Treaty or a council of the World Powers. Moreover,
under the present conditions in Manchuria, it is an internationally
recognized fact that an establishment of the
new regime would not be possible without the understanding
and support of the Imperial Army. Therefore, when Pu Yi
unexpectedly enters into the picture of the establishment
of the new regime, and even if it is ostensibly performed
according to the wishes of the people, there would be
fear of arousing world suspicion. it is essential that
our Empire lead world situations so that we can at least
and at any time conduct a legal argument against
the Powers. I would like to have you keep this point in mind".
<p>
The Army moved Pu Yi on 20 November 1931 to
Port Arthur and installed him in the Yamato Hotel with

explanation that he was receiving too many undesirable

secretly for the Emperor's wife to join him at
Port Arthur.

the northeast upon Heilun during the first half of
November 1931, had also resulted in the occupation of
Taitsihar, and the elimination of Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang's
authority from all of Manchuria, except for a
fragment of Southeast Liaoning Province surrounding the
city of Chinchow. The occupation of Chinchow was all
that remained to make the subjugation of Manchuria complete.
<p>
The Chinese provincial Government, which had
fled from Mukden, had established itself in Chinchow
soon after the Mukden Incident, and Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang
had moved his headquarters from Peiping to Chinchow
in the early days of October 1931, so that the City had
become the center of opposition to the Japanese occupation.
Japanese observation planes made frequent
flights over the city; and on 8 November 1931, six scouting
and five bombing planes flew over the city and dropped
some eighty bombs.
<p>
The disturbances and riots organized by Colonel
DOHIHARA gave the staff officers of the Kwantung Army
an excuse to send troops to tientsin to reinforce the
Japanese Garrison and protect the Japanese Concession

there. The first of these riots occurred on 8 November
1931 as heretofore related; but on 26 November 1931,
a new series of disorders began. Colonel DOHIHARA
had employed Chinese ruffians and Japanese plain-clothes
men and formed them into operating gangs within the
Japanese Concession in order to start trouble in the
Chinese section of Tientsin. On the evening of the 26th,
a terrific explosion was heard, immediately followed by
firing of cannon, machine-guns and rifles. The electric
lights in the Japanese Concession were put out, and plain-clothes
men emerged from the Concession firing upon the
police station in the vicinity.
<p>
The most practical route for reinforcements to
take in moving from Manchuria to tientsin would have
been by sea; but the route by land had distinct strategical
advantages as it lay through the city of Chinchow;
and any movement through Chinchow would afford an excuse
for making an attack upon that city, eliminating the concentration
of Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang's Army there.
<p>
Neutral observers had expected an advance on
Chinchow; and on 23 November 1931, during a conference
on the subject, Foreign Minister Shidehara assured the
American Ambassador in tokyo that he, the Premier, the
Minister of War, MINAMI, and the Chief of the Army General
Staff had agreed that there would be no hostile
operations toward Chinchow. However, DOHIHARA's riot
on the night of the 26th precipitated such an advance
on the morning of 27 November 1931; and a troop train
and several airplanes crossed the Liao River, ostensibly
for the purpose of relieving the Japanese Garrison which
was alleged to be beleaguered at Tientsin, but actually
intending to drive Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang from Chinchow.

The Japanese met little or no resistance as
Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang had already begun withdrawal
of his troops south of the Great Wall in order to remove
all excuse for further advances by the Japanese.
Nevertheless, the advance proceeded, and Japanese planes
repeatedly bombed Chinchow. The American Secretary of
State protested the violation of the assurance so recently
given the American Ambassador that no hostile
action would be taken toward Chinchow; and on 29
November 1931, this assurance was reluctantly and belatedly
honored by the Chief of the Army General Staff
ordering Honjo to recall his troops to a position in
the vicinity of Hsinmin.

<h3>The League Appointed a Commission of Inquiry</h3>
</center>

The Council of the League of Nations had been in
session for approximately four weeks considering the dispute
between Japan and China, when it resolved on 18
December 1931 to accept the suggestion of the Japanese
Representative and send a Commission of Inquiry to Manchuria
to make a study of the situation "on the spot".
The Council's resolution provided that the Commission
should consist of five members from neutral countries with
the right of China and Japan to appoint one "Assessor"
each to assist the Commission.
<p>
Paragraph 2 of the resolution was in these terms:
"(2) Considering that events have assumed na even more
serious aspect since the Council meeting of October 24th,
notes that the two parties undertake to adopt all measures
necessary to avoid any further aggravation of the  situation
and to refrain from any initiative which may lead
to further fighting and loss of life."
<p>
Japan, in accepting the Resolution, made a reservation
concerning paragraph (2), stating that she accepted it
"On the understanding that this paragraph was not intended
to preclude the Japanese forces from taking such action
as might be rendered necessary to provide directly for the
protection of the lives and property of Japanese subjects
against the activities of bandits and lawless elements
rampant in various parts of Manchuria."
<p>
China accepted the Resolution with the reservation
that China's rights of sovereignty in Manchuria would not
be impaired.
<p>
With regard to the undertaking and injunction contained
in paragraph (2), quoted above, China stated "It must
be clearly pointed out that this injunction should not be
violated under the pretext of the existence of lawlessness
caused by a state of affairs which it is the very purpose

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--576--</i></center><hr><a name=page577></a><p>
<blockquote>

fo the resolution to do away with. It is to be observed
that much of the lawlessness now prevalent in Manchuria
is due to the interruption of normal life caused by the
invasion of the Japanese forces. The only sure way of
restoring the normal peaceful life is to hasten the withdrawal
of the Japanese troops and allow the Chinese authorities
to assume the responsibility for the maintenance of
peace and order. China cannot tolerate the invasion and
occupation of her territory by the troops of any foreign
country; far less can she permit these troops to usurp
the police functions of the Chinese authorities."
<p>
Despite this counter-reservation of China, the Japanese
maintained that their reservation gave Japan the right
to maintain her troops in Manchuria and made her responsible
for the suppression of banditry. Under the pretext
of suppressing banditry, Japan proceeded to complete the
conquest of Manchuria. In the words of the Lytton Commission,
"The fact remains that, having made their reservation
at Geneva, the Japanese continued to deal with the situation
in Manchuria according to their plans".
<p>
The membership of the Commission was not completely
made up until 14 January 1932. The Rt. Honorable, the
Earl of Lytton (British) was elected Chairman of the
Commission; and the Commission has come to be known as the
Lytton Commission.

<h3>The Wakatsuki Cabinet Was Forced to Resign</h3>
</center>

The continued efforts of Premier Wakatsuki and his
Foreign Minister Shidehara to enforce the "Friendship
Policy" and the "Policy of Non-Expansion" generated so
much opposition from the Military and their sympathizers
that the Cabinet was forced to resign on 12 December 1931.
Premier Wakatsuki testified as follows: "It is true that
in spite of the fact that the Cabinet had decided on the
policy of stopping the 'Manchurian Incident', it continued

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--577--</i></center><hr><a name=page578></a><p>
<blockquote>

to spread and expand. Various methods were tried, and
one of these was a coalition cabinet, which I hoped might
be able to stop the action of the Kwantung Army. However,
because of certain difficulties, this did not
materialize, and that is why my Cabinet resigned."

<center>
<h3>The Inukai Cabinet</h3>
</center>

The Inukai Cabinet was formed on 13 December 1931,
with ARAKI as Minister of War. The three Army Chiefs,
that, is: the outgoing War Minister, MINAMI, the Chief
of the General Staff, and the Inspector General of Military
Education, whose duty it was under the Japanese
Constitution to select the succeeding War Minister, had
selected General Abe to be War Minister; but ARAKI was
popular with the radical elements of the Army, and they
approached Inukai and demanded his appointment. General
ARAKI received the appointment. Although Premier Inukai
announced to Elder Statesman Prince Saionji that he intended
to carry out the Emperor's wish that Japanese
politics should not be controlled solely by the Army,
and although he adopted a policy to terminate the aggression
of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria, War Minister
ARAKI was not in accord with this policy. ARAKI favored
Commander Honjo's plan that the four Provinces formerly
under Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang should be occupied and
pacified. He admitted that this was so during an interrogation
at Sugamo Prison after the surrender. His first
act was to secure approval in the Cabinet and the privy
Council of an appropriation to carry out this scheme.

<h3>Honjo and Itagaki Moved to Execute Honjo's Plan</h3>
</center>

The formation of the Inukai Cabinet, with
ARAKI as War Minister and favorable to the Honjo plan to
occupy and pacify the four Provinces, was the signal to
the Kwantung Army to execute the plan. ITAGAKI moved
quickly to strengthen the provisional government of
Liaoning Province; a concentration of troops west of Mukden,
poised for a drive on Chinchow and Tientsin, was begun;
and ITAGAKI prepared to visit Tokyo to assist ARAKI
in making detailed arrangements for carrying out the plan.
<p>
General Tsang Shi-hi, who had been incarcerated
in prison on 21 September 1931 because of his refusal
to cooperate with the invading Japanese Army, was
starved into submission and forced to agree to accept
the appointment as Governor of the Provincial Government,
ad interim, of Liaoning Province. He was released form
prison on the night of 13 December 1931; and after an
interview with ITAGAKI, he was duly inaugurated as Governor
on 15 December 1931. He was in such a nervous, weakened
condition as a result of having been starved in
prison, that he fainted during his inauguration when a
photographer exploded a flash bulb in making his picture.
The inauguration of General tsang Shi-hi was in preparation
for a conference of all the Manchurian Provincial
Governors; and the Kwantung Army was hastening preparations
for the meeting.
<p>
The concentration of troops for the advance on
Chinchow had begun on the 10th; and by 15 December 1931,
it was complete. However, the advance could not begin
until approval of War Minister ARAKI had been obtained
and funds provided.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--579--</i></center><hr><a name=page580></a><p>
<blockquote>

All preparations being complete, Commander Honjo
dispatched ITAGAKI to Tokyo to convey to the Government
his opinion that Manchuria should be made independent
of China. War Minister ARAKI immediately supported
Honjo's plan and said that complete independence was
the only way in which the "Manchurian Incident" could
be solved, but considerable opposition to the plan was
found to exist, and he was not able to obtain approval
of the plan without difficulty. The question was finally
presented to the Throne at an Imperial Conference on 27
December 1q931, and ARAKI states: "We immediately decided
to send the troops to Fengtien Province. The principal
plan was made in the War Ministry's order to General
Headquarters, and they took the procedure of sending
troops for the operation." At least a part of ITAGAKI's
mission had bene accomplished.
<p>
On the very day that this decision to advance
against Chinchow was made, the Vice-Minister for Foreign
Affairs handed the American Ambassador in Tokyo a memorandum
in which it was stated that Japan was determined
to remain loyal to the Covenant of the League, the Kellogg-Briand
Pact, and other treaties, and would abide by
the two resolutions adopted by the Council of the
league regarding the Manchurian situation.

<center>
<h3>Manchuria Was Completely Occupied After the Capture of Chinchow</h3>
</center>

The Kwantung Army pointed to the reservation made
at Geneva, as already referred to, and continued to
deal with Manchuria according to plan. The Chinese
Minister for Foreign Affairs, knowing that the attack on

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--580--</i></center><hr><a name=page581></a><p>
<blockquote>

Chinchow was imminent, had made a last minute appeal to
prevent further fighting by offering to remove all remaining
Chinese troops south of the Great Wall, but nothing
came of this appear; and the Kwantung Army actually
began its movement on 23 December 1931. The Chinese
Army was forced to give up its position. From that day,
the advance continued with perfect regularity and hardly
met any resistance at all as the Chinese General had
ordered a retreat. Chinchow was occupied on the morning
of 3 January 1932; and the Kwantung Army continued its
advance right up to the Great Wall at Shanhaikwan.

<center>
<h3>Itagaki Completed His Mission and Returned to Mukden</h3>
</center>

KIDO records in his diary for  11 January 1932,
that ITAGAKI had obtained approval of the plan to set up
a puppet State in Manchuria; the entry is in part as
follows: "At 10:30 o'clock this morning in the antechamber
connected with the lecture hall of the Imperial
Palace, I, together with persons close to the Emperor,
heard from Colonel ITAGAKI the conditions in Manchuria
and Mongolia. Colonel ITAGAKI first explained the situation
concerning the progress of the campaign against
soldier bandits in Manchuria and Mongolia as well as
the progress in establishing a new State in Manchuria.
Colonel ITAGAKI gave hint that Manchuria would be placed
under a new ruler, and the Japanese Army would take charge
of the national defense of the new Manchurian State. He
further explained that Japanese people would participate
in the management of the new State as high government
officials." It will be noted that ITAGAKI followed the
usual practice of referring to all Chinese soldiers as

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--581--</i></center><hr><a name=page582></a><p>
<blockquote>

"bandits". The pretense of invoking the reservation
made at Geneva was again employed.
<p>
On his way back to Mukden, Colonel ITAGAKI called
upon the new ruler mentioned in his conversation
with KIDO. During his visit with Pu Yi at Port Arthur,
ITAGAKI stated to Pu Yi, "In order to get rid of Chinese
Militarists and secure social welfare for the people of
the Northeastern Provinces, we are willingly prepared
to put up a new political regime in Manchuria."
ITAGAKI proposed that Pu Yi should become the head of
the new regime; but demanded, that a soon as the Manchurian
Regime was set up, Japanese should be employed
as advisers and officials.

<h3>The Independence Movement Gained in Intensity</h3>
</center>

After the fall of Chinchow, the independence
movement made progress, especially in North Manchuria,
where DOHIHARA was on duty as Chief of the Special Services
in Harbin. After the Japanese occupied Tsitsihar
on 19 November 1931, and drove the forces of General Ma
toward Hailum, a Self-Government Association of the
usually type was established in Heilungkiang Province; and
General Chang Ching-hui was inaugurated as Governor of
the Province on 1 January 1932. General Chang Ching-hui,
upon learning of the complete defeat and expulsion of
Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang from Chinchow, acceded to the
requests of the Self-Government Guiding Board at Mukden
and declared the independence of Heilungkiang Province.
The declaration was issued on 7 January 1932. On the same
day, the Self-Government Guiding Board issued a Proclamation,
which it had prepared on 1 January, but had bene
holding until an opportune time for publication. The
Proclamation appealed to the people to overthrow Marshal
Chang Hsueh-liang and join the Self-Government Association.
The Proclamation ended with these words: "Organizations
of the Northeast, Unite!" Fifty thousand copies were
distributed. Mr. Yu Chung-han, the Chief of the Board,
and Governor Tsang Shih-yi, of Liaoning Province, were
making plans for a new State to be established in February.
This idea of independence from China had received
no popular support in Manchuria before the "Mukden Incident"
of 18 September 1931. It is apparent that it was
conceived, organized and carried through by a group of
Japanese civil and military officials, of whom Colonels

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--583--</i></center><hr><a name=page584></a><p>
<blockquote>

ITAGAKI and DOHIHARA were leaders. The presence of Japanese
troops to enforce their authority, the control of
the railways by the South Manchurian Railway, the presence
of Japanese Consuls in all of the important urban
centers, and the coordinating effect of the Japanese
controlled Self-Government Guiding Board, afforded the
group a means of exercising an irresistible pressure to
bring about this so-called independence, and later to
control the new puppet State. The independence movement
and the Chinese collaborators were sustained by Japanese
military might alone.

<center>
<h3>Additional Assurances by Japan</h3>
</center>

On 7 January 1932, the day that General Chang Ching-hui
proclaimed the independence of Heilungkiang Province,
the American Secretary of State instructed the American
Ambassador in Tokyo to deliver a Note to the Japanese
Government. The Secretary of State stated in that Note
that the Government of the United States deemed it a
duty to notify both Japan and China that it would not
admit the legality of any de facto situation nor recognize
any treaty or agreement entered into so as to impair
the treaty rights of the United States or its
citizens in China or violate the conventional policy of
the "Open Door" in China, or impair the obligations of
the Pact of Paris (<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-15 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-15</a>).
<p>
This Note was not answered until 16 January 1932.
The Japanese Note stated that Japan was aware that
the United States could be relied upon to do
everything to support Japan's efforts to secure
full and complete fulfillment of the treaties
of Washington and the Kellogg-Briand Pact
(Annex No. B-15). This Japanese Note went on to say that in

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--584--</i></center><hr><a name=page585></a><p>
<blockquote>

so far as Japan could secure it, the policy of the "Open
Door" in China would always be maintained. Having regard
to the Japanese military action in Manchuria, which we
have just described, this Japanese Note is a masterpiece
of hypocrisy.

<center>
<h3>Hashimoto Objected to This Assurance</h3>
</center>

The next day, HASHIMOTO published an article in
the <i>Taiyo Dai Nippon,</i> apparently in protest against this
policy of observing treaties and maintaining the "Open
Door" in China. The title of the article was, "The Reform
of Parliamentary Systems." In the article, HASHIMOTO
said; "Responsible government-Party Cabinet System-runs
absolutely counter to the Constitution. It is the
democratic government which ignores the 'Tenno' government,
* * * which has been established firmly since the
founding of our Empire, and which remains solemnly unshaken
in the Constitution granted by the Emperor. When
we consider their dangerous anti-national structure, political
ideology and their aggressive evils we believe it
most urgently necessary first of all to make a scapegoat
of the existing political parties and destroy them for the
sake of the construction of a cheerful new Japan."

<center>
<h3>Dohihara Negotiated With General Ma Chan-shan</h3>
</center>

After General Ma had been driven from Tsitsihar
by the Japanese and had set up his capital at Hailun, from
which he was attempting to govern Heilungkiang, Colonel
DOHIHARA began carrying on negotiations with the General
form his Special Service Office at Harbin. The General's
position was somewhat ambiguous; although he continued negotiating
with DOHIHARA, he continued to support General Ting
Chao. General Ting Chao had never approved of the puppet

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--585--</i></center><hr><a name=page586></a><p>
<blockquote>

government set up in Kirin Province by the Kwantung Army
under the nominal leadership of General Hsi Hsia, and had
organized an army to oppose General Hsi Hsia. Not only
did General Ma continue to support General Ting Chao,
but these two Generals maintained some contact with
Marshal Chang Hseuh-liang and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,
who gave them assistance.
<p>
In an effort to force General Ma to terms,
Colonel DOHIHARA requested General Hsi Hsia to advance on
Harbin and drive in the direction of Hailun. General Hsi
Hsia, at the beginning of January 1932, prepared an expedition
to the North with a view to occupying Harbin. General
Ting Chao was between him and Harbin. General Hsi Hsia
advanced to Shuangchong on 25 January; but Marshal Chang
Hsueh-liang instructed Generals Ma and ting Chao not to
negotiate further; and fighting began on the morning of
the 26th. DOHIHARA had failed in his attempt to intimidate
Generals Ma and Ting Chao; and what was still worse,
his ally, General Hsi Hsia, was meeting serious reverses
at the hand of General Ting Chao. Thereupon, DOHIHARA
was forced to call upon the Kwantung Army to assist
General Hsi Hsia. To justify this, Colonel DOHIHARA
created another of his "Incidents" in Harbin--an engineered
riot--during which it is said that one Japanese and
three Korean subjects of Japan were killed. Most of the
Japanese troops had been withdrawn from Northern Manchuria
in order to use them in the Chinchow drive; but the 2ne
Division had returned to Mukden for a rest. Although the
2nd Division was ordered to go to the rescue of General Hsi
Hsia, and entrained on 28 January, some delay was experienced
because of transportation difficulties. This gave General
Ting Chao time to seize the Municipal Administration

<p><center><i>--586--</i></center><hr><a name=page587></a><p>
<blockquote>

in Harbin and arrest General Chang Ching-hui, who had
been acting as puppet Governor of Heilungkiang Province.

<center>
<h3>Minami Lectured</h3>
</center>

While the reinforcements were entraining to go to
the aid of General Hsi Hsia, War Councillor MINAMI was
delivering a lecture before the Japanese Emperor in
Tokyo. His subject was, "The Latest Situation in Manchuria".
KIDO was present and recorded the lecture.
MINAMI's conclusions as expressed to the Emperor were:
(10 Japan would take over the national defense of the
new state to be created in Manchuria, complete the Kirin-Kwainei
Railway, and make the Sea of Japan into a lake
to facilitate Japan's advance into North Manchuria, thereby
revolutionizing Japan's defense plans. (2) The joint
management by Japan and the new State of the economy of
the area would make Japan self-sufficient in the World
forever. (3) This arrangement would solve Japan's
population problem, provided she established a colonial
trooping system to the new State. KIDO further recorded
that he thought the three or four JAPanese organs in
Manchuria should be untied under one head when the new
State was formed. This idea was to be carried out later.

<center>
<h3>First Invasion of Shanghai</h3>
</center>

After MINAMI had finished his lecture on the
afternoon of 28 January 1932, fighting broke out in a
new place in China. At 11:00 p.m., fighting commenced
in the first invasion of Shanghai. The commencement of
the "Incident" is typical. The anti-Chinese riots in
Korea following the "Wanpaoshan Incident" led to a Chinese
boycott of Japanese goods in Shanghai, which had been

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--587--</i></center><hr><a name=page588></a><p>
<blockquote>

intensified after the "Mukden Incident" and increased in
intensity as that "Incident" grew into the "Manchurian
Incident". Tension increased so that serious clashes
occurred between Chinese and Japanese. Japanese residents
of SHanghai requested the dispatch of Japanese troops for
their protection. The Japanese Consul-General presented
five demands to the Chinese Mayor of Shanghai; and the
Admiral in command of Japanese naval forces at Shanghai
announced that unless the Mayor's reply was satisfactory,
he would take action. On 24 January 1932, Japanese naval
reinforcements arrived. The Chinese reinforced their
garrison in Chapei, which is the native section of Shanghai.
On 28 January, the Municipal Council of the International
Settlement met and declared a state of emergency
as of 4:00 p.m.; at that hour, the Japanese Consul-General
informed the Consular Body that a satisfactory reply had
been received from the Chinese Mayor; and that no action
would be taken. At 11:00 p.m. on the same day, the Japanese
Admiral announced that the Japanese Navy was anxious
as to the situation in Chapei where numerous Japanese
nationals resided, and had decided to send troops to that
sector and occupy the Shanghai-Woosung Railway Station,
and that he hoped the Chinese would speedily withdraw to
the west of the railway. These Japanese troops sent to
the Chapei sector came into contact with Chinese troops
which would not have had time to withdraw even had they
wished to do so. This was the beginning of the battle
of Shanghai.

<h3>China Made Another Appeal to the League</h3>
</center>

The next morning, 29 January 1932, the alarming
situation caused China to submit a further appeal to
the League of Nations under Articles 10, 11 and 15 of
the Covenant. The Council of the League was in session
when the fighting started at Shanghai and it received
the new appeal from China the next day.

<h3>General Ma Bargained With Dohihara</h3>
</center>

In Manchuria, Colonel DOHIHARA was continuing his
negotiations in an effort to obtain the support of General
Ma in the formation of a new State in Manchuria.
Colonel ITAGAKI had recognized General Ma as "a man of
real worth possessing his own troops", and had attempted
to arrange a truce with him after the battle of Tsitsihar.
General Ma continued to cooperate with General Ting Chao
until the latter's defeat by the combined forces of
General Hsi Hsia and the Japanese on 5 February 1932.
After General Ting Chao's defeat, General Ma resumed
negotiations with Colonel DOHIHARA, while his army
escaped through Russian territory into China. With his
army safe in China proper,k General Ma, it is said,
accepted the one million dollars in gold offered by
DOHIHARA. In any event, he now agreed on 14 February
1932 to become Governor of Heilungkiang Province and
cooperate with the Japanese.

<h3>Supreme Administrative Council</h3>
</center>

According to ARAKI, General Honjo conceived
the idea of having the Governors of the Provinces
organize a "Supreme Administrative Council" to make
recommendations for the organization of the new State
in Manchuria. He forwarded his plan to ARAKI and requested
permission to set up a new State for the government
of Manchuria with Henry Pu Yi as its head. During
his interrogation at Sugamo Prison, ARAKI admitted that
since he had no better suggestion and thought the General's
plan would solve the "Manchurian Problem", he
had approved the plan. ARAKI then sent additional
experts into Manchuria to assist the Self-Government
Guiding Board in carrying out General Honjo's plan.
<p>
General Ma having reached an agreement with
DOHIHARA, the Self-Government Guiding Board called a
meeting of the Governors of the Three Eastern Provinces
and the Special District to meet at Mukden on 16 February
1932, for the announced purpose of "laying the
foundation" for the new State. The meeting was
attended in person by General Ma, as Governor of
Heilungkiang; General Chang Ching-hui as Governor of
the Special District; General Hsi Hsia, as Governor of
Kirin; and general Tsang Shihui, as Governor of
Liaoning; but General Tang Ju-lin, the Governor of
Jehol, was not present. The legal advisor for the
meeting was Dr. Chao Hsin-po, the Tokyo University
trained Doctor of Laws, who had relieved Colonel
DOHIHARA as Mayor of Mukden.
<p>
These five men decided that a new State should be
established, that a North-Eastern Supreme Administrative
Council should be organized which would exercise temporarily

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--590--</i></center><hr><a name=page591></a><p>
<blockquote>

the supreme authority over the Provinces and
the Special District, and that this Supreme Council
should, without delay, make all necessary preparations
for the founding of the new State.
<p>
 On the second day of the Conference, the
 Supreme Administrative Council was duly organized, to
 consist of seven members, namely: the Governors of
 Heilungkiang, Kirin, Liaoning, Jehol and the Special
 District, and the two Mongol chiefs who had joined
 the Conference on the morning of the second day. The
 new Supreme Council immediately proceeded to business,
 and decided: (1) to adopt the Republican system for
 the new State; (2) to respect the autonomy of the
 constituting provinces; (3) to give the tile of "Regent"
 to the Chief Executive; and (4) to issue a Declaration
 of Independence. That night, General Honjo gave an
 official dinner in honor of the "heads of the New State".
 He congratulated them on their success and assured them
 of his assistance in case of need.

 <center>
 <h3>Declaration of Independence</h3>
 </center>

 The next morning after General Honjo's dinner
 party, that is to say on 18 February 1932, the Declaration
 of Independence of Manchuria was published by
 the Supreme Administrative Council. Dr. Okawa in his
 book, <i>2600 Years of Japanese History,</i> published in
 1939, in commenting on this declaration has this to
 say: "The Chang Hseuh-liang regime was swept completely
 away from Manchuria in one swoop through the quick and
 daring action of the Japanese troops." The Tribunal
 finds upon the evidence that there was no popular

movement in Manchuria for the establishment of any
independent government. This movement was sponsored
and inspired by the Kwantung Army and its creature,
the Self-Government Guiding Board, with its Japanese Advisors.

<center>
<h3>Organization of the New State</h3>
</center>

The Declaration of Independence having been
issued, Governors Ma and Hsi Hsia returned to their
Provincial Capitals, but they designated representatives
to meet with Governor Tsang Shih-yi, Governor Chang
Ching-hui and Mayor Chao Hsin-Po for the purpose of
working out the details of the plan for the new State.
On 19 February 1932, this group decided that the form
of the new government should be that of a Republic with
a constitution drawn on the principle of the separation
of powers. The group then agreed upon Changchun as the
Capital of the new State, fixed the design of the new
national flag, and agreed that Pu Yi should be asked to
act as "Regent" of the new State.
<p>
The Self-Government Guiding Board immediately
began holding mass-meetings and demonstrations in the
Provinces, at which the Kwantung Army paraded its might
and fired artillery salutes to impress the Manchurians
with the power of Japan. After the proper foundation
had been laid by these demonstrations, the Board took
the lead in convening an All-Manchurian Convention,
which was held in Mukden on 29 February 1932. At this
Convention, speeches were delivered; a declaration
denouncing the previous regime of General Chang Hsueh-liang
was unanimously adopted; and resolutions welcoming

the new State with Pu Yi as its Chief Executive were approved.
<p>
The Supreme Administrative Council met immediately
in urgent session and elected six delegates to
proceed to Port Arthur to convey their invitation to
Pu Yi to head the new government. Pu Yi did not respond
to the first invitation from the Supreme Administrative
Council, so a second delegation was appointed on 4 March
1932 to induce Pu Yi to accept. Upon the advice of
Colonel ITAGAKI, Pu Yi accepted the second invitation.
After an audience with the Delegate on 5 March, Pu Yi
left Port Arthur on the 6th for Tangkang-tze, and after
two days, began, on the 8th, to receive homage as the
"Regent of Manchukuo". Inauguration ceremonies were
held at the new capital, Changchun, on 9 March 1932. Pu
Yi declared the policy of the new State to be founded
upon morality, benevolence and love. the next day he
appointed the list of principle officials suggested by
the Japanese.
<p>
Prior to the arrival of Pu Yi, a number of
laws and regulations, on which Dr. Chao Hsin-Po had
been working for some time, had been made ready for
adoption and promulgation. they came into effect on 9
March 1932, simultaneously with the law regulating the
organization of the Government of Manchukuo.
<p>
Public announcement of the new State of Manchukuo
was made on 12 March 1932 in a telegram to the
foreign Powers, requesting that they recognize the new
State. Dr. Okawa stated that Manchukuo was a result of
the plan of the Kwantung Army approved by the Japanese
Government, and the establishment of the State progressed
smoothly, because it had been well planned and prepared

beforehand. Pu Yi says that Manchukuo was under the
complete domination of Japan from the beginning.

<center>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approved Fait Accompli</h3>
</center>

ARAKI was right when he said that the Honjo plan
was approved by the Cabinet; but it was not so approved
until 12 March 1932, after the plan had been
executed and after the new State of Manchukuo had come
into existence. it was on 12 March 1932, the day that
the telegram announcing the formation of Manchukuo to
the foreign Powers was sent out, that the Cabinet met
and decided upon an "Outline for the Disposition of
Foreign Relations Accompanying the Establishment of the
New States of Manchukuo". It was decided to render "all
sorts of aid" to the new State, short of recognition
under international law, and "lead her to fulfill the
substantial conditions for an independent state step by
step" in the hope that the Powers would ultimately recognize
her independence. To avoid intervention of the
Signatory Powers of the Nine-Power Pact
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-10 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-10</a>),
it was thought best to have Manchukuo declare a policy
consistent with the policy of the "Open Door" and in harmony
with the principle of equal opportunity guaranteed
by the Treaty. The Cabinet also decided that Manchukuo
should seize the custom houses and salt-tax collecting
organs; but that this should be done in such a way as not
to "bring about troubles in foreign relations". One method
agreed upon for doing this was to bribe the customs
officials and replace them with Japanese. It was planned
to seize military power in Manchukuo under the guise of
subjugating banditry, in line with the reservation made

<blockquote>

at Geneva. In short, the Cabinet fully realized that
the occupation of Manchuria and the establishment of an
independent State there by Japan was a direct violation
of existing treaty obligations; and it was trying to
evolve a plan whereby the reality of the breach could be
concealed by an appearance of compliance with the obligations.

<h3>The Lytton Commission Arrived in Tokyo</h3>
</center>

On the day that the All-Manchurian Convention
was being held in Mukden, that is to say on 29 February
1932, the Lytton Commission arrived in Tokyo, where they
were received by the Emperor and commenced a series of
daily conferences with the Government, including Premier
Inukai, War Minister ARAKI, and others. Although these
daily conferences continued for eight days, none of these
government officials informed the Commission that Japan
was forming a new State in Manchuria; and the Commission
first learned of this after it had left Tokyo and arrived
at Kyoto on its way to China.
<P>
On the day that the Commission arrived in
Tokyo, KOISO was elevated by ARAKI from Chief of the
Military Affairs Bureau of the War Ministry to the high
position of Vice-Minister of War.

<h3>Araki Dispatched Reinforcements to Shanghai</h3>
</center>

The battle which had started at Shanghai on
28 January 1932 had developed to such an extent that the
Navy Minister was forced to call upon War Minister ARAKI
for reinforcements. The Chinese 19th Route Army was

giving a good account of its fighting ability. Large
numbers of Japanese destroyers were anchored in the
Hwangpu, and Japanese airplanes were bombing Chapei.
The Japanese Marines were using their permanent garrison
in Hungkow as a base of operations; and barricades erected
between this garrison and Chapei served as the front
lines between the ground forces. The Japanese destroyers,
firing point blank, bombarded the forts at Wu-sung; this
fire was not returned by the forts, for they had no guns
capable of answering. The Japanese Marines had invaded
areas adjacent to the International Settlement, disarmed
the police and paralysed all city functions; a veritable
reign of terror was in full swing when the Navy Minister
requested these reinforcements. ARAKI states that he
conferred with the Cabinet and it was decided to send
supporting forces quickly; 10,000 men were dispatched
the following day aboard fast destroyers. These reinforcements
landed in the International Settlement fully
equipped with tanks and artillery. The Navy drew up
heavy ships and began shelling the city. However, this
attack which began on 20 February 1932 brought no marked
success despite the fact that it continued for several
days. Following this attack, ARAKI, claiming that General
Ueda had suffered such great losses that it was necessary
to send further reinforcements, sent the 11th and 14th
Divisions to oppose the Chinese Army which had been
defending the city.

<h3>The League Took Action</h3>
</center>

The League of Nations was aroused to action.
The members of the Council, other than China and Japan,
addressed an urgent appeal to the Japanese Government
on 19 February 1932 calling attention to Article 10
of the Covenant
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-6 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-6</a>);
and the Assembly was
convened to meet on 3 March 1932.
<p>
The American Secretary of State advised the
American COnsul-General at Shanghai that the Secretary's
letter to senator Corsh on the China situation was being
released to the Press. In this letter, the Secretary
stated that the Nine-Power Treaty
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-10 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-10</a>)
formed the legal basis upon which the "Open Door POlicy"
rested. he set forth a long history of the Treaty.
He commented that the Treaty represented a carefully
matured international policy designed to assure to all
parties their rights in China and to assure the Chinese
the fullest opportunity to develop their independence
and sovereignty. He recalled that Lord Balfour, Chairman
of the British Delegation, had stated that he understood
that there was no representative present at the
signing of the Treaty, who thought that spheres of
interest were advocated or would be tolerated. The Pact
of Paris (<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-15 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-15</a>)
was intended to reinforce the
Nine-power Treaty. The two Treaties were interdependent,
he said, and were intended to align world conscience
and public opinion in favor of a system of orderly
development through international law, including the
settlement of all controversies by peaceful means instead
of arbitrary force. He said, that in the past
the United States had rested its policy upon abiding
faith in the future of China and upon ultimate success

in dealing with China upon principles of fair play,
patience and mutual good will.
<p>
The British Admiral, Sir Howard Kelly, as one
of the many attempts to secure a cessation fo hostilities
at Shanghai through the good offices of friendly Powers,
held a conference on board his flagship on 28 February
1932. An agreement on the basis of mutual and simultaneous
withdrawal was proposed; but the conference was unsuccessful,
owing to the differing opinions of the parties.
As though in resentment of this interference, the Japanese
troops occupied the western part of Kiangwan, which had
been evacuated by the Chinese, and the Wu-sung forts
and fortifications along the Yangtze were again bombed
from the air and shelled from the sea, as bombing-planes
operated over the whole front, including the Nanking Railway
and the airfield at Hungjao.
<p>
Before the Assembly of the League could meet,
the Council proposed a roundtable conference of 29 February
to make local arrangements for a cessation of
hostilities at Shanghai; both parties agreed to this
conference, but it was not successful because of the
conditions imposed by the Japanese.
<p>
General Shirakawa, who had been appointed to
the Japanese supreme command, arrived with reinforcements
on 29 February. His first order directed the bombing
of the airfield at Hangchow, which was approximately
100 miles away. General Shirakawa gained ground slowly
as a result of heavy naval bombardment; and after a flank
attack on 1 March, he was able to drive the Chinese beyond
the 20 kilometer limit originally demanded by the
japanese as terms for cessation of the hostilities.
<p>
This "face-saving" success permitted the

<p><center><i>--598--</i></center><hr><a name=page599></a><p>
<blockquote>

Japanese to accept the request of the Assembly of the
League of 4 March 1932, calling upon both Governments
to make a cessation of hostilities and recommending
negotiations for conclusion of the hostilities and the
withdrawal of Japanese troops. The opposing commanders
issued appropriate orders and the fighting ceased; negotiations
began on 10 March 1932.
<p>
The Assembly continued its investigation of
the dispute; and on 11 March 1932, it adopted a resolution
to the effect that the provisions of the Covenant
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-6 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-6</a>)
were applicable to the dispute, especially
the provisions that treaties should be scrupulously
respected, that members should respect and preserve the
territorial integrity and political independence of all
the members of the League against external aggression,
and that the members were obligated to submit all disputes
between them to procedures for peaceful settlement.
The Assembly affirmed that it was contrary to the
spirit of the Covenant that the dispute should be settled
under stress of military pressure, affirmed the resolutions
of the Council of 390 September and 10 December
1931, as well as its own resolution of 4 March 1932, and
proceeded to set up a "Committee of Nineteen" to settle
the dispute at Shanghai.
<P>
Contrary to their obligation, the Japanese
took advantage of the truce to bring up reinforcements,
which were landed at Shanghai on 7 and 17 March 1932.
it was not until 5 May 1932, that a complete agreement
was ready for signature. SHIGEMITSU signed for the
Japanese. The fighting at Shanghai had been characterized
by extreme cruelty on the part of the Japanese.
The needless bombing of Chapei, the ruthless bombardment

by navy vessels, and the massacre of the helpless

their hands tied behind their backs, are examples of the
method of warfare waged at Shanghai.

This Incident furnishes another example of the
Japanese determination to use military force against the
Chinese and to impress the Chinese with the might of
Japan, using any pretext for the purpose. The ostensible
reason for the use of force in this case was the request
from some Japanese residents of SHanghai for protection.
The Tribunal has no hesitation in coming to the conclusion
that the force used was out of all proportion to
the existing danger to Japanese Nationals and property.
<p>
There is no doubt that at the time feeling was running
high and the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods, induced
at least in part by Japanese action in Manchuria,
was being felt. In the light of all the facts, the
Tribunal is of the opinion that the real purpose of the
Japanese attack was to alarm the Chinese by indication
fo what would follow if their attitude toward Japan continued,
and thus break down resistance to future operations.
The Incident was a part of the general plan.

<h3>Manchukuo Was Constructed and Operated as a Puppet</h3>
</center>

Manchukuo was definitely a totalitarian State, because
of the power vested in the Regent; and those who
controlled the Regent controlled the State. Ordinance
No. 1, which was promulgated on 9 March 1932, prescribed
the organic law for Manchukuo. In formal expression,
the position was as follows: the governmental power was
divided into four divisions: the Executive, the Legislative,
the Judicial and the Supervisory; the Regent
as the Chief Executive was the head of the State;
all executive power, as well as the power to override
the Legislative Council, was vested in him;
the functions of the Executive Department were performed,
under the direction of the Regent, by the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--601--</i></center><hr><a name=page602></a><p>
<blockquote>

Premier and the Minister of State, who formed a State
Council or Cabinet; the Premier supervised the work of
the Ministries through the powerful General Affairs
Board, which had direct charge of their confidential
matters, personnel, accounting and supplies; subordinate
to the State Council were various bureaux, such as the
Legislative Council; but, following the Japanese Constitution,
the Regent had authority, when the Legislative
Council was not in session, to promulgate ordinances
upon advice of his Privy Council; and the Supervisory
Council supervised the conduct of officials and
audited their accounts. The Legislative Council was
never organized and legislation was therefore enacted
by ordinance of the Regent.
<p>
The General Affairs Board, the Legislative Bureau
and the Advisory Bureau, in practice by way of contrast
to form, constituted a Premier's Office. Upon establishment
of the State, the Self-Government Guiding
Board was abolished and its personnel were transferred
to the Advisory Bureau, which continued the work of
the Board through the Self-Government Committees previously
established in the Provinces and Districts.
The General Affairs Board, more than any other, was the
agency of the Japanese for effective practical control
and domination of every phase of the government and
economy of Manchukuo.
<p>
The Ministers of State were generally Chinese,
but each Minister had a Vice-Minister, who was Japanese.
There existed a committee in the Government of
Manchukuo not provided for in the Constitution which
was known as the "Tuesday meeting". Each Tuesday,
there was a meeting of the various Japanese Vice-Ministers,
presided over by the Japanese Director
of the General Affairs Board, and attended by the Chief
of a Section of the Kwantung Army General Staff.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--602--</i></center><hr><a name=page603></a><p>
<blockquote>

At these meetings, all policies were adopted, all rescripts,
ordinances and other enactments approved; the decisions of
the "Tuesday Meeting" were then passed on to the General
Affairs Board to be officially adopted and promulgated as
an act of the Government of Manchukuo. It was in this manner
that Manchukuo was completely dominated by the Kwantung
Army. In a telegram sent by General Honjo to War Minister
ARAKI on 3 April 1932, Honjo said; "I believe you have no]
objections that the execution of our policies regarding the
whole of Manchukuo should, insofar as it involves negotiations
with Manchukuo, be left chiefly to the Kwantung Army.
in view of the recent conduct of the Japanese government
Offices and various other representing organs in Manchuria,
however, I fear that unless we make it thoroughgoing,
confusion might arise." To this ARAKI replied: "I agree
in principle to your opinion regarding unification in the
execution of our Manchurian policies."
<p>
At firs,t Japanese "Advisors" were appointed to advise
all the important government officials of Manchukuo; but
shortly after the formation of the State, these "Advisors"
became full government officials on the same basis as the
Chinese. Over 200 Japanese were holding office in the
Central Government alone, not including those in the War
Ministry and Military Forces, during the month of April
1932--one month after the formation of the State. In most
bureaux, there were Japanese advisors, councillors, and
secretaries. All important posts in the Supervisory
Bureau were held by Japanese. Finally, most of the important
officials of the Regency, including the Chief of
the Office of Internal Affairs and the Commander of the
Regent's Bodyguard, were Japanese. Even the Regent was
"supervised" by General Yoshioka, who was appointed by the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--603--</i></center><hr><a name=page604></a><p>
<blockquote>


Kwantung Army for that purpose. In short, as for the
government and public services, although the titular heads
were usually Chinese, the main political and administrative
power was held by Japanese officials ad advisors,
councillors, supervisors, secretaries and vice-officials.
<p>
The Japanese Cabinet at a meeting on 11 April 1932,
considered methods for "guiding" Manchukuo and approved
the method outlined above. ARAKI was a member of the Cabinet
as War Minister at that time. The decision was:
"The new State shall employ authoritative advisors from
our country and make them the highest advisors in connection
with financial, economic, and general political
problems. The new State shall appoint Japanese nationals
to the leading posts in the Privy Council, the Central
Bank, and other organs of the new State." The Cabinet
then listed the offices of the government of Manchukuo
which should be filled by Japanese; these included the
Chief of the General Affairs Board and the Chief of each
of that Board's sections, Councillors and Chief Secretary
of the Privy Council, and offices in the revenue, Police,
Banking, Transportation, Justice, Customs, and other Departments.
This measure was found to be necessary so that
the new State would manifest the "very characteristics
that are important factors for the existence of the Empire
in relation to politics, economy, national defense, transportation,
communication and many other fields", and so
that "a single self-sufficient economic unit comprising
Japan and Manchukuo will be realized".

<blockquote>


during April 1932. The Kwantung Army Commander was made
ex-officio Supreme Advisor of the Society. The special
mission of the Concordia Society was to spread the spirit
and ideology of the State, the "Kingly Way", and to strengthen
Manchukuo so that she could subserve Japan in her
struggle against the Anglo-Saxon World and the Comintern.
The policy of the Government of Manchukuo was expressed in
proclamations issued on 18 February 1932 and 1 March 1932;
it was to rule in accordance with the fundamental principle
of the "Kingly Way". In this manner, the consolidation of
Japan's conquest of Manchuria was accomplished in the
sphere of ideological propaganda. No political party other
than the Society was allowed in Manchuria. The titular
head of the Society was the Prime Minister of Manchukuo;
but actually, the leader was a member of the Kwantung Army
General Staff.

<center>
<h3>The Lytton Commission Visited Manchuria</h3>
</center>

The Lytton Commission arrived in Manchuria in April
1932, and began its work of penetrating the veil of secrecy
thrown over the situation by the intimidation of the
inhabitants and obstruction of the Committee's efforts
by the Kwantung Army and Japanese officials of Manchukuo.
Under the excuse of offering "protection" to members of
the Commission and prospective witnesses, the Army and the
Gendarmes "supervised" their activities and movements.
Pu Yi testified that, "We were all under the supervision
of the Japanese Military Officers; and wherever Lord
Lytton went, he was under the supervision of Japanese
Gendarmes. When I interviewed Lord Lytton, many of the
Kwantung military officers were beside me supervising.
If I had told him the truth, I would have been murdered

<p><center><i>--605--</i></center><hr><a name=page606></a><p>
<blockquote>

right after the mission left Manchuria." Pu Yi delivered
to Lord Lytton a statement prepared by Colonel ITAGAKI,
which Pu Yi now declares did not reflect the true facts.
People who spoke Russian or English were carefully supervised
during the Commission's stay in Manchuria; some
were arrested.
<p>
The Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army suggested,
in a telegram sent to the War Ministry on 4 June 1932,
that Japan show her contempt of the Lytton Commission by
taking over the customs during the visit of the Commission.
He said: "It is rather advantageous to take this action
during the stay of the league's Inquiry Commission in
order to display the independence of Manchukuo, and to
indicate the firm resolution of Japan and Manchukuo in
respect to the 'Manchurian Incident'".

<center>
<h3>The Assassination of Premier Inukai</h3>
</center>

The opposition of Premier Inukai to the establishment
of Manchukuo as an independent State cost him his
life. The Premier had consistently opposed the recognition
of Manchukuo by Japan, maintaining that such recognition
would be a violation of the sovereign rights of China.
<p>
Within a few days after assuming office as Premier,
Inukai sent a secret emissary by the name of Kayano to
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to arrange terms of peace.
Generalissimo Chiang was highly satisfied with Kayano's
proposals, and negotiations were proceeding satisfactorily
when one of Kayano's telegrams to Premier Inukai was
intercepted by the War Ministry. The Secretary of the
Cabinet informed Inukai's son that, "Your father is carrying
on negotiations with Generalissimo Chiang. Concerning

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--606--</i></center><hr><a name=page607></a><p>
<blockquote>

this, the War Ministry is highly indignant." Although
the negotiations were abandoned, the friction continued
between the Premier and War Minister ARAKI.
<p>
The conflict between Premier Inukai and the <i>Kodo</i>
or "Imperial Way" faction, of which ARAKI was leader at
that time, reached the explosion point on 8 May 1932, when
Inukai delivered an anti-militaristic and pro-democratic
speech at Yokohama. On 15 May 1932, the Premier was ill
and temporarily alone in his Official Residence, when
several naval officers forced their way into his home and
assassinated him. Dr. Okawa furnished the pistols for
the killing; and HASHIMOTO admitted in his book, <i>The
Road to Reconstruction of the World,</i> that he was
implicated in the murder.
<p>
Lt. Colonel SUZUKI, who was an official in the Military
Affairs Bureau of the War Ministry at that time,
warned that if a new Cabinet should be organized under
the leadership of political parties, a second or third
assassination would occur. He made this warning at a
dinner attended by KIDO, KOISO, and SUZUKI at Baron Harada's
house two days after the murder. The opposition to
the expansionist policy had come largely from representatives
of the political parties in Japan.

<center>
<h3>Recognition of Manchukuo by Japan</h3>
</center>

ARAKI and KOISO retained their positions, as War
Minister and Vice-War Minister respectively, in the new
Cabinet; and under their leadership, Manchukuo was recognized
by the Government of Japan as an independent State.
in replying on 4 June 1932 to a telegram from the Chief-of-Staff
of the Kwantung Army, the War Minister said,
regarding the question of recognition: "It has a very

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--607--</i></center><hr><a name=page608></a><p>
<blockquote>

delicate bearing on various circles at home and abroad,
and therefore we are now determined and ready to effect the
recognition whenever opportunity offers." He also revealed
the plan to rule Manchukuo through the Kwantung Army; he
said: "As regards unification of various organs in Manchuria,
we are planning to establish a coordinating organ with
the Army as its center, among other things aiming at the
industrial development of Manchuria to meet with requirements
for speedy stabilization of Manchukuo and national
defense. Should such underlying motive by chance leak out
at home or abroad, and especially in foreign countries, it
would be extremely disadvantageous from the point of view
of the direction of Manchukuo. Therefore, we hope that
you will be very circumspect even in the study of the matter
in y our own office." About the middle of June 9132, ARAKI
stated before the Supreme War Council that the resolutions
of the League of nations and statements made by Japan in
regard to Manchuria before the establishment of Manchukuo
could no longer be considered binding on Japan.
<p>
The Kwantung Army assisted ARAKI in forcing the Government
to recognize Manchukuo by sending a so-called
"Peace Mission" to Tokyo in June 9132. The purpose of this
mission was to urge the immediate recognition of the new
State; it worked in conjunction with the Black Dragon
Society, which held conferences at Hibiya Toyoken to assist
this "Mission".
<p>
In view of the change of Cabinets, the Lytton Commission
returned to Tokyo on 4 July 1932, and held a series
of conferences with the officials of the new Government
in an effort to learn the views of the Cabinet regarding
the situation in Manchuria. ARAKI was present at these
conferences.

After the Commission returned to Peiping, that is to
say on or about 8 August 1932, the "coordinating organ with
the Army at its center", mentioned by ARAKI in his telegram
to the Chief-of-Staff of the Kwantung Army, was established
as planned. The "Four-in-One" system was replaced
by the "Three-in-One" system; under this new system, the
Commander of the Kwantung Army became the Governor of the
Kwantung Leased Territory, and at the same time Ambassador
to Manchukuo. The new system took effect on 20 August 1932.
A change of personnel was made to put this system in effect.
Muto, Nobuyoshi, replaced Honjo as Commander of the Kwantung
Army. ITAGAKI remained on the Staff of the Kwantung
Army, and was promoted to the rank of Major General. Vice-Minister
of War KOISO was sent to Manchuria as Chief-of-Staff
of the Kwantung Army Special Service Organization,
or Intelligence Service.
<p>
After the surrender, ARAKI stated: "At the conference
of the Big Three (Foreign, Navy and War Ministers), when
discussing recognition of Manchukuo as an independent state,
I suggested that we exchange Ambassadors since Manchukuo
was an independent state. The question came before the
Cabinet at a meeting in August 1932. The discussion was
as to when Manchukuo should receive recognition -- now or
later. The Kwantung Army put in a request that we recognize
immediately. I set the date of 15 September 1932 as
the date to formally recognize Manchukuo. At this meeting
we discussed the contents of the Treaty to be entered into
with Manchukuo, and I approved the contents agreed upon."
<p>
HIRANUMA, as Vice-President of the Privy Council,
called a meeting of the Council on 13  September 1932 to
consider the question of "Signing of the Protocol between

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--609--</i></center><hr><a name=page610></a><p>
<blockquote>

Japan and Manchukuo." HIRANUMA, who had also been
appointed a Member of the Investigation Committee of
the Privy Council, read the report of the Committee
to the full Privy Council. The reported stated, among
other things, "Our Imperial Government firmly believed
that it would be advisable to recognize that country
without delay. Nevertheless, in order to use prudence
and caution, our Government watched for half a year
the developments in Manchukuo as well as the attitudes
of the League of Nations and other countries.
Indications are that our country's recognition of
that country although it will, as may be easily imagined,
cause for a time no small shock to the world, it will
not bring about an international crisis. With the
object of co-existence and co-prosperity, our country
intends to take measures for recognizing Manchukuo by
concluding an arrangement through this Protocol and
the Notes exchanged between the two countries".
<p>
HIRANUMA was referring to four Notes as follows:
<ol type="1">
<li>
The first Note consisted of a letter and the reply
thereto. The letter, which was dated 10 March 1932, the
day after Pu Yi's inauguration, was addressed by Pu Yi
to Honjo. In this letter, Pu Yi stated that he
appreciated the efforts and sacrifices of Japan in
establishing Manchukuo, but that the development of
Manchukuo could not be expected without the support
and guidance of Japan. Pu Yi then requested that
Japan agree, among other things, to the following:
<ol type="A">
<p><li>
Japan to undertake, at the expense of Manchukuo,
the national defence of the new State and the maintenance
of order within the country, with the understanding that
Manchukuo would furnish all military facilities required
by the Kwantung Army;
<p><li>
Japan to undertake to control all existing railroads and other transportation
</ol>
</ol>

facilities and to construct such new facilities as
may be deemed desirable; and
<p><li>
Japanese nationals
to serve as government officials in all branches of
the Government of Manchukuo, subject to appointment,
removal and replacement at will by the Commander of
the Kwantung Army.
</ol>
<p>
Honjo's reply to the letter was
simply that Japan had no objection to Pu Yi's proposals.
<p><li>
The second Note was an agreement between
the Prime Minister of Manchukuo and Honjo, dated 7
August 1932, relating to the control of transportation
facilities, and making the Japanese control more absolute.
<p><li>
The third Note was another agreement
between the Prime Minister of Manchukuo and Honjo,
dated 7 August 1932. It related to the establishment
of the Japan Air Transportation Company. This Company
was authorized by a Cabinet decision of 12 August 1932,
to take over the air-routes which had already been
established in Manchuria by the Kwantung Army under
the pretext of military communications.
<p><li>
The fourth Note was an agreement between Commander Muto
and the Prime Minister of Manchukuo dated 9 September
1932, relative to mining concessions in Manchuria.
</ol>
<p>
According to the report read by HIRANUMA, these
Notes were to be retroactive to the dates of their
signing and were to be deemed international agreements,
but were to be strictly secret.
<P>
The Protocol, which was to be made public, provided
that Japan had recognized Manchukuo; that Manchukuo
affirmed all rights and interests possessed by Japan
and her subjects in Manchuria at the time of the formation
of Manchukuo; and that both parties agreed to

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--611--</i></center><hr><a name=page612></a><p>
<blockquote>

cooperate in the maintenance of their national
security, recognizing that a threat to either
was a threat to both and giving Japan the right
to maintain troops in Manchukuo. The Investigation
Committee recommended approval of the
Protocol and Notes.
<P>
The discussion that followed the reading
of the report of the Investigation Committee
reveals that the members of the Privy Council
fully realized that the proposed Protocol and
notes violated the Nine-Power Pact
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-10 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-10</a>)
and other treaty obligations of Japan.
Privy Councillor Okada raised the question.
The Foreign Minister had explained to the Diet
that Japan would not be violating the Nine-Power
Pact by recognizing Manchukuo, because
Manchukuo had become independent, and Japan had
not agreed to prevent the independence of the
Chinese people. Okada expressed the opinion
that the United States and others would not
be satisfied by that explanation. As he
explained, "The American might say that it
would be all right if Manchukuo had become
independent by the free will of her own
people, but that it was a violation of the Pact
and a disregard of China's sovereignty
for Japan to assist and maintain
that independence." The Foreign

<p><center><i>--612--</i></center><hr><a name=page613></a><p>
<blockquote>

Minister replied: "Of course, in this respect, various views
Minister replied: "Of course, in this respect various views
are held in the United States and other countries, but these
are their own views." ARAKI explained, "The national
defense of Manchukuo is at the same time the national defense
of our country". Councillor Ishii stated: "I feel very uneasy
about Japan's contention in regard to the connection
between the 'Manchurian Problem' and the League of Nations",
and he further observed: "It was almost an established view
of a large number of the people of the United States and
other countries that our action in Manchukuo violated the
Pact of Paris
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-15 tafget=txtwin>Annex No. B-15</a>)
and the Nine-Power Pact."
However, Councillor Ishii added: "Now that Japan has
concluded an alliance with Manchukuo, for joint national defense
I believe that there will be no room for opposing the
stationing of Japanese troops in Manchuria, this will make
the League's past resolution a dead letter." He then observed:
"It was rather strange that the Manchurian and Mongolian
races had started no independence movement up to now!"
<p>
The vote was taken, the Protocol and Notes were approved
by unanimous vote and the Emperor withdrew. Ambassador
Muto presented the Protocol to the Manchukuoan Prime Minister
with the remark, "Here it is. This is the agreement that
you have to sign". Although Pu Yi testified that he did not
know of the existence of the Protocol up until the day it
was presented for signing, he signed it on 15 September 1932.

<h3>Preparation for the Conquest of Jehol</h3>
</center>

Efforts to persuade General Tang Ju-lin, who was Governor
of Jehol Province, to declare his Province independent of
China and place it under the jurisdiction of Manchukuo proved
to be of no avail; therefore, with the conquest and consolidation
of the Three Eastern Provinces completed, the Japanese

<p><center><i>--613--</i></center><hr><a name=page614></a><p>
<blockquote>

Army began to prepare for the conquest of Jehol. After the
surrender, ARAKI tried to explain the decision to invade
Jehol by saying, in speaking of the Privy Council meeting of
17 December 1931, where it was decided -- according to him -- to
appropriate funds for the subjugation of Manchuria, "It had
been decided that the three provinces comprising Chang
Hsueh-liang's territory required pacification; but a statement
by Chang to the effect that his jurisdiction extended
over four provinces expanded the scene of activities to Jehol".
<p>
At the organization of the Supreme Administrative
Council by the puppet Governors of the provinces on 17
February 1932, it was provided that Jehol should be represented
on the Council; however, Governor Tang Ju-lin ignored
the invitation and continued to rule the Province, although
the Mongols of the various Leagues within the Province attempted
to collaborate with the new State, and were claimed
as subjects by Manchukuo.
<p>
The Japanese, having made their reservation at Geneva,
needed only to find an excuse to proceed with their plan for
the incorporation of Jehol into Manchukuo. The first excuse
was presented when an official by the name of Ishimoto, who
was attached to the Kwantung Army, staged a "disappearance"
while traveling between Peipiao and Chinchow on 17 July 1932.
The Japanese immediately claimed that he had been kidnapped
by Chinese Volunteers, and sent a detachment of the Kwantung
Army into Jehol on the pretext of rescuing Ishimoto. Although
the detachment was equipped with artillery, it was
repulsed and failed in its purpose, after occupying a village
on the frontier of the Province. During this encounter,
Japanese planes dropped bombs on the town of Chaoyang; and
through the month of August 1932, Japanese planes continued
to demonstrate over this part of Jehol Province. On 19 August

<p><center><i>--614--</i></center><hr><a name=page615></a><p>
<blockquote>

1932, a Kwantung Army staff officer was sent to Nanling,
a small village situated between Peipiao and the boundary of
Jehol, ostensibly to negotiate for the release of Mr. Ishimoto.
He was accompanied by an infantry detachment. he claimed
that on his return journey, he was fired upon and in self-defense
returned the fire. On the arrival of another infantry
detachment, as if by pre-arrangement, Nanling was occupied.
<p>
Shortly after the engagement at Nanling, a declaration
was issued to the effect that Jehol Province was the territory
of Manchukuo, thus laying the foundation for its annexation
through the action of the Kwantung Army. Military
action continued upon one pretext or another, mostly along
the Chinchow-Peipiao branch line of the Peiping-Mukden
Railway, which is the only means of access to Jehol from
Manchuria by railway. This was to be expected, as the main
lines of communication at that time between China proper and
the Chinese forces remaining in Manchuria ran through Jehol.
It was evident to casual observers that an invasion of Jehol
was imminent, and the Japanese Press freely admitted that fact.
In September 1932, the 14th Mixed Brigade arrived in Manchuria
with the announced mission of "mopping up" bandits in the
Tung Pientao, which is the district on the north side of the
Yalu River between Manchuria and Korea. The real mission of
this brigade was to prepare for the invasion of Jehol.

<h3>The Lytton Commission Reported</h3>
</center>

In Geneva, the Council of the League met on 21 November
1932 to consider the report of the Lytton Commission, which
had been received on 1 October 1932. During the deliberations,
the Japanese Delegate, Matsuoka, declared, "We want no
more territory!" However, due to the fact that Matsuoka refused

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--615--</i></center><hr><a name=page616></a><p>
<blockquote>

to agree to any basis for settlement of the dispute,
the Council was forced on 28 November 1932 to transmit the
report of the Lytton Commission to the Assembly for action.
<p>
The Lytton Commission in its report stated: "It is a
fact that, without declaration of war, a large area of what
was indisputably the Chinese territory has been forcibly
seized and occupied by the armed forces of Japan and has,
in consequence of this operation, been separated form and
declared independent of the rest of China. The steps by
which this was accomplished are claimed by Japan to have
been consistent with the obligations of the Covenant of the
League of Nations (<A href=IMTFE-B.html#B-6 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-6</a>),
the Kellogg Pact (<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-10 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-15</a>)
and the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-10 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-10</a>),
all of which were designed to prevent
action of this kind. The justification in this case has
been that all the military operations have been legitimate
acts of self-defence." However, the Commission further
stated in discussing the events at Mukden on the night of
18 September 1931: "The military operations of the Japanese
troops during this night, which have been described above,
cannot be regarded as measures of legitimate self-defence."
<p>
The Assembly of the League met on 6 December 1932; and
after a general discussion, adopted a resolution on 9 December
1932 requesting the Committee of Nineteen, which it had
appointed on 11 March 1932, to bring about a cessation of
hostilities at Shanghai, study the report, draw up proposals
for settlement of the dispute, and submit those proposals
to the Assembly at the earliest possible moment.
<p>
The Committee of Nineteen drew up two draft resolutions
and a statement of reasons indicating generally the basis on
which it thought it possible to continue its endeavors. On
15 December 1932, the two draft resolutions and the statement
of reasons were submitted to the parties. The Chinese and

<p><center><i>--616--</i></center><hr><a name=page617></a><p>
<blockquote>

the Japanese Delegates proposed amendments; and the
Committee adjourned on 20 December 1932 to permit discussion
of the proposed amendments between the Delegates,
the Secretary-General of the League and the President
of the Committee.

<center>
<h3>The Shanhaikwan Incident</h3>
</center>

Before this discussion proceeded very far, the
serious "Shanhaikwan Incident" occurred on 1 January
1933. Situated at the extremity of the Great Wall,
halfway between Peiping and Mukden, this city has always
been regarded as of great strategic importance.
It is on the route followed by invaders, who, coming
from Manchuria, wish to penetrate into what is now the
Province of Hopei. Moreover, from Hopei is the
easiest route into Jehol.
<p>
After Chinchow had been taken, the Japanese had
advanced to Shanhaikwan -- up to the Great Wall -- and
taken possession of the Mukden-Shanhaikwan Railway.
The railway continues form Shanhaikwan to Peiping,
where Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang was maintaining his
headquarters. Although the railway station at Shanhaikwan
is just south of the Great Wall, the Japanese
trains from Mukden ran to the station; therefore, the
Japanese maintained troops at the station under the
pretense of guarding the trains. The Chinese trains
from Peiping also ran into this station, and the
Chinese maintained troops there. The Chinese Commander
reported that all had been well at the station
until this "Incident" occurred.
<p>
The fact that this "Incident" occurred during
the discussion of the proposed amendments to the two
draft resolutions submitted by the Committee of Nineteen
strongly suggests that it was planned in order

<p><center><i>--617--</i></center><hr><a name=page618></a><p>

to simulate justification of the action of the Japanese
Government in rejecting all efforts of the Committee
to arrive at a basis of settlement between China and Japan.
<p>
On the afternoon of 1 January 1933, the Japanese
claimed that some Chinese had thrown a hand grenade.
That was the excuse for a forthright assault on the
walled city of Shanhaikwan. Smaller towns nearby were
machine-gunned, American missionary property was
bombed, and the fighting developed into old-fashioned
trench warfare, so that the North China Plain between
Peiping and the Great Wall became criss-crossed by
hundreds of miles of trenches. Thousands of peaceful
citizens were slaughtered; and the Chinese Government
addressed an appeal on 11 January 1933 to the signatories
of the 1901 Protocol
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-2 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-2</a>).

<h3>Japan Declined All Efforts of the Committee of Nineteen</h3>
</center>


The Committee of Nineteen met pursuant to adjournment
on 16 January 1933; and submitted to the
parties a number of questions and requests for information
in an effort to arrive at a basis of settlement
between China and Japan. To all of its requests, the
Committee received unsatisfactory replies form Japan;
and on 14 February 1933, the Japanese Government informed
the Committee that it was convinced that the
maintenance and recognition of the independence of
Manchukuo were the only guarantees of peace in the
Far East, and that the whole question would eventually
be solved between Japan and China on that basis. This
put an end to the Committee's deliberations and it
immediately reported to the Assembly.

<h3>The League of Nations Condemned Japan</h3>
</center>

The Assembly of the League of Nations, on 24 February
1933, adopted the report prepared for it by the
Committee of Nineteen condemning Japan as the aggressor
in the war between her and China, and making recommendations
for termination of that war. The Assembly reported
that for more than sixteen months the Council or the
Assembly had continuously tried to find a solution for
the Sino-Japanese dispute; however, the situation tended
constantly to grow worse, and the "war in disguise" continued.
It declared that "Through all its wars and periods
of 'independence', Manchuria remained an integral part
of China; and that a group of Japanese civil and military
officials conceived, organized, and carried through the
Manchurian independence movement as a solution to the
situation in Manchuria as it existed after the events of
18 September 1931; and, with this object made use of the
names and actions of certain Chinese individuals and took
advantage of certain minorities and native communities
that had grievances against the Chinese administration."
The Assembly decided that it could not regard as measures
of self-defence the military operations carried out on
the night of 18 September 1931 by the Japanese troops at
Mukden and other places in Manchuria; and that this
applied as well to the military measures of Japan as a
whole, developed in the course of the dispute. It also
stated that the main political and administrative power
in the "Government" of "Manchukuo" rested in the hands
of Japanese officials and advisors, who were in a position
actually to direct and control the administration. It

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--619--</i></center><hr><a name=page620></a><p>
<blockquote>

found that the vast majority of the population did not
support this "Government", but regarded it as an instrument
of the Japanese. The Assembly declared that
"It is indisputable that, without any declaration of
war, a large part of Chinese territory has been forcibly
seized and occupied by Japanese troops and that
in consequence of this operation, it has been separated
from and declared independent of the rest of China."
The Assembly found as a matter of fact; "While at the
origin of the state of tension that existed before 18
September 1931, certain responsibilities would appear
to lie on one side and the other, no question of Chinese
responsibility can arise for the development of events
since 18 September 1931." This was a finding of aggression
against Japan and a warning that similar conduct
would meet similar condemnation in the future.
Therefore, no person in Japan could rightly say thereafter
that he honestly believed that conduct of this
kind would be condoned. This Tribunal finds no basis
for disagreement with the report adopted by the Assembly
of the League on 24 February 1933.
<p>
The Accused SHIRATORI, who in his public announcements
was one of the foremost assertors of the
legitimacy of Japan's actions in Manchuria, expressed
the truth in a private letter to Arita, then Japanese
Minister to Belgium. Writing in November 1935, and
speaking of Japanese diplomats who favored conciliation
in international affair,s he said: "Have they enough
courage to return Manchuria to China, to get reinstated
in the League of Nations, and to apologize to the
world for the crime?"

<h3>Japan Withdrew From the League of Nations</h3>
</center>

Rather than fulfill her obligations under the

<blockquote>

Covenant (<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-6 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-6</a>),
Japan gave notice on 27 March
1933 of her intention to withdraw from the League. The
notice stated her reason for withdrawal to be: "That
there exist serious differences of opinion between
Japan and these Powers (The majority of the Members of
the League) concerning the application and even the
interpretation of various international engagements
and obligations including the Covenant of the League
and the principles of international law."

<center>
<h3>Invasion of Jehol</h3>
</center>

One day after the Assembly adopted its resolution
condemning Japan as the aggressor in China, she openly
defied the League by invading Jehol Province. Key points
along the Great Wall, such as Shanhaikwan and Kiumenkou,
fell into the hands of the Japanese as a result of the
fighting that followed the "Shanhaikwan Incident", and
the strategical situation of Jehol became very critical
prior to 22 February 1933. On that date, the Japanese
Army, in the name of the puppet State of Manchukuo, sent
an ultimatum to China, stating that Jehol was not Chinese
territory and demanding that Chinese forces in Jehol
Province be withdrawn within 24 hours. The ultimatum
was not satisfied, and the advance of the Japanese Army
began on 25 February 1933. The Japanese advanced in
three columns from their bases at Tungliao and Sui-Chung,
and did not stop until all the territory north and east
of the Great Wall was occupied and all the strategic
gates along the Great Wall were captured. ITAGAKI and
KOISO, as staff officers of the Kwantung Army, assisted in
the completion of the occupation of all Manchuria by
2 March 1933.

<h3>Tangku Truce</h3>
</center>

As a result of its advance to the Great Wall,
the Japanese Army was in a favorable position to invade
China proper; but time was needed to consolidate and
organize its gains preparatory to the next advance; to
gain this time, the Tangku Truce was signed on 31 May
19833. Commander MUTO sent representatives, vested with
plenary power and armed with a draft of the Truce, which
was prepared by the Kwantung Army, to negotiate with the
Chinese representatives at tangku. The Truce as signed
provided for a demilitarized zone south of the Great Wall.
The terms were that the Chinese forces would first withdraw
to a specified line. The Japanese were authorized
to observe by airplane from time to time whether the
withdrawal was complete; on being satisfied with the
withdrawal, the Japanese Army was to withdraw to the
line of the Great Wall; and the Chinese forces were not
to again re-enter the demilitarized zone.

<center>
<h3>Araki, A Popular Figure</h3>
</center>

The successful conquest of all Manchuria by the
Japanese forces made War Minister ARAKI a popular figure
among certain groups in Japan; and he was constantly in
demand as a writer and public speaker. In a motion-picture
adaptation of one of his speeches made in June
1933 and entitled, <i>The Critical Period of Japan,</i> he
stated the ideals of the Military and revealed their
plan to wage wars of aggression in order to dominate
all of Asia and the islands of the Pacific. Among other
things, he said: "Has peace reigned in Asia during the

<p><center><i>--622--</i></center><hr><a name=page623></a><p>
<blockquote>

last fifty years? What is the situation in Siberia,
Mongolia, Tibet, Singkiang, and China? Are the waves of
the Pacific really calm? Can we expect the waves of the
Pacific of tomorrow to be as calm as they are today? It
is the holy mission of Japan, the Yamato race, to establish
peace in the Orient with its ideals and power.
The League of Nations does not respect this mission of
Japan. The siege of Japan by the whole world under the
leadership of the League was revealed by the 'Manchurian
Incident'. The day will come when we will make the whole
world look up to our national virtues." (On the screen
was shown Japan and Manchuria in the center, then China,
India, SIberia and the South Seas). "Manchukuo, which
was founded by the revelation of Heaven in the form of
the 'Mukden Incident', and Japan will work together and
will secure permanent peace in Asia." He then defined
national defence as follows: "I would not adopt such a
narrow view that defence of the nation may be defined in
terms of geographic position. It is the mission of the
Army to defend the 'Imperial Way', in space, in time, in
enlargement and development, in eternity and continuity.
Our troops have fought with the everlasting spirit of the
song: 'The greatest honor is to die for the Emperor.'
Our Country is destined to develop in space. It is of
course expected of the Army to fight against those who
oppose us in spreading the 'Imperial Way'. Compatriots!
Let us look at the situation in Asia. Is it to be left
unamended forever? Our supreme mission is to make a
paradise in Asia. I fervently beseech you to strive
onwards united." (On the screen appeared the words:
"Light comes from the East!")

<h3>Section II.<br>
Consolidation and Exploitation of Manchuria<br>
Reorganization of Manchukuo</h3>
</center>

After the signing of the Tangku Truce, Manchukuo
was reorganized so as to strengthen Japan's control
over that puppet State and to facilitate the economic
exploitation of Manchuria in preparation for continuation
of the war of aggression against China and the waging of
wars of aggression against other Nations, who might
oppose her domination of Asia and the Islands of the Pacific.
<p>
The Japanese Cabinet decided on 8 August 1933
to "develop Manchuria into an independent Nation possessing
indivisible relations with the Japanese Empire."
Control of Manchukuo was to be "executed by Japanese
officials under the jurisdiction of the Commander of the
Kwantung Army." The aim of the Manchurian economy was
to be "the unification of Japanese and Manchurian
economies in order to establish securely the foundation
for the expansion of the Empire's economic powers to the
whole world." "Co-existence and co-prosperity of Japan
and Manchuria" was to be "restricted by the demands of
the national defense of the Empire." ARAKI, who was a
member of the Cabinet at the time this decision was made,
had defined national defense in no uncertain terms. The
concrete plan for the execution of this policy was to be
approved by the Cabinet only after careful investigation,
it was decided.
<P>
The investigations were not completed until after
DOHIHARA had been assigned to the Headquarters of the
Kwantung Army on 16 October 1933, and HIROTA had

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--624--</i></center><hr><a name=page625></a><p>
<blockquote>

become Foreign Minister on 14 September 1933.
However, on 22 December 1933, the Cabinet, with ARAKI
and HIROTA present, decided that: "It seems that the
Manchurian Government is considering a swift reformation
to Monarchy as soon as possible. It must be
made clear that the enforcement of the Monarchy is
not the restoration of the Tsing Dynasty, but the
foundation of a constitutional monarch; and all causes
of hindrances to the development of the national policy
must be nullified, especially to contribute to the
strengthening and expansion of the Japanese and Manchurian
national defense power necessary to overcome
the international crisis which we may encounter before
long." It was decided: that the General Affairs Board
of Manchukuo should be strengthened; that basic reformation
of the internal structure of the Government of
Manchukuo should be exercised, especially upon the personnel;
and that the "existing conventions and agreements
between Japan and Manchukuo should be acknowledged by
the Monarchy."
<p>
This, be it noted, was the Cabinet of Japan
formulating its decisions as to the manner in which Manchukuo
would be governed, a country which it was proclaiming
to the World as independent. The astounding
thing is that the pretence was still maintained before
us and supported by hundreds of pages of evidence and argument.
<p>
No better proof that this dependent status of
Manchukuo did not change can be found than the telegram
from Foreign Minster TOGO to the Commander of the
Kwantung Army UMEZU dated 4 December 1941, which was only
three days before the attack upon Pearl Harbor. In that
telegram, TOGO gave the following instructions: "On the

<p><center><i>--625--</i></center><hr><a name=page626></a><p>
<blockquote>

fourth, in a Joint COnference with the Government Control
Board, we decided upon steps which we will have Manchukuo
take in case the international situation turns critical.
Differing from what I said in my telegram No. 873, our
policy was changed as follows: 'When the Japanese Empire
commences hostilities, for the time being Manchukuo will
not participate. Because Manchukuo is closely bound up
with the Japanese Empire and because England and the
united States and the Netherlands have not recognized
the Government of Manchukuo, as a matter of fact,
Changchun will regard those three nations as de facto
enemies and treat them accordingly'."

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--626--</i></center><hr><a name=page627></a><p>
<blockquote>

The next step in the reorganization was the enthronement
of Pu Yi as emperor of Manchukuo. After the Cabinet
decision of 22 December 1933, General Hishikeri, who had
succeeded General MUTO as Commander of the Kwantung Army,
called upon Pu Yi and told him that he planned to convert
Manchukuo into an Empire. A new set of Organic Laws was
promulgated for Manchukuo on 1 March 1934. These laws
provided for an Emperor to rule Manchukuo and prescribed
his powers, however, they did not materially change the
general construction of the Government. Japanese continued
to hold important positions in the Government; the "Tuesday
Meeting" was retained as the policy making organ; and
General Yoshioka continued with his assignment of "supervising"
the Emperor, even to the day of his capture after
the surrender. On the day that the new laws were promulgated,
Pu Yi, after paying obeisance to Heaven at a temple
in Changchun, was enthroned as Emperor of Manchukuo. However,
he had no power. Although he was allowed to give
audience to his Ministers once a year, that audience was
carefully supervised by the Japanese Director fo the
General Affairs Board.
<p>
Having installed Pu Yi as Emperor of Manchukuo and
revised the laws of that State to facilitate its economic
exploitation, the Cabinet met on 20 March 1934 to discuss
the policy to be followed in carrying out that exploitation.
Although ARAKI had resigned as War Minister on 23
January 1934 to become a Supreme War Councillor, Foreign
Minister HIROTA was present at this Cabinet meeting. It
was decided that fundamental policy would be "based on
developing Manchukuo as an independent Nation possessing
an indivisible relationship with Japan, establishing
securely the base of Japan's world-wide economic expansion,
and strengthening Manchukuo's economic powers." Transportation,
communication and other enterprises in Manchukuo

<p><center><i>--627--</i></center><hr><a name=page628></a><p>
<blockquote>

were to be developed by special companies directly or indirectly
under the supervision fo Japan so as to contribute
to the "national defense" of the Empire.
<p>
As though to remove all doubt regarding Japan's intentions
toward China, HIROTA's Foreign Office issued a statement
on 17 April 1934, which has come to be known as the
"Hands Off China Statement" or the "Amau Statement", deriving
the first name from its contents and the second name
from the official who gave the statement to the Press.
Amau was not only an official of the Foreign Office, but
also its official spokesman. On 25 April 1934, Foreign
Minister HIROTA, during an interview with the American
Ambassador in Japan, on his own initiative referred to the
"Amau Statement"; he stated that, under questioning of newspaper
men, Amau had given out the statement without his approval
or knowledge and that the World had received a
wholly false impression of Japanese policy. HIROTA added
that the policy of Japan was complete observance and support
of the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty
(<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-10 target=txtwin>Annex No. B-10</a>)
in every respect. HIROTA's statement to the American
Ambassador was a private statement, not a public statement.
The "Amau Statement" was never publicly repudiated. Amau
was regarded by the expansionists as a hero for having
issued the Statement; and Foreign Minster HIROTA never
disciplined him for having issued the Statement without
authority of the Foreign Ministry. This Statement conforms
closely to subsequent developments in japanese foreign
policy; and the Tribunal finds upon the evidence that it
was an official declaration by the Foreign Ministry of
Japan's policy toward China at the time and was issued
for the purpose of warning the Signatory Powers of the Nine-Power
Pact that the Japanese Government would not tolerate
any interference with her plans in China.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--628--</i></center><hr><a name=page629></a><p>
<blockquote>

This Statement contained, among other things, the
following: "Owing to the special position of Japan in her
relations with China, her views and attitude respecting
matters that concern China, may not agree with those of
foreign Nations; but it must b e realized that Japan is
called upon to exert the utmost effort in carrying out her
mission in fulfilling her special responsibilities in East
Asia. We oppose, therefore, any attempt on the part of
China to avail herself of the influence of any other
country in order to resist Japan. Any joint operations
undertaken by foreign Powers even in the name of technically
or financial assistance at this particular moment after
the 'Manchurian and Shanghai Incidents' are bound to acquire
political significance. Japan, therefore, must object
to such undertakings as a matter of principle."

<h3>"Two-in-One" System</h3>
</center>

The Kwantung Army received a new Commander and a
new Vice-Chief-of-Staff on 10 December 1934, namely" MINAMI
and ITAGAKI respectively. These appointments heralded the
completion of the reorganization of Manchukuo and the
machinery for its control by Japan. By Imperial Ordinance.
the Japanese Government created the Manchurian Affairs
Bureau to deal with affairs concerning Manchukuo in all
Ministries. The Bureau was organized to correspond to the
new "Two-in-One" organization in Manchuria. The Commander
of the Kwantung Army became Ambassador to Manchukuo as
before, but the office of Governor of the Kwantung Leased
Territory was abolished and its duties were taken over by
the Director of the newly created Kwantung Bureau, which
was placed under the Ambassador. Thus, MINAMI became
Commander of the Kwantung Army; and at the same time, as
Ambassador, he controlled the Government of the Leased
Territories, the Embassy and the South Manchurian Railway
Company. Although the Manchurian Affairs Bureau came
under the Premier, the War Minister held the post of

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--629--</i></center><hr><a name=page630></a><p>
<blockquote>

President of the Bureau, so that the effective control
of Manchukuo remained with the Kwantung Army and the War
Ministry. MINAMI stated on interrogation that, as Ambassador,
his prime duty was "to preserve the independence
of Manchukuo." At that time, he advised the Government
"on such matters as agriculture, transportation,
education, etc." Upon being asked the question:
"In fact, your advice in substance was a direction;
was it not?", replied: "You might say so--Yes."
MINAMI was succeeded as Ambassador and Kwantung Army
Commander by General Ueda on 6 March 1936, who served
until he was replaced by General UMEZU on 7 September
1939. UMEZU held the post until 18 July 1944.

<center>
<h3>Manchurian Affairs Bureau</h3>
</center>

As mentioned, the Manchurian Affairs Bureau was
organized to deal with affairs concerning Manchukuo in
all Ministries, and set as the connecting link between
the Japanese Government and the "Two-in-One" Administrator
in Manchuria. It took charge of all matters concerning
the Kwantung Bureau, the foreign affairs of Manchukuo,
the corporations organized to exploit the economy of
Manchuria, the colonization of Manchuria by
the Japanese, cultural works for Manchukuo -- which
probably included the opium trade, and any other
matters concerning Manchuria or the Kwantung Territory.
By virtue of their positions as War Minister, the following
Accused served as President of this Bureau:
ITAGAKI, HATA and TOJO. Also OKA and SATO each served
as Secretary of this Bureau. The following served as
Councillors to the Bureau at one time or another: KAYA,
MUTO, SATO, SHIGEMITSU, OKA, UMEZU and TOJO.

<h3>Control of Public Opinion in Manchuria</h3>
</center>

In order to control the news coming out of Manchuria
and direct propaganda, the Kwantung Army Commander,
or "Two-in-One" control organ, organized all the Press
and news agencies in Manchuria.All the agencies, which
up to that time had been under the Japanese Government,
the Manchukuo Government or the Manchurian Railway
Company, were organized into an association, which was
known as the Koho Association. This association was
charged with the duty of rigidly supervising all domestic
and foreign news releases, and deciding the
policy and means of propaganda, as well as enforcing
that policy upon its member agencies and those agencies
not members.

<h3>Hoshino Became Director of the Economy of Manchuria</h3>
</center>

Under the new organization of Manchukuo,
HOSHINO became the undisputed ruler of the economy of
Manchuria. He began his training for this work when he
left Japan on 12 July 1932, at the instance of the Japanese
Minister of Finance, to accept an appointment as
a Commissioner in the Finance Ministry of Manchukuo. He
was told at that time that he was considered competent
for the position as Chief of the General Affairs Board,
the all-powerful agency of the Kwantung Army for control
of the Manchukuoan Government. He was advanced by successive
promotions to the position promised. Just before
the completion of the reorganization of Manchukuo,
he was appointed on 1 July 1934 as Chief of the General
Affairs Bureau in the Finance Ministry of Manchukuo.
Then on 9 June 1936, he became Vice-Minister of Finance
for Manchukuo. On 16 December 1936, he became Chief of
the General Affairs Bureau of the General Affairs Board,
where he served until his elevation to the high office
of Director of the Board on 1 July 1937.; He continued
in this office until relieved to become President of
the Cabinet Planning Bureau in Tokyo on 21 July 1940.
Any exposition of the economic exploitation of Manchuria
is essentially a story fo HOSHINO. When he
left Tokyo in July 1932 to become a Commissioner in
the Manchukuoan Finance Ministry, he took with h im a
trained staff to assist him in his duties; and he soon
became recognized in Manchuria as the Japanese official
in charge of economic affairs under the authority of
the Kwantung Army.

<h3>Economy of Manchuria Seized</h3>
</center>

At the very outset of the military occupation,
the Japanese seized control of the economy of Manchuria.
The first public utility seized was the railroads. All
the Chinese-owned railways north of the Great Wall, and
the monies standing to their credit in banks in manchuria,
were seized. All railroads were coo-ordinated, connected
with, and placed under the management of the Japanese
Government agency known as the South Manchurian Railway
Company. Electrical supply and distribution systems were
quickly taken over. All sources of revenue were taken by
force, and the revenues expended to finance the new Government.
The customs were seized on the pretense that Manchukuo
was an independent state. The Central Bank of Manchukuo
was established on 14 June 9132 to replace the old
provincial banks  and the Frontier Bank, whose funds were
used to capitalize the new organization. A new currency
was issued by the Central Bank beginning on 1 July 1932.
The telephone, telegraph and radio systems, being state
owned, were seized and placed under Japanese control. On
14 April 1932, special officers were appointed to take
charge of the Postal Administration; they had taken complete
charge of this service by 26 July 1932. In all of these
public services, Japanese officials and advisors were placed
in the main political and administrative offices and exercised
effective control of the organizations. The Japanese
Cabinet confirmed this practice in its decision of 11 April
1932. It was soon after this decision that HOSHINO was sent
to Manchuria. He was a recognized authority on fiscal and
economic problems, and was sent to Manchuria to organize its economy.

<h3>Kwantung Army's Economic Plan for Guiding Manchukuo</h3>
</center>

On 3 November 1932, after HOSHINO's arrival in
Manchuria in July, Chief-of-Staff KOISO of the Kwantung
Army, sent a telegram to the Japanese War Ministry outlining
his plan for "guiding" Manchukuo. He said: "The administration
shall be backed for the time being by inner leadership
of the Commander of the Kwantung Army and shall be
carried out with officials of Japanese lineage as its
leaders. Economically, co-prosperity and co-existence shall
be the basic principle. In the future, the system accompanying
the establishment of a unit for an economic 'bloc'
between Japan and Manchukuo shall be dept according to the
race coordinate to Japan and Manchukuo. In order to realize
the organization of the economy of Japan and Manchukuo into
a single 'bloc', we must realize industrially the idea of
'Fit Industry for Suitable Locality' both in Japan and Manchukuo
with the aim of abolishing the mutual customs
barriers." All plans adopted thereafter by the Japanese
Cabinet for the control and exploitation of the Manchurian
economy were based upon these ideas.

<center>
<h3>Economic Construction Program for Manchukuo</h3>
</center>

The day before the conquest of Jehol was completed,
that is to say on 1 March 1933, the Government of
Manchukuo promulgated an "Economic Construction Program for
Manchukuo". The Japanese Cabinet approved the essential
features of this "Program" in its decision of 8 August 1933
as related. In the announcement of the "Program", it was
stated": Efforts will be made to promote a healthy and
vigorous development of the whole national economy by applying
to capital such State control as may be necessary in

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--634--</i></center><hr><a name=page635></a><p>
<blockquote>

view of the evils of uncontrolled capitalistic economy and
by making the most of the uses of capital." It was
announced that economic development was to proceed upon
the following basic principles: (1) "To apply State
control and take measures in regard to the important
branches of economic activity, in order effectively to open
up the various national resources with which this country
is endowed and to promote a co-ordinated development in
all fields of economic endeavor; (2) To aim at the co-ordination
and rationalization of the East Asian economy,
to place the emphasis on co-ordination with the good
neighbor Japan in view of the economic relationship of
mutual dependence between the two countries, and to make
increasingly closer this relationship of mutual helpfulness."
In accordance with basic principles, it was announced
that the Government proposed "to make it a guiding principle
that important enterprises of the nature of national defense
or public utilities should be managed by public bodies or
special companies."
<p>
At the Japanese Cabinet meeting of 20 March 1934,
which was after the reorganization of Manchukuo and the
installation of Pu Yi as Emperor, the "Program" received
further sanction of the Cabinet, and it was decided that
those industries necessary for "national defense" should be
operated by special companies, which should hold a dominant
position in the business in Manchukuo, so that rapid development
might be expected. The organization and operation of
these special companies created monopolies in favor of the
Japanese and effectively defeated the "Open Door Policy"
in Manchuria. The united States and other Powers protested
this unwarranted violation of existing treaty obligations
intended to insure "equal opportunity" for trade in China.

<p><center><i>--635--</i></center><hr><a name=page636></a><p>

However, the Japanese Government disclaimed all responsibility
for the violation of treaties by Manchukuo on the
theory that Manchukuo was an independent State.

<center>
<h3>Japan-Manchukuo Joint Economic Committee</h3>
</center>

A Joint Economic Committee was established in
1935 by an agreement between Japan and Manchukuo. The
agreement provided that the Committee was to consist of
eight members, four from each country. Japan's members
were to be: Chief-of-Staff of the Kwantung Army; the
Councillor of the Embassy in Manchukuo; the Chief of the
Kwantung Bureau; and one member specially appointed by the
Japanese Government. It is to be noted that the Commander
of the Kwantung Army automatically controlled three votes
by this arrangement. Manchukuo's members were to be: the
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Commerce and Industry, and
Finance, and the Japanese director fo the General Affairs
Board. All questions before the Committee were to be
decided by majority vote. In answer to a question put to
him at the Privy Council meeting on 3 July 1935 during
discussion of the question of ratification of the Agreement,
HIROTA said: "I ask him (Councillor Motoda) to consider
the fact that three out of the four members of the Committee
from Manchukuo are Ministers and the remaining one is the
Director of the General Affairs Board, who is, and will be
a Japanese forever, I am confident. Although he is an
official of Manchukuo, he is a central organ assuming leadership
of that country. Therefore, in case of a difference
of opinion between the two countries, it cannot be imagined
that he will make any decision that will be disadvantageous
to Japan." The Committee was to deliberate on all questions
concerning the economic tie between the two countries and

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--636--</i></center><hr><a name=page637></a><p>
<blockquote>

supervise the Joint Holding Company to be organized by
Japan and Manchukuo later to control the industries of
Manchukuo; however, it was provided that matters important
to the economic ties of both Governments, but which were
in Japan's power, would not be discussed by the Committee;
and because they were not to be deliberated by the Committee,
those matters were to be made into unilateral
contracts binding only upon Manchukuo. HOSHINO became a
members of this Committee upon his appointment as Director
fo the General Affairs Board of Manchukuo. MINAMI was a
member from the time of the creation of the Committee in
1935 until he was relieved as Commander of the Kwantung
Army on 6 March 1936. UMEZU served on the Committee while
Kwantung Army Commander from 7 September 1939 to 18 July
1944. ITAGAKI, who became Chief-of-Staff of the Kwantung
Army on 23 March 1936, became ex-officio a member of the
Committee on that date. Thus, ITAGAKI was one of the
foremost figures in the construction of Manchukuo. Others
who served on this Committee while Chief-of-Staff of the
Kwantung Army were: TOJO, who served from 6 March 1937 to
30 May 1938, when he became Vice-Minister of War; KIMURA,
who served from 7 November 1940 to 21 April 1941. Upon
being appointed Vice-Minister of War, TOJO retained his
post as a member of the Committee, but in the capacity as
the Government Representative rather than as Chief-of-Staff.

<center>
<h3>Yen Bloc Organized</h3>
</center>

One of the first acts of this Joint Economic
Committee was to integrate the currencies of the two
countries. In November 1935, the yen block was established
and Manchukuo's currency was no longer base on silver and
was stabilized at par with the yen.

<center>
<h3>Release of Extra-Territoriality</h3>
</center>

The next important economic arrangement made by
this Joint Economic Committee was a Treaty which was
signed between Manchukuo and Japan on 10 June 1936. The
purpose of the Treaty appears to have been to give Japanese
all the benefits of Manchukuoan citizenship without imposing
on them the corresponding obligations. The Treaty
recited that its purpose was to abolish, by progressive
stages, the rights of extra-territoriality enjoyed in
Manchukuo by Japan. However, it recited that "Japanese
subjects shall be free within the territories of Manchukuo
to reside and travel and engage in agriculture,
commerce and industry, and to pursue callings and
professions, and shall enjoy all the rights relating to
land." A Supplementary Agreement went much more into
detail and set out at great length the rights of Japanese
in Manchukuo.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--638--</i></center><hr><a name=page639></a><p>
<blockquote>

One of these provisions was, "The government of Manchukuo
shall speedily take necessary steps in order that the rights
of lease by negotiation hitherto possessed by Japanese subjects
shall be converted into land-ownership or other rights
relating to land." Thus was settled the highly controversial
question involving the right to lease land growing out of the
Notes attached to the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1915. This was
very important, for Japan was colonizing Manchuria at a rapid
rate. Between 1936 and 1940, approximately 221,000 Japanese
migrated to Manchuria. By 1945, this number exceeded
1,000,000. Most of the Japanese men settling in Manchuria
were fit soldiers and were used to man new Divisions of the
kwantung Army. The land for settlement of these Japanese
was requisitioned at a nominal price, and the Chinese farmers
so dispossessed were moved and allotted undeveloped lands.

<center>
<h3>Industrial Bank of Manchukuo</h3>
</center>

The Industrial Bank of Manchukuo, which was organized
in December 1936, with a capital of 60 million yen, served
as an easy means of financing preferred industries to be
developed under the Japanese Cabinet Policy. This bank
handled all loans made for industrial purposes in Manchukuo.
The Manchurians were permitted to make deposits in
the Central Bank of Manchukuo and its branches,m but they
were not allowed to borrow from the industrial Bank; only
Japanese were allowed to borrow from that Bank. A law of
savings was enacted to force the people to save money and
deposit it in the Central Bank for the Japanese. At the
time of the surrender, approximately 600 million dollars
were in this Bank -- all the result of the compulsory
savings law.

<h3>Second Period Construction Plan</h3>
</center>

HOSHINO said during his interrogation that instead
of the haphazard development of the first five year
period from 1931 to 1936, it was deemed necessary that a
concrete, coordinated plan be formulated for the development
of Manchukuo. HOSHINO, working with various Ministries
of Manchukuo, the Cabinet Planning Bureau, the
South Manchurian Railway Company, and ITAGAKI as Chief-of-Staff
of the Kwantung Army, drew up an "Outline of
Five Year Plan for Industrial Development of Manchukuo",
which was completed in January 1937. HOSHINO says that
the Commander of the Kwantung Army had the "final say"
on all questions involving this plan. This Second Five
Year Plan followed the basic principles underlying the
First Five Year Plan, and laid emphasis on opening up resources
in Manchukuo and making them available for
"national defense", that is to say "war'. the outline
of the plan declared the policy with regard to mining
and industries to be, "that munition industries for
weapons of war, airplanes, automobiles, and rolling-stock
will be firmly established, and basic major industries
such as those of iron, liquid fuel, coal and
electric power will be developed, and emphasis will be
laid especially on the development of iron and liquid
fuel industries, which materials are necessary for
national defense."
<p>
This plan was adopted at a conference of Provincial
Governors and the Chiefs of the General Affairs Bureau
of the various Ministries in Manchukuo in January 1937.
On 17 February 1937, the Government of Manchukuo issued
its "Official Report on the Result of the First Period
Five Year Administration and OUtline of the Second
Period Construction Plan." The outline stated: "Five

In this period, the administrative and economic system
have been rearranged, and the second 'Five-Year Plan'
will be inaugurated in 1937, with which epoch-making
construction activity will be commenced dashingly."
In effect, the second plan of the Kwantung Army for the
exploitation of the economy of Manchuria was to be adopted
without change.

The Industrialist Aikawa was sent to Manchuria
to help direct the five year plan. He favored a hug
holding company to control all industries in Manchuria,
especially the heavy industries such as coal and steel.

<center>
<h3>Control of Industries</h3>
</center>

On 1 May 1937, Manchukuo promulgated a "Law Controlling
Important Industries", which was so drawn as
to provide for the licensing of "Important Industries",
practically all industries being classified as "important"
under the law, The law was promulgated in order
to coordinate the economy of Manchuria with that of
Japan. The "Essentials of the Give Year Program for
Important Industries" released by the Japanese War
Ministry on 29 May 1937 contained the following: "We
plan systematically to promote the activity of important
industries generally, so that by 1941, if anything
happens, our country may be capable of self-supplying
the important materials in Japan, Manchuria
and North China". The plan then went on: "In promoting
important industries for national defense, the
requisite industries should be pushed ahead to the continent
as far as possible according to the principle of
'Fit Industry for Suitable Locality'." It was in order
to enforce this rule of "Fit Industry for Suitable
Locality" that the "Law Controlling Important Industries"
was promulgated by the puppet Government in Manchukuo.

<center>
<h3>Manchurian Heavy Industry Development Corporation</h3>
</center>

The Cabinet decided on 22 October 1937 to establish
the Manchurian Heavy Industry Development Corporation
"in order to secure and advance the developing policy

only by Manchukuo, Japan and their nationals. The original
issue of stock was to be sold one-half to the Government
of Manchukuo and one-half to Japanese private interests.
The management of this company was to be "entrusted to a
powerful suitable person among the Japanese civilians. The
powerful suitable person among the Japanese civilians is
prearranged as Aikawa, Gisuke, the present President of
Nissan." The Directors and the President of the Company
were to be appointed by the two Governments. Pursuant to
this Cabinet decision, an agreement was entered into with
Manchukuo for the establishment of the Company.

<h3>Manchukuo a Work-House for Japan</h3>
</center>

The economic organization completed by Japan with
the organization of the Heavy Industry Development Corporation,
proved to be of benefit only to Japan and the
japanese. Its sole purpose was to make of Manchuria a
work-house for the production of war goods for use by
Japan. The effectiveness with which this purpose was
realized is vividly expressed by HOSHINO, the one man more
responsible than any other for such success; he stated
that Japan took everything out of Manchuria which could be
obtained. Since Chinese business men were not allowed to
enter important industries and were not allowed to make
loans, most of them went into bankruptcy. The Chinese
farmers lost their lands to Japanese immigrants. The
savings law reduced the Chinese laborer to working for mer
subsistence. The monopolies on rice and cotton deprived the
Chinese of adequate food and clothing, in order to furnish
the best rice and cotton for Japan's Army. A labor and
civil service law was put into effect by UMEZU while he was
Commander of the Kwantung Army, which required all persons 
between 18 and 45 to render labor service to the Japanese
Army in opening highways, digging mines, and constructing

public works. These laborers were kept in concentration
camps where they were fed short rations and furnished no
medical attention whatever. Heavy penalties were imposed
for escape. in the result a system was developed whereby
the Japanese came first, Koreans second, and Chinese last.

<h3>Opium and Narcotics</h3>
</center>

In order ot finance her operations in Manchuria and
also in order to weaken the power of resistance of the
Chinese, Japan sanctioned and developed the traffic in
opium and narcotics. As early as 1929, the National
Government of China was making an effort to fulfill its obligations
under the Opium Conventions of 1912 and 1925.
(Annex No. <a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-11 target=txtwin>B-11</a> &amp;
<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-12 target=txtwin>B-12</a>).
That Government had issued its
Laws for the Prohibition of Smoking Opium, effective as of
25 July 1929. The plan was gradually to suppress the production
and consumption of opium by 1940. Japan as a
signatory to the above opium conventions was obligated to
assist the Chinese Government in the eradication of the
drug habit by limiting the manufacture and sale of the
drugs within her territory and by preventing smuggling of
the drugs into China.
<P>
The principle sources of opium and narcotics at the
time of the Mukden Incident and for some time thereafter,
was Korea, where the Japanese Government operated a factory
in the town of Seoul for the preparation fo opium and
narcotics. Persian opium was also imported into the Far
East. The Japanese Army seized a huge shipment of this
opium, amounting to approximately 10 million ounces, and
stored it in Formosa in 1929; this opium was to be used
later to finance Japan's military campaigns. There was
another source of illegal drugs in Formosa. The cocaine
factory operated at Sinei by Finance Minister Takahashi of
Japan until his assassination in 1936, produced form 200

to 300 kilos of cocaine per month. This was one factory
that was given specific authority to sell its produce to
raise revenue for war.
<p>
Wherever the Japanese Army went in China, Korean and
Japanese drug peddlers followed closely upon its heels,
vending their merchandise without hindrance from the
Japanese authorities. In some cases, these traffickers
were sent ahead of the invading Army to prepare a way for
it by engaging in intrigue, espionage and sabotage; such
seems to have been the case in North China and also in
Fukien Province, where the Genki Plot was perpetrated.
Even the Japanese soldiers and their officers at times
indulged in this lucrative business of vending opium and
narcotics. The Japanese Special Service Organization was
charged with the duty of regulating the opium and narcotic
traffic in territories immediately following their
capture; and this organization in the Kwantung Army
became so involved in the illicit traffic under KOISO that
it was necessary for MINAMI, when he became Commander of
the Kwantung Army in December 1934, to abolish the
organization to prevent it from destroying all discipline
in that Army. DOHIHARA was one of the foremost officers
of this organization; and his connection with the drug
traffic has been fully shown.
<p>
The general principle of gradual suppression of the
traffic in and use of opium and narcotics was the underlying
principle, not only of the drug laws promulgated by
China, but also of the international Opium Conventions of
1912, 1925 and 1931
(Annexes No. <a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-11 target=txtwin>B-11</a>,
<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-12 target=txtwin>B-12</a>,
<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-13 target=txtwin>B-13</a>). Japan,
having ratified those Conventions, was bound by them.
Using this principle of gradual suppression to their
advantage, the Japanese promulgated Opium Laws in the
territories occupied by them in China; these laws ostensibly
followed the principle of gradual suppression by
licensing known addicts to smoke in licensed shops.

However, these laws were merely a blind or cover for
Japan's real intention and operations. These laws
created government controlled monopolies for the distribution
of opium and narcotics to licensed shops; and
these monopolies were nothing more than revenue collection
agencies, which encouraged the use of the drugs in
order to increase the revenue therefrom. In all areas
occupied by the Japanese, the use of opium and narcotics
increased steadily from the time of such occupation
until the surrender.
<p>
This was the procedure followed in Manchuria. In
the Fall of 1932, the Opium Law was promulgated by
Manchukuo and the Manchukuo Opium Monopoly Administration
was created as the administrative agency to enforce
the law. This agency was under the general supervision
of the Director of the General Affairs Board and became
one of the important sources of revenue for Manchukuo.
The reliability of the revenue form these sources is
attested by the fact that the Industrial Bank of Japan
was willing to underwrite the 30 million yen founding
bond issue secured by the opium revenue of Manchukuo
and negotiated by HOSHINO soon after his arrival in Manchuria.
<p>
This procedure was repeated in North China and
again in South China; however, the administrative agency
in those places was the <i>Ko-A-In</i> or China Affairs Bureau,
which maintained its main offices in Tokyo with branch
offices all over North, Central and Southern China.
These organizations created such demand for opium that
the Cabinet was forced from time to time to authorize
the farmers of Korea to increase their acreage devoted
to growing poppies. The trade became so lucrative that
Japanese trading companies, such as the Mitsubishi Trading
Company and Mitsui Bussan, were induced by the Foreign
Ministry to sign a contract limiting their trade areas
and the amount of opium to be supplied by them.

Japan's real purpose in engaging in the drug traffic
was far more sinister than even the debauchery of the
Chinese people. Japan, having signed and ratified the Opium
Conventions, was bound not to engage in the drug traffic,m
but she found in the alleged but false independence of
Manchukuo a convenient opportunity to carry on a world
wide drug traffic and cast the guilt upon that puppet State.
A large part of the opium produced in Korea was sent to
Manchuria. There, opium grown in Manchuria and imported
from Korea and elsewhere, was manufactured and distributed
throughout the world. In 1937, it was pointed out in the
League of Nations that ninety per-cent of all illicit
white drugs in the world were of Japanese origin, manufactured
in the Japanese concession in Tientsin, Dairen
and other cities of Manchuria, Jehol and China, always
by Japanese or under Japanese supervision.

<h2>
<a name="Heading6"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
<p>It is clear that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a></i> (Cth) ('the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>') operates on the common law in cases in federal
jurisdiction, but its precise effect is somewhat obscure. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 80</a>
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
So far as the laws of the Commonwealth are not applicable or so far as their
provisions are insufficient to carry them into effect,
or to provide adequate
remedies or punishment, the common law in Australia as modified by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and by the statute law in force in the State or Territory in
which the Court in which the jurisdiction is exercised is held shall,
so far as
it is applicable and not inconsistent with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and the laws
of the Commonwealth, govern all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in the
exercise of their jurisdiction in civil
and criminal
matters.</blockquote><p>Until recently, the High Court tended to concentrate on
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> (which applies the laws of the State and
Territory where a court is exercising federal jurisdiction), and to consider
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> only as an
afterthought.<a name="_Ref115581454"></a><sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup>
However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> has become the focus of attention following the High Court's
decision in <i>Blunden v
Commonwealth</i>,<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> which held that a
court exercising federal jurisdiction should properly exhaust the operation of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> before going on to consider
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79.</a><a name="_Ref110909269"></a><sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The difficulties in interpreting <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
include its relationship with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of that Act (particularly whether
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> applies statutory modifications of the common law, as well as the
common
law),<a name="_Ref99982650"></a><a name="_Ref111862656"></a><sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup>
and the meaning, if any, of the requirement that the provisions of a
Commonwealth Act be 'insufficient to carry them into effect,
or to provide
adequate remedies or
punishment'.<a name="_Ref100933561"></a><sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p> However, I do not propose to consider these difficulties in any detail.
Instead, I will focus on what seems to be the central function
of s 80
&#8212; to apply the common law in cases in federal jurisdiction (except where
the common law is inconsistent with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> or applicable
statutory law). Although that function is easily described, it is not at all
self-evident how that function is performed.
What exactly is the effect of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> when it provides that 'the common law in Australia &#8230; shall
&#8230; govern all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction'? After
explaining the
issues raised by this question, I seek to provide an answer. Briefly, I suggest
that although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> in terms seems to apply an independently existing
'common law', it could more accurately be described as a conferral of judicial
power to apply and develop the common law.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading17"></a><b>I.	CAN A COMMONWEALTH STATUTE APPLY THE COMMON
LAW?</b></h2>
<p>Despite the notorious ambiguity in the meaning of the 'common law', it seems
safe to say that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> applies the body of
unwritten law which is created and defined by the
courts.<a name="_Ref114303598"></a><sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup>
It also seems safe to say that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> applies the common law as decided from
time to time, rather than the common law as at
1903.<a name="_Ref100881415"></a><sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>The ability of a Commonwealth statute to apply the common law (as just
defined) raises two issues, which are considered in turn:</p>
<p>(1)	whether the application of the common law by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> interferes with
the separation of legislative and judicial power ('the separation of judicial
power issue'), and</p>
<p>(2)	whether the Commonwealth has legislative power to deal with the
subject-matter of the common law principles applied by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> ('the
subject-matter issue').</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading25"></a><b>A.	THE SEPARATION OF JUDICIAL POWER ISSUE </b></h3>
<p>The first issue is whether the application of the common law by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> interferes with the separation of legislative and
judicial power. This sort of issue has arisen for decision in two cases &#8212;
<i>Western Australia v
Commonwealth</i>,<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> and <i>Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd
(No 2)</i>.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading29"></a><b>(1)	</b><b><i>Native Title Act Case</i> &#8212;
<i>Native Title Act</i>, s 12</b></h4>
<p>In the <i>Native Title Act Case</i>, the High Court held that s 12 of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act 1993</a></i> (Cth) ('the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>') was
invalid. Section 12 provided relevantly that 'the common law of Australia
in respect of native title has, after 30 June 1993,
the force of a law of
the Commonwealth'.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading31"></a><b><i>Constitutional difficulties with
s 12</i></b></h4>
<p>The joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and
McHugh JJ held that there were several constitutional difficulties
with
s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.</p>
<p>&#8226;	First, s 12 could not validly invest the common law with the
force of a law of the Commonwealth. That would be either an invalid
conferral of
legislative power on the courts, or an invalid exercise of judicial power by the
Commonwealth Parliament.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 'further objection to
validity'<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup> arose if (as seems
likely) s 12 was interpreted as applying the common law of native title, as
developed from time to time. The joint
judgment stated that 'the Parliament
cannot delegate to the Courts the power to make law involving, as that power
does, a discretion
or, at least, a choice as to what that law should
be'.<a name="_Ref100023464"></a><sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, s 12 purported to diminish the legislative power of the States
confirmed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 107</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. The apparent reason for
giving the common law of native title the force of a law of the Commonwealth was
to engage <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, so that the common law would
prevail over any inconsistent State legislation. However, the joint judgment
held, a Commonwealth Act
cannot withdraw the States' power to override the
common
law.<a name="_Ref100468583"></a><sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the first two points are given as separate objections, they may in
fact be different aspects of the same difficulty. In other
words, it may be that
the question of whether a Commonwealth Act purports to confer legislative power
on the courts (or to exercise
judicial power by legislation) only arises when
the Act gives legislative effect to the common law as in force from time to
time.<a name="_Ref113763996"></a><sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading43"></a><b>Commonwealth Places Act</b><b><i>, s 4(1)
valid</i></b></h4>
<p>Significantly, however, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> <i>Case </i>indicated
that the Commonwealth could sometimes legislate by reference to the common law.
Specifically, the joint judgment stated
that the invalidity of s 12 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> did not cast doubt on the validity of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970</a></i> (Cth) ('the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i>'). <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)</a> provides that '[t]he
provisions of the laws of a State [defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3(1)</a> to include the
"unwritten" law] as in force at a time &#8230; apply &#8230; in accordance with
their tenor' in relation to a Commonwealth
place in that State. According to the
joint judgment, the reason that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> is valid, but s 12 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> is not, is because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> refers to the State
provisions</p>
<blockquote>
as a dictionary for reference in ascertaining the rights and duties under
Commonwealth law within Commonwealth places at the particular
time.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)</a> does not enact either the State statute law or the common law
as a law of the
Commonwealth.<a name="_Ref99812301"></a><sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It
will be necessary to return to these reasons for distinguishing <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i> from s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading50"></a><b>(2)	</b><b><i>Berbatis</i> &#8212; <i>Trade Practices
Act</i>, s 51AA</b></h3>
<p>In <i>Berbatis</i>, French J considered whether s 51AA of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a></i> (Cth) ('the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i>') had the
same problem as s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>. Section 51AA(1)
provides that '[a] corporation must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct
that is unconscionable within the
meaning of the unwritten law, from time to
time, of the States and Territories'. French J held that s 51AA was
valid. Briefly, his
Honour reasoned as follows.</p>
<p>&#8226;	First, French J observed that there were several longstanding
Commonwealth provisions that incorporate by reference elements
of the common
law, including <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup> Although these
provisions were not of course determinative of constitutional validity, their
long standing 'require[d] close attention'
to whether there were any relevant
points of distinction between s 51AA of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> and
s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Secondly, French J held that there was a significant difference of
degree between s 51AA(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> and s 12 of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>. Unlike s 12, s 51AA 'does not purport to
adopt the unwritten law &#8230; and give it the force of statute'; instead,
s 51AA uses
the unwritten law to determine what conduct is 'unconscionable'
and prohibits that
conduct.<a name="_Ref100754778"></a><sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup>
On the other hand, s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> transmuted judicial
decisions directly into Commonwealth law, and therefore 'was significantly
closer as a matter of degree to authorising
judicial legislation than
s 51AA'.<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, other provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> refer to
'unconscionability', but without explicitly tying its content to the unwritten
law; in particular, s 51AB (prohibiting unconscionable
conduct in relation
to the supply of goods or services) and s 51AC (prohibiting unconscionable
conduct in business transactions).
French J stated that it could safely be
assumed that these provisions were constitutionally
valid.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup> Crucially, the process of
decision-making under s 51AA was 'qualitatively so close' to those under
s 51AB and s 51AC that it followed
that s 51AA did not offend the
separation of powers principle
either.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although <i>Berbatis</i> was ultimately appealed to the High Court, the
conclusion upholding the validity of s 51AA of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a></i> was not challenged.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup> Two
points may be noted.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading63"></a><b><i>Validity turns on questions of degree</i></b></h4>
<p>First, French J stated that there is no 'express line of
logic'<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup> separating the valid
provisions from the invalid; instead, validity turns on questions of degree.
Significantly, his Honour upheld
the validity of s 51AA of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a></i>, even though his Honour considered that it would be 'too
simplistic' to describe s 51AA as using the common law as a dictionary to
give content to that provision.<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup>
Therefore, it seems that the explanation given in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>
Case</i> for why <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i> is valid
&#8212; because it uses the common law 'as a dictionary' for determining rights
under Commonwealth law<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p> &#8212; is not the only way that a Commonwealth Act may validly legislate by
reference to the common law.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading70"></a><b><i>No difficulty with 'unconscionability'
developing</i></b></h4>
<p>Secondly, French J did not see any constitutional difficulty with the
possibility that the common law meaning of 'unconscionability'
might develop
over time. His Honour stated:</p>
<blockquote>
The possibility that those classes [of unconscionable conduct] may expand
incrementally or by some sudden rationalisation of the
concept of
unconscionability at the level of the High Court does not put the judge in any
more difficult a position than  the judge
applying unconscionability assessments
of s 51AB or 51AC in the light of the common law or otherwise in accordance
with established
approaches to statutory construction.<sup>
</sup><a name="_Ref130702491"></a><sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This
statement is significant, because it seems that the fact that a Commonwealth Act
operates on the common law <i>as in force from time to time</i> is what gives
rise to the argument that the Act purports (invalidly) to confer legislative
power on the courts, or to exercise judicial
power by
legislation.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading77"></a><b>(3)	Commonwealth legislation and the changing common
law</b></h3>
<p>The second point in <i>Berbatis</i> (that s 51AA of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a></i> could validly operate on the unwritten law of
'unconscionability' as determined from time to time) might seem at first to run
counter
to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> <i>Case</i>. As noted earlier, one
difficulty with s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> was that the Parliament
could not confer on the courts a discretion or choice as to what the content of
a Commonwealth law should
be.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p> In my view, however, there is no inconsistency between <i>Berbatis</i> and
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> <i>Case</i>.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading81"></a><b><i>Two considerations supporting
</i></b><b>Berbatis</b></h4>
<p>Two considerations support the conclusion of French J that there is no
necessary difficulty with the content of a Commonwealth provision
altering with
alterations in the common law.</p>
<p>First, it is unlikely that the joint judgment in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>
Case</i> meant to lay down an absolute rule that the content of a Commonwealth
provision could <i>never</i> depend on judicial development of the common
law.<a name="_Ref100026904"></a><sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p> That sort of absolute rule could not be reconciled with the joint judgment's
statements that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i> was valid.</p>
<p>Secondly, it may be noted, by analogy, that the former national corporations
scheme involved each of the States applying the Corporations
Law enacted by the
Commonwealth 'as in force for the time
being'.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup> The High Court held in
several cases that the States had not abdicated their legislative
power.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup> Admittedly, the joint
judgment in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case </i>stated that different
considerations arise when a Commonwealth provision operates by reference to
judicial decisions, rather than
a text enacted by another
Parliament.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p> However, there does not seem to be any relevant difference in the breadth of
any discretion given to a body other than the Commonwealth
Parliament to vary,
indirectly, the content of Commonwealth law. Of course, it could be argued that
the implication drawn in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case</i> does not just enforce
the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Parliament, but also protects the
independence and integrity of the
judiciary.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> However, the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> guarantees the independence of the States from the
Commonwealth,<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup> as well as the
independence of the Commonwealth judiciary from the Commonwealth legislature and
executive.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading94"></a><b><i>Commonwealth Act cannot be completely
open-ended</i></b></h4>
<p>Instead, I would suggest, the relevant limit here is that a Commonwealth Act
cannot be so open-ended that it no longer determines
'the content of a law as a
rule of conduct or a declaration as to power, right or
duty'.<a name="_Ref100157237"></a><sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup>
Although this test requires drawing an analogy with the delegation of
legislative power on the executive, the joint judgment in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a> Case </i>itself draws that
analogy.<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup> The need for
legislation to be reasonably certain may explain why the joint judgment accepted
that a Commonwealth Act can validly
adopt 'a text which emanates from a source
other than the Parliament', and why it was a problem that the common law is not
contained
in a
'text'.<a name="_Ref100455169"></a><sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup>
Again, however, these passages in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case </i>need to be
read with the joint judgment's support for the validity of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i>.</p>
<p>Applying that analysis to <i>Berbatis</i>, the unwritten law of
unconscionability was significantly more settled than the common law of native
title, at least at the time
that the relevant provisions were enacted. The
likelihood and extent of any change to the content of s 51AA of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> was a matter of incremental expansion or
rationalisation,<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p> rather than a new examination of basic legal principles (as was the case
with s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i>).<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> This difference meant
that s 51AA was not 'unacceptably
uncertain'.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup></p>

law.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup></p>

of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i> from s 12 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title

<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> or other Commonwealth legislation). In <i>Pinkstone v The

McHugh and Gummow JJ stated that State legislation applying in a
Commonwealth place 'operates as a surrogate federal law'. This reference
to a
'surrogate federal law' strongly suggests that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the

<p></p>
<p>I will return to this question in the second part of this article, which
advances an alternative explanation of why <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
is valid.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading123"></a><b>B.	THE SUBJECT-MATTER ISSUE</b></h2>
<p>Apart from the separation of judicial power issue, there is also an issue
whether the Commonwealth Parliament has legislative power
to deal with the
subject-matter of the common law principles applied by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 80</a> applies to all cases in federal
jurisdiction, and (at least on its face) operates on all common law principles
that are applicable
and consistent with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and statutory
law. Those common law principles will sometimes cover subject-matter that is
outside the scope of the Commonwealth's
legislative power. Imagine, for example,
a common law negligence action between residents of different States, heard in a
State Supreme
Court. Although the case is in federal jurisdiction, it is
doubtful whether that fact alone would give the Commonwealth power to
alter the
substantive rights of the
parties.<a name="_Ref114299047"></a><sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></sup>
But <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> seems to supply the applicable law
&#8212; that is, the Australian common law of negligence. If that is valid, does
it follow that
the Commonwealth could choose a <i>different</i> common law (say,
the common law of New
York<a name="_Ref102299286"></a><sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>)? And if the Commonwealth can choose any common law, does it have power also
to <i>modify</i> the common law, perhaps by enacting a special code of
negligence applicable to cases in diversity jurisdiction?</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading128"></a><b>(1)	Comparison with </b><b><i>Judiciary Act</i>,
s 79</b></h3>
<p>A similar issue arises with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>, which
seems to apply all State and Territory statutory law to courts exercising
federal jurisdiction.<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a></sup> I have
suggested elsewhere with Andrew Beech that there are two ways of explaining the
apparent breadth of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a>, particularly in its application to State and
Territory legislation that creates substantive rights and liabilities
('substantive'
legislation).<a name="_Ref132172734"></a><sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#8226;	First, it might be that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
operates on 'substantive' State and Territory legislation in the manner of a
choice of law rule. On this analysis, the power to <i>apply</i> State and
Territory substantive legislation to cases in federal jurisdiction would not
include the power to <i>amend</i> that legislation. Rather, the Commonwealth
would be limited to directing the application of an independently existing
system of law
(that is, the legislation of the State or Territory where the
court is sitting).</p>
<p>&#8226;	Alternatively, if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> operates as a 'legislative
shorthand',<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></sup> then <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> might
not operate on 'substantive' State and Territory legislation at all. Instead, on
this analysis, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> would only pick up State and Territory legislation that
regulates the exercise of jurisdiction. Substantive legislation would apply
of
its own force, subject to inconsistency with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> or with

<p>As I will explain, however, neither of these analyses of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> seems to explain how the common law of Australia is applied
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of that Act.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading136"></a><b>(2)	Does s 80 apply 'substantive' principles of
common law?</b></h3>
<p>The second analysis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> can be quickly
discarded in this context. If this analysis were applied to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> would only apply common law principles that
regulated the exercise of jurisdiction, and would not apply principles of common
law
that deal with substantive rights and liabilities. However, most regulation
of the exercise of jurisdiction is contained in legislation,
such as rules of
court and so on.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a></sup> Even the
so-called 'inherent' powers of courts may in Australia derive by implication
from the legislation establishing the
court.<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a></sup> Accordingly, if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>
were confined to common law principles that regulated the exercise of
jurisdiction, then the scope of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> would be narrow
indeed.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p> (By contrast, even if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> were confined to State or Territory
legislation that regulates the exercise of jurisdiction, then it would still
have a significant
role to play.) Therefore, as a practical matter, the
alternative analysis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> &#8212; that it does not operate on
'substantive' legislation &#8212; seems unhelpful in explaining the operation of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80.</a></p>
<p>More fundamentally, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> applies State and
Territory legislation 'as federal
law'.<a name="_Ref99958215"></a><sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a></sup>
This creates the possibility that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> operates as a 'legislative
shorthand', which in turn would make it necessary to confine its operation to
State and Territory legislation
regulating the exercise of jurisdiction. (As
noted, it is doubtful whether the mere existence of federal jurisdiction would
give
the Commonwealth power to affect the substantive rights of the
parties.<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>) But the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case </i>suggests that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> could not
operate as a 'legislative shorthand' on common law principles, even if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>
were limited to principles that regulate the exercise of
jurisdiction.<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p> Accordingly, the possible reason for excluding 'substantive' legislation
from the scope of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> does not apply to

<h3>
<a name="Heading148"></a><b>(3)	Section 80 as a choice of law
rule?</b></h3>
<p>A more promising argument is that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
applies the common law in the manner of a choice of law
rule.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a></sup> This analysis would
explain how the Commonwealth can direct the application of a rule that the
Commonwealth could not have enacted
itself. It is strongly arguable that the
Commonwealth has power to select which (independently existing) law is
applicable to a dispute
in federal
jurisdiction.<a name="_Ref102299274"></a><sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading152"></a><b><i>Difference between s 80 and a choice of law
rule</i></b></h4>
<p>However, there is a significant difference between the operation of a choice
of law rule and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>. A choice of law rule
performs two roles: (1) it selects the law applicable to a dispute, and
(2) if the applicable law is that of
another law area, the choice of law
rule applies the content of the relevant rules of that law area as a rule of the
forum.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></sup> It may be accepted that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> performs role (1) &#8212; it, together with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a>, 'direct
where this Court shall go for the substantive
law'.<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[63]</a></sup> However, it must be
doubtful, in the light of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case</i>, whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> could validly apply the content of all applicable
common law principles as a law of the Commonwealth (role (2)). (By
contrast, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of that Act does apply the content of applicable State and
Territory legislation 'as federal
law'.<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>)</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading158"></a><b><i>Common law is not 'independently
existing'</i></b></h4>
<p>Indeed, there seems to be a deeper difference between the application of
non-forum law by a choice of law rule and the application
of the common law by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80.</a> When a choice of law rule applies the content of rules of another law
area, the court applying the non-forum rules is not part of
the legal system
that created those rules. Imagine, for example, that an Australian court has
jurisdiction over a common law negligence
claim arising out of events that
occurred in New York. The Australian court would apply the substantive law
applicable in New
York<a name="_Ref100653680"></a><sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[65]</a></sup>
(on this example, the common law of negligence). The conclusions of an
Australian court on the content of the common law of New York
are a matter of
evidence,<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[66]</a></sup> so the court in this
sense is applying an independently existing system of law. By contrast, an
Australian court applying the common
law of Australia is part of the system that
creates those rules, and therefore has authority to develop the common law
(within the
usual
parameters).<a name="_Ref102299000"></a><sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p> Accordingly, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> does not involve the
application of an 'independently existing' system of law in the same way as a
choice of law rule does.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref113441861"></a>Of course, in practice the two situations might
not be quite so different as this overview suggests. An Australian court may be
confronted
with ambiguities in determining the content of the New York common
law (although the court's conclusions would be findings of evidence,
not of
law). Conversely, an Australian court would be constrained by precedent in
developing the Australian common law. Even so,
there is an important qualitative
difference between these situations. An Australian court applying the common law
of Australia has
a legitimate role in developing the law, but that role does not
exist when a court is applying the rules of another law area through
a choice of
law
rule.<a name="_Ref116880967"></a><sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[68]</a></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading166"></a><b>C.	APPLYING THE COMMON LAW BY SECTION 80 OF THE
</b><b><i>JUDICIARY ACT</i> &#8212; UNRESOLVED ISSUES</b></h2>
<p>To summarise, the preceding discussion raises two unresolved issues about
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>. The first issue is how <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> can
provide that the common law 'shall govern' courts exercising federal
jurisdiction without applying the entire common law as a
law of the Commonwealth
(which would seem to be invalid). The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case</i> states that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i> is valid in its application to
the common law, because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> uses the common law 'as a dictionary' for
determining the content of the rights under Commonwealth law. However, I have
suggested
that, with respect, it is difficult to ascribe that effect to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places Act</a></i> (and by extension <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>).</p>
<p>The second unresolved issue is how <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> can validly apply common law
principles when those principles cover subject-matter that goes beyond the scope
of Commonwealth legislative
power. A possible analogy between <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> and a
choice of law rule seems to break down in describing how <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> applies the
content of the common law. When a choice of law rule selects a non-forum law, it
applies an independently existing system
of law. However, the Australian common
law is not 'independently existing' of an Australian court applying it, because
the court
has a legitimate role in developing the common law. Accordingly, a
different analysis is required.</p>
<p>The next part addresses these unresolved issues.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading170"></a><b>II.	A POSSIBLE ANSWER &#8212; SECTION 80 CONFERS
POWER TO APPLY AND DEVELOP THE COMMON LAW</b></h2>
<p>So far, I have described <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> as 'applying'
the common law. That description gives rise to the apparent difficulties with
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> just identified. If <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> applies the common law, is the common
law applied as a law of the Commonwealth? And how can the Commonwealth
Parliament apply common
law principles that it could not enact itself? In this
part of the article, I suggest that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> does not actually apply a body of
independently existing 'common law', but rather confers power on courts to
resolve disputes in
a particular way (by applying and developing the body of
unwritten law). The following discussion explains that analysis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>,
and then demonstrates why that analysis removes the apparent difficulties
identified in the first part of the article.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading172"></a><b>A.	SECTION 80 &#8212; A CONFERRAL OF POWER, NOT
A CHOICE OF LAW?</b></h2>
<p>Clearly, the nature of the common law is a large and complex topic, and a
full discussion is beyond the scope of this
article.<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[69]</a></sup> However, my argument is
quite limited &#8212; the statement in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
that 'the common law shall govern' can be understood as a conferral of power to
apply and develop the common law, rather than as
an application of the content
of common law decisions. Although this argument does not take a position on many
of the contested issues
concerning the common
law,<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[70]</a></sup> it does assume that
applying the common law is an exercise of government power. I should briefly
defend that assumption.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading176"></a><b>(1)	Applying the common law is an exercise of
government power</b></h3>
<p>The argument that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> confers power to
develop the common law presupposes that this power can be conferred by
Parliament. That presupposition reflects
the now widely-held view that the
common law is an exercise of government power, and not some 'brooding
omnipresence in the
sky'.<a name="_Ref100795526"></a><sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p> However, there is an alternative (and by now largely discredited) view that
judges merely 'declare' an independently existing body
of common law, and do not
'make' it.<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[72]</a></sup> Some vestiges of this
declaratory theory remain in the following passage from the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>
Case</i>:<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[73]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
But the common law is not found in a text; its content is evidenced by judicial
reasons for decision. Isaacs J explained in <i>Australian Agricultural Co v
Federated Engine-Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia</i> [(1913)
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1913/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1913] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=17%20CLR%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">17 CLR 261</a>, 275-6] that it is the declaratory nature of a judgment that
allows for the evolution of the common law:</blockquote><p>'A prior decision
does not constitute the law, but is only a judicial declaration as to what the
law is. The declaration, unless that
of a superior tribunal, may be wrong, in
the opinion of those whose present function is to interpret and enforce the
law.'</p>
<p>However, the declaratory theory of the common law sits uneasily with other
parts of the joint judgment in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case</i>. The joint
judgment states further that the courts 'create and define' the common law, and
that the content of the common law will
'change from time to time according to
the changing perceptions of the
courts'.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[74]</a></sup> Those statements seem
to acknowledge frankly that the common law does not exist independently of
judicial decisions. Indeed, if the
content of the common law did have some sort
of independent existence, then it is difficult to see how s 12 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> could have conferred legislative power on the courts (or
involved an exercise of judicial power by the Parliament), as held by the
joint
judgment.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading186"></a><b><i>Common law must conform to the
</i></b><b>Constitution</b></h4>
<p>This apparent rejection of the declaratory theory of the common law is not
limited to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case</i>. For example, statements that the
common law must conform to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i><sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[75]</a></sup> seem to
depend on the proposition that applying and developing the common law is an
exercise of government power. The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> only limits the exercise
of governmental powers, so there would be no need for the common law to conform
to constitutional requirements
if it were not
'governmental'.<a name="_Ref100795528"></a><sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[76]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading190"></a><b><i>Two points of clarification</i></b></h4>
<p>Two points should be clarified here. First, the rejection of the declaratory
theory of the common law does not undermine my argument
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> is actually a conferral of power to apply and develop the
common law. An argument that the <i>method</i> of making common law decisions is
separate from the decisions themselves is entirely consistent with the point
that the <i>content</i> of the common law does not exist separately from
judicial decisions. Secondly, to say that applying and developing the common law
involves an exercise of government power does not in any way impinge on the
independence or integrity of the
courts.<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[77]</a></sup> Even if courts are
'making' law when they apply or develop the common law, this function is
exercised without interference from the
legislative or executive branches of
government.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading193"></a><b>(2)	</b><b><i>Lipohar</i> &#8212; common law,
precedent and jurisdiction</b></h3>
<p>Having cleared away that preliminary point, the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> can be illuminated by considering the links between the
common law and other aspects of the exercise of judicial power, particularly
the
doctrine of precedent and the jurisdiction of courts. Those links were recently
considered (albeit in a case in State jurisdiction)
by Gaudron, Gummow and
Hayne JJ in <i>Lipohar v The
Queen</i>.<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[78]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading196"></a><b><i>Common law conspiracy and connection with South
Australia</i></b></h4>
<p>The appellants in <i>Lipohar</i> challenged their convictions in the Supreme
Court of South Australia ('the SA Supreme Court') of the common law offence
of conspiracy,
arguing that their conduct (which took place outside South
Australia) could not validly be punished under the law of South Australia.
The
High Court upheld the validity of the convictions, with Kirby J
dissenting.</p>
<p>All members of the Court accepted that a South Australian court could not
punish conduct that occurred outside South Australia unless
that conduct had a
sufficient connection with the State. (The point of disagreement between the
majority and Kirby J was therefore
whether the necessary connection
existed.) Within the majority, there were three different views on the point at
which this territorial
limit on South Australian law took effect.</p>
<p>&#8226;	<i>Callinan J</i> held that each State has a separate common
law<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[79]</a></sup> (which is a minority view),
so that a common law offence is an offence against the law of a particular
State.<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[80]</a></sup> On this approach, the
territorial limit applied to the offence
itself.<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Gleeson CJ</i> was prepared to accept that there is a single common
law of Australia,<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[82]</a></sup> but noted that
the penalty for that offence was contained in a South Australian
statute.<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p> On this approach, the territorial limit applied to the <i>penalty</i> for
the offence.<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ</i> held that there is a single common
law of Australia,<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[85]</a></sup> which meant
that a common law offence is an offence against the law of
Australia.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[86]</a></sup> On this approach, the
territorial limit applied to the jurisdiction of the SA Supreme Court,
which was only given jurisdiction 'in
and for the
State'.<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[87]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading212"></a><b><i>Common law and precedent</i></b></h4>
<p>Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ based their conclusion that Australia has a
single common law on the fact that the High Court is the
final court of appeal
in all matters, combined with the doctrine of precedent. This second feature
draws particular attention to
the way that common law decisions are made. Their
Honours
stated:<a name="_Ref100843540"></a><sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[88]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
The common law has its source in the reasons for decisions of the courts
<i>which are reasons arrived at according to well recognised and long
established judicial methods</i>. It is a body of law created and defined by the
courts. Whatever may once have been the case in England the doctrine of
precedent
is now central to any understanding of the common law in Australia. To
assert that there is more than one common law in Australia
or that there is a
common law of individual States is to ignore the central place which precedent
has in both understanding the common
law <i>and explaining its
basis</i>.</blockquote><p>In the 1960s, some members of the High Court adopted a
similar distinction between the content of the common law and its method to
explain why the Court was not bound by decisions of the House of Lords. In
<i>Skelton v Collins</i>,<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p> for example, Windeyer J stated that Australia did not just inherit the
specific rules laid down by English courts, but also 'its
methods and its
spirit', which took account of 'the creative element in the work of courts'. On
my argument, Australia and England
shared 'the common law' (in the sense of a
method of making decisions), even if the content of that common law was not
always identical.
(It should be remembered that, until 1988, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> required Australian courts to apply 'the common law of
England'.<a name="_Ref100881470"></a><sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>) However this result was justified, the Privy Council accepted in
<i>Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v
Uren</i><sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[91]</a></sup> that the High Court
could legitimately depart from decisions of the House of Lords. In
<i>Lipohar</i>, however, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ held that there was
no scope for a similar divergence in the content of the common law between
different parts of
Australia.<a name="_Ref101229375"></a><sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>The implications of this analysis for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
are as follows. If precedent has a 'central place' in understanding the common
law and explaining its
basis,<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[93]</a></sup></p>
<p> then the common law can sensibly be understood as a method, even though
certain features of the method (including precedent) encourage
the common law to
be identified with the content of the decisions themselves. Accordingly, a
provision such as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> could confer power on courts exercising federal
jurisdiction to resolve disputes using that method.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading226"></a><b><i>Common law and jurisdiction</i></b></h4>
<p>A second aspect of judicial power relevant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act</a></i> is the connection between the common law and a court's jurisdiction. In
<i>Lipohar</i>, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ reiterated that 'jurisdiction'
had 3 possible meanings: (1) the subject matter over which the court
has
authority to decide, (2) the court's jurisdiction over the person, or
(3) the geographical extent of the law
area.<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[94]</a></sup> In a court of general
jurisdiction, the various meanings of 'jurisdiction' were closely connected at
common
law.<a name="_Ref101059201"></a><sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#8226;	In <i>civil cases</i>, the court's authority to decide
(meaning (1)) would in personal actions depend on whether the defendant was
amenable to the court's
process
(meaning (2)),<sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[96]</a></sup> which in
turn would traditionally depend on whether the defendant was within the law area
(meaning (3)).<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>criminal cases</i>, the court's authority to decide (meaning (1))
would at common law depend on whether the act was committed within the law area
(meaning
(3)).<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[98]</a></sup> And the
court's authority over the person in criminal cases (meaning (2)) also
depended on the person being present in the law area
(meaning (3)).<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[99]</a></sup></p>
<p>By contrast, the approach of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in
<i>Lipohar</i> meant that the law area of the applicable law (Australia) did not
coincide with the extent of the SA Supreme Court's authority to
decide (matters
in and for South Australia).<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[100]</a></sup>
In other words, the 'settled jurisdictional rules' and the division of Australia
'into geographical and political units' was given
effect through limits on the
subject-matter jurisdiction of the court, rather than through limits on the
reach of the applicable
law.<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[101]</a></sup>
(It may also be noted that the connection between authority over the defendant
and presence in the law area is now affected by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/" class="autolink_findacts">Service and Execution of
Process Act 1992</a></i> (Cth) ('<i>SEPA 1992</i>'), for both civil and
criminal cases.<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[102]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>What does this mean for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>?
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 80</a> applies only to cases in federal jurisdiction, where there is
also a disconformity between the extent of the authority to decide
and the
extent of the law area. The disconformity arises because federal jurisdiction in
Australia is a national jurisdiction (even
for State courts exercising federal
jurisdiction),<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[103]</a></sup> but of course
is also limited to the types of matters listed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. The analysis in <i>Lipohar</i> indicates that, although the
common law of Australia is a national law, a court's power with respect to
common law rights and liabilities
is tied to the limits of the court's
subject-matter jurisdiction. Consequently, the Commonwealth can confer power to
apply and develop
this national common law consistently with the terms in which
federal jurisdiction is conferred on State
courts,<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[104]</a></sup> and without
circumventing the subject-matter limits on the jurisdiction of federal
courts.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading243"></a><b>(3)	Argument &#8212; s 80 confers residual
power to resolve disputes within jurisdiction</b></h3>
<p>These two points drawn from <i>Lipohar</i> lead to my argument of how
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> operates.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading245"></a><b><i>Grant of jurisdiction confers authority to
resolve dispute</i></b></h4>
<p>The argument relies on the general principle that the grant of
(subject-matter) jurisdiction carries with it the authority essential
to resolve
the justiciable controversy between the
parties.<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[105]</a></sup></p>
<p> That principle emerges clearly from cases discussing the accrued
jurisdiction of federal courts. As is well known, a federal court's
jurisdiction
over a federal claim gives the court authority to determine non-federal claims
that form part of the same justiciable
controversy, including common law
claims.<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[106]</a></sup> Although that result
is often explained by reference to the concept of a 'matter', I have suggested
elsewhere that these cases turn
on policy considerations such as avoiding
duplicity of proceedings, and encouraging finality in
litigation.<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>The principle that the conferral of jurisdiction carries with it authority to
resolve the dispute is even more important when federal
jurisdiction is defined
by reference to the identity of the parties, rather than the subject-matter.
When the Commonwealth is a party,
or when the parties are residents of different
States, the substantive law governing the dispute may have no connection with
Commonwealth
law at all.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[108]</a></sup></p>
<p> Accordingly, if the conferral of federal jurisdiction did not carry with it
authority to apply non-federal law &#8212; including
the common law &#8212; then
the exercise of jurisdiction deriving from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(iii)</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(iv)</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> could be
stultified.<a name="_Ref100904614"></a><sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[109]</a></sup></p>
<p>This general principle suggests that the Commonwealth could confer authority
on courts exercising federal jurisdiction to apply the
common law whenever that
was necessary to resolve disputes over which the courts have jurisdiction. That
authority would only be
necessary when the dispute could not be resolved by
applying the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> or statutory law (either Commonwealth, State or
Territory). And this is what <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> does &#8212;
it provides that the common law 'shall govern', except to the extent that the
common law is inconsistent with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> or with Commonwealth
legislation, or with the statute law in force in the relevant State or
Territory.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading256"></a><b><i>Constitutional source of power</i></b></h4>
<p>What is the source of power to enact such a Commonwealth law? Strictly
speaking, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> does not give the Commonwealth Parliament
power to confer judicial power as
such.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[110]</a></sup> Rather, the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to 'confer' original
jurisdiction on the High Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 76)</a>, power to 'define' the jurisdiction
of federal courts other than the High Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 77(i))</a>, and power to
'invest' federal jurisdiction in State courts <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 77(iii)).</a> In addition, the
Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate with respect to 'matters
incidental to the execution of any power
vested by this <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
&#8230; in the Federal Judicature' <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 51(xxxix))</a>, and power to legislate

<p>These constitutional provisions suggest two alternative analyses of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>, depending on whether applying and developing the
common law is seen as an aspect of subject-matter jurisdiction, or a power that
is exercised once the court has
jurisdiction.<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[111]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#8226;	On the <i>jurisdiction</i> analysis, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act</a></i> confers an additional jurisdiction to apply and develop the common law
when a court otherwise has jurisdiction over a federal matter.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 80</a>
is on this analysis supported by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 77</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Of course, the High Court's jurisdiction over <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75</a>
matters derives from the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> itself, not Commonwealth
legislation. As the High Court is the highest authority on common law issues in
Australia, the conferral
of original jurisdiction by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would seem to include implied authority to develop the
common law. Accordingly, with these matters, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary

of its own.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading267"></a><b>(1)	Commonwealth Parliament may confer, but cannot

<p>The apparent difficulties with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> arose if

<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> Case</i> raised a question whether a Commonwealth law that
applied the entire common law would be unacceptably uncertain, and it was not
clear
how the Commonwealth could apply principles which it did not have power to
enact. However, on my analysis, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> does not itself 'apply' the common
law; rather, it confers power on courts exercising federal jurisdiction to apply
and develop the
common law. Therefore, the common law is not used to determine
the content of a law of the Commonwealth. Moreover, there is no difficulty
with
the courts applying common law principles that go beyond the scope of the
Commonwealth Parliament's legislative powers. That
result merely reflects the
fact that the Commonwealth Parliament can only <i>confer</i> judicial power on
courts (in the sense just described), and cannot <i>exercise</i>
it.<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[113]</a></sup></p>
<h4>

apply and develop the common law would derive from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act</a></i>.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, although my analysis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> avoids the apparent constitutional difficulties outlined in
the first part of the article, it raises two further issues &#8212; one
statutory and one constitutional.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading275"></a><b>(2)	Reconciling analysis with language of
s 80</b></h3>
<p>The first, statutory issue is whether my analysis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> can be reconciled with the language of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80.</a> Consider,
in particular, the references in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> to the common law 'as modified by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and by the statute law in force in the [relevant] State or
Territory', which is said to govern courts 'so far as it is applicable',
and so
far as it is 'not inconsistent with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and the laws of the
Commonwealth'. Surely, it might be said, it is common law <i>principles</i> (and
not the common law method) that are modified by, or inconsistent with, the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and statutory law, and common law principles that are
'applicable'?</p>
<p>There are two responses. The first is that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act</a></i> was drafted at a time when the declaratory theory of the common law was
still accepted. In 1903, the common law was considered to
be an independently
existing system of law, although that theory is not accepted today. The second
response is that the courts will
prefer an interpretation that is valid over an
interpretation that is
invalid.<sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[115]</a></sup> It seems from the
first part of this article that there is a real question whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> could validly apply the entire common law as a law of
the Commonwealth. Accordingly, I would suggest, the relevant question is whether
this language in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> can be given some sensible operation if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> is
regarded as a provision that confers power to apply and develop the common
law.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading279"></a><b><i>Giving operation to language of
s 80</i></b></h4>
<p>Much of the language in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> could be explained as confirming the
parameters of the power to apply and develop the common law. To begin with, this
power is not
engaged until the courts have exhausted the operation of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and any relevant statutory law. And when courts apply or
develop the common law, the courts must ensure that this power is exercised
consistently with constitutional and statutory requirements. Admittedly, this
explanation runs counter to statements in <i>Blunden</i> that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> itself
applies statutory modifications of the common
law.<a name="_Ref113873765"></a><sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p> However, the result in <i>Blunden</i> can be explained as the forum's
limitation statute being applied as a 'second tier' common law choice of law
rule (that is, apply
the forum's statute if there is no applicable statutory law
in the place of the
wrong).<a name="_Ref113873766"></a><sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[117]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is more difficult to give some operation to the statutory requirement that
the common law must be 'applicable'. As a historical
matter, this requirement
may have been included in 1903 (when <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> referred to the common law of
England) to take account of the possibility that not all of the English common
law would be appropriate
for
Australia.<sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[118]</a></sup></p>
<p> That possibility is now redundant, given that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> refers to the common
law in Australia. Even so, the reference to the common law being 'applicable'
might confirm that the courts'
power to develop the common law should take
account of Australian conditions and circumstances.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading287"></a><b>(3)	Can the Commonwealth Parliament confer power to
develop the common law?</b></h3>
<p>The second, constitutional issue raised by my analysis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> is whether the Commonwealth Parliament can validly confer
power to <i>develop</i> (rather than merely apply) the common law. Although
there is no clear division between 'applying' and 'developing' the common
law,<sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[119]</a></sup></p>
<p> that sort of distinction is used in the US to define the common law powers
of federal courts.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading292"></a><b>Erie</b><b><i> doctrine</i></b></h4>
<p>The current US position derives from the 1938 decision of <i>Erie Railroad Co
v
Tompkins</i>.<a name="_Ref101056872"></a><sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[120]</a></sup></p>
<p> As is well known, the US Supreme Court held in <i>Erie</i> that federal
courts do not have power to develop the common law, to the extent that the
common law covers subjects beyond the legislative
competence of Congress.
Instead, when a case in federal jurisdiction requires a ruling on a matter of
'general' common law (that
is, non-federal common law), federal courts are
limited to applying or 'predicting' the common
law.<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[121]</a></sup></p>
<p> According to the Court, Congress could not give authority to federal courts
to develop or modify common law principles unless Congress
could have enacted
those common law principles
itself.<a name="_Ref101839482"></a><sup><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[122]</a></sup>
Thus <i>Erie</i> sees no necessary correlation between a federal court having
authority to <i>decide</i> an issue of common law, and having authority to
<i>develop</i> the common
law.<sup><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading302"></a><b><i>Could </i></b><b>Erie<i> be applied in
Australia?</i></b></h4>
<p>Clearly, some aspects of <i>Erie</i> are not relevant to Australia &#8212;
particularly its division between State and federal common
law.<sup><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[124]</a></sup> It might still be argued
that the single Australian common law is State law, and that the Commonwealth
cannot confer power to alter
a State
law.<sup><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[125]</a></sup> The difficulty with this
argument is in its premise, which seems to assume that the common law must be
'State law' simply because
it is not 'Commonwealth law'. As Professor Zines
notes, however, the common law is neither. Just as the High Court is a national
institution, the common law which that Court oversees is also
national.<sup><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[126]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there is another variation on <i>Erie</i> that is not so easily
dismissed. The argument would accept that the Commonwealth can confer authority
on courts exercising federal
jurisdiction to determine issues of common law when
those issues form part of the relevant 'matter'. (To this extent, the exercise
of federal jurisdiction would not be
stultified.<sup><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[127]</a></sup></p>
<p>) However, on this argument, the Commonwealth could not confer authority on
courts to develop or modify the common law unless the
relevant common law
principles came within the scope of Commonwealth legislative power.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading311"></a><b><i>Differences between US and Australian judicial
systems</i></b></h4>
<p>As noted, there would be a practical difficulty in distinguishing between an
'application' and a 'development' of the common law.
More fundamentally, any
attempt to apply this <i>Erie</i>-type argument to Australia would run up
against three significant differences between the US and the Australian judicial
systems.</p>
<p>&#8226;	Most obviously, the High Court supervises the decisions on common law
issues from all courts in Australia. Therefore, one
reason for the holding in
<i>Erie</i> &#8212; that the <i>US <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> did not give the federal
judiciary any authority to supervise the judicial action of the States &#8212;
does not apply.<sup><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[128]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> gives the Commonwealth power
to confer federal jurisdiction on State courts <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 77(iii)).</a> Consequently,
the authority of a State court to determine an issue of common law may in some
cases depend on Commonwealth, rather
than State,
law.<sup><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[129]</a></sup> Therefore, if the
<i>Erie</i>-type argument were correct, this limitation would apply to a State
court exercising federal jurisdiction, as well as federal courts.
Thus a State
court exercising federal jurisdiction could not develop the common law, but the
same court exercising State jurisdiction
could. And if a federal issue were
raised for the first time on appeal, it would mean that the appellate State
court did not have
power to develop the common law, although the trial judge
did. Neither seems to be a desirable
result.<sup><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[130]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, it should be remembered that the highest Australian authority on all
common law issues (the High Court) also has original
jurisdiction.<sup><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[131]</a></sup> As noted
earlier, the original jurisdiction conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(iii)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(iv)</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> may well raise issues of common law. It can hardly be
supposed that the highest authority on common law issues could not develop
the
common law when exercising its original jurisdiction conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75.</a> And
if the jurisdiction conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(iii)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(iv)</a> includes power
to develop the common law, surely the Commonwealth could also confer that power
on the High Court when it is exercising
the types of federal jurisdiction
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> (which require Commonwealth
legislation to confer).<sup><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[132]</a></sup></p>
<p> And if the Commonwealth can validly confer power to develop the common law
when conferring jurisdiction on the High Court, would
it make sense if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 77</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> prohibited the Commonwealth, impliedly, from
conferring this power when conferring the same federal jurisdiction on other
courts?</p>
<p>I would suggest that these three differences, in combination, mean this
<i>Erie</i>-type argument should not be applied to Australia.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading324"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p>This article has examined the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>
when it provides that 'the common law in Australia &#8230; shall &#8230; govern
all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction'. Although
it might be thought that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> applies an independently existing body of law, that analysis seems to
lead to constitutional difficulties. Instead, I have suggested
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>
confers power on courts exercising federal jurisdiction to resolve disputes by
applying and developing the common law, when the dispute
cannot be resolved by
applying the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> or statutory law. Although that analysis does
not perhaps sit easily with the language of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>, it ensures that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>
is constitutionally valid. There is a possible argument, based on the US
decision of <i>Erie</i>, that Commonwealth legislation could only confer power
to <i>apply</i> the common law, but not to <i>develop</i> it. However, that
argument should not be accepted, because of the differences between the US and
Australian judicial systems.</p>
<p>It might then be objected that this proposed analysis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> reduces the provision to a statement of the blindingly
obvious.<a name="_Ref104019318"></a><sup><a name="fnB134" href="#fn134">[133]</a></sup></p>
<p> A sceptic might say that of course the grant of jurisdiction carries with it
the necessary powers to resolve the dispute, so there
could never be any
question that courts exercising federal jurisdiction in Australia can apply and
develop the common law when appropriate.
One response is that it is preferable
to give <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> an operation that is valid, but
obvious, rather an alternative operation of at least contestable validity. There
are several further
responses.</p>
<p>&#8226;	First, although there was no lack of legislation in colonial
Australia, many important areas of law were governed largely
or entirely by the
common law in 1903 (such as contract and
tort).<sup><a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[134]</a></sup> Certain classes of
federal jurisdiction were therefore likely to involve determining issues of
common law, particularly matters involving
the Commonwealth, and matters between
residents of different States. For these matters, the power to apply and develop
the common
law was too central to be left to implication.</p>
<p>Secondly, <i>Abebe v
Commonwealth</i><a name="_Ref101231982"></a><sup><a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[135]</a></sup>
establishes that, although the Commonwealth <i>can</i> confer authority on
federal courts to resolve an entire justiciable controversy, it does not have
to. It is therefore theoretically
possible (but unlikely as a matter of policy)
that the Commonwealth could confer federal jurisdiction without including the
authority
to apply or develop the common
law.<sup><a name="fnB137" href="#fn137">[136]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thirdly, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> confirms that the creation of
a federal judicial system did not require a division between 'federal' and
'State' common law. That
is important, because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of that Act applies the
laws of the State or Territory in which the court is
sitting.<sup><a name="fnB138" href="#fn138">[137]</a></sup> Without <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>,
there might have been a question whether the reference in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> to the 'laws
of each State or Territory' included a common law peculiar to that State or
Territory.<a name="_Ref100971899"></a><sup><a name="fnB139" href="#fn139">[138]</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, my analysis may bear upon other questions raised by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i>. Returning to the examples given at the beginning of
the article, this analysis suggests that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> does not itself apply
statutory modifications of the common
law.<sup><a name="fnB140" href="#fn140">[139]</a></sup></p>
<p> That in turn suggests that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> should be
applied before <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>, because it would be most surprising if the
Commonwealth Parliament intended common law doctrines to have priority over
State or
Territory
legislation.<sup><a name="fnB141" href="#fn141">[140]</a></sup></p>
<p> Similarly, on this analysis, the requirement that the provisions of a
Commonwealth Act be 'insufficient to carry them into effect,
or to provide
adequate remedies or punishment' simply describes the parameters of the power to
apply and develop the common law,
and mirrors the proviso that the common law is
not applied if it is inconsistent with Commonwealth
legislation.<sup><a name="fnB142" href="#fn142">[141]</a></sup></p>
<p> Moving beyond those examples, the Australian Law Reform Commission has
recommended that s 79 and s 80 be combined into a single
provision.<sup><a name="fnB143" href="#fn143">[142]</a></sup></p>
<p> If s 80 is a conferral of judicial power (as I suggest), then it
operates quite differently from s 79, which applies State and Territory
statutory law as a law of the Commonwealth. That difference would be usefully
kept in mind when drafting any amendments. Accordingly,
the issue examined in
this article is not just the product of a mind that is unhappy unless it can
find a problem for every solution,
but is rather an issue of practical
importance.</p>

although that issue did not arise in

accordance with Commonwealth legislation (the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hcoaa1979233/" class="autolink_findacts">High Court of Australia Act
1979</a></i> (Cth)) and is federal in that sense.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn130" href="#fnB130">[129]</a></sup> 	Indeed, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> has the effect that, when a case comes within any of the
categories of federal jurisdiction, the <i>only</i> authority State courts have
to determine the case derives from Commonwealth law: see <i>Felton v
Mulligan</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20124%20CLR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 124 CLR 367</a>, 373 (Barwick CJ), 411&#8211;413
(Walsh J); see also 393 (Windeyer J); <i>Edensor Nominees</i> (2000)
204 CLR 559, 571 [7] (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ, with
Hayne and Callinan JJ agreeing); <i>APLA Limited v Legal Services
Commissioner (NSW)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2005/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[2005] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282005%29%20219%20ALR%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2005) 219 ALR 403</a>, 460 [232] (Gummow J). By
contrast, in the US, State courts determine cases raising federal subject-matter
pursuant to authority
granted by State law, not federal law: see generally
Richard H Fallon Jr, Daniel J Meltzer and David L Shapiro,
<i>Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System</i>
(4<sup>th</sup> ed 1996) 450&#8211;5.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn131" href="#fnB131">[130]</a></sup> 	Particularly given that
there have been times when State courts have not appreciated that they were
exercising federal jurisdiction:
see, eg, <i>British American Tobacco Australia
Ltd v Western Australia</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2003/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[2003] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282003%29%20217%20CLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2003) 217 CLR 30</a>, 41 [3] (Gleeson CJ), 50
[35] (McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ, with Callinan J agreeing).</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn132" href="#fnB132">[131]</a></sup> 	The US Supreme Court
also has original jurisdiction but, unlike the High Court, it is not a court of
general appellate jurisdiction.
 Accordingly, since <i>Erie</i>, even the
US Supreme Court may only predict or apply State common law in cases coming
within the Court's original jurisdiction.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn133" href="#fnB133">[132]</a></sup> 	Imagine, for example,
that <i>Pfeiffer</i> had been commenced in the High Court's original
jurisdiction. Although the case raised constitutional objections to the former
'double
actionability' rule (and thus involved the interpretation of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76(i))</a>, the Court could have responded by
merely changing the common law. (And indeed <i>Pfeiffer</i> did only alter the
common law: see Justice Gummow, above n <a href="3.html#_Ref110909269">3</a>, 180.)</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn134" href="#fnB134">[133]</a></sup> 	The joint judgment in
<i>Pfeiffer</i> notes an issue whether, in the absence of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a>, choice of
law rules would 'nevertheless apply in federal jurisdiction as part of the
ultimate constitutional foundation': <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2000/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[2000] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%20203%20CLR%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2000) 203 CLR 503</a>, 531 [56]
(Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). Similarly, Pryles
and Hanks suggest that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> 'may
only be declaratory of the situation that would exist in their absence': above
n <a href="3.html#_Ref102299274">61</a>, 179 [5.2.3].</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn135" href="#fnB135">[134]</a></sup> 	For example, Professor
Finn (as he then was) stated that 'we were born to statutes', although he also
noted that there was a proliferation
of statute law in the 1970s: Paul Finn,
'Statutes and the Common Law' (1992) 22 <i>University of Western Australia
Law Review</i> 7, 8, 11.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn136" href="#fnB136">[135]</a></sup> 	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20197%20CLR%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 197 CLR 510.</a> The
High Court (by majority) upheld the validity of Commonwealth provisions that
gave the Federal Court power to review migration
decisions on some grounds, but
not others.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn137" href="#fnB137">[136]</a></sup> 	Compare the observation
by French J that it would be possible expressly to exclude a federal
court's accrued jurisdiction by statute:
Robert French, 'Federal Courts Created
by Parliament' in Brian Opeskin and Fiona Wheeler (eds), <i>The Australian
Federal Judicial System</i> (2000) 123, 143.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn138" href="#fnB138">[137]</a></sup> 	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 79</a>
relevantly provides: 'The laws <i>of each</i> State or Territory &#8230; shall,
except as otherwise provided by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> or the laws of the
Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction<i> in
that</i> <i>State or Territory</i> &#8230;' (emphasis added).</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn139" href="#fnB139">[138]</a></sup> 	Some earlier cases
stated that common law choice of law rules were picked up by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a>, although
it was not suggested that the common law varied between different parts of
Australia: see <i>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for the State of New South
Wales  v Brown</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1958/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1958] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%20100%20CLR%2032" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 100 CLR 32</a>, 39 (Dixon J); <i>Pedersen v

More recent
authorities, however, indicate that the common law is not picked up by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a>, because it is not a law 'of' a State or Territory: see, eg,
<i>Mewett</i> (1997) 191 CLR 471, 526 (Gaudron J); see also
<i>Blunden</i> (2003) 218 CLR 330, 339 [18] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne

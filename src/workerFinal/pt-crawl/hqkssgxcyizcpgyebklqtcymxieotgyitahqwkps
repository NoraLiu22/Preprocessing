<h3>Jewish Role in Iraqi Music</h3>
<p>by<b> Yeheskel Kojaman </b></p>
<p>The Iraqi Jewish community settled in Iraq long before the Arabs occupied the 
  country.</p>
<p> Jews mastered the Arabic language quickly, and participated in all fields 
  of life. The leaders of the community were treated with great respect by the 
  Khalifs.</p>
<p> This article deals mainly with the role of the Jews in music during the first 
  half of the 20th century. The Jewish community in Iraq liked instrumentalists 
  and treated them with respect for their skills and their artistic talents. Thus, 
  during the first half of the twentieth century, Jews were virtually the only 
  instrumental players in Iraq. They were the musicians of the Iraqi people. In 
  1932, for example, all the instrumentalists who attended the first Arabic music 
  congress in Cairo were Jews, while the singer, Mohammed Al-Qebbantchi was Moslem. 
  At that Conference the Iraqi ensemble received the first prize from King Fuad. 
  When Iraq Radio was first established in Iraq in 1936, the entire instrumental 
  ensemble, apart from the percussion player, was Jewish. Almost all instrumentalists 
  in the night-clubs of Baghdad were Jews. For this reason, on Yom Kippur and 
  Tish'a 'be-Ab, the two most solemn days in the Jewish calendar when Jews did 
  not play music, no live music was broadcast on Iraq Radio; only records were 
  played.</p>
<p> During the late 1920's, an instrumental ensemble at a night-club consisted 
  of violin, qanum (plucked trapezoid zither), ud (middle-eastern lute) and two 
  percussion players. Only in the broadcasting station were cello and nay (flute) 
  introduced.</p>
<p> Singers, both men and women, were of different religions - Moslems, Jews and 
  some Christians. The most famous woman singer, since the early 1930's, was a 
  Jewish vocalist called Salima Pasha (later Salima Murad). At the time, it was 
  considered shameful for a woman to sing in public, so that no respectable family 
  would allow their daughter to become a professional singer. Thus, a situation 
  existed whereby women singers (and dancers) were recruited from local brothels 
  from among those who had musical talent. Despite this, Salima Murad was loved 
  and respected; she was asked to sing at numerous private parties where she earned 
  a high fee. She is known to have helped many people financially, and by interceding 
  on their behalf at Government level when necessary. </p>
<p>In 1936, an institute was started for the teaching of instruments, singing 
  and acting, but most of its instrumental classes were for brass and other western 
  instruments, such as piano and violin. The only eastern instrument to be taught 
  was the ud (middle-eastern lute). However, another institution, the school for 
  blind Jewish children existed since the late 1920's. It was started so as to 
  teach these children a profession - such as weaving, and the making of brushes, 
  cane seats and cradles of rope - to save them from the usual fate of begging. 
  Most of the children liked music, and the school provided them with instrumental 
  lessons. Many of the students became musicians in Iraq, and later, as part of 
  the Arabic Music Ensemble Qol Yisrael (Israel Radio), was formed of these blind 
  musicians. The term "Art Music" is used to denote all music which is pre-composed, 
  and thus in most cases has a known composer; it is distinct from folk music. 
  In Iraq, there are two traditions of art music as sung and played in the big 
  cities such as Baghdad, Mosul and Basra.</p>
<p> <b>1. Modern Music </b></p>
<p>This tradition is identical with music sung and played in all other Arab countries. 
  In vocal music, it was Egypt that dictated the new repertoire. Composers and 
  singers of new songs appeared first in Egypt, which became the leader in the 
  development of the "modern music" style. The new repertoire then spread to other 
  Arab countries. It was only in the late 1920's that Egyptian musicians began 
  to compose new instrumental pieces.</p>
<p> In Iraq, new compositions emerged somewhat later than in Egypt. Until the 
  early 1920's, there were no famous composers, except for Ezra Aharon, an ud 
  player who was one of the musicians in the group that represented Iraq in the 
  1932 Congress of Arabic Music at Cairo; he later became famous in the Middle-East 
  Broadcast (from Cyprus), and later (first in Palestine) and then in Israel, 
  as the director of the Arabic Music Ensemble for Israel Radio. </p>
<p>During the 1920's, two brothers began to gain prominence in the field of music 
  in Iraq; the Kuwaiti brothers - Salih, a violin player, and Dawud, an ud player. 
  Almost at the same time, the name of a woman singer, Salima Pasha (then Salima 
  Murad) began to achieve fame. The brothers, Salih and Dawud el-Kuwaiti began 
  to perform and to compose new songs for Salima. Salih became the most prominent 
  musician in Iraq, and Salima became the most famous singer. Following the opening 
  of the Iraqi Broadcast Station in 1936. Salih was asked to form the official 
  music ensemble for the radio station. It was due to him, that two instruments, 
  the cello and nay (flute), were introduced for the first time into the instrumental 
  music ensemble.</p>
<p> <b>2. Iraqi Maqam</b></p>
<p>In Iraq, this second tradition of art music is known as Iraqi Maqam. No other 
  Arab country had encountered this form of music until the Congress of Cairo 
  in 1932. </p>
<p>The Maqam tradition in Iraq is in fact, a composed repertoire of about sixty 
  songs, to be performed by a solo singer accompanied by an instrumental ensemble, 
  the latter being known as the Chalghi Baghdad. In the past, the Maqam (pl. maqamat) 
  was also sung without instrumental accompaniment. Most Maqamat were composed 
  before the twentieth century. Some were composed by known composers, for example, 
  Ahmed Zaidan and Mohammed Al-Qebbantchi (both twentieth century composers), 
  and some are anonymous. These songs are transmitted orally from one singer to 
  another, and on the whole are sung as the original composer composed and performed 
  it. </p>
<p>All these songs were composed according to a strict set of rules which they 
  share in common, and any new Maqam must be composed according to the same set 
  of rules.</p>
<p> The Maqam is usually formed of three sections - the tahrir (introduction), 
  the matan (the text of the poem) and the tasliim (conclusion). Generally, they 
  are all sung with instrumental accompaniment. </p>
<p>The Maqam is often followed by a light song called pasta. The instruments that 
  are used to accompany the maqam singer, differ from those used in the Modern 
  Music tradition. The maqam ensemble, called the chalghi, consists of a santur 
  (struck dulcimer), a kamana-joza (a four-string spike fiddle; body constructed 
  from a coconut shell) and two percussion instruments, the daff (frame drum, 
  with metal discs) and dumbuk (goblet-shaped drum; also known as "tabla" in Egypt. 
</p>
<p>During the end of the nineteenth century and until about the beginning of the 
  1950's the chalghi instrumentalists were exclusively Jewish. This profession 
  was strictly a "family business." During this period, there were two such chalghi 
  ensembles in Baghdad - the Patao ensemble and the Bassoun ensemble. </p>
<p>Maqamat were sometimes sung in coffee houses. Traditionally, though, they were 
  performed at family celebrations; at such celebrations they performed until 
  morning. At such performances, the maqamat were divided into five groups known 
  as "chapters." Each chapter is composed of four to six maqamat, based on different 
  melodic modes. These maqamat are generally sung in the same order, and are not 
  repeated in another chapter. </p>
<p>Each maqam is followed by a "pasta." There are many pastat in the same melodic 
  mode, and the singer may choose any one of them. The texts are mainly popular 
  dialect. The pasta gives the audience an interval of light music during which 
  they can clap, accompany the singer and even dance, changing the atmosphere 
  from the very serious attention which is demanded during the singing of the 
  maqam. </p>
<p>The majority of Iraqi Jews emigrated to Israel during 1950/51. All the Jewish 
  musicians emigrated as well, except for some of the women singers, such as Salima 
  Murad, Sultana Yusef, Nadhima Ibrahim. Musically, it was a difficult period 
  in Iraq, as there were insufficient musicians, but the problem was initially 
  solved by using graduates of the Institute of Fine Arts and by borrowing musicians 
  from other Arab countries. Later, many musicians and composers in modern music 
  appeared, and any new maqam singers and chalghi players were trained at the 
  Institute, which opened a special branch for teaching maqam.</p>
<p> In Israel, the situation for the Iraqi musicians was also difficult. In Iraq, 
  their numbers had been sufficient to play to the millions of Iraqi people, but 
  in Israel they found themselves limited to an audience of only tens of thousands 
  - and an audience that is diminishing day by day, because the old are dying 
  and the young are now accustomed to Israeli music. </p>
<p>There was only one Arabic music ensemble in Qol Yisrael (Israeli radio); the 
  ensemble originally consisted solely of Iraqi musicians most of them young graduates 
  of the School for Blind Children in Baghdad. Salih and Dawud el-Kuwaiti continued 
  to play and compose and sing in addition to their regular work to earn their 
  living, outside the music profession. Music was part of their life, and they 
  continued to play and sing to their last day. </p>

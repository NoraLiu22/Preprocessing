<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Exhilaration has been in short supply over the last 18 months. It’s hard for a film to put a fire in your belly and your mind when the world is burning and you’re watching said film in quarters where you have spent far too much time, rather than escaping to a cinema and being overwhelmed or, to use Susan Sontag’s apt word, “kidnapped”.</p></div>

Looking back to those bleak months, the outlook for cinema now seems comparatively rosy. Thanks to the arrival of vaccines, what was formerly known as real life is returning, albeit slowly. The fog of lockdown has lifted. We’ve been able to step off the endless streaming conveyor-belt. Projectors are whirring again. Festivals have jolted back to life.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We say: </strong>The hand of Sorrentino here may not be that of the flashy showman of The Great Beauty (2013) but his detour into memoir is all the better for it. This film mostly avoids the overstatement of many of his previous ones. That said, Naples and its outlandish residents and traditions are raucously brought to life but Sorrentino makes time for tenderness; when tragedy strikes, the film’s focus on family and laughter packs an added punch.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We say: </strong>Watching Friends and Strangers as an English winter approaches is almost masochistic, such is the welcoming warmth of the Australian sun. The conversations that Ray has throughout the film are considerably cooler, however. Vaughan shows a great eye for detail and for timing (he edited the film as well as writing and directing it), interspersing the interactions Ray has with friends and strangers with little details and asides that would fall into mumblecore territory in weaker hands.

Using their descent as the structural framework for his narrative, Frammartino follows his group of actor-speleologists into the hole, portraying their methodical journey under the earth from a mid-distance, with the specifics of dialogue barely audible and only natural light to illuminate the environment around them. Frammartino and his cinematographer, Renato Berta, revel in the inky abyss. Initially, light leaks into the frame from overhead but soon the cave walls are thrown into relief when a head torch is shone against them or a piece of burning paper is thrown over the precipice to gauge the depth of the next shaft. As such, the compositions feel alive, with different areas of the screen appearing and disappearing as a head turns.” (Ben Nicholson, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> online)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said:</strong> “The decision to tell Amin’s tale through animation recalls Ari Folman’s Waltz with Bashir (2008), although unlike Folman’s grim depiction of war crimes, Flee has moments of great joy. An exhilarating sequence of young Amin dashing through the streets of Kabul to A-ha’s ‘Take On Me’, with a whirl of energy and flight that recalls the kinetic animation of the band’s music video, is quite wondrous. The devastating ending of Waltz with Bashir uses real archive footage of the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Flee, too, uses real life footage, often news reports that add context to Amin’s plight. The final image, though, ends the film on a deserved, overwhelmingly moving note of optimism.” (Alex Davidson, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> online)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said:</strong> “Not since Peter Strickland’s Berberian Sound Studio (2012) has the shadowy world of genre movies looked so starkly beautiful. Censor is so much more than the sum of its parts, and yet each of its distinct elements is its own consummate achievement. Paulina Rzeszowska, who worked previously on Rose Glass’s British indie horror Saint Maud (2019), delivers a production design that’s stylishly lugubrious, with pointed 1980s detail. Annika Summerson’s cinematography carries over the screening room’s claustrophobia into richly chiaroscuro’d urban corners and home interiors. The editor Mark Towns – again, previously of Saint Maud – elides Enid’s hallucinations and routine to dizzying effect. Then there’s the foreboding music by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch (who also composed the score for Sarah Gavron’s Rocks, 2019) that perfectly seals off Enid’s world.” (Ela Bittencourt, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> Summer)</p></div>

Its use of detail – the paraphernalia of pioneer existence – is exquisite. Its visual approach emphasises warm colours amidst organic mulch. It knows how to amuse with empathy, even throwing in a couple of really dumb children’s jokes of a kind I’m fond of, but which I won’t spoil by telling here. Nothing is made too great a fuss of except by belligerent and vengeful souls in a place where the law is really the Chief Factor, the Factor’s men and the odd military officer.” (Nick James, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> June)</p></div>

Renate Reinsve plays Julie, a 29-year-old woman at the crossroads of her life, or the spaghetti junction, given that she has more options than a Netflix menu. Will she be a doctor or a photographer? Work in a bookshop or become a writer? Does she settle down with comic-book writer Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie) or have an affair with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum)? From her embarrassment of choices we get a sharp, hilarious, clever and romantic depiction of that moment of delicious suspense before life properly begins. Of course, beneath that gnaws away the worry that her life already is, in fact, getting away.” (John Bleasdale, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> September)</p></div>

The present film does justice to its source – or at least, it does as far as it goes. Inevitably, given that Herbert’s is a long and complex novel, several episodes are compressed or omitted, but never to the detriment of the narrative flow. The key storyline isn’t distorted or simplified, and neither are the main characters; there are no casting missteps such as Lynch made. Instead, Timothée Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name, 2017) tellingly brings out the steely determination developing behind Paul’s initial diffidence. No weak links in the impeccably chosen supporting cast, either.” (Philip Kemp, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> November) </p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said:</strong> “A considered portrait of a rock band that met with much bemusement when it sprang from the 1960s New York art scene, but went on to pop-cultural veneration by subsequent generations. It’s the journey from avant-garde laughing stock to canonical status that gives Haynes’s film a greater sense of purpose than the familiar music-doc logging of line-ups, albums and creative differences. </p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Declining to wheel in music critics or today’s pop sensations to expound on the band’s ongoing influence, the film does the expository stuff pretty well, covering the behind-the-music give and take of animosity between the main movers. Meanwhile, Haynes deals with the shortage of ‘professionally’ shot coverage of the Velvets in rehearsal or performance by delivering what’s essentially a hyperactive collage of endlessly shifting cool-as-fuck moments.” (Trevor Johnston, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> November)</p></div>

All of which, of course, makes him more human and likeable than the preux chevalier of the original poem. Lowery leads his flawed protagonist through a dark landscape – much of it atmospherically shot in Co.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said: </strong>“The soundtrack for Carax’s Holy Motors included ‘How Are You Getting Home?’ by Sparks, the duo made up of brothers Ron and Russell Mael, who would later send Carax a treatment idea for a musical, along with some 20 demos, which eventually became Annette. The kinship between band and director is hardly surprising: both are pop pioneers in their respective idioms who revel in mixing high sophistication with oddball, often puerile humour.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>What it has engendered is a script with dialogue composed of lyrics replete with dorky rhymes – though in large part delivered in recitative à la Jacques Demy – and very likely the only musical ever to contain not just one but two scenes of cunnilingus. In the first, the couple alternately sing “We love each other so much!” until they climax in unison with the song, while the second occasions a masterpiece of a match cut from the ecstasy of orgasm to that of childbirth (“Breathe in! Breathe out! Push, push!” sings a chorus of doctors and nurses).” (Giovanni Marchini Camia, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> September)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Thompson (a.k.a. Questlove) creates a resounding time capsule of the late 1960s, using rediscovered footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival to present a procession of Black musical legends.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said:</strong> “As Summer of Soul unfolds, the fact that it took so long for the footage to see the light of day feels increasingly puzzling. Not only is the material stunning on its musical merits alone, but it thrums with history, with the political and cultural currents of Black life in the 1960s. Questlove excavates these themes deftly through talking-head interviews with attendees, critics and the artists themselves, some of whom encounter the footage for the first time.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Some of the most joyous shots in Summer of Soul are those of the crowd, which paint a picture of all that coalesced around the festival. Rows and rows of afros bob to the music, little girls and boys can be seen perched atop their parents’ shoulders, vendors hawk food and drink on the sidelines and the Black Panthers patrol the venue, providing security in lieu of a reluctant police. In the years in which the footage languished in obscurity, Summer of Soul lived on in the dreams of its attendees, some of whom vividly recall the smell of “Afro Sheen and chicken” and the feeling of being a part of something generation-defining. With Summer of Soul, Questlove gives solidity to their memories, ensuring their due place in the annals of American history.” (Devika Girish, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> September)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Absurdist vignettes are combined with a tragi-comic love story in Koberidze’s second feature, a Georgian romance with Kafkaesque quirks.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said:</strong> “On the eve of a World Cup, a timid young pharmacist, Lisa (played alternatively by Irina Chelidze and Ani Karseladze), and an equally shy league-soccer player, Giorgi (Giorgi Amroladze and Giorgi Bochorishvili), fall in love, after two fortuitous encounters. But when Lisa gets bewitched by the ‘evil eye’, her looks are entirely altered by the next morning – with the same fate befalling her lover – and the two miss each other on their first date. Both also lose their talents (Lisa for medicine, Giorgi for soccer) so that Lisa winds up working at an ice-cream parlour; Giorgi finds a similarly lacklustre job. Koberidze astutely keeps the couple’s misfortunes in a minor key, turning tragedy into the stuff of absurdist fables: Kafka and Hrabal but also Orhan Pamuk (of My Name Is Red) certainly come to mind.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The scripted scenes offer a mix of quietly astonishing moments, which capture the town’s uniqueness and convey a sense of wonder. Some of them are humorous, such as a purportedly missed encounter between two dogs that ‘agreed’ to watch a soccer match together. Others are visual interludes, or refrains, such as a soccer-ball bobbing down the stream, a little girl muscling through a violin piece, or the dancing of light and wind against gauzy curtains. To say that Koberidze aspires to be a poet of the cinema might sound cloying, but he certainly thinks in variations, rhythms and echoes, rather than dramatic arches or characters.” (Ela Bittencourt, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> online)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Campion’s first film in over a decade is typically perceptive about the myriad effects of toxic masculinity, as channeled through Benedict Cumberbatch’s rancher Phil.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said:</strong> “Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) rides herd over a thriving cattle ranch with his stolid brother George (Jesse Plemons), sharing the well-appointed lodge-like house left behind by their city-bound parents. When George takes a liking to a widow, Rose (Kirsten Dunst, played with aching brittleness), who runs a small hotel, Phil feels their tight-knit fraternity threatened. He directs his cruel ire toward Rose and the boy he dubs “Miss Nancy”: her willowy, bookish son, Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee, winning in his ungainly awkwardness and resembling a young Martin Landau).</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>But as Phil childishly acts out about his brother actually growing up, he’s also slowly self-destructing in his own fashion. With a suggestiveness more direct than earlier forays into the mythic West, the film orchestrates another kind of archetype in Phil: a man desperately trying to tamp down his sexuality by putting up a rough front to all around him. Cumberbatch summons Lee Marvin’s brash magnetic voice in creating a cowboy who’s know-it-all yet deeply confused, as he idolises an old friend, Bronco Henry, who was so perfect and manly it hurts. Campion dots the film with earthy close-ups or hard edits (blood droplets on wheat, cattle castration); actual human touch is used sparingly and powerfully. Where it all ends up feels at once cathartic and surprising, a denouement readable as lurid poetic justice and profound tragedy (our ears somehow pricked along the way by the odd high horns in Jonny Greenwood’s score).” (Nicolas Rapold, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> December)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p dir="ltr"><strong>We said: </strong>“After the hit cannibal horror Raw (2016), expectations were high for Ducournau’s follow up. In Titane, she has met and surpassed them. The film looks and sounds gorgeous, with Ruben Impens’s day-glo cinematography giving way at times to something more naturalistic, and Jim Williams’s score accompanying the fervid action with its own fever dream rhythms, alternating between techno and something more operatic.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p dir="ltr">Extreme French cinema has become a genre in itself but can all too often have the effect of a faulty smoke alarm: it might wake you up with a jerk but for no real reason.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said: </strong>“Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s gift for exquisite empathy remains fully intact in his first feature to be shot outside Thailand and include a major star. Towering over the rest of the Cannes competition in terms of ambition and singularity, Memoria sends a wraithlike Tilda Swinton on a hypnotic wander through Bogotá, the disparate impressions she collects along the way repeatedly interrupted by a metallic thud that echoes inside her skull: one indeterminate sound within an entire filigree soundscape that at once steers the narrative and highlights cinema’s oft-untapped sonic potential.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The motivation for Jessica’s actions are just as unexplained, which seem less guided by any intentionality than by an insatiable urge to roam. She walks the streets of Bogotá, looks at images of fungi-plagued flowers in a library, passes by an impromptu jazz concert at the university. She visits her sister at the hospital, befriends a French archaeologist named Agnès carrying out excavations in a tunnel and has a sound technician named Hernán try to replicate the thud inside her head; the database he uses consists of cinema sound effects. Her sister fears that a curse might have caused her illness, Agnès talks of an old skull found in the tunnel whose cranium was once pierced to release spirits; and no one seems to have heard of an Hernán when Jessica tries to visit him again at the sound studio.” (James Lattimer, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> online)</p></div>

Precision is key for Hamaguchi’s tragicomedies of manners and for the Murakami Haruki short story on which this film is based.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said: </strong>“An extremely small and exactly perfect film, Céline Sciamma’s Petite maman might at first appear dwarfed by her last title, Portrait of a Lady of Fire. But come closer – and this is a film that beckons like a forest path – and there is much that is similar. There’s the luminosity of the filmmaking – an introvert radiance made extrovert by the unshakable assurance of Claire Mathon’s camerawork and Sciamma’s own directorial certitude. And there are the stories, one about romantic love, the other about a mother-daughter bond, but both about the beautiful tragedy of love, even when fully reciprocated: that you can never truly know anyone, however much you care for them. Portrait, more epic though it was, hinged on the tiny revelation of a finger marking a significant place in a book, and Petite maman may yet turn out to be the page 28 in the ongoing novel of Sciamma’s career.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>In addition to all its other bright, polished pleasures, Sciamma’s film embodies a scintillatingly simple solution to the conundrum of filmmaking under lockdown conditions: if circumstances dictate that the scale becomes smaller, zoom in.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><strong>We said: </strong>“How do you follow a film like The Souvenir (2019)? Joanna Hogg’s unsparing portrait of the relationship between a student filmmaker, Julie (Honor Swinton-Byrne) and an older man, Anthony (Tom Burke), who ends up dying from a heroin overdose, was loaded with metatextual emotion by virtue of being naked autobiography. Hogg recycled personal mementos, using photographs of the view from her own apartment window in 1980s Knightsbridge to show Julie’s view of the same and bringing her own gold-framed bed onto the set for Julie to sleep in. These tactile details blurred the line between truth and art, a line further blurred with playful sophistication in this transfixing sequel.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>If Part I was about Julie losing herself in romance, Part <span class="caps">II</span> is about Julie finding herself in grief, as she attempts to process what happened with Anthony through the making of her thesis film, itself as transparently autobiographical as The Souvenir is for Hogg. The making of the film-within-the-film gives rise to excruciating moments that show its creator’s lacerating self-awareness and lack of vanity. Harris Dickinson shows up to play ‘Anthony’ (opposite Ariane Labed’s ‘Julie’), wincing with the pained confusion of a well-meaning actor confronted with a director who has not given him a solid character. As he questions the material, the sense is that he is also questioning whether Julie really knew Anthony. The film expresses the awkward and vulnerable truth that creating something out of raw emotion means total exposure to collaborators, not all of whom will be on side.” (Sophie Monks Kaufman, <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> online)</p></div>

It’s hard for a film to put a fire in your belly and your mind when the world is burning and you’re watching said film in quarters where you have spent far too much time, rather than escaping to a cinema and being overwhelmed or, to use Susan Sontag’s apt word,&nbsp;“kidnapped”.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the year in film started grimly, with cinemas shuttered, against a backdrop of spiralling Covid cases and deaths, as well as a sense of the <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> as a nation culturally isolated as the final throes of Brexit severed remaining ties to the <span class=\"caps\">EU</span>. Looking back to those bleak months, the outlook for cinema now seems comparatively rosy. Thanks to the arrival of vaccines, what was formerly known as real life is returning, albeit slowly. The fog of lockdown has lifted. We’ve been able to step off the endless streaming conveyor-belt. Projectors are whirring again. Festivals have jolted back to life.

In short, one might wonder if Eastwood, one-time mayor of Carmel, California, is joining the ever-expanding ranks of anti-Trump Republicans yearning for a more civilised country (in this case, Mexico).” (Jonathan Rosenbaum, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;December)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/cry-macho-shows-ambivalence-towards-traditional-masculinity\" title=\"Cry Macho review\">Cry Macho shows an ambivalence towards traditional&nbsp;masculinity</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span>&nbsp;cinemas</p>\n\n<h3>48.

As newly widowed Mary, Joanna Scanlan offers a portrait of a woman whose cracked heart wins our sympathy, and whose increasingly stealthy behaviour commands our attention as she infiltrates another woman’s life. In Scanlan’s features we see grief and humiliation twisted into possessiveness, vengefulness and misplaced compassion.”<strong> </strong>(Pamela Hutchinson, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;June)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/after-love-grieves-house-divided-english-channel-aleem-khan-joanna-scanlan\" title=\"After Love review: grieving for a house divided\">After Love grieves for a house divided by the English&nbsp;Channel</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/interviews/aleem-khan-interviewed-after-love\" title=\"Aleem Khan on After Love\">“Things are so much messier, and more beautiful, than we believe”: Aleem Khan on After&nbsp;Love</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-after-love-2020-online\">On <span class=\"caps\">BFI</span> Player</a> and <a href=\"https://shop.bfi.org.uk/pre-order-after-love-blu-ray.html\">on&nbsp;Blu-ray</a></p>\n\n<h3>47.

This film mostly avoids the overstatement of many of his previous ones. That said, Naples and its outlandish residents and traditions are raucously brought to life but Sorrentino makes time for tenderness; when tragedy strikes, the film’s focus on family and laughter packs an added punch.

The conversations that Ray has throughout the film are considerably cooler, however. Vaughan shows a great eye for detail and for timing (he edited the film as well as writing and directing it), interspersing the interactions Ray has with friends and strangers with little details and asides that would fall into mumblecore territory in weaker hands.

People with families, hobbies, traditions, and songs. It’s a reminder, without ever being piteous, that when we watch television news or footage framed by social media feeds that we’re only seeing a partial story.” (Rebecca Harrison, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;Summer)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/limbo-2020-ben-sharrock-refugee-immigrants-in-scotland\" title=\"Limbo review: a Scottish welcome to four refugees\">Limbo gives a Scottish welcome to four far-flung&nbsp;refugees</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ feature: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/features/strangers-strange-land-films-reframing-refugee-experience-limbo\" title=\"How films are reframing the refugee experience\">Strangers in a strange land: how films are reframing the refugee&nbsp;experience</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/limbo-2019-ben-sharrock\">On&nbsp;Mubi</a></p>\n\n<h3>44.&nbsp;Belle</h3>\n\n<p>Hosoda Mamoru,&nbsp;Japan</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"03dc6a09-ee4f-49f5-b04e-f56cc4946e15\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"354148\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Hosoda’s anime update of Beauty and the Beast for the digital era explores shy school student Suzu’s adventures in a virtual&nbsp;world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We say: </strong>With films such as Mirai (2018), Hosoda had already proved himself a dexterous and sensitive architect of a child’s point of view. This Cocteau-inspired tale is just as nuanced a character study but even more visually bombastic.

There’s a curious, restless quality to the film and its dynamic camera, which often trails Fern from behind as she seemingly forges ahead into new&nbsp;territory.</p>\n\n<p>Through the lens of cinematographer Joshua James Richards, nature is otherworldly.

It has cast a terrific Olivia Colman as a university professor vacationing on a Greek island and ruminating on her choices as a mother of two daughters.

Using their descent as the structural framework for his narrative, Frammartino follows his group of actor-speleologists into the hole, portraying their methodical journey under the earth from a mid-distance, with the specifics of dialogue barely audible and only natural light to illuminate the environment around them. Frammartino and his cinematographer, Renato Berta, revel in the inky abyss. Initially, light leaks into the frame from overhead but soon the cave walls are thrown into relief when a head torch is shone against them or a piece of burning paper is thrown over the precipice to gauge the depth of the next shaft.

An exhilarating sequence of young Amin dashing through the streets of Kabul to A-ha’s ‘Take On Me’, with a whirl of energy and flight that recalls the kinetic animation of the band’s music video, is quite wondrous. The devastating ending of Waltz with Bashir uses real archive footage of the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Flee, too, uses real life footage, often news reports that add context to Amin’s plight.

Censor is so much more than the sum of its parts, and yet each of its distinct elements is its own consummate achievement. Paulina Rzeszowska, who worked previously on Rose Glass’s British indie horror Saint Maud (2019), delivers a production design that’s stylishly lugubrious, with pointed 1980s detail. Annika Summerson’s cinematography carries over the screening room’s claustrophobia into richly chiaroscuro’d urban corners and home interiors. The editor Mark Towns – again, previously of Saint Maud – elides Enid’s hallucinations and routine to dizzying effect. Then there’s the foreboding music by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch (who also composed the score for Sarah Gavron’s Rocks, 2019) that perfectly seals off Enid’s world.” (Ela Bittencourt, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;Summer)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/censor-prano-bailey-bond-video-nasty-violence-social-commentary-niamh-algar\" title=\"Censor review: video nasty violence and social comment\">Censor splices cut-throat video nasty violence with smart social&nbsp;commentary</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/features/censor-mark-kermode-prano-bailey-bond\" title=\"Kermode speaks to Censor director Prano Bailey-Bond\">In the realm of Censor: Mark Kermode speaks to director Prano&nbsp;Bailey-Bond</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/censor\">On&nbsp;Mubi</a></p>\n\n<h3>17.

Its use of detail – the paraphernalia of pioneer existence – is exquisite. Its visual approach emphasises warm colours amidst organic mulch. It knows how to amuse with empathy, even throwing in a couple of really dumb children’s jokes of a kind I’m fond of, but which I won’t spoil by telling here.

Renate Reinsve plays Julie, a 29-year-old woman at the crossroads of her life, or the spaghetti junction, given that she has more options than a Netflix menu. Will she be a doctor or a photographer? Work in a bookshop or become a writer? Does she settle down with comic-book writer Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie) or have an affair with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum)? From her embarrassment of choices we get a sharp, hilarious, clever and romantic depiction of that moment of delicious suspense before life properly begins.

The present film does justice to its source – or at least, it does as far as it goes. Inevitably, given that Herbert’s is a long and complex novel, several episodes are compressed or omitted, but never to the detriment of the narrative flow. The key storyline isn’t distorted or simplified, and neither are the main characters; there are no casting missteps such as Lynch made. Instead, Timothée Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name, 2017) tellingly brings out the steely determination developing behind Paul’s initial diffidence.

It’s the journey from avant-garde laughing stock to canonical status that gives Haynes’s film a greater sense of purpose than the familiar music-doc logging of line-ups, albums and creative&nbsp;differences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Declining to wheel in music critics or today’s pop sensations to expound on the band’s ongoing influence, the film does the expository stuff pretty well, covering the behind-the-music give and take of animosity between the main movers.

All of which, of course, makes him more human and likeable than the preux chevalier of the original poem.

This is the first manoeuvre in a film whose English title anticipates its narrative twists. Except this isn’t the same way, this isn’t quite repetition. The film is slippery with such divergences. Hamaguchi Ryūsuke’s Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy continues the director’s interest in doublings, coincidences and duplicity that has earned him comparisons with Rivette and Rohmer since his debut melodrama, Passion, in&nbsp;2008.</p>\n\n<p>Hamaguchi’s method of improvisatory workshopping (sometimes with non-professional actors, often working in pairs) facilitates taut, even tortured, exchanges. He often has actors read scripts aloud, with no inflection, until ‘something happens’ (he struggles to explain quite what). Something happens that feels real, has a certain weight or thickness – and that is when he starts filming.” (Becca Voelcker, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;online)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/wheel-fortune-fantasy-ryusuke-hamaguchi-middle-class-japan-coincidences\" title=\"Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy review\">Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy spins yarns of connection and coincidence in the conditional&nbsp;tense</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> cinemas from 11 February&nbsp;2022</p>\n\n<h3>9.&nbsp;Annette</h3>\n\n<p>Leos Carax,&nbsp;France</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"5bca3de0-cb64-4768-9d38-28d37ab8058c\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"355249\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Opening this year’s bumper edition of Cannes with a bang, Carax’s melodramatic, shapeshifting musical sang up a storm of love, lust and&nbsp;lamentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>We said: </strong>“The soundtrack for Carax’s Holy Motors included ‘How Are You Getting Home?’ by Sparks, the duo made up of brothers Ron and Russell Mael, who would later send Carax a treatment idea for a musical, along with some 20 demos, which eventually became Annette. The kinship between band and director is hardly surprising: both are pop pioneers in their respective idioms who revel in mixing high sophistication with oddball, often puerile&nbsp;humour.</p>\n\n<p>What it has engendered is a script with dialogue composed of lyrics replete with dorky rhymes – though in large part delivered in recitative à la Jacques Demy – and very likely the only musical ever to contain not just one but two scenes of cunnilingus. In the first, the couple alternately sing “We love each other so much!” until they climax in unison with the song, while the second occasions a masterpiece of a match cut from the ecstasy of orgasm to that of childbirth (“Breathe in!

Questlove) creates a resounding time capsule of the late 1960s, using rediscovered footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival to present a procession of Black musical&nbsp;legends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We said:</strong> “As Summer of Soul unfolds, the fact that it took so long for the footage to see the light of day feels increasingly puzzling. Not only is the material stunning on its musical merits alone, but it thrums with history, with the political and cultural currents of Black life in the 1960s. Questlove excavates these themes deftly through talking-head interviews with attendees, critics and the artists themselves, some of whom encounter the footage for the first&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most joyous shots in Summer of Soul are those of the crowd, which paint a picture of all that coalesced around the festival. Rows and rows of afros bob to the music, little girls and boys can be seen perched atop their parents’ shoulders, vendors hawk food and drink on the sidelines and the Black Panthers patrol the venue, providing security in lieu of a reluctant police. In the years in which the footage languished in obscurity, Summer of Soul lived on in the dreams of its attendees, some of whom vividly recall the smell of “Afro Sheen and chicken” and the feeling of being a part of something generation-defining. With Summer of Soul, Questlove gives solidity to their memories, ensuring their due place in the annals of American history.” (Devika Girish, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;September)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/summer-soul-revolution-could-not-be-televised-ahmir-questlove-thompson-1968-harlem-cultural-festival-doc\" title=\"Summer of Soul review: Black Woodstock, still vital\">Summer of Soul brings us the Black Woodstock, five decades late but still&nbsp;vital</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/summer-of-soul-or-when-the-revolution-could-not-be-televised/kbSrVIU25suX\">On&nbsp;Disney+</a></p>\n\n<h3>7.

But when Lisa gets bewitched by the ‘evil eye’, her looks are entirely altered by the next morning – with the same fate befalling her lover – and the two miss each other on their first date. Both also lose their talents (Lisa for medicine, Giorgi for soccer) so that Lisa winds up working at an ice-cream parlour; Giorgi finds a similarly lacklustre job. Koberidze astutely keeps the couple’s misfortunes in a minor key, turning tragedy into the stuff of absurdist fables: Kafka and Hrabal but also Orhan Pamuk (of My Name Is Red) certainly come to&nbsp;mind.</p>\n\n<p>The scripted scenes offer a mix of quietly astonishing moments, which capture the town’s uniqueness and convey a sense of wonder. Some of them are humorous, such as a purportedly missed encounter between two dogs that ‘agreed’ to watch a soccer match together. Others are visual interludes, or refrains, such as a soccer-ball bobbing down the stream, a little girl muscling through a violin piece, or the dancing of light and wind against gauzy curtains. To say that Koberidze aspires to be a poet of the cinema might sound cloying, but he certainly thinks in variations, rhythms and echoes, rather than dramatic arches or characters.” (Ela Bittencourt, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;online)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/what-do-we-see-when-we-look-sky-alexandre-koberidze-georgian-romance-kafkaesque-quirks\" title=\"What Do We See When We Look at the Sky? review\">What Do We See When We Look at the Sky? is a Georgian romance with Kafkaesque&nbsp;quirks</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><span class=\"caps\">UK</span> release date yet to be&nbsp;announced</p>\n\n<h3>6.

When George takes a liking to a widow, Rose (Kirsten Dunst, played with aching brittleness), who runs a small hotel, Phil feels their tight-knit fraternity threatened. He directs his cruel ire toward Rose and the boy he dubs “Miss Nancy”: her willowy, bookish son, Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee, winning in his ungainly awkwardness and resembling a young Martin&nbsp;Landau).</p>\n\n<p>But as Phil childishly acts out about his brother actually growing up, he’s also slowly self-destructing in his own fashion. With a suggestiveness more direct than earlier forays into the mythic West, the film orchestrates another kind of archetype in Phil: a man desperately trying to tamp down his sexuality by putting up a rough front to all around him. Cumberbatch summons Lee Marvin’s brash magnetic voice in creating a cowboy who’s know-it-all yet deeply confused, as he idolises an old friend, Bronco Henry, who was so perfect and manly it hurts. Campion dots the film with earthy close-ups or hard edits (blood droplets on wheat, cattle castration); actual human touch is used sparingly and powerfully. Where it all ends up feels at once cathartic and surprising, a denouement readable as lurid poetic justice and profound tragedy (our ears somehow pricked along the way by the odd high horns in Jonny Greenwood’s score).” (Nicolas Rapold, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;December)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/power-dog-draws-out-instability-american-west-myths\" title=\"The Power of the Dog review: a gripping psychodrama\">The Power of the Dog draws out the instability of the American West’s handed-down&nbsp;myths</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81127997\">On&nbsp;Netflix</a></p>\n\n<h3>5.&nbsp;Titane</h3>\n\n<p>Julia Ducournau,&nbsp;France</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"10715d80-051f-43ce-a0bf-d8b770cc4307\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"355450\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Julia Docournau’s second feature crashed into the Cannes competition like a ten-ton truck, a motor-minded explosion of oily eroticism with a still-beating heart of emotional tenderness under its&nbsp;bonnet.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We said: </strong>“After the hit cannibal horror Raw (2016), expectations were high for Ducournau’s follow up. In Titane, she has met and surpassed them. The film looks and sounds gorgeous, with Ruben Impens’s day-glo cinematography giving way at times to something more naturalistic, and Jim Williams’s score accompanying the fervid action with its own fever dream rhythms, alternating between techno and something&nbsp;more&nbsp;operatic.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Extreme French cinema has become a genre in itself but can all too often have the effect of a faulty smoke alarm: it might wake you up with a jerk but for no real reason. Titane in contrast has an abundance to say: about gender, sexuality, family, human relationships and fetishisation.

Towering over the rest of the Cannes competition in terms of ambition and singularity, Memoria sends a wraithlike Tilda Swinton on a hypnotic wander through Bogotá, the disparate impressions she collects along the way repeatedly interrupted by a metallic thud that echoes inside her skull: one indeterminate sound within an entire filigree soundscape that at once steers the narrative and highlights cinema’s oft-untapped&nbsp;sonic&nbsp;potential.</p>\n\n<p>The motivation for Jessica’s actions are just as unexplained, which seem less guided by any intentionality than by an insatiable urge to roam. She walks the streets of Bogotá, looks at images of fungi-plagued flowers in a library, passes by an impromptu jazz concert at the university. She visits her sister at the hospital, befriends a French archaeologist named Agnès carrying out excavations in a tunnel and has a sound technician named Hernán try to replicate the thud inside her head; the database he uses consists of cinema sound effects. Her sister fears that a curse might have caused her illness, Agnès talks of an old skull found in the tunnel whose cranium was once pierced to release spirits; and no one seems to have heard of an Hernán when Jessica tries to visit him again at the sound&nbsp;studio.” (James Lattimer, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;online)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/memoria-apichatpong-weerasethakul-tilda-swinton\" title=\"Memoria review\">Memoria shows Apichatpong at the peak of his mesmerising&nbsp;powers</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> cinemas from 14 January&nbsp;2022</p>\n\n<h3>3.

Precision is key for Hamaguchi’s tragicomedies of manners and for the Murakami Haruki short story on which this film is based. The film adheres closely to Murakami’s text, though it makes its own detours. (In Murakami’s story the Saab is yellow; Hamaguchi’s red substitute looks exquisite against the snow in the film’s closing scenes, shot in Japan’s northernmost region&nbsp;Hokkaido.)</p>\n\n<p>A theatre actor, Mr Kafuku, loses his wife, whom he secretly knows was unfaithful to him. Much of the film is concerned with how Mr Kafuku spends his days, rehearsing Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya with a multilingual cast of actors at a theatre in Hiroshima. Role play and performance fascinate Hamaguchi, as evidenced in Happy Hour and, more recently, Asako I <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"caps\">II</span> (2018) and Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy (2021). Drive My Car contains many extended takes in which actors workshop lines and scenarios through improvisation.

But come closer – and this is a film that beckons like a forest path – and there is much that is similar. There’s the luminosity of the filmmaking – an introvert radiance made extrovert by the unshakable assurance of Claire Mathon’s camerawork and Sciamma’s own directorial certitude. And there are the stories, one about romantic love, the other about a mother-daughter bond, but both about the beautiful tragedy of love, even when fully reciprocated: that you can never truly know anyone, however much you care for them. Portrait, more epic though it was, hinged on the tiny revelation of a finger marking a significant place in a book, and Petite maman may yet turn out to be the page 28 in the ongoing novel of Sciamma’s&nbsp;career.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to all its other bright, polished pleasures, Sciamma’s film embodies a scintillatingly simple solution to the conundrum of filmmaking under lockdown conditions: if circumstances dictate that the scale becomes smaller, zoom in. Petite maman is a tiny suspended moment within time, magnified at high resolution until the microscopic becomes momentous, and the mystery of a child’s love for her mother becomes the mystery of all love.” (Jessica Kiang, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;December)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/petite-maman-celine-sciamma-forest-fairy-tale-mother-daughter-love\" title=\"Petite maman review: Céline Sciamma’s forest fairytale\">Petite Maman is a magical story of childhood love and&nbsp;loneliness</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/features/celine-sciamma-petite-maman-mother-invention\" title=\"Céline Sciamma: mother of invention\">Céline Sciamma: mother of&nbsp;invention</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> cinemas now and on Mubi from 18 February&nbsp;2022</p>\n\n<h3>1.

Joanna Hogg’s unsparing portrait of the relationship between a student filmmaker, Julie (Honor Swinton-Byrne) and an older man, Anthony (Tom Burke), who ends up dying from a heroin overdose, was loaded with metatextual emotion by virtue of being naked autobiography. Hogg recycled personal mementos, using photographs of the view from her own apartment window in 1980s Knightsbridge to show Julie’s view of the same and bringing her own gold-framed bed onto the set for Julie to sleep in. These tactile details blurred the line between truth and art, a line further blurred with playful sophistication in this&nbsp;transfixing&nbsp;sequel.</p>\n\n<p>If Part I was about Julie losing herself in romance, Part <span class=\"caps\">II</span> is about Julie finding herself in grief, as she attempts to process what happened with Anthony through the making of her thesis film, itself as transparently autobiographical as The Souvenir is for Hogg. The making of the film-within-the-film gives rise to excruciating moments that show its creator’s lacerating self-awareness and lack of vanity. Harris Dickinson shows up to play ‘Anthony’ (opposite Ariane Labed’s ‘Julie’), wincing with the pained confusion of a well-meaning actor confronted with a director who has not given him a solid character. As he questions the material, the sense is that he is also questioning whether Julie really knew Anthony. The film expresses the awkward and vulnerable truth that creating something out of raw emotion means total exposure to collaborators, not all of whom will be on&nbsp;side.” (Sophie Monks Kaufman,

1972 in the pages of Sight <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Sound, Stanley Kubrick, talking to <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span> editor Penelope Houston and critic Philip Strick, came up with a shrewd definition of art. “A work of art must make life more enjoyable or endurable,” Kubrick said, citing Samuel Johnson; but above all, in Kubrick’s mind, “a work of art is always&nbsp;exhilarating.”</p>\n\n<p>Exhilaration has been in short supply over the last 18 months. It’s hard for a film to put a fire in your belly and your mind when the world is burning and you’re watching said film in quarters where you have spent far too much time, rather than escaping to a cinema and being overwhelmed or, to use Susan Sontag’s apt word,&nbsp;“kidnapped”.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the year in film started grimly, with cinemas shuttered, against a backdrop of spiralling Covid cases and deaths, as well as a sense of the <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> as a nation culturally isolated as the final throes of Brexit severed remaining ties to the <span class=\"caps\">EU</span>. Looking back to those bleak months, the outlook for cinema now seems comparatively rosy. Thanks to the arrival of vaccines, what was formerly known as real life is returning, albeit slowly. The fog of lockdown has lifted. We’ve been able to step off the endless streaming conveyor-belt. Projectors are whirring again. Festivals have jolted back to life.

In short, one might wonder if Eastwood, one-time mayor of Carmel, California, is joining the ever-expanding ranks of anti-Trump Republicans yearning for a more civilised country (in this case, Mexico).” (Jonathan Rosenbaum, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;December)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/cry-macho-shows-ambivalence-towards-traditional-masculinity\" title=\"Cry Macho review\">Cry Macho shows an ambivalence towards traditional&nbsp;masculinity</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span>&nbsp;cinemas</p>\n\n<h3>48.

As newly widowed Mary, Joanna Scanlan offers a portrait of a woman whose cracked heart wins our sympathy, and whose increasingly stealthy behaviour commands our attention as she infiltrates another woman’s life. In Scanlan’s features we see grief and humiliation twisted into possessiveness, vengefulness and misplaced compassion.”<strong> </strong>(Pamela Hutchinson, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;June)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/after-love-grieves-house-divided-english-channel-aleem-khan-joanna-scanlan\" title=\"After Love review: grieving for a house divided\">After Love grieves for a house divided by the English&nbsp;Channel</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/interviews/aleem-khan-interviewed-after-love\" title=\"Aleem Khan on After Love\">“Things are so much messier, and more beautiful, than we believe”: Aleem Khan on After&nbsp;Love</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-after-love-2020-online\">On <span class=\"caps\">BFI</span> Player</a> and <a href=\"https://shop.bfi.org.uk/pre-order-after-love-blu-ray.html\">on&nbsp;Blu-ray</a></p>\n\n<h3>47.

This film mostly avoids the overstatement of many of his previous ones. That said, Naples and its outlandish residents and traditions are raucously brought to life but Sorrentino makes time for tenderness; when tragedy strikes, the film’s focus on family and laughter packs an added punch.

The conversations that Ray has throughout the film are considerably cooler, however. Vaughan shows a great eye for detail and for timing (he edited the film as well as writing and directing it), interspersing the interactions Ray has with friends and strangers with little details and asides that would fall into mumblecore territory in weaker hands.

People with families, hobbies, traditions, and songs. It’s a reminder, without ever being piteous, that when we watch television news or footage framed by social media feeds that we’re only seeing a partial story.” (Rebecca Harrison, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;Summer)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/limbo-2020-ben-sharrock-refugee-immigrants-in-scotland\" title=\"Limbo review: a Scottish welcome to four refugees\">Limbo gives a Scottish welcome to four far-flung&nbsp;refugees</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ feature: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/features/strangers-strange-land-films-reframing-refugee-experience-limbo\" title=\"How films are reframing the refugee experience\">Strangers in a strange land: how films are reframing the refugee&nbsp;experience</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/limbo-2019-ben-sharrock\">On&nbsp;Mubi</a></p>\n\n<h3>44.&nbsp;Belle</h3>\n\n<p>Hosoda Mamoru,&nbsp;Japan</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"03dc6a09-ee4f-49f5-b04e-f56cc4946e15\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"354148\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Hosoda’s anime update of Beauty and the Beast for the digital era explores shy school student Suzu’s adventures in a virtual&nbsp;world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We say: </strong>With films such as Mirai (2018), Hosoda had already proved himself a dexterous and sensitive architect of a child’s point of view. This Cocteau-inspired tale is just as nuanced a character study but even more visually bombastic. Awkward teenager Suzu finds solace in a cyber realm, brought to life with dizzying <span class=\"caps\">CGI</span>, which Hosoda sketches her ‘real’ world by hand. The film was a true product of lockdown, with Hosoda collaborating virtually with animators across the world.

It’s no accident that at different points Christoph and Undine doze off in broad daylight; and Petzold has claimed the eminently oneiric Vertigo as one of the film’s inspirations.” (Jonathan Romney, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;April)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/undine-2020-christian-petzold-berlin-fairytale-romance-diver-water-nymph\" title=\"Undine review: modern-day fairytale romance\">Undine is a modern-day fairytale romance, between diver and water&nbsp;nymph</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it</strong><strong>: </strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/undine-2020\">On&nbsp;Mubi</a></p>\n\n<h3>42.

As writer, she studs her intricately constructed screenplay with hilarious absurdity and scalpel-sharp one-liners; as director, she frames the mayhem expertly, with one eye always on the bigger picture.” (Lisa Mullen, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;Summer)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/shiva-baby-2020-emma-seligman-secret-life-young-jewish-woman\" title=\"Shiva Baby review: secret life unravels during funeral\">Shiva Baby sees a young Jewish woman’s secret life unravel during a&nbsp;funeral</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/interviews/emma-seligman-interviewed%E2%80%93shiva-baby\" title=\"Emma Seligman on Shiva Baby and sugar daddies\">“I take pride in my millennial audience”: Emma Seligman on Shiva Baby and sugar&nbsp;daddies</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/shiva-baby-2020\">On&nbsp;Mubi</a></p>\n\n<h3>41.

There’s a curious, restless quality to the film and its dynamic camera, which often trails Fern from behind as she seemingly forges ahead into new&nbsp;territory.</p>\n\n<p>Through the lens of cinematographer Joshua James Richards, nature is otherworldly. Fern communes with enormous, abstract rock formations doused in violet sunset; lush redwoods that feel like remnants of the prehistoric age.

It has cast a terrific Olivia Colman as a university professor vacationing on a Greek island and ruminating on her choices as a mother of two daughters. In the flashbacks – treated so extensively as to be more of an episodic narrative alongside Colman’s thread – Jessie Buckley plays the character’s younger self.

Using their descent as the structural framework for his narrative, Frammartino follows his group of actor-speleologists into the hole, portraying their methodical journey under the earth from a mid-distance, with the specifics of dialogue barely audible and only natural light to illuminate the environment around them. Frammartino and his cinematographer, Renato Berta, revel in the inky abyss. Initially, light leaks into the frame from overhead but soon the cave walls are thrown into relief when a head torch is shone against them or a piece of burning paper is thrown over the precipice to gauge the depth of the next shaft. As such, the compositions feel alive, with different areas of the screen appearing and disappearing as a head turns.” (Ben Nicholson, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;online)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/il-buco-takes-viewers-meditative-dive-through-caves-calabria\" title=\"Il Buco review: a meditative dive into the abyss\">Il Buco takes viewers on a meditative dive through the caves of&nbsp;Calabria</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><span class=\"caps\">UK</span> release date yet to be&nbsp;announced</p>\n\n<h3>19.&nbsp;Flee</h3>\n\n<p>Jonas Peter Rasmussen,&nbsp;Denmark</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"5d7f5515-b15c-4673-8ad8-a58029e22d47\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"354825\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s intimate animated feature looks back on the personal experiences of Amin, a gay man living in Copenhagen who was forced to flee Afghanistan as a&nbsp;child.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We said:</strong> “The decision to tell Amin’s tale through animation recalls Ari Folman’s Waltz with Bashir (2008), although unlike Folman’s grim depiction of war crimes, Flee has moments of great joy. An exhilarating sequence of young Amin dashing through the streets of Kabul to A-ha’s ‘Take On Me’, with a whirl of energy and flight that recalls the kinetic animation of the band’s music video, is quite wondrous. The devastating ending of Waltz with Bashir uses real archive footage of the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Flee, too, uses real life footage, often news reports that add context to Amin’s plight. The final image, though, ends the film on a deserved, overwhelmingly moving note of optimism.” (Alex Davidson, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;online)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/flee-an-astonishing-animated-portrait-young-refugee\" title=\"Flee review: an astonishing animated documentary\">Flee is an astonishing animated portrait of a young&nbsp;refugee</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> cinemas from 11 February&nbsp;2022</p>\n\n<h3>18.&nbsp;Censor</h3>\n\n<p>Prano Bailey-Bond, <span class=\"caps\">UK</span></p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"fc0893d3-751a-4c68-8f83-b18f0a844217\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"354885\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Splicing cut-throat video nasty violence with smart social commentary, Bailey-Bond’s razor-sharp debut sees the cynical gore of 1980s horror movies seeping into the real&nbsp;world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We said:</strong> “Not since Peter Strickland’s Berberian Sound Studio (2012) has the shadowy world of genre movies looked so starkly beautiful. Censor is so much more than the sum of its parts, and yet each of its distinct elements is its own consummate achievement. Paulina Rzeszowska, who worked previously on Rose Glass’s British indie horror Saint Maud (2019), delivers a production design that’s stylishly lugubrious, with pointed 1980s detail. Annika Summerson’s cinematography carries over the screening room’s claustrophobia into richly chiaroscuro’d urban corners and home interiors. The editor Mark Towns – again, previously of Saint Maud – elides Enid’s hallucinations and routine to dizzying effect. Then there’s the foreboding music by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch (who also composed the score for Sarah Gavron’s Rocks, 2019) that perfectly seals off Enid’s world.” (Ela Bittencourt, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;Summer)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/censor-prano-bailey-bond-video-nasty-violence-social-commentary-niamh-algar\" title=\"Censor review: video nasty violence and social comment\">Censor splices cut-throat video nasty violence with smart social&nbsp;commentary</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/features/censor-mark-kermode-prano-bailey-bond\" title=\"Kermode speaks to Censor director Prano Bailey-Bond\">In the realm of Censor: Mark Kermode speaks to director Prano&nbsp;Bailey-Bond</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/censor\">On&nbsp;Mubi</a></p>\n\n<h3>17.

Its use of detail – the paraphernalia of pioneer existence – is exquisite. Its visual approach emphasises warm colours amidst organic mulch. It knows how to amuse with empathy, even throwing in a couple of really dumb children’s jokes of a kind I’m fond of, but which I won’t spoil by telling here. Nothing is made too great a fuss of except by belligerent and vengeful souls in a place where the law is really the Chief Factor, the Factor’s men and the odd military officer.” (Nick James, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;June)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/first-cow-kelly-reichardt-oregon-milk-rustling-western\" title=\"First Cow review: a milk-rustling western\">First Cow: Kelly Reichardt’s milk-rustling western rises like a&nbsp;treat</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/interviews/kelly-reichardt-first-cow\" title=\"Kelly Reichardt: the quiet American\">Kelly Reichardt: the quiet&nbsp;American</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it:</strong> <a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/first-cow\">On&nbsp;Mubi</a></p>\n\n<h3>16.

Renate Reinsve plays Julie, a 29-year-old woman at the crossroads of her life, or the spaghetti junction, given that she has more options than a Netflix menu. Will she be a doctor or a photographer? Work in a bookshop or become a writer? Does she settle down with comic-book writer Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie) or have an affair with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum)? From her embarrassment of choices we get a sharp, hilarious, clever and romantic depiction of that moment of delicious suspense before life properly begins.

Her breathy English accent sometimes veers towards impersonation, but Stewart captures Diana’s fragility and her yearning to escape the strictures of the family she’s found herself&nbsp;in.</p>\n\n<p>Claire Mathon’s cinematography captures the watercolours of a British winter: pallid sunlight, frosty fields and the lush interiors which, despite their beauty, manage to look as cold as Diana and the boys repeatedly complain they are.

The present film does justice to its source – or at least, it does as far as it goes. Inevitably, given that Herbert’s is a long and complex novel, several episodes are compressed or omitted, but never to the detriment of the narrative flow. The key storyline isn’t distorted or simplified, and neither are the main characters; there are no casting missteps such as Lynch made. Instead, Timothée Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name, 2017) tellingly brings out the steely determination developing behind Paul’s initial diffidence. No weak links in the impeccably chosen supporting cast, either.” (Philip Kemp, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;November)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review online: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/dune-succeeds-avoiding-excessive-fidelity-original-novel\" title=\"Dune review: a fresh take on a sci-fi classic \">Dune succeeds by avoiding excessive fidelity to the original&nbsp;novel</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span>&nbsp;cinemas</p>\n\n<h3>13.

It’s the journey from avant-garde laughing stock to canonical status that gives Haynes’s film a greater sense of purpose than the familiar music-doc logging of line-ups, albums and creative&nbsp;differences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Declining to wheel in music critics or today’s pop sensations to expound on the band’s ongoing influence, the film does the expository stuff pretty well, covering the behind-the-music give and take of animosity between the main movers. Meanwhile, Haynes deals with the shortage of ‘professionally’ shot coverage of the Velvets in rehearsal or performance by delivering what’s essentially a hyperactive collage of endlessly shifting cool-as-fuck moments.” (Trevor Johnston, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;November)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review online: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/velvet-underground-todd-haynes-tribute-avant-garde-rocknroll-icons\" title=\"The Velvet Underground review: rock’n’roll icons\">The Velvet Underground pays tribute to avant-garde rock’n’roll&nbsp;icons</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/the-velvet-underground/umc.cmc.69ic79cvvy80epfhz5efdgjjd\">On Apple <span class=\"caps\">TV</span>+</a></p>\n\n<h3>12.

Our hero Gawain (he’s not even a Sir in this version until late in the action) is hesitant and beset by doubts (“I’m not ready yet” is one of the first things we hear him say); prior to his quest he spends his time in scruffy, boozy surroundings with his low-caste lover Essel (Alicia Vikander). All of which, of course, makes him more human and likeable than the preux chevalier of the original poem. Lowery leads his flawed protagonist through a dark landscape – much of it atmospherically shot in Co.

But Hansen-Løve touches on a more sombre view of the creative process when Chris takes a peek into her partner’s notebook, finding sketches of women in sexually submissive positions and the outline of what looks to be a spiritual remake of Bergman’s psychosexual freakout Persona (1966). Could Tony in fact be the tortured artist? Is making art about using big words and big concepts to dig deep into the darkest reaches of the human soul? Has Chris been doing it all wrong?

This is the first manoeuvre in a film whose English title anticipates its narrative twists. Except this isn’t the same way, this isn’t quite repetition. The film is slippery with such divergences. Hamaguchi Ryūsuke’s Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy continues the director’s interest in doublings, coincidences and duplicity that has earned him comparisons with Rivette and Rohmer since his debut melodrama, Passion, in&nbsp;2008.</p>\n\n<p>Hamaguchi’s method of improvisatory workshopping (sometimes with non-professional actors, often working in pairs) facilitates taut, even tortured, exchanges. He often has actors read scripts aloud, with no inflection, until ‘something happens’ (he struggles to explain quite what).

Not only is the material stunning on its musical merits alone, but it thrums with history, with the political and cultural currents of Black life in the 1960s. Questlove excavates these themes deftly through talking-head interviews with attendees, critics and the artists themselves, some of whom encounter the footage for the first&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most joyous shots in Summer of Soul are those of the crowd, which paint a picture of all that coalesced around the festival. Rows and rows of afros bob to the music, little girls and boys can be seen perched atop their parents’ shoulders, vendors hawk food and drink on the sidelines and the Black Panthers patrol the venue, providing security in lieu of a reluctant police. In the years in which the footage languished in obscurity, Summer of Soul lived on in the dreams of its attendees, some of whom vividly recall the smell of “Afro Sheen and chicken” and the feeling of being a part of something generation-defining.

What Do We See When We Look at the&nbsp;Sky?</h3>\n\n<p>Alexandre Koberidze,&nbsp;Georgia</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"a5f99070-2901-4bf3-b3dd-182f4c0b5cd3\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"355325\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Absurdist vignettes are combined with a tragi-comic love story in Koberidze’s second feature, a Georgian romance with Kafkaesque&nbsp;quirks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We said:</strong> “On the eve of a World Cup, a timid young pharmacist, Lisa (played alternatively by Irina Chelidze and Ani Karseladze), and an equally shy league-soccer player, Giorgi (Giorgi Amroladze and Giorgi Bochorishvili), fall in love, after two fortuitous encounters. But when Lisa gets bewitched by the ‘evil eye’, her looks are entirely altered by the next morning – with the same fate befalling her lover – and the two miss each other on their first date. Both also lose their talents (Lisa for medicine, Giorgi for soccer) so that Lisa winds up working at an ice-cream parlour; Giorgi finds a similarly lacklustre job. Koberidze astutely keeps the couple’s misfortunes in a minor key, turning tragedy into the stuff of absurdist fables: Kafka and Hrabal but also Orhan Pamuk (of My Name Is Red) certainly come to&nbsp;mind.</p>\n\n<p>The scripted scenes offer a mix of quietly astonishing moments, which capture the town’s uniqueness and convey a sense of wonder. Some of them are humorous, such as a purportedly missed encounter between two dogs that ‘agreed’ to watch a soccer match together. Others are visual interludes, or refrains, such as a soccer-ball bobbing down the stream, a little girl muscling through a violin piece, or the dancing of light and wind against gauzy curtains. To say that Koberidze aspires to be a poet of the cinema might sound cloying, but he certainly thinks in variations, rhythms and echoes, rather than dramatic arches or characters.” (Ela Bittencourt, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;online)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/what-do-we-see-when-we-look-sky-alexandre-koberidze-georgian-romance-kafkaesque-quirks\" title=\"What Do We See When We Look at the Sky? review\">What Do We See When We Look at the Sky? is a Georgian romance with Kafkaesque&nbsp;quirks</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><span class=\"caps\">UK</span> release date yet to be&nbsp;announced</p>\n\n<h3>6.

When George takes a liking to a widow, Rose (Kirsten Dunst, played with aching brittleness), who runs a small hotel, Phil feels their tight-knit fraternity threatened. He directs his cruel ire toward Rose and the boy he dubs “Miss Nancy”: her willowy, bookish son, Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee, winning in his ungainly awkwardness and resembling a young Martin&nbsp;Landau).</p>\n\n<p>But as Phil childishly acts out about his brother actually growing up, he’s also slowly self-destructing in his own fashion. With a suggestiveness more direct than earlier forays into the mythic West, the film orchestrates another kind of archetype in Phil: a man desperately trying to tamp down his sexuality by putting up a rough front to all around him. Cumberbatch summons Lee Marvin’s brash magnetic voice in creating a cowboy who’s know-it-all yet deeply confused, as he idolises an old friend, Bronco Henry, who was so perfect and manly it hurts. Campion dots the film with earthy close-ups or hard edits (blood droplets on wheat, cattle castration); actual human touch is used sparingly and powerfully. Where it all ends up feels at once cathartic and surprising, a denouement readable as lurid poetic justice and profound tragedy (our ears somehow pricked along the way by the odd high horns in Jonny Greenwood’s score).” (Nicolas Rapold, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;December)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/power-dog-draws-out-instability-american-west-myths\" title=\"The Power of the Dog review: a gripping psychodrama\">The Power of the Dog draws out the instability of the American West’s handed-down&nbsp;myths</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81127997\">On&nbsp;Netflix</a></p>\n\n<h3>5.&nbsp;Titane</h3>\n\n<p>Julia Ducournau,&nbsp;France</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"paragraphs\" data-paragraph-id=\"10715d80-051f-43ce-a0bf-d8b770cc4307\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"355450\" data-paragraph-type=\"image\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Julia Docournau’s second feature crashed into the Cannes competition like a ten-ton truck, a motor-minded explosion of oily eroticism with a still-beating heart of emotional tenderness under its&nbsp;bonnet.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We said: </strong>“After the hit cannibal horror Raw (2016), expectations were high for Ducournau’s follow up. In Titane, she has met and surpassed them. The film looks and sounds gorgeous, with Ruben Impens’s day-glo cinematography giving way at times to something more naturalistic, and Jim Williams’s score accompanying the fervid action with its own fever dream rhythms, alternating between techno and something&nbsp;more&nbsp;operatic.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Extreme French cinema has become a genre in itself but can all too often have the effect of a faulty smoke alarm: it might wake you up with a jerk but for no real reason. Titane in contrast has an abundance to say: about gender, sexuality, family, human relationships and fetishisation.

Towering over the rest of the Cannes competition in terms of ambition and singularity, Memoria sends a wraithlike Tilda Swinton on a hypnotic wander through Bogotá, the disparate impressions she collects along the way repeatedly interrupted by a metallic thud that echoes inside her skull: one indeterminate sound within an entire filigree soundscape that at once steers the narrative and highlights cinema’s oft-untapped&nbsp;sonic&nbsp;potential.</p>\n\n<p>The motivation for Jessica’s actions are just as unexplained, which seem less guided by any intentionality than by an insatiable urge to roam. She walks the streets of Bogotá, looks at images of fungi-plagued flowers in a library, passes by an impromptu jazz concert at the university. She visits her sister at the hospital, befriends a French archaeologist named Agnès carrying out excavations in a tunnel and has a sound technician named Hernán try to replicate the thud inside her head; the database he uses consists of cinema sound effects. Her sister fears that a curse might have caused her illness, Agnès talks of an old skull found in the tunnel whose cranium was once pierced to release spirits; and no one seems to have heard of an Hernán when Jessica tries to visit him again at the sound&nbsp;studio.” (James Lattimer, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;online)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/memoria-apichatpong-weerasethakul-tilda-swinton\" title=\"Memoria review\">Memoria shows Apichatpong at the peak of his mesmerising&nbsp;powers</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> cinemas from 14 January&nbsp;2022</p>\n\n<h3>3.

Precision is key for Hamaguchi’s tragicomedies of manners and for the Murakami Haruki short story on which this film is based. The film adheres closely to Murakami’s text, though it makes its own detours. (In Murakami’s story the Saab is yellow; Hamaguchi’s red substitute looks exquisite against the snow in the film’s closing scenes, shot in Japan’s northernmost region&nbsp;Hokkaido.)</p>\n\n<p>A theatre actor, Mr Kafuku, loses his wife, whom he secretly knows was unfaithful to him. Much of the film is concerned with how Mr Kafuku spends his days, rehearsing Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya with a multilingual cast of actors at a theatre in Hiroshima. Role play and performance fascinate Hamaguchi, as evidenced in Happy Hour and, more recently, Asako I <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"caps\">II</span> (2018) and Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy (2021). Drive My Car contains many extended takes in which actors workshop lines and scenarios through improvisation. Language is key here – be it Japanese, with its nuances of politeness and elliptical implication, or body languages and facial expressions.” (Becca Voelcker, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;December)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/drive-my-car-meditative-trip-down-memory-lane-murakami-haruki-hamaguchi-ryusuke\" title=\"Drive My Car review: meditative trip down memory lane\">Drive My Car takes a meditative trip down memory&nbsp;lane</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview:</strong> <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/interviews/hamaguchi-ryusuke-drive-my-car\" title=\"On the road with Hamaguchi Ryūsuke\">On the road with Hamaguchi&nbsp;Ryūsuke</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span>&nbsp;cinemas</p>\n\n<h3>2.

But come closer – and this is a film that beckons like a forest path – and there is much that is similar. There’s the luminosity of the filmmaking – an introvert radiance made extrovert by the unshakable assurance of Claire Mathon’s camerawork and Sciamma’s own directorial certitude. And there are the stories, one about romantic love, the other about a mother-daughter bond, but both about the beautiful tragedy of love, even when fully reciprocated: that you can never truly know anyone, however much you care for them. Portrait, more epic though it was, hinged on the tiny revelation of a finger marking a significant place in a book, and Petite maman may yet turn out to be the page 28 in the ongoing novel of Sciamma’s&nbsp;career.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to all its other bright, polished pleasures, Sciamma’s film embodies a scintillatingly simple solution to the conundrum of filmmaking under lockdown conditions: if circumstances dictate that the scale becomes smaller, zoom in. Petite maman is a tiny suspended moment within time, magnified at high resolution until the microscopic becomes momentous, and the mystery of a child’s love for her mother becomes the mystery of all love.” (Jessica Kiang, <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span>&nbsp;December)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/reviews/petite-maman-celine-sciamma-forest-fairy-tale-mother-daughter-love\" title=\"Petite maman review: Céline Sciamma’s forest fairytale\">Petite Maman is a magical story of childhood love and&nbsp;loneliness</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>+ interview: </strong><a href=\"/sight-and-sound/features/celine-sciamma-petite-maman-mother-invention\" title=\"Céline Sciamma: mother of invention\">Céline Sciamma: mother of&nbsp;invention</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to see it: </strong>In <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> cinemas now and on Mubi from 18 February&nbsp;2022</p>\n\n<h3>1.

Joanna Hogg’s unsparing portrait of the relationship between a student filmmaker, Julie (Honor Swinton-Byrne) and an older man, Anthony (Tom Burke), who ends up dying from a heroin overdose, was loaded with metatextual emotion by virtue of being naked autobiography. Hogg recycled personal mementos, using photographs of the view from her own apartment window in 1980s Knightsbridge to show Julie’s view of the same and bringing her own gold-framed bed onto the set for Julie to sleep in. These tactile details blurred the line between truth and art, a line further blurred with playful sophistication in this&nbsp;transfixing&nbsp;sequel.</p>\n\n<p>If Part I was about Julie losing herself in romance, Part <span class=\"caps\">II</span> is about Julie finding herself in grief, as she attempts to process what happened with Anthony through the making of her thesis film, itself as transparently autobiographical as The Souvenir is for Hogg. The making of the film-within-the-film gives rise to excruciating moments that show its creator’s lacerating self-awareness and lack of vanity. Harris Dickinson shows up to play ‘Anthony’ (opposite Ariane Labed’s ‘Julie’), wincing with the pained confusion of a well-meaning actor confronted with a director who has not given him a solid character. As he questions the material, the sense is that he is also questioning whether Julie really knew Anthony. The film expresses the awkward and vulnerable truth that creating something out of raw emotion means total exposure to collaborators, not all of whom will be on&nbsp;side.” (Sophie Monks Kaufman,

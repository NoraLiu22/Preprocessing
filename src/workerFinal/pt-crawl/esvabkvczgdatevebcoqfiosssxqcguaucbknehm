	<h2>General Concept</h2>
	
	<p>This privateer-style schooner is intended for construction in Indonesia using top 
	quality tropical hardwoods.&nbsp; The concept has been to create a vessel that could accommodate 
	up to twelve charter guests plus twelve crew for charters in Indonesia and South East Asia, as 
	well as to have&nbsp; a vessel suited to worldwide cruising. The 
	goal has been to provide all the amenities of a well equipped charter vessel that is fully capable 
	as a <a href="idealMS.htm">motor-sailor</a>, while also performing exceptionally well as a pure 
	sailing vessel.&nbsp; We have specified modern materials wherever 
	possible to provide a rig that reflects a classic schooner / brigantine heritage.&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p>With the 'privateer' hull type, six luxury cabins are provided within a smaller overall vessel size than would be 
	required using a typical Pinisi or KLM hull type, all without having to reduce the size of the guest cabins.&nbsp; 
	The guest cabins have been located amidships, with the engine room moved aft; the 
	crew cabins located forward; and the captain and engineer / mate in their 
	own cabins on deck.&nbsp; As compared with our Indonesian Pinisi designs there is less rake to the 
	stem and the overhang aft is very modest.&nbsp; These changes allow the overall 
	size to be reduced from around 37 meters and 350 metric tons, to 31 meters 
	length on deck and 244 metric tons.&nbsp; In all, a much more economical vessel to build, with no 
	reduction in the accommodation space.&nbsp;  </p>
	
	<p>Particulars are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Length on Deck: 101' (31 m)</li>
		<li>Length WL: 86.2' (26.3 m)</li>
		<li>Moulded Beam: 22' (9.5 m)</li>
		<li>Draft: 11.7' (3.6m)</li>
		<li>Displacement: 240 Long Tons (244 metric tons)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
		<h2>Construction</h2>
	
	<p>The construction methods used in South Sulawesi are plank-on-frame using 
	tropical hardwood.&nbsp; Frames are sawn futtocks which are scarphed 
	together rather than lying side by side.&nbsp; By tradition the planks are erected prior to the 
	frames being installed, therefore all planks are edge fastened using a 
	combination of hardwood dowels and galvanized drifts.&nbsp; Please see our <a href="phinisi_history.htm">Pinisi History</a> page for 
	more information about the construction methods used in Indonesia, and our
	<a href="phinisi_quality.htm">Pinisi Building</a> page for our recommended 
	path to achieve the highest quality.<br /> &nbsp; </p>
		
		<h2>Rig</h2>
		
	<p>The rig is a traditional stays'l schooner / brigantine with gaff main. Light weather sails include a main gaff tops'l, two square foretops'ls, 
	and a large lower course for light winds.&nbsp; This kind of rig is able to provide plenty of sail area for 
	fast passage making without becoming too tall, and the square 
	sails perform exceedingly well off the wind.&nbsp; Although it is common for the Indonesian Pinisi sailing rigs to use a 
	standing gaff with the sail brailled to the mast, we have 
	instead used a standard Western gaff so that the sail and the gaff can be raised 
	and lowered together.&nbsp; This provides much greater flexibility in reefing, 
	less windage, and in general far easier sail handling.</p>
	<p>As a result of the vessel's heavy displacement it is able to carry all 
	steel spars and yards, allowing more freedom with regard to the rig design 
	and size.&nbsp; Steel tube is no heavier than tropical 
	hardwood for masts and spars.&nbsp; All welded tube and fittings vastly 
	simplifies the rig construction while dramatically increasing the 
	strength and longevity of the rig.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</p>
		
		<h2>Six Cabin Layout</h2>
		
	<p><strong>EXTERIOR: </strong>The exterior configuration can be seen in the 
	sail plan above and in the layout images below.&nbsp; There is a raised aft 
	deck surrounded by a tall bulwark and wrap-around seating.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
	the forward deck there is a seating pod with a table for dining on deck.&nbsp; 
	The seating pod can be converted into an Asian seating platform for informal 
	lounging on deck, or for sleeping under the stars.&nbsp; Elsewhere on the 
	foredeck there is ample space for lounge chairs, and if dive operations are 
	anticipated, a pair of 'dive kiosks' can be placed on the fore deck, located 
	in place of the life raft cannisters.</p>
	
	<p><strong>INTERIOR ON DECK:&nbsp; </strong>The raised part of the deck house 
	contains the galley, with the bridge in its forward end.&nbsp; The on-deck location for 
	the galley was chosen in order to allow the guests to participate in gourmet 
	cooking adventures - potentially a central feature for charters.&nbsp; With most of the food storage located below 
	within a dedicated pantry, the galley is reserved for 
	cooking and entertainment.&nbsp; Wrap-around counters provide ample 
	space for food preparation.&nbsp; An additional food preparation area is located 
	right aft of the galley, which can function as a service area for the aft 
	seating, or as a BBQ and fish cleaning area, or it can simply be used as a 
	wet bar.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Accessible from the galley as well as from the starb'd 
	side-deck is a stairway leading below aft, providing access to the engine 
	room as well as to a large aft guest cabin / VIP suite / owner's cabin.&nbsp; In the deck house right forward of the bridge are a pair of cabins for 
	the captain and the mate / chief engineer.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Forward of that there is a comfortable lounge / dining room.&nbsp; &nbsp;Wrap-around lounge areas 
	are to port and starb'd, and a formal dining table is 
	located forward.&nbsp; A stairway on 
	center leads down to the guest hallway, providing ready access to 
	the forward guest cabins.&nbsp; The two staircases descending from the lounge 
	have between them a long table extending forward and aft of 
	the stairwell.&nbsp; The table creates headroom for the stairwell, and thus 
	becomes a 'feature' within the lounge, with seating all around.&nbsp; The 
	table also provides a service area, and in the aft end a media center.<br /> &nbsp;</p>

	<p class="table_text_centered">Click for Larger Image <br /> &nbsp;</p>
	
	<p><strong>INTERIOR BELOW:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>In addition to the captain 
	and mate / engineer cabins on deck, ten crew are accommodated in two cabins 
	forward.&nbsp; The crew cabins are accessed directly via a scuttle on the foredeck, as well as from 
	the guest hallway.&nbsp; 
	</p>
	
	<p>Aft of the crew cabins are four deluxe en-suite guest cabins plus one 
	V.I.P cabin, all of which are accessed via the stairway leading below from 
	within the on-deck lounge. Each guest suite has its own private head and shower, a desk, a couch, a 
	wardrobe, and ample storage.</p>
	
	<p>Aft of the guest cabins on center is the 
	engine room containing the propulsion engine and two primary 
	generators, pumps, filters, fuel manifold, etc.&nbsp; Outboard of the engine 
	room to port is a machinery space, which contains the air conditioning 
	chiller, dive air compressor, water maker pump, hot water heater, and a 
	'pony' generator to run only the refrigeration, basic lighting, and 
	to keep the house batteries charged when there are no guests aboard.&nbsp; 
	Outboard of the engine room to starb'd is a cool storage room, which 
	contains a large deep freeze and generous cooled storage for produce and 
	other food stores.</p>
	
	<p>Aft of the engine room is an athwartships hallway, which provides access 
	from on deck and from the galley to the engine room, and to the owner's 
	suite aft.&nbsp; Outboard of this hallway is a head to port and shower to starb'd 
	accessed from the owner's suite.<br />

	<h2>Five Cabin Layout</h2>
	
	<p><strong>INTERIOR ON DECK:&nbsp;</strong> If we elect to focus the 
	vessel's primary operations on high-end dive charters, we can locate the galley below 
	so that the aft part of the deck house can become a dedicated dive shop. In 
	this location the dive shop is sufficiently large to contain a storage / 
	filling station for 24 tanks; a repair station; and all of the shared dive 
	gear.&nbsp; The aft deck becomes a staging area for dive operations complete 
	with briefing area and washdown showers with direct access to the dive shop.&nbsp; 
	From within the dive shop access is provided to the galley below and to the 
	starb'd side deck.<br /> 
	&nbsp;</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p><strong>INTERIOR BELOW: </strong>&nbsp;Without changing any of the cabins 
	forward of the engine room, we have simply eliminated the grand suite aft in 
	favor of placing the galley there instead.&nbsp; This allows the galley to 
	be quite large, with its own ready access to the cool room / pantry below to 
	starb'd of the engine room.&nbsp; The drawing below shows how that would 
	work...<br /> 
	&nbsp;</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h2>Eight Cabin Layout</h2>
	
	<p> <strong>INTERIOR LAYOUT ON DECK</strong>:&nbsp; Keeping the galley located 
	below, this leaves the aft part of the on-deck house for use as a dedicated 
	dive shop as shown below, very much the same as with the 'five cabin' 
	layout.<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p class="table_text_centered"> 
	<a href="_drawings/31m_komodo_privateer_dive_shop_deck_plan.png">
	<img alt="31m Komodo Privateer - Kasten Marine Design, Inc." class="auto-style2" height="274" src="_drawings/31m_komodo_privateer_dive_shop_deck_plan.png" width="925" /></a><br />
	Click for Larger Images<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p><strong>INTERIOR BELOW</strong>:&nbsp; The interior length that is 
	available for the guest cabins forward of the engine room is twelve meters.&nbsp; If that length were divided into fourths 
	it would be possible to achieve eight cabins forward, having 
	dimensions of roughly 3 meters by 4 meters each.&nbsp; In all, this would 
	provide private sleeping cabins for sixteen guests, each cabin having a 
	private en-suite head and shower.&nbsp; For high end charters this is a bit 
	crowded.&nbsp; For charters focused on diving however, it may be just the 
	right arrangement.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the image below, we can see 
	how that would work... <br />
	&nbsp;</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	
	<p>That there are at least three different but equally viable cabin layout options 
	for this design illustrates the flexibility provided by the "<strong>Privateer</strong>" 
	hull form.&nbsp; If one were to mix and match among the above options or 
	change the guest suite layout there are a number of other layouts that could 
	be achieved, depending on the kind of charter guest being considered.</p>
	
	<p>The <strong>31m Komodo Privateer</strong> is a larger version of our
	<a href="flores_privateer_56.htm">17m Flores Privateer</a> and
	<a href="sulawesi_privateer_66.htm">20m Sulawesi Privateer</a> designs, also 
	intended for construction in Indonesia.&nbsp; For the <strong>31m Komodo Privateer</strong> the size has been increased 
	considerably for the sake of carrying more charter guests in greater comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	
	<p>As an extension of this design series, we developed a preliminary 
	design for a larger version called the
	<a href="45m_kalimantan_privateer.htm">45m Kalimantan Privateer</a>. This size 
	allows the vessel to have five much larger ultra luxurious guest suites, or 
	alternately to accommodate up to twenty guests.&nbsp; By comparison, a standard 
	Pinisi hull with sharply raked stem and stern would have to be 
	approximately 10 to 15% larger, or roughly 50 meters or so length on deck.&nbsp;</p>

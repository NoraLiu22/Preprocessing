Your clone will be younger than you because you will clone your self when you're 25 years old. By the time you reach 50 your clone will be 25 years old. Transplant your brain into your new body which is the clone with no brain. Each blood vessel will heal but the nervous connection must be connected by using nanotechnology or stem cell technology. Repair your brain cells by using stem cell technology. Do this and you will be young again. Keep on getting young again over and over continuously and you will live as long as you want. To grow a body with out a brain detect the stem cells that turn to braincells before they turn to braincells and extract them.You could either donate these cells to alzheimer's patients or just squash some of them. Its just blood because it did not turn to brain cells yet. The knowledge of good and evil is humans trying to make up ethics on "Godly" matters. The father is the old "me", the son is the new "me" and the holy spirit the transformation. The new "me" can be born of a surrogate mother who could be a virgin. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with god and the word was god. The word came for a while and lived among us. John1:14"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us." These quotes was taken out of the New International Version.  John wrote this 2000 years ago.  The dead-sea-scrolls proves this.  The word became flesh.  The only word that becomes flesh that I could think of is DNA.  The microscope was only invented in 1674 AD.  How did they know about DNA before the microscope was invented unless they had some help from a Divine Source.  Artificial impregnation was only invented nowadays and the virgin gave birth 2000 years ago.  The DNA which is the words that programs life multiplied into stem cells then became full living flesh.  The word became flesh.  Proof of the Divine Being's existence. We could do this nowadays.  The Divine made man in his own image, this is cloning.  The name Michael means " one who is like God".  If god had a clone, the clone would be the "one who is like God" right. The Creatormakes  man in their own image. The fountain of youth washes away your sins by allowing you to live long enough to learn from your mistakes. I am not calling my self god but the king of the universe uses the same technology. "Messiah" is in the image of his father and he and his father are one. This is not the only secret. There is more. I congratulate you because you know your stuff. The Most Awesome did go back in time to resurrect us. Artificial impregnation  was only invented nowadays and it was done back then. If it was Aliens we would have records of that technology and it would not be considered a miracle back then.  If I went back in time and killed me self I would resurrect my self and the resurrected self is the one who would go back in time. So the paradox is conquered. They resurrect us by faking our deaths. They do this by high technology. Body one controls body two and body one senses what body two senses. Only body one has a brain. This is done by cordless remote control. Rebirth and resurrection are separate. Every one thinks they are body two and doesn't know about body one but they are really body one. Body two dies instead of body one. We are reborn and we are resurrected. The Creator went back in time and made himself. Over populationCan be defeated by moving to other planets. Happiness can be achieved if we show each other love. Please spread the word or help me do this. You are lucky if you believe. From Wesley Saul Miller to the world.Email me at:   yosoy144 [at] hotmail.com</nodetxt><p><p><p><HR WIDTH=420><font size=-1><a href="/COPYR.html">Copyright&copy; 2001 Principia Cybernetica</a> - <a href="REFERPCP.html">Referencing this page</a></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=140 BGCOLOR=DED6A5><TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=15 BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR=#EEEEEE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>      <BR>   <B> <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>Author</FONT></B><br>  <FONT SIZE=-1> <author><a href ="don't have one.html">wesley saul miller</a> (<a href=mailto:yosoy[ at ]hotmail.com>yosoy[ at ]hotmail.com</a>) </author></FONT><p>   <B> <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>Date</FONT></B>   <BR><FONT SIZE=-1><update> Dec 20, 2001</update> </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>   <TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=0><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>      <CENTER>   <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF " SIZE=-1>    <a href=/DEFAULT.html>Home</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><FONT SIZE=-1><a href=/MSTT.html>Metasystem Transition Theory</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><a href=/EVOLUT.html>Evolutionary Theory</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><a href=/REPLICAT.html>Replication</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><parent><a href=/BIOREPLI.html>Immortality through Replication (annotated node)</a></parent></FONT>      </FONT>      <P><B>    <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>     Up      <BR>      <A HREF="/BIOREPLI.html">Prev.</A>      <img src="/Images/4arrows.gif" width="37" height="36" align="middle">      <a HREF="/Annotations/BIOREPLI.0.html">Next</A>      <BR>   Down   </FONT>   </B>       </CENTER><HR><P>     <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>      </FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=140 BGCOLOR=DED6A5>   <CENTER><P><HR align="left" noshade><a href="/MAKANNOT.html">Discussion</a><HR></CENTER>              <FONT SIZE=-1>   <P>   </FONT>   <CENTER>   <P><FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"><a TARGET=_blank href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/hypercard.acgi$replyform?">Reply</a></FONT><p>         <img src="/Images/space.gif" width="7" height="7" align="middle">   </CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 55 http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be:80/Annotations/BIOREPLI.1.html responseCode 3 200

<font size=+1><p>This month's fungus is the third species of <i>Armillaria</i> to make Fungus of the Month!   You may have already heard about our discovery and description of <a href="feb99.html"> <i>Armillaria nabsnona</i></a>, honey mushroom number nine, from the Olympic Peninsula in Washington.  You may have also already read about the tenth anniversary of the humongous fungus, <a href="apr2002"><i>Armillaria gallica</i></a> in 2002.  

<p> As you read on those pages, up until fairly recently there was considered to be only a single species of  <i>Armillaria</i>, namely <i>Armillaria mellea</i> (Vahl:Fr.) Kummer. Until the late 1970s <I>Armillaria mellea</I> was considered by most researchers to be a pleiomorphic species with a wide host range and distribution. It was considered by different researchers to be either a virulent pathogen (in the west) or a opportunistic pathogen (and then not very virulent) in the eastern United States.  Its host
range was phenomenal, one of the broadest known for fungi, and its morphology was extremely variable.

<p><img src="images/asolid3.jpg" align=right alt="Armillaria solidipes">Since fruiting body morphology proved difficult, other avenues of research were followed.  The most productive was placing single spores of different fungi in agar medium and seeing whether they would mate.  If they did mate, two specimens were considered to be the same biological species. You can read about the details of how this was accomplished in  <a href="arm.html"> The state of taxonomy of the genus <i>Armillaria</i></a>, but the end result was that there are TEN North American Biological Species (NABS) and five European Biological species (EBS), along with many other biological species from around the world. There's a chart of these accepted species <a href="armnames.html">here.</a>

<p>NABS I was associated with a specimen of <i>Armillaria ostoyae</i> collected and described (as <i>Armillariella ostoyae</i>) by Romagnesi in France in 1970, mainly because European Armillaria researchers were far ahead of those in the Americas. However, they neglected a species described by Charles H. Peck in 1900, which we show in a recently published paper to be NABS I.  Because the oldest name takes precedent, the correct name for NABS I is <i>Armillaria solidipes</i>. 

<p>You can read all the details in this paper, which is <a href="http://pnwfungi.org/pdf_files/manuscripts_volume_3/naf20087/naf2008717.pdf" target="new">available here as a pdf file.</a>

<p>Burdsall, H. H., Jr., and T. J. Volk. 2008. <i>Armillaria solidipes</i>, an older name for the fungus called <i>Armillaria ostoyae</i>. North American Fungi 3(7): 261-267. doi: 10.2509/naf2008.003.00717 Published August 29, 2008 


<p><b>Abstract: </b> The name <i>Armillaria ostoyae</i> has been applied for nearly 40 years to the <i>Armillaria</i> species
that causes a major root-rot of conifers throughout Europe, the northern United States, much of Canada,
and more recently in China. However, C.H. Peck described this species in 1900 under the name <i>A.
solidipes,</i> well before the name <i>A. ostoyae</i> was coined by Romagnesi in 1970. Thus, the name <i>A. solidipes</i>
must be used for the taxon wherever it occurs.

<p>I recommend you read the paper for all the gory details.

<p>Fungal nomenclature is fun!

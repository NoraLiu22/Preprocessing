<b>THE GREAT DIVERGENCE: EUROPE, CHINA,
AND THE MAKING OF THE MODERN WORLD
ECONOMY</b> by Kenneth Pomeranz, Princeton:
Princeton University Press 2000:  382 pp. 
<p>


This book makes, bar none, the biggest and most important  contribution
to our new understanding of the causes and mechanisms that brought about
THE GREAT DIVERGENCE between the West and the Rest and China in
particular. Other academics and pundits like Samuel Huntington [1996]
who coined this phrase still deal in civilizational differences and
clashes and David Landes [1997] still trots out the same tired old
shibboleths about alleged cultural differences to explain THE WEALTH AND
POVERTY OF NATIONS.  Pomeranz's colleague Bin Wong draws on European and
Chinese evidence properly to reject all this a- indeed anti- historical
Euroocentric nonsense. Although his CHINA TRANSFORMED [1997] does so
with important new data, he also still confines his analysis to a
comparative method that seeks out allegedly crucial differences to
explain the great divergence.  <p>

Pomeranz instead offers an entirely new and refreshing departure.
Although he alios makes new comparisons between Europe, China, Japan,
India, Southeast Asia and India; Pomeranz's analysis  also connects all
these and more in a bold new sweep that should immediately make all
previous and most contemporary related work obsolescent. His well
documented comparisons, like some of Wong's also, demonstrate that the
respectively moat advanced Chinese regions matched or bested European
ones in standard of living and especially the most important one, that
is length of life itself; in  consumption of calories from grain  and
even from sugar, as well as of household goods and textiles; in storage,
distribution and availability of grain to counter climatically induced
famines; in quantities of long-distance grain shipments that were
multiples  of those through the Baltic; in textile production and
earnings of textile workers; and in commercialization of the economy and
especially of agriculture, including markets in land, labor, inputs,
products and credit. In all of these and other respects, Pomeranz shows
that seventeenth and eighteenth China - and also Japan and in many ways
Southeast Asia and India - were fully as or more developed - and
"capitalist" if the term then retains any  meaning -  than Europe.
However, Pomeranz also insists that properly Western or even all of
Europe should be compared to only a region of China such as the Yangze
Valley.  <p>

But more importantly still, Pomeranz also goes beyond simple comparisons
and  ends book by writing that it  "has shown that rather than pretend
we are seeing differences among truly independent entities on the eve of
industrialization, we must acknowledge the importance of pre-existing
connections in creating those differences." And so he has. In a tour de
force through a veritable gold mine of his own and others' original and
also secondary data, Pomeranz uses and even develops and combines new
micro- and macro- economic, ecological and counter-factual analytic
tools of analysis to mine, refine, connect and relate his rich ores in
China, Europe, Africa, the Americas, indeed the world.  Although his
multivariate analysis is too sophisticated and intricate to do justice
to here, fundamentally his argument rests on two main pillars,
ecological and input saving/substitution - also with ecological
ramifications.  <p>

The ecological damage of previous growth ravaged both China and Europe
and especially their forests and therefore their supplies of wood, thus
driving up its [opportunity] price, particularly with respect to coal as
an alternative.  Fortunately however, in Britain coal deposits were
located near potential industrial users, while the northeast Chinese
coal deposits were so far from the coastal population and industrial
centers as to make their use uneconomic. Therefore, coal driven
industrialization as in Britain did not begin in China  and also not in
relatively coal poor India, nor for that matter in the Netherlands that
had to depend on peet.  

<p>
The other pillar of Pomeranz's argument is that Europe and particularly
Britain derived huge benefits from its overseas colonies. But his
argument is far more sophisticated than one of simple exploitation and
capital drain a la Marx, Eric Williams or the Wallerstein/Frank  world
systemises. Pomeranz argues- and constructs numeric estimates to show -
that the import of virtually free calories from the sugar/slave
plantations [and he might have added cod fisheries] obviated their
production in Europe, where they wold have further increased t costs of
production imposed by already h and ever increasing land and wood deriva
fuel constraints. A fortiori, the use of American timber and shipping
reduced the need to cut down even more forests and make wood and fuel
all the more scarce in Europe and particularly in Britain. The import of
ctton textiles from India had analogous effects: Though cotton may not
have replaced wool, it certainly obviated an alterative increase in wool
production, and therefore of sheep 'that ate men' as well as grass,
which would otherwise have had to be grown with  still more enclosures
and even more deforestation.  But how did Europe pay for its imported
cotton textiles from India and of china from China, etc? Exclusively
with silver also derived at low cost from its American colonies. 

<p>
Therefore Pomeranz argues, in Europe the land constraint was relieved by
imports from its external periphery, which at the same time   also
became a captive market for its labor intensive manufactures and the
re-export of textiles  from Asia. Later of course, these peripheries
would supply even more  land- intensive - and in Europe land-saving! -
cheap commodities, especially cotton and wheat and then alos meat, while
also absorbing 60 millions of Europe's surplus population. By contrast,
the much more internal Chinese periphery was able to pursue an import
substation policy from early on, which simultaneously deprived the
Chinese manufacturing centers of markets and by stimulating local demand
there reduced the export supply and increased the import price of
commodities  to  these centers from their interior peripheries.  Thus
Pomeranz shows how Europe's overseas regions ameliorated its ecological
and Malthusian constraints as China's  and other Asian peripheries never
could.

<p>
With this kind of new data and analysis, Pomeranz becomes the most
important, accomplished and hopefully the most influential member of
what Jack Goldstone has called the new "California School" of historians
writing on China and the world, including Bin Wong, von Glahn [on money
1997], Dennis Flynn and Arturo Giraldez [on silver 1998], Robert Marks
[on South China ecology 1997] with honourary membership generously
extended to me [for China in the global economy 1998].  As the proponent
of the latter, my critique if it is one of Pomeranz , or perhaps better
my encouragement to him, is to extend his  analysis even further.  All
of us agree  that industrialization and  great divergence were not the
teleological result of  allegedly  pre- existing cultural and
institutional diffes and European "exceptionalisms." Instead we agree -
in a minority of still only a half dozen ? - that this process emerged
only around 1800 and not earlier as the contingent localized reactions
at one end of Eurasia to a highly complex set of interrelated
circumstances in the world as a whole in the absence of which Europe
wold most probably have continued on much like the rest of Eurasia.  The
task therefore is  to search out and demonstrate the place, role and
importance of these pre- existing and newly generated GL SYSTEMIC
connections and their structure and dynamic in creating regional,
sectoral, and class differences in the wealth and poverty of nations.
Pomeranz  brilliantly illuminates the way for others to follow and one
day also to transcend his pioneering work.

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 589]]</font> In the 
        second volume of <em>Nature</em>, p. 510, I reviewed the late Prof. Hartt's 
        &quot;Geology and Physical Geography of Brazil,&quot; and called attention to the 
        author's views, as well as those of the late Prof. Agassiz, relating to 
        the supposed glaciation of that country. From their very positive statements 
        I concluded that the evidence as described by them did actually exist, 
        and that until it was disproved it should not be ignored. In my &quot;Darwinism,&quot; 
        p. 370, I stated, on the authority of my friend, Mr. J. C. Branner, now 
        Professor of Geology in the Stanford University, California, who succeeded 
        Prof. Hartt in Brazil, and had a much more extensive knowledge of the 
        country, that the supposed glacial drift and erratic blocks were all results 
        of suba&euml;rial denudation. Recently, however, Sir Henry Howorth has 
        quoted some passages from my review in illustration of the wild and incredible 
        theories of some geologists, as samples, in fact, of the &quot;Glacial Nightmare&quot;; 
        and, as no authoritative disproof has yet been given of the exceedingly 
        strong and positive statements of Agassiz and Hartt, I beg leave to lay 
        before the readers of <em>Nature</em> some extracts from a paper on &quot;The 
        Supposed Glaciation of Brazil,&quot; by Prof. Branner, which will shortly be 
        published, and of which he has kindly sent me a type-written copy in advance. 
        As a partial justification of what has now proved my too hasty acceptance 
        of the statements of these gentlemen, I will give one passage in which 
        Prof. Agassiz refers to the supposed glacial phenomena near Ceara:--&quot;I 
        may say that in the whole valley of Hasli there are no accumulations of 
        morainic materials more characteristic than those I have found here, not 
        even about the Kirchel; neither are there any remains of the kind more 
        striking about the valleys of Mount Desert in Maine, where the glacial 
        phenomena are so remarkable; nor in the valleys of Loch Fine, Loch Awe, 
        and Loch Long, in Scotland, where the traces of ancient glaciers are so 
        distinct.&quot; Both Agassiz and Hartt were equally strong as to similar phenomena 
        near Rio.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be first noted that Hartt had only spent 
        eighteen months in Brazil when he wrote his book, and his views on the 
        glacial phenomena were thus based on a very hasty survey of that enormous 
        territory. Prof. Branner went with him when he again visited Brazil in 
        1874, helped him in his geological work till his death in 1877, and himself 
        remained five years longer making a geological survey of the country; 
        and he states that, before his death, Hartt's views underwent a radical 
        change. Prof. Branner says:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Under his direction I did more or less work 
        in the mountains about Rio de Janeiro for the purpose of sifting the evidence 
        of glaciation in that region, and I am glad to say, in justice to the 
        memory and scientific spirit of my former chief and friend, that long 
        before his death he had entirely abandoned the theory of the glaciation 
        of Brazil, and that the subject had ceased to receive further attention, 
        even as a working hypothesis.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few extracts must now be given showing to what 
        causes the phenomena which deceived these observers are really due. And 
        first as to what were supposed to be erratic boulders often embedded in 
        boulder clay.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The boulders believed to be erratics are not 
        erratics in the sense implied, though they are not always in place. The 
        first and most common are boulders of decomposition, either rounded or 
        subangular, left by the decay of granite or gneiss. Sometimes they are 
        embedded in residuary, and therefore unstratified, clays, formed by the 
        decomposition in place of the surrounding rock. And everyone has heard 
        of the great depth to which rocks are decomposed in Brazil. The true origin 
        of these boulders and their accompanying clays is often obscured by the 
        'creep' of the materials, or in hilly districts by land slides, great 
        or small, that throw the whole mass into a confusion closely resembling 
        that so common in the true glacier boulder clays. In this connection too 
        much stress cannot be placed upon the matter of land slides; they are 
        very common in the hilly portions of Brazil, and aside from profound striations 
        and facetting produce phenomena that, on a small scale, resemble glacial 
        till in a very striking degree.&quot; . . .</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The second method by which these boulders have 
        been formed is quite similar to the first, but instead of being cores 
        of granite or gneiss, they have been derived by the same process of exfoliation 
        and decomposition from the angular blocks into which the dikes of diorite, 
        diabase, or other dark-coloured rocks break up. Their colour marks them 
        as quite different from the surrounding granites, and the dikes themselves 
        are almost invariably concealed. The residuary clays derived from the 
        decomposition of these dikes are somewhat different in colour from those 
        yielded by the granites, so that when 'creep' or land-slides add their 
        confusion to the original relations of the rocks the resemblance to true 
        glacial boulder clays is pretty strong. The chance of discovering the 
        source of such boulders is further decreased by the depth to which the 
        mass of the rock has decayed, and by the inpenetrable jungles that cover 
        the whole country, and so effectually limit the range of one's observations. 
        Dikes, such as these last mentioned, are not uncommon in the mountains 
        about Rio de Janeiro. Indeed, what have generally been regarded as the 
        very best evidences of Brazilian glaciation, some of the boulders near 
        the English hotel at Tijca, fall under this head, though some are of gneiss. 
        The fact is that the great mountain masses about Rio are of granite or 
        gneiss, while some of the boulders come from the dikes of diabase or other 
        dark-coloured rock high on their sides--dikes which were not visited by 
        Agassiz or Hartt.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Branner then describes a third class of 
        supposed erratic, derived from certain sandstone beds of the tertiary 
        deposits, which, by exposure, change to the hardest kind of quartzite, 
        and when the surrounding strata are removed by denudation, and a few blocks 
        of this quartzite are left, they are so unlike the rocks by which they 
        are surrounded that unless the observer has given a special study to the 
        tertiary sediments, he is liable to be misled by them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide-spread coating of drift-like materials 
        that covers considerable areas of the country, consisting of boulders, 
        cobbles, and gravels, sometimes assorted and sometimes having clay and 
        sand mixed with them, are then described, and are shown to be due to the 
        denudation of the tertiary beds during the last emergence of the land, 
        aided by subsequent suba&euml;rial denudation and surface wash. Prof. 
        Branner thus concludes:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I may sum up my own views with the statement 
        that I did not see, during eight years of travel and geological observations 
        that extended from the Amazon valley and the coast through the highlands 
        of Brazil and to the head waters of the Paraguay and the Tapagos, a single 
        phenomenon in the way of boulders, gravels, clays, soils, surfaces, or 
        topography, that required to be referred to glaciation.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very clear statement above given of the real 
        nature of the phenomena which deceived Prof. Agassiz and Mr. Hartt, is 
        very instructive, and it shows us that a superficial resemblance to drift, 
        boulder-clay, and erratic blocks, in a comparatively unknown country, 
        must not be held to be proofs of glaciation. <font color="99000">[[p. 
        590]]</font> We require either striated rock surfaces or boulders, or 
        undoubted <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es</em>, or erratics, which can be 
        proved not to exist sufficiently near to have been brought by &quot;creep&quot; 
        or land-slides. In view of these liabilities to error, we may be almost 
        sure that the supposed evidences of glaciation described by the late Mr. 
        Belt in his &quot;Naturalist in Nicaragua&quot; (p. 260), are explicable in the 
        same manner as the Brazilian evidences, since he nowhere found glacial 
        stri&aelig; or any boulders that could be proved to be true erratics; 
        and this is the more certain because he himself states (p. 265), &quot;I have 
        myself seen, near Pernambuco, and in the province of Maranham, in Brazil, 
        a great drift deposit that I believe to be of glacial origin.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All students of the past and present history 
        of the earth are indebted to Prof. Branner for having relieved them of 
        a great difficulty--a true glacial nightmare--that of having to explain 
        the recent occurrence of glaciation on a large scale far within the tropics 
        and on surfaces not much elevated above the sea-level.</p>

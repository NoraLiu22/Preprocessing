<H4><B> The Prayer of Reparation </H4></B>
<P><I>(The priest recites inaudibly the prayer of preparation of alter):
Lord, who knows the hearts of all, who is Holy, and who rests amid the
saints; who alone is without sin, and who is mighty to forgive sins;
You, O Lord, know my unworthiness, my unfitness, and my unmeetness,
unto this, Your holy service; and I have no boldness that I should
draw near and open my mouth before Your holy glory; but according to
the multitude of Your tender mercies, pardon me a sinner, and grant
unto me the I may find grace and mercy at this hour, and send me
straight form high (here he uncovers the chalice, and arranges it upon
the alter, together with the paten and the spoon, continuing mean
while) that I may begin, and may be made fit, and may finish Your holy
service according to Your pleasure, according to the good pleasure of
Your will, and for a sweet Saviour of incense. Even so, O our Lord;
be with us, take part with us in this; bless us; for You are the
forgiveness of our sins, the light of our souls, our life, and our
strength and our confidence; You are He unto whom we ascribe praise,
and glory, and worship, O Father and Son and Holy Spirit, now and at
all times, and unto the age of all ages. Amen.

(He continues immediately, and still inaudibly with the prayer after
the preparation of the altar): 

You, O Lord, have taught us this great mystery of salvation.  You have
called us, Your lowly and unworthy servants, to be servants of Your
holy altar.  O You, our Lord, make us meet, in the power of Your Holy
Spirit, to finish this service; so that, without falling into
condemnation before Your great Glory, we may offer up unto You a
sacrifice of praise, glory, and great beauty, in Your sanctuary.  O
God, who gives grace, who sends forth salvation, who works all in all,
grant, O Lord, that our sacrifice may be accepted before You for my
sins, and for the ignorances of Your people; for, behold it is holy,
according to the gift of Your Holy Spirit, in Christ Jesus our Lord,
through whom becomes You glory, and honour and worship, with Him and
the Holy Spirit, the Life-Giver, who is of one essence with You, now
and at all times and unto the age of all ages. Amen.</I></P><HR>

Therefore we ask and entreat Your goodness, O Philanthropic one, grant us
to complete this holy day, and all the days of our life, in all peace with
your fear. All envy, all temptation, all the work of satan the counsel of
wicked men and the rising up of enemies, hidden and manifest, take them
away from us, and from all your people, and form this table, and from this
holy place that is yours. But those things which are good and profitable
do provide for us, for it is you who have given us the authority to tread
on serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy. And lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, by the grace, compassion
and philanthropy of your Only-Begotten Son, our Lord, God and Saviour
Jesus Christ. Through whom the glory, the honour, the dominion, and the
adoration are due unto you, with him and the Holy Spirit, the Life-Giver
who is of one essence with you, now and at all times and unto the age of

Master, Lord Jesus Christ, the co-eternal Logos of the unblemished Father
who is of one essence with him and the Holy Spirit. For you are the living
bread which came down from heaven and did aforetime make yourself a Lamb
without spot, for the life of the world. We ask and entreat your goodness,
O philanthropic One (here the priest points with his hand to the bread set
before him on the paten) Show your face upon this bread (and here he
points to the wine set before him in the chalice) and upon this cup, which
we have set upon (here he points to the altar) this, your priestly table.
(and her he makes the sign of the cross three times over the bread and
wine together, saying at first signing) Bless them, (at the second
signing) sanctify them, (and at the third signing) purify them and change
them (her he points with his hand to the bead in particular) in order that
this bread, on the one hand may become indeed your holy Body (here he
points with his hand to the chalice in particular)and the mixture on the
other hand, which is in this cup, indeed your precious Blood, and may they
become for all of us a partaking, healing, and salvation of our souls, our
bodies and our spirits. For you are our God and glory is due unto you with
Your Good Father and the Holy Spirit, the Life-Giver who is of one essence
with you, now and at all times and unto the age of all ages. Amen.</I></P>

you have visited them with mercies and compassion, heal them. Remember, O
Lord, our fathers and brethren who are traveling, bring them back to their

O Lord, those who are in captivity, save them all. Remember, O Lord, our
fathers and brethren who have fallen asleep and reposed in the Orthodox
faith, repose all their souls.  Remember, O Lord, those who have been
brought unto you these gifts, those on whose behalf they have brought, and
those by whom they have been brought, give them all the heavenly reward.
Remember, O Lord, those who are distressed in hardships and oppressions,
save them from all their hardships. Remember, O Lord, the catechumens of
your people, have mercy upon them; confirm their faith in you; uproot all
traces of idolatry form their hearts. Your law, your fear, your
commandments, your truths, and your holy precepts, establish in their
hearts. Grant that they know the steadfastness of the preaching they have
received. And in the set time, may they be worthy of the washing of the
new birth for the remission of their sins; as you prepare them to be a
temple of your Holy Spirit, by the grace, compassion, and philanthropy
(love of mankind) of your only-Begotten Son, our Lord God and Saviour
Jesus Christ. Through whom the glory, the honour, the dominion, and the
adoration are due unto you, with him and the Holy Spirit, the Life-Giver

Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all
ages; Light of light, true God of true God, begotten not created, of one
essence with the Father, by whom all things were made; Who for us men and
our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit
and of the Virgin Mary, and became Man. And he was crucified for us under
Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried. And the third day He rose from
the dead, according to the scriptures, ascended into the heavens; he sits
at the right hand of his Father, and He is coming again in his glory to
judge the living and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end. Yes, we
believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Life-Giver, who proceeds from
the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified,
who spoke by the prophets. And in one holy, catholic and apostolic church.
We confess one baptism for the remission of sins. We look for the

Pantocrator for your mercy is great upon us, for you have prepared for us
those things which the angels desire to behold. We ask and entreat your
goodness, O Philanthropic One, that since you have purified us all, you
join us unto Yourself, through our partaking of your divine mysteries.
That we may become filled with your holy spirit with the longing for your
true love, may we speak of your glory at all times, in Christ Jesus, our
Lord, through whom the glory, the honour, the dominion, and the adoration
are due unto you, is of one essence with you, now, and at all times and
unto the age of all ages. Amen. </I></P>

<I><B>PRIEST: (Inaudibly: absolution to the father)</B>
O Master, Lord God the Pantocrator, healer of our souls, our bodies, and
spirits, you are he who said unto our father Peter through the mouth of
your only-begotten son, “You are Peter, upon this rock I will build y
church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it, and I will
give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. That which you will bind
upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens, and that which you will
loose upon the earth shall be loosed in the heavens. Therefore, O Lord,
let your servants, my fathers, my brethren and my own weakness, be
absolved by my mouth, through your holy spirit, O you, good and
Philanthropic one. O God, who takes away the sin of the world, hasten, to
accept the repentance of your servants for a light of understanding and
forgiveness of sins. For you are a compassionate and merciful God; you are
patient; your mercy is great and true. If we have sinned against you
either by word or by deeds, pardon and forgive us, as a good and
Philanthropic one. O God, absolve us and all your people form every sin,
form every curse, form every denial, form every false oath, and from every
encounter with the heretics and the heathens. O our Lord, grant us a
reason, power and understanding to flee from any evil deed of the
adversary, and grant us to do what is pleasing unto you at all times.
Inscribe our names with all the choir of your saints in the kingdom of the
heavens, in Christ Jesus, our Lord, through whom the glory, the honour,
the dominion, and the adoration are due unto you, with him and the holy
spirit, the Life- giver who is of one essence with you, now and at all
times and unto the age of all ages. Amen. </I>
<P>
<I><B>PRIEST: (Inaudibly)</B>
Remember, O Lord, my own weakness and forgive my many sins, and where
transgression has abounded, let your grace be multiplied in abundance.
Because of my own sins and the abomination of my heart, deprive not your
people of the grace of your holy spirit. Absolve us and absolve all your
people form every sin, from every curse, from every denial, from every
false oath, and from every encounter with the heretics and the heathens. O
our Lord, grant us a reason, power and understanding to flee from any evil
deed of the adversary, and grant us to do what is pleasing unto your at
all times. Inscribe our names with all the choir of your saints in the
kingdom of the heavens, in Christ Jesus, our Lord, through whom the glory,
the honour, the dominion, and the adoration are due unto you, with him and
the holy spirit, the life-giver who is of one essence with you, now and at
all times and unto the age of all ages. Amen</I></P>

<B>PRIEST:</B>
Amen. Amen. Amen. I believe, I believe, I believe and confess to the last
breath, that this is the life-giving body that your only-begotten Son, our
Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ took from our lady, the lady of us all,
the holy Theotokos Saint May. He made it one with his divinity without
mingling, without confusion and without alteration. He witnessed the good
confession before Pontius Pilate. He gave it up for us upon the holy wood
of the cross, of his own will, for us all. Truly I believe that his
divinity parted not from his humanity for a single moment nor a twinkling
of an eye. Given for us for salvation, remission of sins and eternal life
to those who partake of him. I believe, I believe, I believe that this is
so in truth. Amen.

of Jesus Christ be with you. Sing. Alleluia. Pray for the worthy communion
of the immaculate heavenly, and holy mysteries. Lord have mercy.

Glory to you, O Lord, glory to You.

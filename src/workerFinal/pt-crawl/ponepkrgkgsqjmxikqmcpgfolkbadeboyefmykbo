      <h3><b>General Characteristics of the
Renaissance</b></h3>
      </center>
      <a name="general">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Renaissance"
literally means "rebirth." It refers especially to the rebirth of
learning that began in Italy in the fourteenth century, spread to
the north, including England, by the sixteenth century, and ended
in the north in the mid-seventeenth century (earlier in Italy).
During this period, there was an enormous renewal of interest in
and study of classical antiquity. </a>
      <p><a name="general">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the
Renaissance was more than a
"rebirth." It was also an age of new discoveries, both geographical
(exploration of the New World) and intellectual. Both kinds of
discovery resulted in changes of tremendous import for Western
civilization. In science, for example, Copernicus (1473-1543)
attempted to prove that the sun rather than the earth was at the
center of the planetary system, thus radically altering the cosmic
world view that had dominated antiquity and the Middle Ages. In
religion, Martin Luther (1483-1546) challenged and ultimately
caused the division of one of the major institutions that had
united Europe throughout the Middle Ages--the Church. In fact,
Renaissance thinkers often thought of themselves as ushering in the
modern age, as distinct from the ancient and medieval eras. </a></p>
      <p><a name="general">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study of the
Renaissance might well
center on five interrelated issues. First, although Renaissance
thinkers often tried to associate themselves with classical
antiquity and to dissociate themselves from the Middle Ages,
important continuities with their recent past, such as belief in
the Great Chain of Being, were still much in evidence. Second,
during this period, certain significant political changes were
taking place. Third, some of the noblest ideals of the period were
best expressed by the movement known as Humanism. Fourth, and
connected to Humanist ideals, was the literary doctrine of
"imitation," important for its ideas about how literary works
should be created. Finally, what later probably became an even more
far-reaching influence, both on literary creation and on modern
life in general, was the religious movement known as the
Reformation.</a></p>
      <p><a name="general">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renaissance
thinkers strongly
associated themselves with the values of classical antiquity,
particularly as expressed in the newly rediscovered classics of
literature, history, and moral philosophy. Conversely, they tended
to dissociate themselves from works written in the Middle Ages, a
historical period they looked upon rather negatively. According to
them, the Middle Ages were set in the "middle" of two much more
valuable historical periods, antiquity and their own. Nevertheless,
as modern scholars have noted, extremely important continuities
with the previous age still existed. </a></p>

      <h3>
      <center><a name="being"><b>The Great Chain of
Being</b></a></center>
      </h3>
      <a name="being">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the most important of the
continuities with the Classical period was the concept of the Great
Chain of Being. Its major premise was that every existing thing in
the universe had its "place" in a divinely planned hierarchical
order, which was pictured as a chain vertically extended.
("Hierarchical" refers to an order based on a series of higher and
lower, strictly ranked gradations.) An object's "place" depended on
the relative proportion of "spirit" and "matter" it contained--the
less "spirit" and the more "matter," the lower down it stood. At
the bottom, for example, stood various types of inanimate objects,
such as metals, stones, and the four elements (earth, water, air,
fire). Higher up were various members of the vegetative class, like
trees and flowers. Then came animals; then humans; and then angels.
At the very top was God. Then within each of these large groups,
there were other hierarchies. For example, among metals, gold was
the noblest and stood highest; lead had less "spirit" and more
matter and so stood lower. (Alchemy was based on the belief that
lead could be changed to gold through an infusion of "spirit.") The
various species of plants, animals, humans, and angels were
similarly ranked from low to high within their respective segments.
Finally, it was believed that between the segments themselves,
there was continuity (shellfish were lowest among animals and
shaded into the vegetative class, for example, because without
locomotion, they most resembled plants). </a>
      <p><a name="being">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides
universal orderliness, there
was universal interdependence. This was implicit in the doctrine of
"correspondences," which held that different segments of the chain
reflected other segments. For example, Renaissance thinkers viewed
a human being as a microcosm (literally, a "little world") that
reflected the structure of the world as a whole, the macrocosm;
just as the world was composed of four "elements" (earth, water,
air, fire), so too was the human body composed of four substances
called "humours," with characteristics corresponding to the four
elements. (Illness occurred when there was an imbalance or
"disorder" among the humours, that is, when they did not exist in
proper proportion to each other.) "Correspondences" existed
everywhere, on many levels. Thus the hierarchical organization of
the mental faculties was also thought of as reflecting the
hierarchical order within the family, the state, and the forces of
nature. When things were properly ordered, reason ruled the
emotions, just as a king ruled his subjects, the parent ruled the
child, and the sun governed the planets. But when disorder was
present in one realm, it was correspondingly reflected in other
realms. For example, in Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>, the
simultaneous disorder in family relationships and in the state
(child ruling parent, subject ruling king) is reflected in the
disorder of Lear's mind (the loss of reason) as well as in the
disorder of nature (the raging storm). Lear even equates his loss
of reason to "a tempest in my mind." </a></p>
      <p><a name="being">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though
Renaissance writers seemed to
be quite on the side of "order," the theme of "disorder" is much in
evidence, suggesting that the age may have been experiencing some
growing discomfort with traditional hierarchies. According to the
chain of being concept, all existing things have their precise
place and function in the universe, and to depart from one's proper
place was to betray one's nature. Human beings, for example, were
pictured as placed between the beasts and the angels. To act
against human nature by not allowing reason to rule the
emotions--was to descend to the level of the beasts. In the other
direction, to attempt to go above one's proper place, as Eve did
when she was tempted by Satan, was to court disaster. Yet
Renaissance writers at times showed ambivalence towards such a
rigidly organized universe. For example, the Italian philosopher
Pico della Mirandola, in a work entitled <i>On the Dignity of Man</i>,
exalted human beings as capable of rising to the level of the
angels through philosophical contemplation. Also, some Renaissance
writers were fascinated by the thought of going beyond boundaries
set by the chain of being. A major example was the title character
of Christopher Marlowe's play <i>Doctor Faustus</i>.
Simultaneously displaying the grand spirit of human aspiration and
the more questionable hunger for superhuman powers, Faustus seems
in the play to be both exalted and punished. Marlowe's drama, in
fact, has often been seen as the embodiment of Renaissance
ambiguity in this regard, suggesting both its fear of and its
fascination with pushing beyond human limitations. </a></p>

      <h3>
      <center><b>Political Implications of the Chain of
Being</b></center>
      </h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fear of "disorder" was not
merely philosophical--it had significant political ramifications.
The proscription against trying to rise beyond one's place was of
course useful to political rulers, for it helped to reinforce their
authority. The implication was that civil rebellion caused the
chain to be broken, and according to the doctrine of
correspondences, this would have dire consequences in other realms.
It was a sin against God, at least wherever rulers claimed to rule
by "Divine Right." (And in England, the King was also the head of
the Anglican Church.) In Shakespeare, it was suggested that the sin
was of cosmic proportions: civil disorders were often accompanied
by meteoric disturbances in the heavens. (Before Halley's theory
about periodic orbits, comets, as well as meteors, were thought to
be disorderly heavenly bodies.)
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need for strong political
rule
was in fact very significant, for the Renaissance had brought an
end for the most part to feudalism, the medieval form of political
organization. The major political accomplishment of the
Renaissance, perhaps, was the establishment of effective central
government, not only in the north but in the south as well.
Northern Europe saw the rise of national monarchies headed by
kings, especially in England and France. Italy saw the rise of the
territorial city-state often headed by wealthy oligarchic families.
Not only did the chain of being concept provide a rationale for the
authority of such rulers; it also suggested that there was ideal
behavior that was appropriate to their place in the order of
things. It is no wonder then that much Renaissance literature is
concerned with the ideals of kingship, with the character and
behavior of rulers, as in Machiavelli's <i>Prince</i> or
Shakespeare's <i>Henry V</i>. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other ideals and values that
were
represented in the literature were even more significant. It was
the intellectual movement known as Humanism that may have expressed
most fully the values of the Renaissance and made a lasting
contribution to our own culture. </p>
      <p><a name="human"></a></p>
      <center>
      <h3><a name="human"><b>Humanism </b></a></h3>
      </center>
      <a name="human">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A common
oversimplification of
Humanism suggests that it gave renewed emphasis to life in this
world instead of to the otherworldly, spiritual life associated
with the Middle Ages. Oversimplified as it is, there is
nevertheless truth to the idea that Renaissance Humanists placed
great emphasis upon the dignity of man and upon the expanded
possibilities of human life in this world. For the most part, it
regarded human beings as social creatures who could create
meaningful lives only in association with other social beings.</a>
      <p><a name="human">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the terms
used in the Renaissance
itself, Humanism represented a shift from the "contemplative life"
to the "active life." In the Middle Ages, great value had often
been attached to the life of contemplation and religious devotion,
away from the world (though this ideal applied to only a small
number of people). In the Renaissance, the highest cultural values
were usually associated with active involvement in public life, in
moral, political, and military action, and in service to the state.
Of course, the traditional religious values coexisted with the new
secular values; in fact, some of the most important Humanists, like
Erasmus, were Churchmen. Also, individual achievement, breadth of
knowledge, and personal aspiration (as personified by Doctor
Faustus) were valued. The concept of the "Renaissance Man" refers
to an individual who, in addition to participating actively in the
affairs of public life, possesses knowledge of and skill in many
subject areas. (Such figures included Leonardo Da Vinci and John
Milton, as well as Francis Bacon, who had declared, "I have taken
all knowledge to be my province.") Nevertheless, individual
aspiration was not the major concern of Renaissance Humanists, who
focused rather on teaching people how to participate in and rule a
society (though only the nobility and some members of the middle
class were included in this ideal). Overall, in consciously
attempting to revive the thought and culture of classical
antiquity, perhaps the most important value the Humanists extracted
from their studies of classical literature, history, and moral
philosophy was the social nature of humanity. </a></p>

      <h3>
      <center><a name="imitate"><b>"Imitation" </b></a></center>
      </h3>
      <a name="imitate">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another concept
derived from the
classical past (though it was present in the Middle Ages too), was
the literary doctrine of "imitation." Of the two senses in which
the term had traditionally been used, the theoretical emphasis of
Renaissance literary critics was less on the "imitation" that meant
"mirroring life" and more on the "imitation" that meant "following
predecessors." In contrast to our own emphasis on "originality,"
the goal was not to create something entirely new. To a great
extent, contemporary critics believed that the great literary works
expressing definitive moral values had already been written in
classical antiquity. </a>
      <p><a name="imitate">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Theoretically, then, it was the task
of the writer to translate for present readers the moral vision of
the past, and they were to do this by "imitating" great works,
adapting them to a Christian perspective and milieu. (Writers of
the Middle Ages also practiced "imitation" in this sense, but did
not have as many classical models to work from.) Of course
Renaissance literary critics made it clear that such "imitation"
was to be neither mechanical nor complete: writers were to capture
the spirit of the originals, mastering the best models, learning
from them, then using them for their own purposes. Nevertheless,
despite the fact that there were a great many comments by critics
about "imitation" in this sense, it was not the predominant
practice of many of the greatest writers. For them, the faithful
depiction of human behavior--what Shakespeare called holding the
mirror up to nature--was paramount, and therefore "imitation" in
the mimetic sense was more often the common practice. </a></p>
      <p><a name="imitate">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctrine
of "imitation" of
ancient authors did have one very important effect: since it
recommended not only the imitation of specific classical writers,
but also the imitation of classical genres, there was a revival of
significant literary forms. Among the most popular that were
derived from antiquity were epic and satire. Even more important
were the dramatic genres of comedy and tragedy. In fact, Europe at
this time experienced a golden age of theater, led by great
dramatists such as Shakespeare. </a></p>
      <p><a name="prot"></a></p>
      <h3>
      <center><a name="prot"><b>The Protestant Reformation </b></a></center>
      </h3>
      <a name="prot">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as it
developed during the
Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation was a movement that had
profound implications, not only for the modern world in general,
but specifically for literary history. Just as Renaissance
Humanists rejected medieval learning, the Reformation seemed to
reject the medieval form of Christianity. (It should be noted,
however, that both Catholics and Protestants were Humanists, though
often with different emphases.) In the early sixteenth century, the
German monk Martin Luther reacted against Church corruption, the
sort depicted, for example, by Chaucer in the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>.</a>
      <p><a name="prot">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Catholics
like Erasmus wanted
to reform the Church from within. However, Luther's disagreements
with Church policy ultimately led him to challenge some of the most
fundamental doctrines of the Church, which in turn led him and his
followers to break away from the Catholic Church in protest; hence
they were known as Protestants. The Reformation had significant
political ramifications, for it split Europe into Protestant and
Catholic countries which often went to war with each other during
this period. Protestantism broke up the institution that had for so
long unified all Europe under the Pope (though there were also
national struggles with the Papacy that had little to do with
Protestantism). </a></p>
      <p><a name="prot">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the most
important tenets of
Protestantism was the rejection of the Pope as spiritual leader. A
closely related Protestant doctrine was the rejection of the
authority of the Church and its priests to mediate between human
beings and God. Protestants believed that the Church as an
institution could not grant salvation; only through a direct
personal relationship with God--achieved by reading the
Bible--could the believer be granted such. Many scholars argue that
this emphasis on a personal, individual connection with God spawned
the modern emphasis on individualism in those cultures affected by
Protestantism. On the other hand, some Protestants also believed
that after the Fall of Adam in Eden, human nature was totally
corrupted as far as human spiritual capabilities were concerned.
(Early Protestantism's emphasis on human depravity distinguishes it
sharply from Renaissance Humanism.) Humans therefore are incapable
of contributing to their salvation, for instance through good
deeds; it could only be achieved through faith in God's grace.
Overall, there is a good deal of ambivalence regarding many of the
Protestant positions, and in fact the disagreement among the many
Christian sects may be precisely what distinguishes Renaissance
from Medieval religion. </a></p>

      <h3>
      <center><b>Literary Ramifications</b></center>
      </h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the literary ramifications of
the Reformation, two stand out. First, the Protestant rejection of
the authority of Church representatives resulted in placing that
authority entirely on the Bible, at least in theory. Consequently,
Protestants stressed the need for all believers to read the Bible
for themselves. To help make that possible, they were active in
translating the Bible into the vernacular languages so that all
laymen could read it. This practice was opposed by the Catholic
Church, which insisted on preserving the Bible in Latin. At the
same time, Protestants also stressed the need to understand the
Bible in its original languages (Hebrew and Greek) so that it could
be properly translated. In their interest in such learning,
particularly of ancient languages, Protestants were similar to
Humanists. This emphasis on the Bible had a significant impact on
literature because the Bible became a renewed source of literary
inspiration, both in literary form and subject matter; it also
became a rich source of symbols.
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other way the Reformation
impacted on literature was perhaps more subtle, and the effects did
not appear till much later in literary history. Certainly the
emphasis on inner feeling found later in the Romantic Movement
received at least some of its inspiration and reinforcement from
the religious thrust of the Protestant Reformation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When student readers approach
Renaissance literary works, they may experience certain concepts
(the doctrine of "correspondences," for instance), as a bit
strange. Yet they are also likely to sense some very modern things
in the works written in this remarkable age. And among its many
wonders, they will also be experiencing the revival of great drama,
as it underwent a "rebirth" in the Renaissance, embodied most fully
in the works of our greatest English writer, <a href="sh.html">William
Shakespeare</a>.</p>

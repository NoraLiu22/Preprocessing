<br><b>The New Evidence</b>



<p>The Indonesian invasion of East Timor in December 1975 set the stage



for the long, bloody, and disastrous occupation of the territory that ended



only after an international peacekeeping force was introduced in 1999.&nbsp;



President Bill Clinton cut off military aid to Indonesia in September 1999—reversing



a longstanding policy of military cooperation—but questions persist about



U.S. responsibility for the 1975 invasion; in particular, the degree to



which Washington actually condoned or supported the bloody military offensive.&nbsp;



Most recently, journalist Christopher Hitchens raised questions about the



role of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in giving a green light



to the invasion that has left perhaps 200,000 dead in the years since.&nbsp;



Two newly declassified documents from the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library,



released to the National Security Archive, shed light on the Ford administration’s



relationship with President Suharto of Indonesia during 1975. Of special



importance is <u><a href="#doc4">the record of Ford’s and Kissinger’s meeting



with Suharto in early December 1975</a></u>.&nbsp; The document shows that



Suharto began the invasion knowing that he had the full approval of the



White House.&nbsp; Both of these documents had been released in heavily



excised form some years ago, but with Suharto now out of power, and following



the collapse of Indonesian control over East Timor, the situation has changed



enough that both documents have been released in their entirety.



<p>Other documents found among State Department records at the National



Archives elucidate the inner workings of U.S. policy toward the Indonesian



crisis during 1975 and 1976.&nbsp; Besides confirming that Henry Kissinger



and top advisers expected an eventual Indonesian takeover of East Timor,



archival material shows that the Secretary of State fully understood that



the invasion of East Timor involved the "illegal" use of U.S.-supplied



military equipment because it was not used in self-defense as required



by law.



<p>Although Indonesia was a major site of U.S. energy and raw materials



investment, an important petroleum exporter, strategically located near



vital shipping lanes, and a significant recipient of U.S. military assistance,



the country—much less the East Timor question—barely figures into Henry



Kissinger’s memoirs of the Nixon and Ford administrations.&nbsp; Gerald



Ford’s memoir briefly discusses the December 1975 visit to Jakarta but



does not mention the discussion of East Timor with Suharto.&nbsp; Indeed,



as important as the bilateral relationship was, Jakarta's brutal suppression



of the independence movement in East Timor was a development that neither



Ford nor Kissinger wanted people to remember about their time in power.&nbsp;



That the two decided on a course of action of dubious legality and that



resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Timorese may well have also discouraged



further reflection, at least in public.&nbsp; No doubt the omissions from



Ford's and Kissinger's memoirs also reflect the low priority that East



Timor had during the Ford administration.&nbsp; For senior officials, the



fate of a post-colonial East Timor paled in comparison to the strategic



relationship with the anti-communist Suharto regime, especially in the



wake of the communist victory in Vietnam, when Ford and Kissinger wanted



to strengthen relations with anti-communists and check left-wing movements



in the region.(<u><a href="#1">1</a></u>)&nbsp; But it is not simply a



matter of omission; on several occasions Kissinger has explicitly denied



that he ever had substantive discussions of East Timor with Suharto, much



less having consented to Indonesian plans.(<u><a href="#2">2</a></u>)&nbsp;



The new evidence contradicts Kissinger's statements: Indonesian plans for



the invasion of East Timor were indeed discussed with Suharto, and Ford



and Kissinger gave them the green light.&nbsp; As Kissinger advised Suharto



on the eve of the invasion: "it is important that whatever you do succeeds



quickly" but that "it would be better if it were done after we returned"



to the United States.



<p>Although these new documents shed important light on U.S. policy toward



the East Timor question in 1975, much more needs to be learned about U.S.



policymaking during 1975 and 1976.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most of the relevant



sources are classified.&nbsp; The large collection of Kissinger-Scowcroft



office files at the Ford Library remains unavailable, as are the records



of the State Department’s Indonesia desk and the Bureau of East Asian Affairs



for the 1970s.&nbsp; The State Department's recent acquisition of Henry



Kissinger's telephone conversation transcripts might include important



material, although they will probably reflect the relatively low priority



that the policymakers gave to the East Timor question.



<p><b>Background</b>



<p>The leftist military revolt that overthrew Portugal’s authoritarian



regime in April 1974 encouraged nationalist movements in the Portuguese



colony of East Timor calling for gradual independence from Lisbon—a position



also initially favored by the new Portuguese government.&nbsp; One of these



groups, the Timorese Democratic Union (UTD), had greater support among



Timorese elites and senior Portuguese colonial administrators, while the



Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin), with its



left-leaning, social democratic program, had the support of younger Timorese



and lower-level colonial officials.&nbsp; In January 1975 the two groups



formed an uneasy coalition.&nbsp; Increasingly, Fretilin enjoyed the greatest



public support and led the push for rapid independence.(<u><a href="#3">3</a></u>)



<p>Early signals from the Indonesian government indicated that it was prepared



to support East Timorese independence,(<u><a href="#4">4</a></u>) but Jakarta



soon became interested in turning the region into the country’s twenty-seventh



province.&nbsp; Fears that an independent East Timor could be used as a



base by unfriendly governments or spur other secessionist movements in



Indonesia had convinced hardliners in the military to press for annexation



of the territory.&nbsp; In February 1975 the Indonesian military conducted



a mock invasion of East Timor in South Sumatra.(<u><a href="#5">5</a></u>)&nbsp;



Military hardliners also backed the pro-integration Timorese Popular Democratic



Association (Apodeti) with financial assistance and launched a propaganda



campaign against the pro-independence groups.(<u><a href="#6">6</a></u>)&nbsp;



Apodeti, however, never had the popular support enjoyed by Fretilin or



UDT.



<p>The new regime in Lisbon was preoccupied with its own internal political



controversies and could do little to ensure a steady transition toward



independence.&nbsp; During 1974 and 1975 Indonesian authorities hoped that



the Portuguese would acquiesce in Jakarta's plans to acquire East Timor.&nbsp;



At first the Portuguese seemed responsive, but by mid-1975 it had become



evident that Lisbon supported self-determination for the people of East



Timor.&nbsp; In July 1975 Lisbon rebuffed Jakarta with the issuance of



Constitutional Law 7/75, setting forth a timetable for home-rule, including



the election of a popular assembly that would determine East Timor's future,



with Portuguese sovereignty ending no later than October 1978.(<u><a href="#7">7</a></u>)



<p>Events in East Timor, however, did not proceed in accordance with Lisbon's



schedule.&nbsp; The delicate UDT-Fretilin alliance had fallen apart in



May, in part due to a propaganda campaign launched by the Indonesian government



to inflame UTD concerns about Fretilin’s alleged communist tendencies.(<u><a href="#8">8</a></u>)&nbsp;



UDT’s fears were bolstered in June when Fretilin refused to attend an all-party



conference on decolonization hosted by Portuguese officials on Macao due



to the presence of Apodeti representatives.(<u><a href="#9">9</a></u>)&nbsp;



To Fretilin the issue of independence was not up for discussion, least



of all with Jakarta.&nbsp; The extent of Fretilin’s popularity—and thus



popular sentiment for independence from Indonesia—became evident in July



when the party won 55 percent of the vote in local elections.(<u><a href="#10">10</a></u>)&nbsp;



Convinced by Indonesian intelligence that Fretilin was planning a coup,



UDT staged its own in August 1975 in the Timorese capital Dili in an effort



to drive out Fretilin supporters.&nbsp; A Fretilin counterattack pushed



UDT forces out of the city, however, and by September Fretilin controlled



nearly all of East Timor, the Portuguese administrators having fled to



the island of Ata&uacute;ro.(<u><a href="#11">11</a></u>)&nbsp; Despite



having gained de facto control of the territory, Fretilin ended its call



for immediate independence and now supported a plan similar to the gradual



independence program proposed in June by the Portuguese.(<u><a href="#12">12</a></u>)



<p>The Indonesian government did not seize the opportunity to move troops



into Dili on the premise of restoring order.&nbsp; Suharto was still concerned



about the reaction from the West and needed more time to get the UDT and



other anti-Fretilin groups to support integration.(<u><a href="#13">13</a></u>)&nbsp;



The UDT, now refugees on the Indonesian side of Timor and in need of food



and shelter, had no choice but to sign a pro-integration petition drawn



up by Indonesia.&nbsp; Meanwhile, in October Indonesian special forces



began to infiltrate secretly into East Timor in an effort to provoke clashes



that would provide the pretext for a full-scale invasion.&nbsp; When these



incursions—including the murder by Indonesian forces of five journalists



employed by Australian TV—failed to elicit any noticeable reaction from



the West, Indonesia stepped-up its attacks across the border.(<u><a href="#14">14</a></u>)



<p>While Indonesian airborne troops—outfitted with American equipment—prepared



to take Dili, Fretilin petitioned the United Nations to call for the withdrawal



of the invading forces.&nbsp; Four days later, on November 28, Fretilin



declared East Timor's independence—apparently in the belief that a sovereign



state would have greater success appealing to the UN, but also thinking



that Timorese soldiers would be more likely to fight for an independent



state.&nbsp; Indonesia countered the next day with a “declaration of integration”



signed by Apodeti and UDT representatives and coordinated by Indonesia’s



military intelligence service.(<u><a href="#15">15</a></u>)&nbsp; The invasion,



originally scheduled for early December, was apparently delayed by the



visit of Ford and Kissinger to Jakarta on December 6.



<p>Operation Komodo, a general invasion of East Timor, commenced the next



day.&nbsp; In the following weeks a series of United Nations resolutions—supported



by the U.S.—called for the withdrawal of the Indonesian troops.(<u><a href="#16">16</a></u>)&nbsp;



An estimated 20,000 Indonesian troops were deployed to the region by the



end of the month.&nbsp; While casualty estimates vary, anywhere from 60,000-100,000



Timorese were probably killed in the first year after the violence began



in 1975.(<u><a href="#17">17</a></u>)&nbsp; In 1979 the U.S. Agency for



International Development estimated that 300,000 East Timorese—nearly half



the population—had been uprooted and moved into camps controlled by Indonesian



armed forces.&nbsp; By 1980 the occupation had left more than 100,000 dead



from military action, starvation or disease, with some estimates running



as high as 230,000.(<u><a href="#18">18</a></u>)

<blockquote>This document records a conversation between Suharto and Ford



at Camp David on July 5, 1975, five months before the invasion of East



Timor.&nbsp; Speaking only a few months after the collapse of the Thieu



regime in South Vietnam, the two presidents shared a tour d'horizon of



East Asian political issues, U.S. military assistance to Indonesia, international



investment, and Portuguese decolonization.&nbsp; Fearing greater political



and ideological ferment in the region following the Communist victory in



Vietnam, Suharto saw his ideological concoction "Pancasila" (possibly misspelled



"Pantechistita" in the document) as useful, no doubt because its emphasis



on consensus excluded any oppositional political activity.(<u><a href="#19">19</a></u>)&nbsp;



Not taking “consensus” for granted, Suharto wanted U.S. help in building



up his military machine to increase its mobility for dealing with insurgent



elements, noting that, “Especially at this moment, intelligence and territorial



operations are very important.”&nbsp; Ford proposed setting up a joint



commission to scrutinize Suharto's military request but wanted Kissinger



to settle the details.



<p>Suharto brought up the question of Portuguese decolonization in East



Timor proclaiming his support for “self-determination” but also dismissing



independence as unviable: “So the only way is to integrate [East Timor]



into Indonesia.”&nbsp; Without mentioning Fretilin by name, Suharto misleadingly



characterized it as “almost Communist” and criticized the group for boycotting



the decolonization meeting in Macao.&nbsp; Suharto claimed that Indonesia



did not want to interfere with East Timor's self-determination but implied



that it might have to because “those who want independence are those who



are Communist-influenced.”



<p>While Lisbon still had legal sovereignty over East Timor, apparently



neither Ford nor Suharto discussed the implications for Indonesian policy.&nbsp;



Although Washington had worked closely with the Salazar dictatorship that



ruled Portugal for decades, it was now deeply suspicious of the new social



democratic regime in Lisbon; with its exaggerated concerns about a Communist



coup, the Ford administration considered the possibility of expelling Portugal



from NATO and supporting an independence movement in the Azores (where



the U.S. had important military facilities).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, from Ford's



and Kissinger's perspective in 1975, Portugual's role in the region was



of little interest and did not pose an important obstacle to Indonesian



action.&nbsp; That some left-leaning Portuguese officers had contacts with



Fretilin undoubtedly made the White House even less inclined to concern



itself with Portugal's response to Indonesian action in East Timor.(<u><a href="#20">20</a></u>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Apparently encouraged by his meeting with President Ford, Suharto



returned from Washington on July 8 and made his first public statement



suggesting that an independent East Timor was not viable.&nbsp; Only days



later, UDT leaders launched their coup with the hope that they could suppress



Fretilin.&nbsp; During an August 12 discussion of the coup, Henry Kissinger



and his close advisers were not altogether sure what was happening, but



did not disagree with Assistant Secretary Philip Habib's statement that



the Indonesians would not let a “communist-dominated group,” i.e., Fretilin,



take over.&nbsp; Kissinger, in particular, assumed that an Indonesian takeover



would take place “sooner or later.”&nbsp; Believing that Australia, a key



regional ally, would feel “impelled” to support self-determination for



the Timorese, Kissinger and his advisers wanted to avoid controversy over



the issue.&nbsp; They quickly agreed that the State Department should make



no comment on the coup or related events.



<p>A few days later, the Australian ambassador in Jakarta relayed a statement



by U.S. ambassador John Newsom that summarized Washington's approach but



alluded to a problem that Kissinger and his advisers had not specifically



discussed on August 12.&nbsp; The message noted Newsom’s August 16 comment



that if Indonesia were to invade East Timor, it [should] do so “effectively,



quickly, and not use our equipment.”(<u><a href="#21">21</a></u>)&nbsp;



The U.S. ambassador recognized that there was a congressional prohibition



on Indonesia’s use of military gear financed by U.S. aid for anything but



defensive operations.&nbsp; Kissinger would come to understand the problem,



if he did not already, but as document four suggests, he was not willing



to let it tie Jakarta's hands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Kissinger memorandum, prepared for President Ford some



two weeks before the two were to visit to Jakarta, indicates that the administration's



larger strategic interests in Indonesia made it unlikely that Washington



would make a fuss over East Timor. The eventual fate of East Timor was



evidently a relatively low priority for Kissinger and his staff—it was



the twelfth and final item mentioned in the memo.(<u><a href="#22">22</a></u>)&nbsp;



While Kissinger, in the memo, acknowledged that the Indonesians have been



“maneuvering to absorb the colony” through negotiations with Portugal and



“covert military operations in the colony itself,” he apparently did not



expect an overt invasion using U.S.-supplied military equipment.&nbsp;



Indeed, his memo and the briefing paper on “Indonesia and Portuguese Timor”



both indicate that to do so would violate U.S. law, suggesting that this



consideration had induced "restraint" on the part of Jakarta.&nbsp; Moreover,



and in contrast to Habib's view(<u><a href="#23">23</a></u>) that Fretelin



was "Communist-dominated," the author of the briefing paper more accurately



characterized the Front as "vaguely left-wing."</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the eve of Indonesia’s full-scale invasion of East Timor,



President Ford and Secretary Kissinger stopped in Jakarta en route from



China where they had just met with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.&nbsp;



During his meeting with Suharto, Ford emphasized America’s continuing commitment



to Asian affairs despite the “severe setback of Vietnam.”&nbsp; Discussion



then turned to the problem of Communist influence in the Non-Aligned Movement



and the insurgency movements in Thailand and Malaysia.&nbsp; Ford told



Suharto that he would be “enthusiastic” about building an M-16 plant in



Indonesia to provide small arms to help Southeast Asian governments counter



regional insurgency movements.&nbsp; Kissinger also approved of the proposed



arrangement “because of its indication of wider cooperation.”



<p>On 4 or 5 December, while still in Beijing, Kissinger received a cable



from the State Department suggesting that the Indonesians had "plans" to



invade East Timor.(<u><a href="#25">25</a></u>)&nbsp; Thus, Ford or Kissinger



could not have been too surprised when, in the middle of a discussion of



guerrilla movements in Thailand and Malaysia, Suharto suddenly brought



up East Timor.&nbsp; Suharto noted that while Indonesia “has no territorial



ambitions,” Fretilin has not cooperated with negotiations and has “declared



its independence unilaterally.”&nbsp; The current situation, he said, “will



prolong the suffering of the refugees and increase instability in the area.”&nbsp;



Suharto then assured the Americans that “the four other parties” favor



integration, with the apparent implication that a mere majority among the



“parties” to the conflict—absent a popular referendum—alone constituted



an act of self-determination.&nbsp; “We want your understanding,” Suharto



continued, “if we deem it necessary to take rapid or drastic action.”



<p>Ford and Kissinger took great pains to assure Suharto that they would



not oppose the invasion.&nbsp; Ford was unambiguous: “We will understand



and will not press you on the issue.&nbsp; We understand the problem and



the intentions you have.”&nbsp; Kissinger did indeed stress that “the use



of US-made arms could create problems,” but then added that, “It depends



on how we construe it; whether it is in self defense or is a foreign operation.”&nbsp;



Thus, Kissinger’s concern was not about whether U.S. arms would be used



offensively—and hence illegally—but whether the act would actually be <i>interpreted</i>



as such—a process he clearly intended to manipulate.(<u><a href="#26">26</a></u>)&nbsp;



In any case, Kissinger added: “It is important that whatever you do succeeds



quickly.”



<p>Indeed, timing and damage control were very important to the Americans,



as Kissinger told Suharto: “We would be able to influence the reaction



in America if whatever happens happens after we return. . .&nbsp; If you



have made plans, we will do our best to keep everyone quiet until the President



returns home.”&nbsp; Kissinger also asked Suharto if he anticipated a “long



guerilla war,” apparently aware that a quick military success would be



easier to spin than a long campaign.&nbsp; Suharto acknowledged that there



"will probably be a small guerilla war" but he was cagey enough not to



predict its duration.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his military colleagues were



optimistic; as one of the architects of Indonesian policy, General Ali



Murtopo explained to a U.S. scholar some months before the invasion, "the



whole business will be settled in three weeks."(<u><a href="#27">27</a></u>)



<p>With the U.S. position on the East Timor “business” settled, Suharto



turned to economic problems, especially petroleum investments.&nbsp; With



the recent bankruptcy of the state oil company, the regime needed more



revenue and Suharto wanted to get it from the oil companies that invested



in Indonesia.&nbsp; Noting that the oil companies were sharing larger shares



of their profits with Middle Eastern states than they were with Indonesia,



Suharto told Ford and Kissinger that he wanted to negotiate an "understanding"



with them.&nbsp; Both Americans were sympathetic and said that he would



have their support.&nbsp; Kissinger, however, noted carefully that whatever



Suharto did he should “not create a climate that discourages investment.”&nbsp;



The possibility that the East Timor affair could prove to be a disaster



for Indonesia and someday impair the “climate for investment” never seems



to have occurred to either Kissinger or Ford.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Washington’s initial response to the invasion was to delay



new arms sales to Indonesia pending an administrative review by the State



Department, ostensibly to determine whether Indonesia had actually violated



the bilateral agreement stipulating that U.S.-supplied arms could only



be used for defensive purposes.&nbsp; Military equipment already in the



pipeline continued to flow, however, and during the six-month review period



the U.S. made four new offers of military equipment sales to Indonesia



including maintenance and spare parts for the Rockwell OV-10 Bronco aircraft,



designed specifically for counterinsurgency operations and employed during



the invasion of East Timor.(<u><a href="#28">28</a></u>)&nbsp; The administrative



delay and the subsequent offers were the subject of a December 18, 1975,



meeting between Secretary Kissinger and his advisers in which he chastised



his staff for writing a memo recommending that arms sales to Indonesia



be cut off for violating the end-use agreement.&nbsp; While the memo was



not widely distributed, Kissinger was angry that word might leak about



how “Kissinger overruled his pristine bureaucrats and violated the law.”&nbsp;



The secretary told his staff that he “took care of it with the administrative



thing by ordering Carlyle(<u><a href="#29">29</a></u>) not to make any



new sales.”&nbsp; If Congress asked about the policy, Kissinger said, “We



cut it off while we are studying it.&nbsp; We intend to start again in



January.”(<u><a href="#30">30</a></u>)



<p>Six months later, and exactly one month before the formal annexation



of East Timor by Indonesia, the subject of East Timor again came up during



a staff meeting between Secretary Kissinger and his State Department bureau



chiefs.&nbsp; The question was raised as to whether or not the U.S. should



send a representative to accompany an Indonesian parliamentary delegation



to East Timor—an invitation declined by most other countries.&nbsp; Robert



H. Miller, an adviser from the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs,



recommended against accepting the invitation, suggesting that “broader



objectives with respect to Indonesia – including overall support to Timor,”



would be better served “if we don’t have high-profile participation.”&nbsp;



Miller hoped to prevent “Congressional [sic] sentiment with regard to Indonesia



from being rekindled.”&nbsp; Philip Habib, under secretary of state for



political affairs, agreed: “There’s no need to take this action . . . Let



them go ahead and do what they’ve been doing.&nbsp; We have no objection



. . . They’re quite happy with the position we’ve taken.&nbsp; We’ve resumed,



as you know, all of our normal relations with them; and there isn’t any



problem involved.”&nbsp; In apparent reference to the continuing arms sales,



his deception of Congress, or possibly to Indonesia's bloody invasion and



occupation, Kissinger responded: “Not very willingly.&nbsp; Illegally and



beautifully.”</blockquote>

<p><a NAME="2"></a>2. At a 1995 press conference Kissinger told former



East Timorese resistance leader Constancio Pinto, “Timor was never discussed



with us when we were in Indonesia" and then qualified this remark by stating



that he learned about the invasion plans at the airport as the presidential



party was about to leave. See “Ask Kissinger about East Timor: Confronting



Henry Kissinger,” East Timor Action Network, August 1995 &lt;<u><a href="http://etan.org/news/kissinger/ask.htm">http://etan.org/news/kissinger/ask.htm</a></u>>.&nbsp;



During a radio interview in 1999, Kissinger continued to treat the discussion



with Suharto on East Timor as incidental and nonsubstantive: “We were told



at the airport as we left Jakarta that either that day or the next day



they intended to take East Timor.” See &lt;<u><a href="http://www.etan.org/_vti_bin/shtml.exe/news/kissinger/radio.htm/map">http://www.etan.org/_vti_bin/shtml.exe/news/kissinger/radio.htm/map</a></u>>.

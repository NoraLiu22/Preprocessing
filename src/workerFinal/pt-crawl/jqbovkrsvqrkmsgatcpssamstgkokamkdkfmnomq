<H3>Introduction </H3>             
             
For those of us who are parents,             
it is rare and gratifying to be able to pull off a stunt that             
our children actually think is clever and             
useful.  All the more so if we are engaged in intellectual research             
far removed from our children's interests.  One of us (DM) recently had             
such an experience.             
<p>             
             
My daughter grew up in Holland (her mother and I were             
divorced when she was three).             
She recently arrived in the United States with her             
Chilean fiance, seeking a life style             
far from big cities - but with a racially diverse and youthful             
population, cheap land, and good job opportunities.             
She had a good atlas, maps from the AAA,             
and Chamber of Commerce brochures.  From the Web,             
she had gotten information from local governments and commercial             
organizations.  She and her fiance were ready to             
check out places firsthand, but they could not afford a lengthy Odyssey;             
they needed to quickly find a good place to live and work.             
<p>             
             
The day before their departure, she asked me for help.             
"We know the general area we want, but we don't know what route to take.             
The Web pages only talk about the tourist attractions and fabulous             
hotels where we can stay for $100 a night.  Every brochure shows             
gorgeous scenery and smiling people saying their own city is the best             
place in the universe.  The atlas tells me about total population and climate             
but nothing else."             
<p>             
             
I told her about 1990 U.S. Census LOOKUP.  "I'm sorry I can't help you             
today, but you can figure it out yourself.  Go to the LOOKUP home page at             
<a href="http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/lookup_doc.html">             
http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/lookup_doc.html</a>.             
Summary Tape Files (STF) 3A and 1A have the data you need.  Choose             
a state and then a few towns (places), using your atlas as a guide.             
Get the tables about age, race, and (Hispanic) ethnicity.  LOOKUP can't tell             
you about current land values or salaries, but you can get a general idea             
from housing values and median rents in 1990, and from education and             
occupation."             
<p>             
             
I arrived home that evening too late to help her, but I was gratified             
to find pages of printouts that she had gleaned from LOOKUP.  Penciled on the             
map was a route through the most interesting towns.  The             
next morning, she and her fiance were on their way.             
<p>             
             
The preceding story, though simplified for brevity, is             
true.  With no more than a Web browser and the guidelines I gave my daughter,             
one can negotiate LOOKUP and obtain similar             
information for any region of the United States.             
<p>

<h3>Data in LOOKUP</h3>             
             
             
Other excellent Web-based tools exist (             
<a href=#gazetteer>             
[Gazetteer],             
</a>             
<a href=#datamap>             
[Datamap],             
</a>             
<a href=#orst>             
[ORST]             
</a>             
)             
             
which provide simple access to profiles of selected data.             
Compared with those tools, LOOKUP is more difficult to use, but for             
good reason:             
only LOOKUP provides access to nationwide U.S. Census             
data below the county level.  The data are derived from             
86 CD-ROMs (about 43 gigabytes) which             
<a href="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/mp/www/index2.html">             
can be purchased</a>             
from the U.S. Bureau of the Census.             
<a name = "table1-return"</a>LOOKUP provides Web access to             
almost two billion numeric data values, as described             
in              
<a href="table1.html">

<hr>             
<h3>An example</h3>             
             
In detail, we illustrate the use of LOOKUP to obtain             
racial characteristics and median family income for the Census             
tracts of a small rural county (Trinity County, California).             
Such information might interest, for             
example, persons involved in political redistricting, or commercial             
marketing activities, or real estate sales, or demographic research.             
<p>             
             
<ol>             
             
<li>             
With your Web browser, go to the LOOKUP home page at             
<a href="http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/lookup_doc.html">             
http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/lookup_doc.html.             
</a>             
Select any one of the available LOOKUP browsers, for example the one at the

<p>             
<li>             
Select Summary Tape File 1A             
<a href="http://www.census.gov/cdrom/lookup/CMD=LIST/DB=C90STF1A/LEV=STATE">

</a>             
which contains basic demographic             
variables from the "100% sample" or "short form" census tabulations, for             
small geographic areas including census tracts.             
(Other variables, not needed in this example, are in STF3A.)             
             
<p>             
<li>             
In the Census, tracts are organized by county.             
From the list of states,             
select "California" and "level State--County"             
and then "Submit." Then select "Trinity County" and             
"level State--County--Census Tract" and then "Submit."             
You will see the list of (four) census tracts in Trinity County, California.             
Choose "Select/retrieve all of the areas below" and then "Submit."             
Then "Choose TABLES to retrieve (population, race breakdowns, etc.)"             
and "Submit."             
             
<p>             
<li>             
You will see a list of the 98 tables that are available in STF1A.             
Select the following three tables, which contain a total of seven variables:             
<pre>             
P1.	Persons(1)	Universe: Persons             
P6.	Race(5)		Universe: Persons             
H23B.	Median Value(1)	Universe: Specified owner-occupied housing units             
</pre>             
and then "Submit."             
             
<p>             
<li>             
Select "HTML format"  (HyperText Markup Language) and "Submit."             
<a name = "table2-return"></a>The data for the four tracts are shown in <a href="table2.html">             
Table 2.             
</a>             
Yes, those really are counts of single individuals, not thousands!             
For example, in 1990 there were             
only 53 African Americans (blacks) in Trinity County.             
All but five of them lived in Tract 1.

Using your Web browser, you can             
"mouse" the information into your word processor, print the information,             
save the information in a disk file, or mail the             
information to your Internet address.             
<i>Note:</i> Some Web browsers have bugs which may prevent you from saving             
LOOKUP output data in a file.             
The known browser bugs, with some workarounds, are described in

For downloading into a spreadsheet or database,             
you can get the same data             
in a more convenient tab-delimited format.             
Return to the page where you selected "HTML format."             
<a name = "table3-return"></a>This time select "Tab-delimited format" and "Submit."             
<a href="table3.html">             
Table 3             
</a>             
shows the resulting data ready for downloading.             
<i>Note:</i> Some browsers and e-mail systems             
convert tabs into spaces, in which case the file may require             
editing before being loaded into your spreadsheet.

<h3>History</h3>             
             
LOOKUP grew out of former projects at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory             
<a href="http://www.lbl.gov"> (LBNL),</a>             
a Department of Energy installation.             
Between 1970 and 1985,             
The Socio-Economic Environmental Demographic Information System             
<a href="http://cedr.lbl.gov/mdocs/seedis/seedis.html"> (SEEDIS) </a>             
acquired and integrated 1970 and 1980 Census data for the Department of             
Labor.  Between 1978 and 1995, the Populations at Risk to             
Environmental Pollution             
<a href="http://cedr.lbl.gov/pdocs/parep.html"> (PAREP) </a>             
project added health data and other socioeconomic data for studies of             
geographic disease distributions.             
             
<p>             
In 1990, LBNL began acquiring CD-ROM juke boxes and providing Internet             
access to 1990 Census CD-ROMs, most of which were provided by the             
<a href="http://library.berkeley.edu">             
University of California Berkeley (UCB) Libraries. </a>             
University of California Data Archive and Technical Assistance             
<a href="http://ucdata.berkeley.edu"> (UC DATA) </a> installed additional             
juke boxes and provided user support.             
In 1992, Hiroaki Katayama, a visiting LBNL guest scientist, developed a             
PC menu system             
<a href=#menu> [Menu] </a>             
which provides integrated access to the CD-ROM information system             
( <a href=#cdrom> [CDROM] </a> ,             
<a href=#merrill> [Merrill] </a> ).             
             
<p>             
In 1993, Nathan Parker, an LBNL summer student, developed DBUTIL subroutines             
for accessing the Census dBase files. In 1994, he completed             
LOOKUP, which Chris Stuber installed at the Census Bureau.             
Beginning in 1995, Valerie Gregg obtained Census Bureau funding for             
additional hardware and software development and for support of LBNL.             
In 1996, all the STF1 and STF3 CD-ROMs used by LOOKUP were copied to disk             
drives at the Census Bureau.  New Web-based             
<a href="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/main/www/access.html">             
data access tools</a>             
include the TIGER Mapping Service             
<A HREF="http://tiger.census.gov/"> (TMS),</a>             
a thematic mapping system

<p>             
<a name = "fig1-return"></a>Figure 1 shows LOOKUP usage by month, since August 1994.             
The lighter and darker bars represent, respectively,             
the number of different clients which accessed in each month             
(a) the LOOKUP server at the Census Bureau (b) the             
two LOOKUP servers at LBNL.             
The numbers above the bars represent thousands of clients.             
About two-thirds of the usage is at the Census Bureau's LOOKUP server.             
             
<p>             
As of Febrary 1996, LOOKUP was being accessed each month by about             
28,000 different client computers.             
Usage had steadily increased by about             
10 percent each month, with two exceptions which are evident in             
Figure 1:             
<p>             
             
             
<ul>             
<li>             
On June 21, 1995, LOOKUP was named as the Web "Cool Site of the Day"             
( <a href=#davis> [Davis] </a>,             
<a href="#kahn"> [Kahn]. </a> )             
Thanks to the temporary publicity, almost 10,000 clients accessed LOOKUP             
in a 24-hour period,             
mostly on the LBNL server cedr.lbl.gov.             
<p>             
             
<li>             
During November 1995, December 1995 and January 1996, usage was reduced             
because the Census Bureau was closed for a total of four weeks.             
The Census server was unavailable             
from 11/14/95 to 11/20/95 and from 12/18/95 to 1/7/96 due             
to the Federal budget impasse, and from             
1/8/96 to 1/10/96 due to blizzard weather conditions.             
Figure 2 shows (for example) the daily usage during January 1996.             
During the Census Bureau shutdown, LBNL usage approximately doubled.             
However, total usage was below normal because new users usually discover             
the LOOKUP through the Census Bureau home page, which was unavailable.             
<a name = "fig2-return"></a>Figure 2 also shows that usage on holidays (January 1) and weekends             
(January 6-7, 13-14, 20-21, and 27-28) is about half of normal weekday usage.

Detailed log files, of every LOOKUP session to date, are archived at LBNL.             
To preserve the confidentiality of the users, these are not publicly available.             
Some summary statistics, including Figures 1 and 2, are maintained at             
<a href="http://bigsur.lbl.gov/pub/lookup/stats/summary.html">             
http://bigsur.lbl.gov/pub/lookup/stats/summary.html             
</a>).             
Other statistics, not all on line, provide the following information:             
<ul>             
<li>             
Each month, about 75 percent of the LOOKUP clients are new clients;             
the remaining 25 percent are returnees which accessed LOOKUP in at least one             
previous month.             
<p>             
<li>             
Clients are fairly evenly divided among the commercial, educational, and             
government sectors.             
<p>             
<li>             
Clients are evenly distributed over             
the United States, with a handful of foreign clients.             
<p>             
<li>             
The most frequently accessed data are a few dozen             
tables of STF3A (long-form sample data for small geographic areas).

<h3>How to obtain and install LOOKUP</h3>             
             
To run LOOKUP as a <i>user,</i> no installation is required.             
You need only a World Wide Web (WWW) browser capable of             
handling forms.  Follow the instructions under "An example."             
             
<p>             
However, as a system manager of a Web <i>server</i>, you can improve             
performance for your users by locally installing LOOKUP.  This is strongly             
encouraged, for faster response and for availability when other LOOKUP servers             
are unavailable.  The remainder of this section is intended             
for UNIX system managers who are familiar with Web concepts.             
             
<p>             
A HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server must             
be running on the computer where LOOKUP is             
to be installed.  LOOKUP is a Common Gateway             
Interface (CGI) program written in C.  Installation instructions, and             
source code for SunOS and Solaris 2, are available at             
<a href="http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/install/lookup.html">             
http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/install/lookup.html</a>.             
             
<p>             
The 86 mount points described in Figure 1 must be locally mounted with             
Network File Services (NFS), preferably with an automounter (either amd or             
Sun's automounter).  The necessary automount maps             
are publicly exported from LBNL, as described in             
<a href="http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/nfs.html">             
http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/nfs.html</a>.             
The local system manager must obtain a current copy of the public automount             
map and provide it to the local automounter.             
             
<p>             
The NFS locations change rather frequently.  When a particular diskN mount             
point is temporarily unavailable,              
its entry is moved from the "online" files to the "offline" files             
described below.  At the same time, the             
automount maps which are exported from LBNL are changed.  To avoid the             
need for constant attention, the local system manager should arrange for             
the local copy of the automount map to be periodically updated automatically.             
<p>

<h3>How to configure the local version of LOOKUP</h3>             
             
<p>             
For efficiency and redundancy, duplicate public copies of the 1990 Census             
data are available.  Sharing of the multiple copies by different LOOKUP             
servers is accomplished with three sets of files, which we             
call the "STF files," the "contents file," and the "NFS file."  These             
are available at the following locations:

<p>             
             
The contents file and the NFS file provide information for             
choosing the best configuration of the STF files.  The possible choices             
can be tested to see which choice gives consistently the fastest and most             
reliable response.  It may be useful to communicate with the system             
managers of the individual data servers.             
             
<p>             
The contents file lists all the publicly available mount points.             
The diskN tag is permanently assigned when a new mount point (either             
CD-ROM or disk) is registered at LBNL.             
For example, three copies of North Carolina STF3A data were registered as             
of February 1996:             
(#1) CD-ROMs exported from LBNL             
(#2) disk files exported from the Census Bureau             
(#3) disk files exported from North Carolina State University (NCSU).

<p>             
The NFS file, which corresponds to the automount maps exported from LBNL,             
specifies the current NFS location of each mount point.  As of February             
1996 these were:             
<pre>             
disk173|hibana.lbl.gov        |/export/cdrom/cd029

</pre>             
             
<p>             
The STF files $STF_INFO_DIR/stf/*/*.loc             
are created locally when LOOKUP             
is installed, and should be modified by the local system manager.             
The STF files need to be changed only when LOOKUP is installed,             
or when a new mount point is registered, or when             
a mount point will be off line for an extended period.             
System problems and anticipated shutdowns are announced in             
<a href="http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/lookup/status.html">             
http://cedr.lbl.gov/cdrom/doc/lookup/status.html</a>.             
Upon request, you can be be notified by e-mail whenever             
this file is updated.             
             
<p>             
After you have installed LOOKUP, the local file             
$STF_INFO_DIR/stf/c90stf3a/nc.loc may contain             
<pre>             
stf3a nc 37 ( 001 - 099 ) disk173 stf300nc.dbf             
stf3a nc 37 ( 101 - 199 ) disk174 stf300nc.dbf             
</pre>             
which instructs the local LOOKUP server to use the mount points             
disk173 and disk174 (<i>i.e.,</i> CD-ROMs at LBNL)             
for North Carolina STF3A data.             
You should check the contents file and NFS file to see what mount points             
are currently registered.  If disk389 and disk390 (the disk files             
exported from the Census Bureau) are currently on line, you can improve             
performance by changing the file             
$STF_INFO_DIR/stf/c90stf3a/nc.loc as follows:             
<pre>             
stf3a nc 37 ( 001 - 099 ) disk389 stf300nc.dbf             
stf3a nc 37 ( 101 - 199 ) disk390 stf300nc.dbf             
</pre>             
If disk295 and disk296 (the disk files exported from             
NCSU) are currently on line, you can change the file             
$STF_INFO_DIR/stf/c90stf3a/nc.loc             
as follows:             
<pre>             
stf3a nc 37 ( 001 - 099 ) disk295 stf300nc.dbf             
stf3a nc 37 ( 101 - 199 ) disk296 stf300nc.dbf             
</pre>             
This would be appropriate for LOOKUP servers which are close to NCSU.             
             
<p>             
For even better performance, selected CD-ROMs             
can be copied to a local disk, and the corresponding STF files             
changed appropriately.     
<p>             
     
<hr>             
<h3>A plea for cooperation</h3>             
             
The contents file and NFS file contain all the mount points which             
data servers have chosen to register with LBNL for shared public access.             
For a list of data servers, see "Acknowledgments." Over 400 mount points             
were registered as of February 1996, including the 86 used by LOOKUP.             
Many of these are being used for experimental development of new Web-based             
data servers.             
<p>             
             
The advantage of a central registry is that one can conveniently develop             
software (<i>e.g.</i> <a href=#lookup> LOOKUP </a>             
or the <a href=#menu>PC menu system</a>)             
which simultaneously accesses data from dozens or even hundreds of             
mount points.  The incremental cost of publicly exporting a mount point             
is small, compared with the costs of acquiring and maintaining the             
necessary hardware.             
<p>             
             
The authors wish to encourage additional sites to publicly NFS-export their             
non-restricted data files, and to publicly register them with LBNL.             
If this occurs, the sites now exporting data will not become overloaded, and             
the entire Internet community can participate in developing the next             
generation of integrated public data servers.

<p class="lead">Background</p>

<p>A couple years ago I wrote a Sega Genesis demo called <a href="https://HuguesJohnson.com/rc89/">Retail Clerk '89</a>. I decided to try making a general-purpose adventure-adjacent game engine out of that code. Instead I created a demo specifically intended for speedrunning with it. Close enough I guess.</p>

<p>Speedrun Tower is set in a building with a confusing elevator system. <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/programming/genesis/random/">The design is loosely described here</a>. I'll summarize by saying the connections between floors are randomized at the start. So the elevators on the first floor might go to the fifth and ninth. The fifth and ninth floors will have elevators connecting back to the first. They will also have two other elevators with randomized connections to other floors. There is a guaranteed path that visits every floor.</p>

<p>Floors 2-15 have three elevators. One that connects to the previous step in the guaranteed path, one that connects to the next step in the guaranteed path, and one that connects to a random floor. Of course you don't know which door is which or what the guaranteed path even is. Assuming I can math, there are 1.507947313Ã—10<sup>18</sup> potential variations. Once the game has started the connections won't change unless I made a mistake.</p>

<p>Your goal is to reach the top floor and talk to your co-workers in the fewest steps possible. Unless of course your goal is to visit every floor or view every event in the fewest steps possible. Did I mention there are optional events? There are four endings based on what things you did.</p>

<p>This demo was also an excuse to try different approaches for achieving pseudorandomness on the Sega Genesis. I am very tempted to port this to other 68k platforms but there are no concrete plans.</p>

<p class="lead">Setting</p>

<div class="container-fluid">
	<div class="clearfix">
		<img class="float-start" src="directory.png" alt="Building directory"/>
		<p>Speedrun Tower is loosely inspired by various dysfunctional office buildings I've worked in or visited. It has the types of businesses expected in a multi-use building. There are also a few floors with shared amenities.</p>
		<p>None of these businesses are based on companies I've actually worked in. Violating NDAs is not high on my to-do list. I of course have been in buildings that had a shared gym, or an on-site nurse, or food court, or badging center. I think anyone who worked in a multi-use 10+ floor building has seen all the various things in this demo.</p>
		<p>The location of this tower is irrelevant. The call sign on the radio station locks it down to a broad region I suppose. There's no particular city in mind here. Fill in the blanks however you like.</p>
		<p>The playable characters are composites of my kids' friends. Their names are random just because I wanted to test that out. They have no personalities except for whatever the player assigns to them in their head. Their only backstory is they are Gen-Zers entering the workforce. We've gone out of our way to make their lives confusing up to this point. We're continuing that streak by making them work in a building that is illogical to navigate.</p>
		<p>The non-playable characters are totally made-up. I just had fun trying out different hairstyles and outfits for most. When I started I only had a few characters in mind - guards, a maintenance guy, a nurse, some douchey tech-bros, and an angry gym guy. Those characters look like their description. The rest are totally arbitrary. I made a bunch of sprites and assigned them to random floors.</p>
		<p>I originally planned to have 120 floors with at least as many characters. It took me almost a year to create 16 very basic floors and some light dialog. Although I'm excited about the idea of expanding this demo, it's unlikely to reach anything approaching that scale.</p>

<p class="lead">Progress</p>


<p>Sega Genesis version 1.0 is complete. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game is fully-playable demo and doesn't crash in any way I've found.</li>
<li>It's been tested on real Sega Genesis model 1 hardware.</li>
<li>So far no &quot;unwinnable&quot; game states have been produced - I don't know if I want to declare it &quot;impossible&quot; though. I've done well over 100 playthroughs while testing. Every set of connections generated allows 3 out of 4 endings to occur. One ending only has a 1/14 chance of being available by design.</li>
<li>I do not plan any further changes to this version unless a breaking bug is found</li>
</ul>

<p>I am very tempted to port this to other 68k platforms but there are no concrete plans. I am also tempted to port it to Sega CD but again nothing concrete.

<p class="lead">Compatibility</p>

<p>Things this has been tested on:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Real Sega Genesis hardware</b>: The regular builds work just fine, the builds specifically for AtGames devices do not work.</li>
<li><b>Gens r7 on Linux</b>: This is what I use for all development and testing so all builds have to work on here first before I try anything else.</li>
<li><b>BlastEm 0.5.1</b>: All builds are compatible.</li>
<li><b>Genecyst X</b>: All builds are compatible.</li>
<li><b>AtGames portable Genesis clone (aka Firecore)</b>: The builds for AtGames devices are fully functional. This means it's likely to work on other AtGames clones but no guarantees. The versions for actual Genesis hardware will play but have degraded music.</li>
<li><b>MD.emu</b>: The regular builds work just fine. The builds specifically for AtGames devices have an unusually long pause before the title screen loads. Everything works after that. It's safe to assume other derivatives of Genesis Plus have this problem. Just don't use the AtGames builds except on their devices. Or better yet, don't use AtGames devices.</li>
</ul>


<br>

<p class="lead">Content Rating</p>

<p>I can't believe this game wouldn't be rated <b>E</b> if it went through ESRB. I try to avoid controversial content. There are no political or religious references anywhere in this demo. I poke fun at some businesses that I think are scammy or ill-conceived. Perhaps that will offend someone. Perhaps something totally non-offensive will offend someone. I can't really control that. It seems like any thing that exists will offend at least one person.</p>

<p>This game does not have DLC, micro-transactions, pay-to-win, or NFTs... because it's a Sega Genesis game. Even if it was on something else it still wouldn't have these.</p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Even when 
        armed with all the information, including understanding that not all reptiles 
        are dangerous, many parents are still unwilling to get a reptile for their 
        kids, or allow their children to get a reptile. There may be many reasons 
        for this, including knowing their kids well enough to know that a reptile 
        may all too likely be a passing fad and being unwilling to take on the 
        care of the reptile themselves (you may not think your folks have much 
        of a life, but their days are probably overfilled with things to do as 
        it is!). They may understand the financial commitments--and uncertainty--that 
        a pet (or another pet) means, and may not feel they are able or are willing 
        to make that commitment at this time.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">So, what 
        can you do besides whine, wheedle, beg and just generally make a pest 
        of yourself?</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Be responsible<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Start showing 
        responsibility and commitment by paying greater attention to schoolwork 
        and household chores, etc. If you already have assigned chores, do them 
        enthusiastically and without complaint. Get your homework done on time; 
        don't wait till the last minute to get to the library or hit the 'net 
        to do your research, leave your homework at home, or run the thermometer 
        under hot water to get out of going to school because you didn't study 
        for that big test.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If you 
        have been telling your parents that you will be conscientious about caring 
        for a reptile, they will want to see you demonstrate that commitment by 
        seeing you do the things you already need to do, and doing them when they 
        need to be done. When your reptile's cage needs to be cleaned, or it needs 
        to be fed or watered or have the heat light replaced, it can't wait - 
        you need to get right on it. If you typically procrastinate and find other 
        things to do, putting off what needs to be done, there is no reason for 
        your parents to expect that you will be any different when it comes to 
        caring for an animal of any type.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Do some 
        research<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Start researching 
        different species, including their care, availability in the pet trade, 
        their good points and weak points as a pet, common health problems, temperament, 
        the cost of an individual animal plus the costs associated with proper 
        housing, feeding, vet care, and anticipated future expenses as the reptile 
        outgrows its first enclosure.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">While 
        the total cost of any reptile far exceeds the reptile's sticker price, 
        what it costs to set up a reptile in New York city may be very different 
        than what it costs in Redding, California. What you need to do to research 
        out housing expenses is to go to several local pet stores, pad of paper 
        in hand, and start making some notes. Even the most easy-to-care-for reptile 
        has some very specific requirements. Depending on what type you decide 
        to get, basic equipment and furnishings include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Suitably sized enclosure 
          (depending on the species, may need to start with anything from a 10-60

      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many people 
        figure they can skimp on the enclosure size or delay in getting the equipment 
        their animal needs. The problem is, the reptile needs the proper heating, 
        lighting, substrate, food, etc., now ! All too often, owners find that 
        they end up with a dead reptile. Or they may end up having to spend hundreds 
        of dollars in veterinary expenses and the cost of the equipment they should 
        have bought to begin with...and still their reptile may be too far gone 
        to make it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">For veterinary 
        expenses, check with the local herpetological society or wildlife rescue 
        group to see who the good reptile vets are in your area, then call their 
        offices. You don't need to actually talk to the vet as the office staff 
        can tell you how much an initial exam for a new patient, a fecal flotation 
        and worming medicine is (which is what you can expect to pay for any new 
        reptile who is basically healthy but needs to be wormed).</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If you 
        can't save enough from your allowance, birthday gifts and after school 
        jobs to not only get everything your reptile needs to start with, and 
        to get all the replacements it is going to need (replacing burned out 
        bulbs, vitamins, food supplies, substrate, cleaning/disinfecting supplies, 
        annual replacement of the UVB tubes, etc.) in addition to what you are 
        going to have to pay for the animal itself, and your parents are not willing 
        to chip in or carry the full cost themselves, don't get it. It is not 
        fair to the reptile to subject it to inadequate housing, food and care 
        just because you desperately want to have it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">By the 
        way, &quot;do some research&quot; doesn't mean posting on a newsgroup 
        or message board or emailing someone demanding &quot;tell me everything 
        you know about [species] so my mom will let me have one&quot; or &quot;how 
        much does a corn snake cost?&quot; While the information and resources 
        available through the Internet should be a part of your research, it should 
        not, and cannot, if you are doing a thorough job, be the only resource 
        you tackle in finding out everything you can about the care and keeping 
        of the reptiles you are interested in.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Get 
        your parents involved<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Ask your folks 
        to attend herp society meetings with you. This will give both of you some 
        time together to focus on other aspects of herpetology/herpetoculture, 
        including finding and making use of local resources and meeting other 
        herpers. This latter can be most effective as your folks will be able 
        to meet other parents of kids your age and will be able to pick their 
        brains - just as you will be able to pick the kids' brains. And, just 
        in case your parents think all herpers are a buncha tattooed biker dope 
        fiends, they will be pleasantly surprised to find that herpers come in 
        all persuasions, representing both genders, all ages, backgrounds, and 
        walks of life. The herp society can also be great place to find locally 
        bred reptiles.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Be adult: 
        prepare to compromise<br>

        if it is your folks who will be providing the money for your reptile and 
        its care! While all of your hard work and stick-to-it-iveness and research 
        skills and powers of assimilation (putting all the facts and information 
        you got together into a form that allowed you to start making some comparisons 
        and decisions - see? and you didn't think you were learning anything important 
        in school!) may have convinced your parents that you were mature and responsible 
        enough for a reptile, the fact that they are going to be paying for some 
        or all of it means that your decision on what to get is going to have 
        to be tempered by what they will allow in the house.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As above, 
        don't whine, wheedle, beg, or complain. Do it enough, and your folks just 
        may change their minds! Instead, roll with their decision. Start off nice 
        and slow. You may be one of the lucky ones whose reptiles grow on their 
        parents, leading to more reptiles, like the ones you wanted to get to 
        begin with, a year or more down the line.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Dealing 
        with reality<br>
        </font> </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A 
        big problem comes up when you go away for the weekend or longer. If your 
        parents aren't willing to care for your animal of choice, don't get it. 
        Unless, of course, you never plan on going to camp, off on a school trip, 
        spend the night at a friend's house, or college! Even snakes need to be 
        looked in on regularly and their enclosures cleaned. Just telling your 
        folks to leave it till you get home isn't very practical, especially since 
        many reptiles like to poop in their water bowl or on their food...</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Remember 
        that, even with all the research you did, and no matter how prepared you 
        were for that reptile, it is still going to be a learning experience for 
        you. You are going to need to learn how to adjust your own schedule and 
        responsibilities to fit in the care your reptile needs, the handling sessions, 
        cage cleaning days, getting food for it, monitoring the equipment to make 
        sure it is working all right, etc.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many reptiles 
        should be handled regularly. Not only does it give them exercise they 
        wouldn't ordinarily get in their enclosure, but it provides mental stimulation 
        for them, too. Just think about how crazy you'd get if you had to stay 
        in your room all day (with most of the fun stuff taken out, including 
        radio, television, your computer and hand-held video games), day after 
        day after day, week after week, month after month. That, unfortunately, 
        is what happens to too many reptiles that kids get. Football or soccer 
        or whatever season starts, practice starts taking up what time isn't spent 
        eating, studying and kicking back with your friends, and pretty soon your 
        reptile starts getting snappy or hissy when you finally think to go take 
        it out for awhile, so you put it away again. Just as it isn't fair to 
        the reptile to start out with anything less than the enclosure and equipment 
        it needs, so too isn't it fair to leave many of them completely alone 
        except for when you remember to feed, water and clean.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Plan 
        for the future<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If you agree 
        to be responsible for your reptile, including getting to the store to 
        get food, and taking it to the vet, keep in mind that your choice of reptile 
        needs to be limited to its eventual size. You can't exactly take a 10 
        ft boa or 5 ft lizard on the bus or bicycle to get to the vet, and bag 
        of dead rats or rabbits slung over your book rack on the back of your 
        bike may get a bit messy and smelly on your way home, and the live ones 
        may eat their way out of the bag or box before you get there.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Planning 
        on going away to college and living away from home? If you are planning 
        on living in student housing with your reptile, you may need to think 
        again. Most college and university dorms and student housing prohibit 
        the keeping of any pets; some specifically prohibit reptiles, or certain 
        reptiles. Think you can just sneak yours in? Read the fine print and think 
        again. Housing facilities staff generally have the right to enter student 
        rooms without the student present or any advance notification given. If 
        you are renting a house or an apartment, landlords can do the same thing 
        if there is something like leaky plumbing to be fixed. Think your friends 
        won't rat you out? Think again...it just takes one ticked off friend or 
        acquaintance to tell the wrong person that you have been hiding a 15 ft 
        python in your closet. Too many students end up with very sick animals 
        because they aren't able to provide the right environment, diet, or veterinary 
        care for it, or are faced with finding a home for themselves or their 
        reptile within 24 hours once the facilities staff finds out and gives 
        notice of eviction.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Your 
        folks still say no...<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Accept it. 
        For now, at least. You can always try again next year, using the year 
        in between to work on anything that needs to be worked on (proclaiming 
        your maturity to your folks while whining, stamping your foot, and slamming 
        the door probably isn't going to convince them that you are as mature 
        as you say you are...!) In the meantime, you can still keep up with the 
        reptile world, attending herp society meetings, reading herp magazines, 
        participating in herp forums online. It is a good time to start putting 
        aside some money regularly, saving up for when you will need it for your 
        herp.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">And, if 
        worse comes to terrible, and your parents can't be swayed while you are 
        living under their roof, don't despair. The time will come when you will 
        be on your own, with all the joys and not-so-joys of maintaining your 
        own household and vehicle, and earning your own money to pay for it all. 
        Then you can indulge yourself and get that reptile you've always wanted. 
        And, who knows? Having one then may be a great way to keep your folks 
        from dropping in unexpectedly!</font></p>

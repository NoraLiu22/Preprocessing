            devices for cleaning records and keeping them in excellent condition. 
            <br>
            The <b>Loricraft Record Cleaning Machines (PRC)</b> work along the 
            same principle devised by the late <b>Percy Wilson</b>, but they omit 
            the stationary brush and the motorized unwinding of the buffer thread. 
            The advantage is that the Loricraft machines are about half the price 
            of the Keith Monks. <br>
            From Germany there are two machines built along the same construction 
            principles: SB+ and SBPro.</font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
            machines that are constructed along the principles of Keith Monks, 
            extraordinary results can be obtained if an effective cleaning solution 
            is used. Not only dirty records can improve, but also many old records 
            from the vintage era and from the early days of mono can successfully 
            be cleaned and regain in many cases a lot of their former splendor.<br>

            is the cheap and practical <b>Disco-Antistat</b> if you do not have

            machines that work with a suction arm that vacuums the entire record 
            surface in one or to revolutions. In this category there is a variety 
            of machines, ranging from the cheap and loud <b>Okki Nokki</b> to 
            the expensive machines made by Clearaudio and VPI. Then there is the

            record he heard some <b>background noise</b> caused by the residue 
            of the cleaning liquid in the groove. I advised him to buy a Loricraft 
            or a Keith Monks Record Cleaning Machine. These are the best machines. 
            I have not heard from him since. I presume that he currently plays

            the record you bought from him was not OK? When I am in a shop and 
            see a sealed record, I ask the attendant or shop owner to remove the

            manufacture that contain some sort of grease in order to put a thin 
            layer/film of &quot;grease&quot; over the surface of the LP. The aim 
            is to let the diamond tip glide easily over the walls of the engraved 
            vinyl groove. It should be a very thin film though. These formulas 
            do their work right if that is the effect what you ask. But generally 
            they do not deep clean the groove as a pure cleaning liquid does. 
            The &quot;greasy&quot; solutions can be applied with some success 
            only if the record was thoroughly cleaned first.<b> Just think of 
            this: when washing your hair... do you use a shampoo with built in 
            cream rinse? </b>A &quot;fatty&quot; cleaning liquid will add width 
            to the micrometers that represent the engraved signal but also to 
            the structure of the vinyl. And that can be heard!</font></p>

            stylus ride smoothly in the groove. And that is what you can hear 
            because the edgy sound of for example digitally recorded strings can 
            get a more friendly character. </font></font></p>

            quite good. But &quot;burned in&quot; dirt and debris will not easily 
            go away with this liquid. It was clear to me that for some older records 
            there should be a &quot;clean&quot; cleaning first with a purer formula. 
            Tip: Leave the record in the open during the night, supported by a 
            short cardboard tube.</font><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000066"> 
            The record can be washed again with L'Art du Son. In all cases your

            There are also reports on the fact that the deluted solution becomes

            of using a glas jar. However I found that a glas jar does not prevent 
            the liquid from getting opaque. So the best thing is to make a small 
            portion each time, just enough for the number of records to be cleaned

            Playing a completely clean groove will even out very tiny holes in 
            the vinyl as the needle tip reaches a high temperature (900 to 1200 
            degrees Celsius) and that for a very short time when riding the groove. 
            And that effect is appreciated by many vinyl lovers. It goes without 
            saying that the needle tip should be clean and dry as well. You can 
            use the same cleaning formula for the cartridge tip. Apply it with 
            a soft brush first and than clean the actual diamond tip with the

            the grease (or whatever additive is used by manufacturers of special 
            liquids) smoothes out the information in the mid band and the mid-high 
            register as if the tiny diamond tip is skipping some information. 
            The effect is that the attack and the transient response are somewhat 
            hampered.<br>

          <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also 
            the application of special, more or less volatile, liquids which put 
            a thin layer between needle tip and vinyl groove can have this effect: 
            the high frequencies are sounding &quot;nicer and refined&quot;, but 
            the attack of instruments can be less clear. A problem with these 
            liquids is also that they are not easily applied evenly on the record's 
            surface. <br>
            Only after cleaning the completely dry record has been played entirely, 
            the cleaning with grease containing liquid or one of those special 
            liquids like LAST Record Preservative can be applied, only of course 
            if you really want to! Because it can depend on the record. Some fierce 
            sounding Mercury LPs sound much better with Record Preservative. You

                best option for a buffer thread is the nylon thread as it was 
                originally used by Keith Monks. It came from England and was The 
                Celebrated Talbot No. 30. Not solid but the braided type. This 
                make is no longer available. Many owners of Keith Monks and of 
                Loricraft machines have been experimenting to find a solution.<br>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4">Polyester 
                is not the best alternative, but always better than polyester 
                mixed with cotton as cotton absorbs the liquid and expands and 
                this obstructs the suction. At one time I used a very thin thread 
                of polyester that I doubled, wound on an old spool using an electric 
                drill. That double thread worked fine.</font></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">One 
                negative aspect using the Talbot thread came to light when the 
                thread was confronted with the rough edge of a 1950's record and 
                the thread was massed up at the jar and I had to solve the obstruction.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4"><br>

                some experiments can do no harm. Always try on an old record as 
                with some threads the vinyl could probably be damaged. The best 
                option is to find a manufacturer of nylon thread or just ask Keith 
                Monks or Loricraft.</font></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4">Often 
                I have been looking for a nylon thread to be replaced in the Keith 
                Monks RCM. When my small stock of Calibrated Talbot nylon thread 
                would soon run out, I went looking for an alternative again. A 
                few years ago I had bought a large spool of green nylon thread 
                at a haberdashery shop, tried the thread and was not too happy 
                with the result. But that was before I installed the new KNF vacuum 
                pump. Some time ago I discovered that the jar for the used fluid 
                was not properly sealed and I solved that problem. Now I wound 
                the green nylon thread on a small spool and installed it in the 
                machine. I found that it worked wonders and that it was transported 
                very well through the tube. This is the wire: Red fish 210D/2 
                which is 0.25 mm thick and is available in a variety of colors. 
                The color is of no importance of course.</font></font></p>

                    For the guiding of the thread you need a plastic tube that 
                    is long enough to make a bend and at one end is large enough 
                    to fit on the nozzle (more or less). You can make the other 
                    end fit to the copper tube from which the thread emerges by 
                    inserting a short piece of smaller tube (see the image). Another 
                    method is to take off the tube at the point where it connects 
                    to the nozzle. And insert it into the temporary (green in

            effective and also less expensive than the Keith Monks. The VPI and 
            Clearaudio have similarities and do work very well. They do not have 
            a suction arm which moves from label to periphery, but have a long 
            pipe with a slot which is put over the record and sucks the liquid 
            and dirt in just in one or two turns of the record. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">The Nitty 
            Gritty machines follow the same principle. Zenn Audio in Singapore 
            proposes a fast centrifugal cleaning machine (without dry suction 
            via a vacuum pump). Recently a small machine is available on the market. 
            It is the Cadence Okki Nokki. The platter, motor and pump seem to 
            be sturdy and well working, though the pump is loud, but check carefully 
            if you like the suction arm which has some rough felt around the mouth 
            and could damage your vinyl. In my view that part should be improved 
            and be made safer for your records.</font></p>

            you can learn from some of the improvements I made on the Keith Monks 
            Record Cleaning Machine.</font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="4">1. 
            Locate the machine in a separate room, an attic or in a (dry) garage.</font></b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>2. 
            Build a cabinet to place the machine on.</b> Calculate the height 
            of the cabinet in such a way that you can easily put a record on the 
            platter without damaging it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>3. 
            Build a roof over the machine and install a ventilator (fan) </b> 
            in it, connected to an exhaust pipe. The pipe should end in a hole 
            in the outside wall, door or window.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>4. 
            Mount to the left and right of the ventilator above the machine two 
            small 25 or 40 Watt bulbs.</b> You can connect the lamps and the ventilator 
            to the same switch so both will function when you switch the ventilator 
            on before starting cleaning records.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>5. 
            Take the vacuum pump out </b>of the Keith Monks Machine's cabinet 
            and place it on a wooden base and decouple it with springs. Buy extra 
            lengths of tube and wire to connect the pump. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="4">6. 
            Buy a new belt and improve the drying of the record.</font></b><font size="4"> 
            The suction arm should move slowly from the center of the record to 
            the periphery. Many users complain about the fact that the arm skips 
            a few grooves and leaves some liquid on the record's surface. The 
            best thing to do is to use a new arm belt that you can buy at a camera 
            repair shop where they also sell belts for movie projectors. Take 
            the old belt with you and ask for a similar new one. In most cases 
            they cannot supply a belt with the same thickness but just smaller. 
            That will do the trick. Now the arm will move slower and will hopefully 
            not skip part of the record. A reason that the arm skips can be caused 
            by the fact that the motor does not have enough grip on the disc underneath 
            the suction arm. After installing a thinner belt the drying of the 
            record will take a bit longer. But who cares if one has a valuable 
            record collection. So many times I read in threads and lists that 
            a virtue of this or that machine is that it cleans in just X seconds. 
            I do not understand those people. What is it that you want? Saving 
            30 seconds? Just do not start cleaning a record when you have to catch 
            a train.</font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>7. 
            Check the functioning of the vacuum pump.</b> Check the pump from 
            time to time and clean the innards carefully and put everything back 
            the same way you took the various parts out before you started to 
            clean the pump.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4" color="#663333">The 
            result is:</font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#663333">a. 
            The exhaust prevents you from being exposed to the cleaning liquid 
            which contains a high percentage of alcohol. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#663333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">b. 
            Because the pump has been placed underneath the machine and on springs, 
            the machine does not vibrate and the platter turns in a silent way 
            without the suction arm being moved by the vibrations. The effect 
            is a smooth and even drying of the record. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#663333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">c. 
            The record is cleaner and it is also completely dry.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="VENT"></a></font></p>

            liquid probably does not exist as there are many solutions possible 
            and these are propagated by thousands of collectors. There are many 
            different cleaners and as many different views on how to clean vinyl 
            long playing records. At the end of the nineteen fifties, the problem 
            of dirty records became more and more an urgent topic for the record 
            collector. The stereo groove and the elliptical diamond had been introduced 
            and these prompted many audiophiles to rethink the best way of how 
            to achieve a as perfect a reproduction as possible. It was legendary 
            audiojournalist and inventor Percy Wilson from Great Britain who started 
            to consider using a machine for cleaning LP records. The aim was to 
            restore as much as possible the physical aspect of a record. Hitherto 
            the advice had been given to use a damp cloth, or even a flat, round 
            white sponge like the Rimington. That worked all right when playing 
            the old mono records with a spherical (conical) diamond tip which 
            rides high in the groove.</font></font> </div>

              the increasing refinement of the vinyl compound, the cutting of 
              a wider frequency band, dedicated cleaning became even more urgent. 
              So record cleaning machines were constructed. In the beginning it 
              was advised to use equal parts of industrial alcohol and destilled 
              water. But various people started to devise and try specific liquids 
              which were made up of various ingredients. Various brands have been 
              marketed since. They all have their benefits and they all have their 
              inadequacies as they are mostly not suitable to deep clean the groove 
              so the signal is restored as much as possible.</font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#666666"><b>LAST 
              (Liquid Archival Sound Treatment) offers an array of products for 
              restoring the groove of records which are still in relatively good 
              shape: special liquids and brushes. Also Nitty Gritty and Knosti 
              provide a relatively good clean. The same goes for L'Art du Son. 
              They all want to retain the original sound of the record. These 
              all have ingredients which make the diamond tip ride a smooth groove.

            &quot;burned&quot; into the vinyl, these products hardly fulfill the 
            promise that the groove is cleaned. That is why a thorough cleaning 
            with a mix of water and alcohol may be undertaken first and then have 
            the record treated in a second wash with these high end formulas, 
            if you wish. But also here your ear is the best judge.</font></b></font></div>

            Go to the art supply shop and buy a brush. I use the Royal Talens 
            6 - 350. It is a relatively soft brush, but the hairs are sturdy enough

            the bottle's opening to remove excess liquid and wet the sticker on 
            the record cover with the brush. Leave it for several minutes. Then 
            you can try to pull at a corner of the sticker and see if it detaches. 
            If not, apply some turpentine again and let the sticker soak. It may 
            be necessary to use just a little bit of force. But be careful! If 
            the sticker can be taken off, the cover will show some residue. Just 
            brush that spot once more and then use a paper tissue to wipe off 
            the rest of the turpentine, sticker and glue. If a stickers is put

            Also be careful if you want to use turpentine on very old printed 
            cardboard/Kraft covers, because it may dissolve and smear the old

            I recently acquired a few first pressings of a vintage label. They 
            had been advertised as being unplayed and unopened. However three 
            of the five albums had been opened and glue of the sticker was smeared 
            on the vinyl over a wide area. There turpentine possibly could help.

          <p><font color="#666666" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>I 
            soaked the brush in the turpentine and gently moved the brush over 
            the large spot and let it soak. After a while I moved the brush again 
            over the area, always parallel to the groove, waited again and repeated 
            the action. The glue was dissolving gradually and nicely, and I could 
            wipe it off with a tissue. After that of course I applied turpentine 
            once again. All residue had to be dissolved and removed. This has 
            to be done carefully and with patience. But the reward can be that 
            the record surface will be neat and the groove can be played again, 
            only of course after a few cleanings on the machine. </b></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#666666"><b><font size="4">Another 
            disc had a sort of debris in circles stuck to a wide area. I was not 
            sure whether this could be removed or if it was not vinyl grain and 
            the groove was really damaged by playing it with a worn needle. The 
            only way to be sure was to apply turpentine with the brush. Again 
            I moved the brush in circles. Very gently. Than waited some time and 
            with the brush I could take off the residue of the pressing which 
            was made 50 years ago. And finally I could use the tissue to soak 
            up the rest of the turpentine. After that the disc needed two cleanings 
            on the machine. Surfaces of the other discs were also showing some 
            residue -they were first pressings that never had been played- and 
            before cleaning the record on the machine it was the turpentine that 
            helped. <br>

            That is why I generally do not buy factory sealed records. I only 
            buy them if I know I can trust the seller and the record can be returned. 
            'Factory sealed' is definitely no guarantee that they are MINT. Actually 
            they can be less than pristine. In some cases even the seller may 
            shrink-wrap the item.</font></b></font> </p>

            there are stickers on the record label, I would advise you to leave 
            them there and not to manipulate them, because the situation only 
            can get worse. But if you insist...<br>
            Removing stickers can be done by using a special sticker remover, 
            a solution which can be found in the drugstore or a specialized shop 
            with office or art materials. You better try the effectiveness of 
            this liquid on a dispensable record/record cover. Sometimes a label 
            is easily damaged. Apply the liquid and let the sticker soak for some 
            time. Then carefully try to lift the sticker at a corner. If it is 
            not detachable, do apply some more liquid and take more time.</font></b></font>

          <p><font color="#666666" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="4">You 
            can combine this method with the use of a hairdryer if it concerns 
            a cover. The hot air will generally soften the glue so the sticker 
            may come off easier. If it is a sticker on a label you can try the 
            same liquid. Sometimes labels are made of hard plastic or gold. Those 
            stickers may have a hard upper layer which makes soaking difficult. 
            Then the hairdryer comes in handy. Place a cardboard roll (the basis 
            of a wide packaging tape) on the label, around the sticker. Do not 
            position the roll over the dead wax or over the groove. Now hold the 
            hairdryer in the opening of the roll and blow hot air for a few seconds 
            inside the roll. Check if the sticker can be lifted at the edge. Do 
            this carefully. Do not use force. Then blow again for 5 seconds. Try 
            to remove the sticker a bit more. And so on and so forth. You probably 
            can also try the hairdryer method without the use of the sticker remover 
            solution if the remover does damage the color of the label. But that 
            can be a dangerous affair.<br>

            fluid works on uncoated stickers the best, but it's worked for me 
            on almost every sticker. If the sticker is metallic then the fluid 
            obviously wont penetrate it from above, but it's likely you can get 
            at it from beneath.... soak the sticker edges first, wait, then re-soak 
            and start peeling towards the center. repeat the process until it's 
            all off. don't rush it or you can pull up the paper with un-loosened 
            adhesive. My dad collects stamps and he uses lighter fluid on his 
            stamps to verify watermarks. It evaporates without a trace in about 
            a minute. it has never damaged his stamps, and so it should be considered

            people claim that cleaning a vinyl record will damage the groove.</font> 
            <font color="#666666" size="4">Somebody wrote in a forum that he had 
            talked to people from a record company and these people said that 
            a record should never be cleaned with liquids, even if these liquids 
            have been specifically designed for vinyl record cleaning. But what 
            if you have a really dirty record that you want to play and you do 
            not want to damage the fine, polished diamond tip? Some people argue 
            that these record producers want vinyl records to sound mediocre, 
            so the CD will be more appreciated and the new SACD will count on 
            new enthusiasts who have enough of bad sounding, romantically crackling 
            records.</font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#666666">There 
            is much turbulence going on when a stylus follows the groove. A record 
            can collect small particles of dust and will get dirty in time. Before 
            playing a record it needs to be wiped gently with a soft velvet brush 
            or with one of these special carbon fiber brushes. Naturally these 
            brushes are only effective if the record's surface is relatively clean. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#990000">A 
            few months back there was a guy on the market who was selling a lot 
            of old records. I overheard him advising a client. He said that the 
            record should be cleaned with window cleaner. I corrected him and 
            from now on he no longer advises his clients to use window/glass cleaner. 
            Using glass cleaner definitely will ruin the vinyl. Never use that 
            stuff, it takes of the shiny glow of the vinyl and gives persistent 
            hiss and background noise. You easily can distinguish such a disc 
            from a copy not being cleaned with aggressive glass cleaner.</font></p>

            surface with a carbon brush and get rid of dust and debris first before 
            applying the liquid. Many people just put the record on the cleaning 
            machine and start cleaning,. They forget that the dust and particles 
            will be accumulated by the cleaning brush and will ride over the vinyl 
            and in the groove, round after round. You can imagine what the result 
            is. </b></font></font></p>

            it again, may actually improve the groove. Only of course if the groove 
            suffered from dust and dirt. Not if it has been damaged by a worn 
            stylus tip. Then a record can not be bettered.</font></b></font></p>

            climate in the listening room has its influence also. Heavy smokers 
            should not be invited. Heavy smoking is not advised. The record can 
            collect greasy particles which float in the air.<br>
            Not carefully slipping the record in its sleeve after play will increase 
            the possibility that it collects dust and gets dirty. <br>
            And as said earlier: the use of grease/oil during the pressing process 
            in the factory is a necessity so the matrix and the vinyl record can 
            be separated easily. But the fat or oil hardens when the record cools 
            off. This hardened grease can give a ticking sound or a sound as if 
            there is a bump or other unevenness in the vinyl. Especially in the 
            nineteen seventies the application of the pressing oil or fat was 
            not always done carefully. Many buyers and also the personal in the 
            record shop thought that the records were damaged and traded them 
            in and they were sent back to the factory.</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#666666" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>If 
            a record sounds bad even after cleaning, the groove must have been 
            damaged by playing on a bad turntable. Or the plastic of an old inner 
            sleeve may have been in contact with the vinyl over decades. Another 
            possibiliy is that the record can never be improved because the vinyl 
            is of bad quality and is not pure enough and contains a high percentage 
            of filler material. Such a record can hardly be improved. </b></font></p>

            during the pressing process. So the surface has a &quot;bump&quot; 
            or can have &quot;loose particles&quot; which will be transported

                  splits are a nuisance. They can get longer and longer and they 
                  can damage the record if the inner sleeve is not new and does 
                  not protect the rim of the record. The drawings show what can

                  will experience here too that practice can make perfect. <br>
                  Take a long piece of 200 gr. paper or Kraft. The length should 
                  be a little more than the split. Fold it along its length. See 
                  to it that the paper stays folded. If you want to make it last 
                  forever you can cover it entirely with a piece of wide transparent 
                  adhesive tape. Then fold it again. Now cut the piece more or 
                  less to the needed size. Fold it again, so it will better remember 
                  the fold. Spread it out on an old newspaper and then put on 
                  the glue and smear it out. <br>

                  comes the difficult part and that is slipping the piece into 
                  the inside of the cover. You can bend the cover somewhat and 
                  than put the piece in place. If you can get some help it will 
                  make things easier. Clamp the seem for some time. <br>
                  This method works best with covers made of thin cardboard or

        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#000000">This 
            cleaning formula works also very well when using the DISCO ANTISTAT 
            (Knosti) device, as friends and collectors have told me, and some 
            have shown me. If you find the right balance of the ingredients you 
            will notice that there will be hardly any residue, hence not much 
            dirt does accumulate on the needle tip when first playing a record 
            cleaned with this ingenious device. <br>
            To eliminate the residue to the max you should use a second basin 
            (brushes included) just filled with distilled(!) water and rinse the 
            disc after being washed in the first basin.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#000000">Do 
            not think that by a few turns the record groove is well cleaned. As 
            on a Keith Monks the record turns for about a minute, you should turn 
            the record in the Disco ANTISTAT quite for some time. Here again your 
            experience will tell you if the wash is too short or is effective.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#000000">Since 
            isopropyl can cause leakage of the vinyl (as I am told), you should 
            avoid cleaning with just isopropyl. But you can use it in a mix. Just 
            add a small percentage to your formula.&nbsp;However the Library of 
            Congress once proposed a mixture of 20% isopropyl and 80% de-ionized 
            water. I tried that solution and it worked all right. A long time 
            ago I was told that isopropyl was toxic, more than any other solvent. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#000000">But 
            recently Dr. Pekka Keski-Rahkonen from Finland wrote to me: &quot;I 
            would like to point out that using isopropyl alcohol should not be 
            avoided due to toxicity reasons. As per classification according to 
            EU Directives 67/548/EEC or 1999/45/EC, the substance is not classified 
            toxic, and is even used for skin desinfection purposes as a main constituent 
            in "rubbing alcohol". In contrast, methanol, which has traditionally 
            been used in "methylated spirits", is toxic and should be avoided.&quot; 
            <br>
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#000000">I 
            myself use both methanol and a small amount of isopropyl in the cleaning 
            mix. In any case building an exhaust is no luxury. Even though I have 
            returned to my original formula. By the way, the Library of Congress 
            (LOC) have devised a new formula which I did not try, but looks rather 
            promising viewing its ingredients.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Whatever 
            machine or cleaning device you use, it is important to take dust and 
            other particles off the record before you start cleaning it with a 
            liquid. If you use a Keith Monks or other high speed machine, put 
            the record on the platter of the machine or on the platter of an old 
            turntable like a Goldring/Lenco (which you may have installed for 
            this purpose) with the B-side facing up. Then switch the machine on 
            and dust the record with a carbon fiber record brush. Stop the spinning. 
            Turn the record so that Side A is facing up. Dust off this side. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">If the 
            record does not have rough particles, dirt and dust, you may start 
            the liquid cleaning process. Always put enough liquid on the surface 
            and spread it around before spinning the platter. The liquid will 
            prevent the record from being damaged by any left particles. If you 
            start cleaning now, you will automatically do Side A first. And then 
            Side B. So you will not get confused.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Another 
            important thing is to clean the brush(es) of your cleaning machine 
            at regular intervals. Dirt may stick to the brush(es) and eventually 
            will harm the groove.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">In case 
            the dirt is really sticking to the vinyl and cannot be taken off with 
            the carbon fiber brush, than you will have to gently clean the record 
            under the tap first and dry it carefully with soft paper tissues. 
            Do not exercise pressure and do not smear the tap water plus dirt 
            over the record's surface, nor its label. Once you are satisfied with 
            the result and have dried the surfaces with tissue paper you may start 
            cleaning the record on the machine. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">If dirt, 
            glue and other unknown materials were not removed from the disc by 
            the cleaning process, you can try other liquids like turpentine, benzene 
            and methylated spirit for removing persistent dirt. These liquids 
            will generally do no harm to the vinyl. Use a small brush to apply 
            the liquid and give the liquid time to do its job. In certain cases 
            you also may use cotton tips. After the dirt has been removed a paper 
            tissue will absorb excess liquid. Then the record can be cleaned again. 
            In case of the turpentine you may clean it more than once, or add 
            an extra drop of washing detergent.</font></p>

            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">You can 
            'create' your own spindle hole enlarger Buy a pair of small kitchen 
            scissors with blades that are about 8 mm wide in the middle at the 
            pivot (screw). Cut off one eye. Now you can fold the blades so that 
            they shift further over each other. The cutting edges are now at the 
            outside. Fold the two blade together so that they fit into the spindle 
            hole. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Take 
            the record in one hand and with the other you put the scissors blades 
            into the hole. The blades will always adjust to the size of the spindle 
            hole. Gently turn the scissors. The amount of pressure you apply will 
            determine the extend of widening the spindle hole. In most cases a 
            few light turns at one side will do. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Take 
            care that the debris (paper, vinyl) is taken off the record. Do it 
            with your finger. You can turn one finger nail in the hole and flatten/clean 
            the edge and blow the debris away. Try if the record fits on the turntable 
            without having to apply force. If it does not fit give the scissors 
            another light turn.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I have 
            been using this method for many years and it provides an even widening. 
            This is to my knowledge the best way to go about and will give good 
            results. Most of the time it is not the vinyl which is obstructing, 
            but the edge of the paper label that will prevent the record hole 
            to slide over the spindle.</font></p>

thoroughly cleaning the record, I put it in a new sleeve</font></b><font size="4">. 
Certain inner sleeves like the ones from Decca, London, Deutsche Grammophon and 
Philips can be very cautiously cleaned with a paper tissue and a few drops of 
methylated spirit. It takes some practice. In general though I use a new inner 
sleeve and slip the original one (if it has text and/or pictures) into the cover 
as well.</font></font></p></div><div align="left"> <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">To 
avoid mold caused by humidity and to avoid sticking of plastic to the surface 
Philips used inner sleeves of <b>thin, soft blotting paper</b>, just a folded 
sheet, no glue, no flip back borders. That was in the 1950's. That was an excellent 
practice. Later the blotting paper was replaced by folded sheets of white paper, 
and for the more expensive series the sleeves were made of paper sealed inside 
plastic bags. <br> If you have 10&quot; records without inner sleeves you can 
make these yourself by choosing a nice quality of coated paper, fold it and cut 
it to the right measurements so it will just fit into the 10&quot; cover.<br> 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">There 
are various inner sleeves available on the market and to my knowledge the ones 
manufactured today are of <b>the not sticking kind</b>. Also most sleeves from 
the nineteen seventies and eighties are of the right kind. The sleeves will not 
stick to the surface if both the record. <b>Keep the sleeve clean. Do not use 
Lenco Clean</b> or other fluids on your records when you play them. These liquids 
will put a thin film of sticky liquid on the record and on the inner sleeve, as 
you may have noticed. On top of that Lenco Clean restricts the movement of the 
needle tip and not only <b>diminishes high frequency information and kills an 
excellent transient response</b>. And the transient is just one of those valuable 
features of the analog LP which the CD cannot perform at all because of its restricted 
bandwidth. </font></p></div><div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">If 
you want to play wet, than a preferred method is using distilled water. In all 
cases it is of importance that you <b>clean the record on a cleaning machine after 
it has been played wet </b>or at least see to it that the surface is completely 
dry before you put the LP back into the inner sleeve. </font></div><div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
The quality of the sleeve is of the utmost importance. If you have very old records 
with sturdy cardboard covers that hardly allow you to insert a modern polylined 
paper sleeve, you could use the <b>simple plastic Nagaoka</b> variety of inner 
sleeves. The Nagaoka inner sleeves do slip easily into the old nineteen fifties/sixties 
cardboard covers. Be careful though. They are thin and with the record inside, 
they also <b>slip easily out of your hand</b>. It is far better to use the square 
double lined all plastic inner sleeves as used by Proac, Soundstream, and others.</font></div><div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">For

visitors of my pages do ask me about how to store their valuable records. There 
are various sites dealing with this subject. There is also advice from the Library 
of Congress who in 1959 published a research paper on the life expectancy of acetates, 
vinyl records and tapes. The conclusion was that records could maintain their 
quality for over a century and even tape had a rather long life if taken care 
of storage and maintenance.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Now, 
many decades later, one can only agree with the finding that records can have 
a very long life, provided humidity is kept relatively low, the room temperature 
is not too high (preferably under 35 degrees or even lower), records are kept 
out of the sun and heating sources can not radiate directly on the albums, and 
the records should be stored vertically and do not have room/space to bend. In 
hot climates they should be stored in a room on the north side of the house/apartment, 
and the shelves should have doors or venetian blinds. Rooms should have curtains.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
Why keep records for more than one hundred years? Well, the LP has the extraordinary 
feature that its signal always can be reproduced because the information in the 
groove is analogous and has to be read with a mechanical device. One wonders if 
a century from now the CD still can be auditioned.<br> You have all the interest 
in keeping your records in good shape for at least as long as you live and as 
long as you will be able to play them. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
To protect old, valuable albums and also gatefold editions, I use outer sleeves 
of transparent plastic. I use the thick variety which is supple, not the hard 
kind. There is also a thinner, less sturdy transparent outer sleeve available. 
The records are slipped into the sleeve from the top. This makes it possible to 
store the album and pull it out of the cabinet entirely without leaving the album 
on the shelve and holding just the plastic outer sleeve in your hand. </font></p></blockquote><p align="center"><img src="lpstorage.jpg" width="580" height="720"></p><blockquote>

					<h3 class="line">Howâ€™s Life?</h3>
					<p align="left">Italy performs well across a number of &nbsp;of well-being dimensions relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. Italy outperforms the average in health, work-life balance and civic engagement. It underperforms average in income, employment, education, environmental quality, social connections and life satisfaction. These assessments are based on available selected data.</p>
<p align="left">Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In Italy,<strong>&nbsp;the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;29 431 a year</strong>, slightly lower than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490 a year.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of employment,&nbsp;<strong>about 58% of people aged 15 to 64 in Italy have a paid job</strong>, below the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 67% of men are in paid work, compared with 49% of women.<strong>&nbsp;In Italy, 3% of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, below the OECD average of 10%, with 4% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 2% of women.</p>
<p align="left">Good education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>63% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 79%. However, completion varies between men and women, as 61% of men have successfully completed high school compared with 65% of women. In terms of the quality of the education system,<strong>&nbsp;the average student scored 477 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)</strong>. This score is lower than the OECD average of 488. On average in Italy,&nbsp;<strong>girls outperformed boys by 2 points</strong>, well below the average OECD gap of 5 points.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of health,&nbsp;<strong>life expectancy at birth in Italy is around 84 years</strong>, three years higher than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 86 years, compared with 81 for men.&nbsp;<strong>The level of atmospheric PM2.5</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>is 15.9 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, above the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In Italy, <strong>77% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 84%.</p>
<p align="left">Concerning the public sphere, there is a moderate sense of community and high levels of civic participation in Italy, where<strong>&nbsp;89% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need</strong>, less than the OECD average of 91%. <strong>Voter turnout,</strong>&nbsp;a measure of citizens' participation in the political process,&nbsp;<strong>was 73% during recent elections</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 69%. Social and economic status can affect voting rates; voter turnout for the top 20% of the population is an estimated 82% and for the bottom 20% it is an estimated 62%.</p>
<p align="left">When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Italians gave it&nbsp;<strong>a 6.5 grade on average,&nbsp;lower than the OECD average of 6.7.</strong></p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people's lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. All of these elements help make a house a home. And of course there is the question whether people can afford adequate housing.</p>
<p align="left">Housing costs take up a large share of the household budget and represent the largest single expenditure for many individuals and families, by the time you add up elements such as rent, gas, electricity, water, furniture or repairs. In Italy, households on average spend&nbsp;<strong>23% of their gross adjusted disposable income on keeping a roof over their heads</strong>, above the OECD average of 20%.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">In addition to housing costs it is also important to examine living conditions, such as the average number of rooms shared per person and whether households have access to basic facilities. The number of rooms in a dwelling, divided by the number of persons living there, indicates whether residents are living in crowded conditions. Overcrowded housing may have a negative impact on physical and mental health, relations with others and children's development. In addition, dense living conditions are often a sign of inadequate water and sewage supply. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>the average home contains 1.4 rooms per person</strong>, less than the OECD average of 1.7 rooms per person. In terms of basic facilities however,&nbsp;<strong>99.4%&nbsp;of dwellings in Italy contain private access to an indoor flushing toilet</strong>, more than the OECD average of 97%.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">While money may not buy happiness, it is an important means to achieving higher living standards and thus greater well-being. Higher economic wealth may also improve access to quality education, health care and housing.</p>
<p align="left">Household net adjusted disposable income is the amount of money that a household earns each year after taxes and transfers. It represents the money available to a household for spending on goods or services. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;29 431</strong>&nbsp;a year, slightly lower than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net wealth is estimated at USD&nbsp;295 020</strong>, slightly lower than the OECD average of USD 323 960.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Having a job brings many important benefits, including: providing a source of income, improving social inclusion, fulfilling one's own aspirations, building self-esteem and developing skills and competencies. In Italy,<strong>&nbsp;58% of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 has a paid job</strong>. This figure is lower than the OECD employment average of 66%.</p>
<p align="left">Unemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at 4.8%</strong>, much higher than the OECD average of 1.3%.</p>
<p align="left">The wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality.&nbsp;<strong>Italians earn&nbsp;USD 37 769 per year on average</strong>, less than the OECD average of USD 49 165.</p>
<p align="left">Another essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>workers face an expected 8.6% loss of earnings if they become unemployed</strong>, much higher than the OECD average of 5.1%.</p>

                <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Boosting skills and innovation</em></p>
<p align="left">Italy launched the National Industry 4.0 Plan in 2016 to boost skills and innovation in new technologies over 2017-20. It provides a range of incentives to stimulate investment as well as increase public investment to extend the ultra-broadband network. Examples of such investments include: a hyper-depreciation scheme, a super-depreciation scheme, R&amp;D tax credits, tax credits for start-ups and innovative small- and medium-enterprises. To enhance the country&rsquo;s technological skills, the Plan will implement a national Digital School Plan, increase the number of students and researchers in technical and scientific subjects, and create competence centres and digital innovation hubs to support knowledge-sharing between universities, the public and private sectors in facilitating technological transfer, and skills in new technology.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Boosting employment through reform</em></p>
<p align="left">Italy introduced a series of policies to reverse the damage caused by the 2008 economic crisis. The 2015 Jobs Act and temporary exemptions in social security contributions have helped create new open-ended contract jobs while also transforming many temporary, atypical and apprenticeship jobs into permanent ones. A new type of permanent contract was also introduced, increasing employment protection for new hires with job tenure. A combination of measures to support paternal care and maternity protection, such as a monthly subsidy for female workers at the end of maternity, have also contributed to higher labour participation. The coverage and duration of unemployment benefits were increased, improving both flexibility and security for Italian workers. Recent growth in employment and participation rates demonstrate the initial success of these policies.</p>

<p align="left">Humans are social creatures. The frequency of our contact with others and the quality of our personal relationships are thus crucial determinants of our well-being.</p>
<p align="left">A strong social network, or community, can provide emotional support during both good and bad times as well as provide access to jobs, services and other material opportunities. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>89% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in a time of need</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 91%.</p>
<p align="left">A weak social network can result in limited economic opportunities, a lack of contact with others, and eventually, feelings of isolation. Socially isolated individuals face difficulties integrating into society as a contributing member and fulfilling personal aspirations.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

<p align="left"><em>Volunteering to preserve city sites</em></p>
<p align="left">Florence, known for its artistic heritage and UNESCO special status, is preserved by some 1 800 dedicated volunteers. The Angels of Hope initiative organises volunteers to help reduce the degradation of the historic environment and strengthen civic feelings of ownership of the historical sites in the city. Volunteers maintain public spaces, buildings and green spaces by removing graffiti, reducing litter and preventing degradation.</p>
<p align="left">Evaluations found that 21 kilometres of road and 45 930 square metres of wall space have been covered by volunteer activities. On average, a single volunteer takes care of 17 roads and invests 165 hours a month. "Before and after" comparisons show considerable improvements and residents report positively on the impact on their neighbourhoods. Volunteers have also brought new ideas. For instance, by simplifying municipal regulations to improve urban spaces and introducing a EUR 75 fine for writing graffiti in non-authorised spaces.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. Italians can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>16.7 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, less than the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>63%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 79%.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in Italy scored 477 in reading literacy, maths and sciences</strong>, below the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions,&nbsp;<strong>the health impacts of urban air pollution&nbsp;continue to worsen</strong>, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p align="left">PM2.5 &ndash; tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung &ndash; is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>PM2.5 levels are 15.9 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter and higher than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the&nbsp;World Health Organization.</p>
<p align="left">Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>77% of people say they are satisfied with water quality,&nbsp;</strong>lower than the OECD average of 84%.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

<p align="left"><em>Green chemistry</em></p>
<p align="left">In Porto Torres (Sardinia), the government facilitated the transformation of an old chemical industry site into a "green chemistry" area that produces biodegradable plastic products. This has involved rehabilitating a contaminated site as well as installing a biomass power plant to supply the new industrial facility. The project is a joint venture between Versalis (the ENI group's chemicals subsidiary) and Novamont, a bio-plastics company. In six years, the project is expected to develop a value chain from non-food agricultural production to bio-plastics and bio-chemicals. The project has allowed employees of the old chemical factory to be retained and some additional employees to be hired in the future.</p>
<p align="left">The central and regional governments, the joint venture, and trade unions signed an agreement providing for entirely private investment of about EUR 500 million (plus EUR 230 million for the biomass power plant).&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Broader public engagement in the decision-making process is also important for holding the government to account and maintaining confidence in public institutions. The formal process for public engagement in developing laws and regulations is one way to measure the extent to which people can become involved in government decisions on key issues that affect their lives. In Italy, the level of stakeholder engagement in developing regulations is 2.5 (on a scale between 0 and 4); higher than the OECD average of 2.1.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Engaging citizens on well-being</em></p>
<p align="left">Italian cities and regions are using well-being objectives to understand what matters most to their citizens. In 2013, Italy published the first edition of the report on Equitable and Sustainable Well-being (BES). Most of the indicators (on 12 dimensions of well-being) are available at the regional level and, in the future, the BES framework will be adapted and applied to large cities and provinces.</p>
<p align="left">In the region of Sardinia public institutions, the private sector and civil society defined concrete well-being objectives for the region. This initiative led to concrete improvements in public service delivery. Over five years the amount of landfilled waste was halved and the share of recycled urban waste rose from 27% to 48%.</p>
<p align="left">Rome initiated a similar consultation process that included community surveys, web tools, public meetings and workshops to create well-being measures that reflect what matters most to Romans. These measures have been used to identify the region&rsquo;s territorial development strategy.</p>

<p align="left">Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care.&nbsp;<strong>Life</strong>&nbsp;<strong>expectancy at birth in Italy stands at almost 84 years</strong>, three years above the OECD average of 81 years, and one of the highest in the OECD.

<p align="left"><em>Improving regional health systems</em></p>
<p align="left">Italy's National Agency for Regional Health Services (AGENAS) co-ordinates different levels of government to address regional differences in care and outcomes. AGENAS' Observatory for Good Practices for Patient Safety collects, classifies, and disseminates safety improvement activities to regions and autonomous provinces. Every year the Observatory issues a call for good practices to encourage patient safety. In this call it provides a standard platform through which to report content, outcomes and costs to ensure comparability. Examples of good practices are then shared in an annual publication and database. Chosen practices show a clear evidence base, are sustainable and are evaluated in accordance with the principles of Continuous Quality Improvement. The Observatory's success in co-ordinating action between the Italian health regions is attributed to the early inclusion of stakeholder input in its design. Complementary top-down and bottom-up actions have also helped sustain collaboration.</p>

<p align="left">Finding a suitable balance between work and life is a challenge for all workers, especially working parents. The ability to successfully combine work, family commitments and personal life is important for the well-being of all members in a household. Governments can help to address the issue by encouraging supportive and flexible working practices, making it easier for parents to strike a better balance between work and home life.</p>
<p align="left">An important aspect of work-life balance is the amount of time a person spends at work. Evidence suggests that long work hours may impair personal health, jeopardise safety and increase stress. In Italy,&nbsp;<strong>about&nbsp;3%&nbsp;of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, much less than the OECD average of 10%.</p>
<p align="left">The more people work, the less time they have to spend on other activities, such as time with others, leisure activities, eating or sleeping. The amount and quality of leisure time is important for people's overall well-being, and can bring additional physical and mental health benefits.&nbsp;<strong>In Italy, full-time workers&nbsp;devote 69% of their day on average, or 16.5 hours, to personal care</strong>&nbsp;(eating, sleeping, etc.)&nbsp;<strong>and leisure</strong>&nbsp;(socialising with friends and family, hobbies, games, computer and television use, etc.) &ndash; more than the OECD average of 15 hours.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

The services are located at the Ministry Headquarters in Rome and in nearby external sports facilities during summer. It is operational on weekdays when there is no school. In the morning before starting work, employees can leave their children in care and collect them at lunch time. If their working hours involve an afternoon, they can also leave them after lunch and collect them in the evening. The care activities are managed by qualified childcare staff.</p>
<p align="left">This improves work-life balance, with 76% of users valuing the experience of the service by their sons and daughters as "excellent" and 21% as "good". Also the work attendance rate of employees who use the service is on average higher than that of other employees with children of the same age.&nbsp;</p>

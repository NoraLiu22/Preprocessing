<hr color="#800000">
<p>The word Copt is derived from the Greek word Aigyptos, which was, in turn,
derived from &quot;Hikaptah&quot;, one of the names for Memphis, the first
capital of <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Site.PyramidsOfGiza.jpg">Ancient
Egypt.</a> The modern use of the term &quot;Coptic&quot; describes Egyptian
Christians, as well as <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticAlphabet.txt">the
last stage of the ancient Egyptian language script.</a> Also, it describes the
distinctive <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticArtOfEgypt.txt">art</a>
and <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/OldCairoCopticChurches.txt">architecture</a>
that developed as <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticArtOrigins.txt">an
early expression of the new faith.</a></p>
<p>The Coptic Church is based on the teachings of <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMark-2.gif">Saint
Mark</a> who brought Christianity to Egypt during the reign of the Roman emperor
Nero in the first century, a dozen of years after the Lord's ascension. He was
one of the four evangelists and the one who wrote the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Codex.StMark-Gospel.gif">oldest
canonical gospel</a>. Christianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century
of Saint Mark's arrival in <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/alexandria/">Alexandria</a>
as is clear from the New Testament writings found in Bahnasa, in Middle Egypt,
which date around the year 200 A.D., and a fragment of the Gospel of Saint John,
written using the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticAlphabet.txt">Coptic
language</a>, which was found in Upper Egypt and can be dated to the first half
of the second century. The Coptic Church, which is now more than nineteen
centuries old, was the subject of many <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/EgyptInTheBible.txt">prophecies
in the Old Testament.</a> Isaiah the prophet, in Chapter 19, Verse 19 says <em>&quot;In
that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt,
and a pillar to the LORD at its border.&quot;</em>
<p>Although fully integrated into the body of 
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/">the
modern Egyptian nation</a>, the Copts have survived as a strong religious entity
who pride themselves on their contribution to the Christian world. The Coptic
church regards itself as a strong defendant of Christian faith. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/prayers/Creed.txt">The
Nicene Creed</a>, which is recited in all churches throughout the world, has
been authored by one of its favorite sons, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StAthanasius-1.gif">Saint
Athanasius</a>, the Pope of Alexandria for 46 years, from 327 A.D. to 373 A.D.
This status is well deserved, after all, Egypt was the refuge that the Holy
Family sought in its <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Tableau.FlightToEgypt.gif">flight
from Judea</a>: &quot;When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by
night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/HolyFamilyInEgypt.txt">&quot;Out
of Egypt I called My Son&quot;</a> [Mathew 2:12-23].
<p><a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CoptsAndChristendom.txt">The
contributions of the Coptic Church to Christendom</a> are many. From the
beginning, it played a central role in Christian theology---and especially to
protect it from <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/GnosticHeresies.txt">the
Gnostics heresies</a>. The Coptic Church produced thousands of texts, biblical
and theological studies which are important resources for archeology. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/TheStoryOfTheBible.txt">The
Holy Bible </a>was translated to the Coptic language in the second century.
Hundreds of scribes used to write copies of the Bible and other liturgical and
theological books. Now libraries, museums and universities throughout the world
possess hundreds and thousands of <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticPapyrusCodices.txt">Coptic
manuscripts</a>.
<p>The <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt">Catechetical
School </a>of Alexandria is the oldest Catechetical School in the world. Soon
after its inception around 190 A.D. by the Christian scholar Pantanaeus, the
school of Alexandria became the most important institution of religious learning
in Christendom. Many prominent bishops from many areas of the world were
instructed in that school under scholars such as Athenagoras, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/ClementOfAlexandria.txt">Clement,</a>
Didymus, and the great Origen, who was considered the father of theology and who
was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies.
Origen wrote over 6,000 commentaries of the Bible in addition to his famous
<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07316a.htm">Hexapla.</a> Many scholars such as Saint Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to
exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars. The scope of the
school of Alexandria was not limited to theological subjects, because science,
mathematics and the humanities were also taught there: The question and answer
method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before Braille, wood-carving
techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write. The
Theological college of the Catechetical School of Alexandria was re-established
in 1893. Today, it has campuses in 
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/alexandria/">Alexandria</a>,
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/cairo/">Cairo</a>, New Jersey, and Los
Angeles, where priests-to-be and other qualified men and women are taught among
other subjects Christian theology, history, Coptic language and art---including <a href="http://www.coptic.net/sounds/Chant.AlleluiaEiei.wav">chanting</a>,
<a href="http://www.coptic.net/sounds/Instrumental.Epouro.wav">music</a>, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticIcons.txt">iconography</a>,
<a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Textile.Omofrion.jpg">tapestry</a>
etc.
<p>Monasticism was born in Egypt and was instrumental in the formation of the
Coptic Church's character of submission and humbleness, thanks to the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/SayingsOfDesertFathers.txt">teachings</a>
and <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticTheologyBites.txt">writings</a>
of <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/ParadiseOfDesertFathers.txt">the
Great Fathers of Egypt's Deserts.</a> Monasticism started in the last years of
the third century and flourished in the fourth century. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StAnthony-1.jpg">Saint
Anthony</a>, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/synexarion/Anthony.txt">the
world's first Christian monk was a Copt from Upper Egypt.</a> Saint Pachom, who
established the rules of monasticism, was a Copt. And, Saint Paul, the world's
first anchorite is also a Copt. Other famous Coptic desert fathers include <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMakarios.jpg">Saint
Makarios</a>, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMosesTheBlack.gif">Saint
Moses the Black</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMina-1.gif">Saint
Mina the wondrous</a>. The more contemporary desert fathers include the late <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Autograph.PopeCyrilVI-2.gif">Pope
Cyril VI</a> and <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.BishopMina.jpg">his
disciple Bishop Mina Abba Mina</a>. By the end of the fourth century, there were
hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout
the Egyptian hills. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Site.StBishoyMonastery-3.jpg">Many
of these monasteries</a> are still flourishing and have new vocations till this
day. All Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the
Egyptian example: Saint Basil, organiser of the monastic movement in Asia minor
visited Egypt around 357 A.D. and his rule is followed by the eastern Churches;
Saint Jerome, who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt around 400 A.D.
and left details of his experiences in his letters; Saint Benedict founded
monasteries in the sixth century on the model of Saint Pachom, but in a stricter
form. And countless pilgrims visited the &quot;Desert Fathers&quot; and emulated
their spiritual, disciplined lives. There is even evidence that Copts had
missionaries to Nothern Europe. One example is <a href="http://www.coptic.net/synexarion/MauriceOfTheba.txt">Saint
Moritz of the Theban Legion</a> who was drafted from Egypt to serve under the
Roman flag and ended up teaching Christianity to inhabitants of the Swiss Alps,
where a small town and a Monastery that contains his relics as well as some of
his books and belongings are named after him. Another saint from the 
<a href="http://www.bibleprobe.com/theban.html">Theban
Legion</a> is <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StVictor.gif">Saint
Victor, known among Copts as &quot;Boktor&quot;.</a>
<p>Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed
to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played
leading roles in Christian theology. They were invited everywhere to speak about
the Christian faith. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/synexarion/CyrilPillarOfFaith.txt">Saint
Cyril</a>, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was
held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said that the bishops of the Church
of Alexandria did nothing but spend all their time in meetings. This leading
role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with
Church affairs. It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with
matters of faith in the Church. The response of Saint Dioscorus, the Pope of
Alexandria who was later exiled, to this interference was clear: &quot;You have
nothing to do with the Church.&quot; These political motives became even more
apparent in Chalcedon in 451, when the Coptic Church was unfairly accused of
following the teachings of Eutyches, who believed in monophysitism. This
doctrine maintains that the Lord Jesus Christ has only one nature, the divine,
not two natures, the human as well as the divine.
<p><a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/MonophysitismReconsidered.txt">The
Coptic Church has never believed in monophysitism</a> the way it was portrayed
in the Council of Chalcedon! In that Council, monophysitism meant believing in
one nature. Copts believe that the Lord is perfect in His divinity, and He is
perfect in His humanity, but His divinity and His humanity were united in one
nature called &quot;the nature of the incarnate word&quot;, which was reiterated
by Saint Cyril of Alexandria. Copts, thus, believe in two natures
&quot;human&quot; and &quot;divine&quot; that are united in one <em>&quot;without
mingling, without confusion, and without alteration&quot;</em> (from the
declaration of faith at the end of <a href="http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html">the
Coptic divine liturgy</a>). These two natures <em>&quot;did not separate for a
moment or the twinkling of an eye&quot;</em> (also from the declaration of faith
at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).
<p>The Coptic Church was misunderstood in the 5th century at the Council of
Chalcedon. Perhaps the Council understood the Church correctly, but they wanted
to exile the Church, to isolate it and to abolish the Egyptian, independent
Pope, who maintained that Church and State should be separate. Despite all of
this, the Coptic Church has remained very strict and steadfast in its faith.
Whether it was a conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church
as a punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether Pope
Dioscurus didn't quite go the extra mile to make the point that Copts are not
monophysite, the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate to reconcile
&quot;semantic&quot; differences between all Christian Churches. This is aptly
expressed by the current 117th successor of Saint Mark, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.PopeShenoudaIIISeat-02.jpg">Pope
Shenouda III</a>: <em>&quot;To the Coptic Church, faith is more important than
anything, and others must know that semantics and terminology are of little
importance to us.&quot;</em> Throughout this century, the Coptic Church has
played an important role in the ecumenical movement. The Coptic Church is one of
the founders of <a href="http://www.wcc-coe.org/">the World Council of
Churches.</a> It has remained a member of that council since 1948 A.D. The
Coptic Church is a member of the all African Council of Churches (AACC) and the
Middle East Council of Churches (MECC). The Church plays an important role in
the Christian movement by conducting dialogues aiming at resolving the
theological differences with the Catholic, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/OrthodoxUnityDialog.txt">Eastern
Orthodox</a>, Presbyterian, and Evangelical Churches.
<p>Perhaps the greatest glory of the Coptic Church is <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Cross.gif">its
Cross.</a> Copts take pride in the persecution they have sustained as early as
May 8, 68 A.D., when their Patron <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMark-2.gif">Saint
Mark</a> was slain on Easter Monday after being dragged from his feet by Roman
soldiers all over Alexandria's streets and alleys. The Copts have been
persecuted by almost every ruler of Egypt. Their Clergymen have been tortured
and exiled even by their Christian brothers after the schism of Chalcedon in 451
A.D. and until the Arab's conquest of Egypt in 641 A.D. To emphasize their pride
in <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Fresco.CopticCross.gif">their cross</a>,
Copts adopted a calendar, called the Calendar of the Martyrs, which begins its
era on August 29, 284 A.D., in commemoration of those who died for their faith
during the rule of Diocletian the Roman Emperor. This calendar is still in use
all over Egypt by farmers to keep track of the various agricultural seasons and
in <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticLectionary.txt">the Coptic
Church Lectionary</a>.
<p>For the four centuries that followed the Arab's conquest of Egypt, the Coptic
Church generally flourished and Egypt remained basically Christian. This is due
to a large extent to the fortunate position that the Copts enjoyed, for the
Prophet of Islam, who had an Egyptian wife (the only one of his wives to bear a
child), preached especial kindness towards Copts: &quot;When you conquer Egypt,
be kind to the Copts for they are your protégés and kith and kin&quot;. Copts,
thus, were allowed to freely practice their religion and were to a large degree
autonomous, provided they continued to pay a special tax, called &quot;Gezya&quot;,
that qualifies them as &quot;Ahl Zemma&quot; protégés (protected). Individuals
who cannot afford to pay this tax were faced with the choice of either
converting to Islam or losing their civil right to be &quot;protected&quot;,
which in some instances meant being killed. Copts, despite additional sumptuary
laws that were imposed on them in 750-868 A.D. and 905-935 A.D. under the
Abbasid Dynasties, prospered and their Church enjoyed one of its most peaceful
era. Surviving literature from monastic centers, dating back from the 8th to the
11th century, shows no drastic break in the activities of Coptic craftsmen, such
as weavers, leather-binders, painters, and wood-workers. Throughout that period,
the Coptic language remained the language of the land, and it was not until the
second half of the 11th century that the first bi-lingual <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Codex.StMark-Gospel.gif">Coptic-Arabic
liturgical manuscripts</a> started to appear. One of the first complete Arabic
texts is <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/AwlaadAlAssal.txt">the 13th
century text by Awlaad El-Assal (children of the Honey Maker)</a>, in which the
laws, cultural norms and traditions of the Copts at this pivotal time, 500 years
after the Islamic conquest of Egypt were detailed. The adoption of the Arabic
language as the language used in Egyptians' every-day's life was so slow that
even in the 15th century al-Makrizi implied that the Coptic Language was still
largely in use. Up to this day, the Coptic Language continues to be the
liturgical language of the Church.
<p>The Christian face of Egypt started to change by the beginning of the second
millennium A.D., when Copts, in addition to the <i>&quot;Gezya&quot;</i> tax, suffered
from specific disabilities, some of which were serious and interfered with their
freedom of worship. For example, there were restrictions on repairing old
Churches and building new ones, on testifying in court, on public behavior, on
adoption, on inheritance, on public religious activities, and on dress codes.
Slowly but steadily, by the end of the 12th century, the face of Egypt changed
from a predominantly Christian to a predominantly Muslim country and the Coptic
community occupied an inferior position and lived in some expectation of Muslim
hostility, which periodically flared into violence. It is remarkable that the
well-being of Copts was more or less related to the well-being of their rulers.
In particular, the Copts suffered most in those periods when Arab dynasties were
at their low.
<p>The position of the Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under
the stability and tolerance of Muhammad Ali's dynasty. The Coptic community
ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit and, by 1855 A.D.,
the main mark of Copts' inferiority, the <i>&quot;Gezya&quot;</i> tax was lifted, and
shortly thereafter Copts started to serve in the Egyptian army. The 1919 A.D.
revolution in Egypt, the first grassroots display of Egyptian identity in
centuries, stands as a witness to the homogeneity of Egypt's modern society with
both its Muslim and Coptic sects. Today, this homogeneity is what keeps the
Egyptian society united against the religious intolerance of extremist groups,
who occasionally subject the Copts to <a href="http://www.coptic.net/lessons/Persecution.txt">persecution
and terror</a>. Modern day martyrs, like <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.StMarcosKhalil.jpg">Father
Marcos Khalil</a>, serve as reminders of the miracle of Coptic survival.
<p>Despite <a href="http://www.coptic.net/lessons/Persecution.txt">persecution</a>,
the Coptic Church as a religious institution has never been controlled or
allowed itself to control the governments in Egypt. This long-held position of
the Church concerning the separation between State and Religion stems from the
words of the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.ChristTheSavior.gif">Lord
Jesus Christ </a>himself, when he asked his followers to submit to their rulers:
<i>&quot;Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things
that are God's.&quot; </i>[Mathew 22:21]. The Coptic Church has never forcefully
resisted authorities or invaders and was never allied with any powers, for the
words of the Lord Jesus Christ are clear: <i>&quot;Put your sword in its place, for all
who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;</i> (Mathew 26:52). The miraculous
survival of the Coptic Church till this day and age is a living proof of the
validity and wisdom of these teachings.
<p>Today [as of the writing of this document in 1992 A.D.], there are over 9
million Copts (out of a population of some 57 million Egyptians) who pray and
share communion in daily masses in thousands of Coptic Churches in Egypt. This
is in addition to another 1.2 million emigrant Copts who practice their faith
in <a href="http://www.coptic.net/ypages/Churches.txt">hundreds of churches in
the United States, Canada, Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Austria,
Holland, Brazil, and many other countries in Africa and Asia.</a> Inside Egypt
Copts live in every province and in no one of these provinces are they a
majority. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticSitesInEgypt.txt">Their
cultural, historical, and spiritual treasures are spread all over Egypt,</a>
even in its most remote oasis, the Kharga Oasis, deep in the western desert. As
individuals, Copts have reached prestigious academic and professional stature
all over the world. One such individual is <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/SG/sg6bio.html">Dr.
Boutros Boutros Ghali the Sixth United Nations Secretary-General (1992-1997).</a>
Another is Dr. Magdy Yacoub one of the world's most famous heart surgeons.
<p>Copts observe seven canonical sacraments: Baptism, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/lessons/Christmation.txt">Christmation
(Confirmation), </a>Eucharist, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/lessons/Confession.txt">Confession</a>
(Penance), Orders, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/prayers/Matrimony.txt">Matrimony,</a>
and <a href="http://www.coptic.net/prayers/UnctionPrayers.txt">Unction of the
sick</a>. Baptism is performed few weeks after birth by immersing the whole body
of the newborn into especially consecrated water three times. Confirmation is
performed immediately after Baptism. Regular confession with a personal priest,
called the father of confession, is necessary to receive the Eucharist. It is
customary for a whole family to pick the same priest as a father of confession,
thus, making of that priest a family counselor. Of all seven sacraments, only
Matrimony cannot be performed during a fasting season. Polygamy is illegal, even
if recognized by the civil law of the land. Divorce is not allowed except in the
case of adultery, annulment due to bigamy, or other extreme circumstances, which
must be reviewed by a special council of Bishops. Divorce can be requested by
either husband or wife. Civil divorce is not recognized by the Church. The
Coptic Orthodox Church does not have and does not mind any civil law of the land
as long as it does not interfere with the Church's sacraments. The Church does
not have (and actually refuses to canonize) an official position vis-à-vis some
controversial issues (e.g. abortion). While the church has clear teachings about
such matters (e.g. abortion interferes with God's will), it is the position of
the Church that such matters are better resolved on a case-by-case basis by the
father of confession, as opposed to having a blanket canon that makes a sin of
such practices.
<p>There are three main <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticLiturgy.txt">Liturgies
</a>in the Coptic Church: The <a href="http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html">Liturgy
according to Saint Basil, Bishop of Caesarea</a>; The Liturgy according to Saint
Gregory of Nazianzus, Bishop of Constantinople; and The Liturgy according to
Saint Cyril I, the 24th Pope of the Coptic Church. The bulk of Saint Cyril's
Liturgy is from the one that Saint Mark used (in Greek) in the first century. It
was memorized by the Bishops and priests of the church till it was translated
into the Coptic Language by Saint Cyril. Today, these three Liturgies, with some
added sections (e.g. the intercessions), are still in use; the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html">Liturgy
of Saint Basil</a> is the one most commonly used in the Coptic Orthodox Church.
<p>The worship of Saints is expressly forbidden by the Church; however, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/prayers/TheotokosIntercessions.txt">asking
for their intercessions</a> (e.g. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/sounds/Chant.PraiseOfMary.wav">Marian
Praise</a>) is central in any Coptic service. Any Coptic Church is named after a
Patron Saint. Among all Saints, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMary-1.gif">the
Virgin Saint Mary</a> <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMary-2.gif">(Theotokos)</a>
occupies a special place in the heart of all Copts. Her repeated <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.ZaytounApparition.gif">daily
appearances in a small Church in Elzaytoun district of Cairo</a> for over a
month in April of 1968 <a href="http://www.coptic.net/articles/ZaitounApparitionOfSaintMary.txt">was
witnessed by thousands of Egyptians,</a> both Copts and Muslims and was even <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.ZaytounApparitionOnTV.gif">broadcast
on International TV</a>. Copts celebrate seven major Holy feasts and seven minor
Holy feasts. The major feasts commemorate <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Annunciation-1.gif">Annunciation</a>,
<a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.HolyFamilyAndMagi.gif">Christmas</a>,
<a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Baptism.jpg">Theophany</a>, Palm
Sunday, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Resurrection.gif">Easter</a>,
<a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Fresco.Ascension.gif">Ascension</a>,
and the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Pentecost.gif">Pentecost</a>.
<a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Tableau.Nativity.gif">Christmas</a> is
celebrated on January 7th. The Coptic Church emphasizes <a href="http://www.coptic.net/lessons/ResurrectionInChristianity.txt">the
Resurrection of Christ (Easter)</a> as much as <a href="http://www.coptic.net/lessons/AdventProphesies.txt">His
Advent (Christmas),</a> if not more. Easter is usually on the second Sunday
after the first full moon in Spring. The Coptic Calendar of Martyrs is full of
other feasts usually commemorating the martyrdom of popular Saints (e.g. <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StMark-1.gif">Saint
Mark</a>, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Tableau.StMena.gif">Saint
Mina</a>, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StGeorge-1.jpg">Saint
George</a>, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.StBarbara.gif">Saint
Barbara</a>) from Coptic History.
<p>The Copts have seasons of fasting matched by no other Christian community.
Out of the 365 days of the year, Copts fast for over 210 days. During fasting, 
no animal products (meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, butter, etc.) are allowed. Moreover, no food or drink whatsoever may be taken between sunrise and sunset.
These strict fasting rules -- which have resulted in a very exquisite
<a href="http://www.DiningontheNile.com">Coptic cuisine</a> over the centuries 
-- are usually relaxed by priests on an individual basis
to accommodate for illness or weakness. Lent, known as <i>&quot;the Great
Fast&quot;</i>, is largely observed by all Copts. It starts with a pre-Lent fast of
one week, followed by a 40-day fast commemorating Christ's fasting on the
mountain, followed by the Holy week, the most sacred week (called Pascha) of the
Coptic Calendar, which climaxes with the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Crucifix-3.gif">Crucifix</a>
on Good Friday and ends with the joyous <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Resurrection.gif">Easter.</a>
Other fasting seasons of the Coptic Church include, the Advent (Fast of the
Nativity), the Fast of the Apostles, the Fast of the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Icon.Theotokos-3.gif">Virgin
Saint Mary</a>, and the Fast of Nineveh.
<p>The Coptic Orthodox Church's clergy is headed by the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.PopeShenoudaIIISeat-03.jpg">Pope
of Alexandria</a> and includes Bishops who oversee the priests ordained in their
dioceses. Both the <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.PopeShenoudaIIIAndBishopsTheophilosTadros.jpg">Pope
and the Bishops</a> must be monks; they are all members of the Coptic Orthodox
Holy Synod (Council),<a> which meets regularly to oversee matters of faith and
pastoral care of the Church. The Pope of the Coptic Church, although highly
regarded by all Copts, does not enjoy any state of supremacy or infallibility.
Today, there are over </a><a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.PopeShenoudaIIIAndSynod.jpg">60
Coptic Bishops governing dioceses inside Egypt as well as dioceses outside
Egypt,</a> such as in Jerusalem, Sudan, Western Africa, France, England, and the
United States. The direct pastoral responsibility of <a href="http://www.coptic.net/ypages/Churches.html">Coptic
congregations</a> in any of these dioceses falls on Priests, who must be married
and must attend the Catechetical School before being ordained.
<p>There are two other non-clerical bodies who participate in taking care of
Church affairs. The first is a popularly-elected 
<a href="http://www.bestavros.net/adel/publications/1975%20-%20Society%20of%20The%20Law%20of%20Oriental%20Churches%20-%20History%20of%20Lay%20Councils.pdf">Coptic Lay Council</a>, which
appeared on the stage in 1883 A.D. to act as a liaison between the Church and
the Government. The second is a joint lay-clerical committee, which appeared on
the stage in 1928 A.D. to oversee and monitor the management of the Coptic
Church's endowments in accordance with the Egyptian laws.
<p>Daily, in all Coptic Churches all over the world, <a href="http://www.coptic.net/pictures/Photo.BishopMina.jpg">Copts
pray</a> for the reunion of all Christian Churches. They pray for Egypt,
its Nile, its crops, its president, its army, its government, and above all its
people. They pray for the world's peace and for the well-being of the human
race.

<p align="center"><strong>Family</strong> <strong>APIOCERIDAE</strong></p>
<p>Apiocerids are relatively large asiloid flies normally found in arid to semi-arid areas of the globe. Some 140 extant species in 8 genera are known. Regarding fossils, only undescribed taxa of this family have been recorded in the literature. Grimaldi &amp; Engel (2005) listed two species of undescribed taxa known from compression fossils: one from the Lower Cretaceous of Baissa, Russia and the other from the Lower Cretaceous of Bon-Tsagan, Mongolia.<BR>

Ranging in length from three to twenty metres, canoes were essential for travel, transport, hunting, and trade. Different coastal communities developed distinctive styles to suit their particular needs. Each canoe is made from a single cedar log, carved and steamed into shape. Haida canoes were exquisite craft hewn from the gigantic red cedar that grows on Haida Gwaii and were highly prized by chiefs of other nations throughout the coast. The combination of beautiful lines that pleased the most demanding navigator with the fine craftsmanship and the superior quality of the cedar available on Haida Gwaii literally made Haida canoes the Cadillacs of the coast. Canoemakers in each village worked on their new craft throughout the autumn at sites where the very best red cedars stood. After an appropriate snowfall that facilitated sledding, the roughed-out canoes were moved from the woods to the nearest beach and towed to the home village, where they were finished over the winter. In the spring, lightly manned flotillas of new canoes left Skidegate Inlet, Masset and Rose Spit on the north coast, braving the seasonal storms to head for the mainland. If these vessels could withstand a crossing of the treacherous Hecate Strait, they could withstand any weather the coast could provide. At the Nass River, the canoes were traded to coastal tribes assembled to take advantage of the spring eulachon fishery. Old canoes were taken in trade by the Haida for their return journey home.

Ranging in length from three to twenty metres, canoes were essential for travel, transport, hunting, and trade. Different coastal communities developed distinctive styles to suit their particular needs. Each canoe is made from a single cedar log, carved and steamed into shape.<br /><br />Haida canoes were exquisite craft hewn from the gigantic red cedar that grows on Haida Gwaii and were highly prized by chiefs of other nations throughout the coast. The combination of beautiful lines that pleased the most demanding navigator with the fine craftsmanship and the superior quality of the cedar available on Haida Gwaii literally made Haida canoes the Cadillacs of the coast.<br /><br />Canoemakers in each village worked on their new craft throughout the autumn at sites where the very best red cedars stood. After an appropriate snowfall that facilitated sledding, the roughed-out canoes were moved from the woods to the nearest beach and towed to the home village, where they were finished over the winter. In the spring, lightly manned flotillas of new canoes left Skidegate Inlet, Masset and Rose Spit on the north coast, braving the seasonal storms to head for the mainland. If these vessels could withstand a crossing of the treacherous Hecate Strait, they could withstand any weather the coast could provide. At the Nass River, the canoes were traded to coastal tribes assembled to take advantage of the spring eulachon fishery. Old canoes were taken in trade by the Haida for their return journey home.<br /><br /></b>Text above adapted from http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/havct01e.shtml<br /><br /><p><a href="images27/canoeimg_1193.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/canoeimg_1193sm.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="666" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><b>Gelwa (Canoe)<br />Haisla</b><br /><br />Carved and painted by David Shaw and assistants, ca 1934<br />Over-painted by Bill Reid, 1967<br />Kitamaat, BC<br /><br />Red Cedar, paint<br />Gift of Major G.G.E.

Since his crest is the  Eagle, all the symbols were going to be from that culture. <br /><br />However, his father died during the making of the canoe, so he decided to make it a memorial for his father, whose crest was the Raven.

The replacement spreaders in the centre  increase in length an inch at a time as the sides flare outward. When the planned beam and form are reached, the canoe is allowed to cool.

This is generally done by driving shredded yellow-cedar bark into the crack, sewing it together with cedar withes, and then covering it with gum. When there is a knot-hole in the side of a canoe, it is filled as tight as possible with rushes, the inner bark of the spruce-tree, or cedar twigs. Then pegs made of red cedar, about 15 cm. long and pointed at. one end, are driven in from both sides until the hole is completely filled. This is an efficient temporary closing of a knot-hole. For a permanent closing, new pieces are sewed into the sides of the canoe. In caulking canoes, rotten pitch-wood is used, which is gathered in bags. This is rubbed until it becomes quite fine and sticky, and is put over the yellow-cedar bark which is inserted in cracks; or when the cracks are very narrow, the rotten wood is simply rubbed into them until they are entirely filled up. This renders the canoes perfectly water-tight.<br /><br />Text above: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Boas (1909)</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href="images27/canoefulllength.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/canoefulllengthmed.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="1000"></a></center><br clear ="all"><center><a href="images27/canoefromabove.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/canoefromabovemed.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="1000" height="247"></a></center><br clear ="all"><center><br /><br /><b>Tluu (Canoe)</b><br /><br />Photo: http://www.rrnpilot.org/items/27797</center><br clear ="all"><p><a href="images27/canoeimg_1224.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/canoeimg_1224sm.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="408" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images27/canoeend.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/canoeendsm.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="431" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Tluu (Canoe)<br /><br /></b>Full size northern style dugout canoe with a high, rectangular shaped prow and stern; prow has deep groove carved in the middle.

The 63 foot long, (19.2 metres)  seaworthy canoe was built in 1878 by the Haida, who are native to the Queen Charlotte Islands off British Columbia. Canoes were an essential part of life for the Indians of this area, and were used for traveling to ceremonies, for trade, and for war. In this display, created in 1910 by George T. Emmons, who explored the Northwest Coast for the Museum, the Indians are depicted arriving at a potlatch -- a grand ceremonial feast. The two men with long poles at the front, as well as the paddlers on the sides, are captured slaves.</p><br clear ="all"><p>The Haida Canoe was carved from a single piece of wood, the trunk of a large cedar tree. Although the trunk was only eight feet in diameter, the shipwrights softened it with boiling water and widened it to make the canoe eight-and one-half feet wide. The front of the canoe is decorated with a carving of a wolf and a painting of a killer whale. The carved decoration is more typical of the Bella Bella Indians than the Haida, and implies that the canoe was sold to a Bella Bella chief, who added his own embellishments. No matter who is responsible for its individual components, the Haida Canoe is a masterpiece of artistry and virtuoso building, and remains one of the Museum's most popular exhibits.</p><br clear ="all"><p>Photo (left):  twmnj, Jan 2, 2006, http://travel.webshots.com/photo/1534082874046209414fjYJwr<br />Photo (right): Luiyo, Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)<br />Text: Adapted from http://american.naturalhistory.museum/exhibitions/expeditions/treasure_fossil/Treasures/Haida_Canoe/canoe.html?50</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images27/haidawarcanoe3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/haidawarcanoe3sm.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="540" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />This is a superb photograph of the Haida War Canoe, which has now been suspended from the roof after refurbishment, in the  American Museum of Natural History in New York.<br /><br />Photo: &copy; 2009 RFC Graphics</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images27/haidacanoe1904.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/haidacanoe1904sm.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="463" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />One of only two surviving Haida war canoes, 17 m (56 feet) in length with a beam of nearly 2 m (6 feet).

As in the first Golden Potlatch celebration, postcards were distributed as 'Official Invitation to Seattle's Golden Potlatch'. Other postcards provided views of commercial streets in Seattle. The Klondike image of D’Oro from the first celebration was succeeded by Hyas Tyee Kopa Konoway (the Big Bug).  "The Golden Potlatch," was promoted as a 'free' feast spread for the whole world and its brother. On the water, Jean Romano's wingless hydroplane, which looked like a giant spider, thrilled spectators with a 30 M.P.H. exhibition run off Harbor Island. <br /><br />Capitalizing on Seattle's borrowed Indian heritage, city leaders cranked up the marketing machine to promote their version of Progress. Local boosters called themselves 'Tillikums',  the word for friends in Chinook jargon, and led a number of civic celebrations. The Golden Potlatch Parade provided the 'Tillikums' an opportunity to ride in decorated cars and to sponsor themed floats.  Many of these are illustrated in Kopf postcards.<br /><br />Negative Number	NA1971<br />Digital Collection:	American Indians of the Pacific Northwest Images<br />Collection:	Native American Collection no. 275<br />Repository:	University of Washington Libraries.

This drawing records this bay and some of its inhabitants. It is drawn in ink, pencil and wash and watercolours. The artist, John Webber (1751-93), accompanied Captain Cook on his third voyage of exploration in the South Seas and Pacific Ocean, which lasted for four years from 1776 to 1780. Webber was one of several artists employed to record the peoples, animals birds, fishes, plants and landscapes of the newly discovered Pacific Islands.<br /><br />The written descriptions of the location are confirmed by the drawing. It is severe and inhospitable. High cliffs, rocks that reach right down into the sea, and the jagged shore line gave it a ‘melancholy appearance’. The terrible weather, which left the trees ‘mutilated by rough gales’ contrasted greatly with the tropical scenes and palm trees enjoyed by the explorers in Tahiti.</p><br clear ="all"><p>Webber also drew the native people. Their clothing, basically the same for men as for women, consisted of a woven cloth, fastened at the shoulder or neck. According to Captain Cook, the cloth was the bark of the pine tree, beaten flat like a sort of rough felt. The head was covered with a conical hat made of matting. It is probable that Webber modified the drawing for the sake of decency and for public viewing. Cook described the men’s dress as generally bare in the ‘… Middles, nor are they ashamed to appear naked’.<br /><br />(<i>note the distinctive shape of the Nootka canoe, the harpoons resting at the prow of the canoe,  and the clothing of the people, superbly adapted for the climate and their way of life&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />Photo:  John Webber, 1778<br />Source and text: British Museum, via http://qmackie.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/webber-in-nootka-sound-1778/</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><br /><b>When James Cook first encountered the villagers at Yuquot in 1778, they directed him to "come around" (Nuu-chah-nulth nuutkaa is "to circle around") with his ship to the harbour. Cook interpreted this as the native's name for the inlet - now called Nootka Sound - which came to be applied to the inhabitants of the area. In 1978 the term Nuu-chah-nulth (nuučaan̓uł, meaning "all along the mountains") was chosen as a collective term to describe the closely related nations of western Vancouver Island. This was the culmination of the 1967 alliance forged between the various nations in order to present a unified political voice. The Makah of Washington are closely related to the Nuu-chah-nulth.<br /><br /></b>Text in paragraph above: Wikipedia<br /><br /><p><a href="images27/oceangoingnootkaboat.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/oceangoingnootkaboatsm.jpg" alt = "sealing canoe" width="494" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />The Nuu-Chah-Nulth canoe is possibly even more seaworthy than the more widely known Haida canoe (from the Queen Charlotte Islands) because the seas they faced were every bit as rough. The high upturned prow and stern of the Nuu Chah Nulth canoes are designed to enable these vessels to face forward on a beach so as to be able to back out through the breakers. Their flatter bottom allows for easy beaching and loading. But what is especially distinctive about these canoes is that their sides flare out about 30 degrees for much of their length, giving them exceptional stability as they pitch in oceanic swells.<br /><br />The coast Indians excelled in seamanship. Reports by whites aboard schooners note meeting canoes as far as 40 miles offshore, sometimes with sealskin bladders to prevent foundering. Their range was extended greatly by the use of sails. Records show that the natives used sail power from earliest contact and with the wind on their tail, accomplished some formidable journeys even by today's standards. Nootka whalers paddled to open sea in 8-man cedar canoes to harpoon grey whales, used for their oil and meat. <br /><br />Photo: unknown engraving<br />Source and text: http://www.blackfishwilderness.com/motherhistoryk.htm</p><br clear ="all"><p><a href="images27/burialcanoe.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/burialcanoesm.jpg" alt = " Burial Canoe" width="576" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Chinook burial canoe, at the mouth of the Columbia River, in an engraving made in 1839.<br /><br /> (<i> Note that this canoe could well have been made by the Chinook Nation, since they could have used the local small white cedar for such a small object.<br /><br /> However the style is of the Nootka or Nuu-Chah-Nulth type, the large canoes which they obtained by trade from the Nuu-Chah-Nulth on Vancouver Island.  &nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />Photo: from Edward Belcher's Narrative of a voyage round the world, 1843, v.1, p. 292<br /><br />Negative Number:	NA3888<br />Digital Collection:	American Indians of the Pacific Northwest Images<br />Repository:	University of Washington Libraries.

Surrounded by lush forest, it had easy access to seemingly never-ending supplies of raw material. The townsite was named after Sewell Prescott Moody, a dynamic entrepreneur originally from the United States who turned the mill into a success story. It soon became one of the biggest exporters in the new province of British Columbia, and the community achieved many firsts in the region, including the first wedding, school and electric lights. By the early 1890s, however, voracious logging and a worldwide depression had depleted its trees and fortunes. The mill closed in 1901 and the City of North Vancouver gradually absorbed the site.

Nowhere else in the world would it be likely that someone with a portable camera could have gone out in a canoe or whaling boat and taken a photograph of a whale being harpooned with a hand held and thrown harpoon. Elsewhere in the world the harpoon gun and steam powered ships had long taken over whaling&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br /></p><blockquote>Men waited for favourable weather and ocean conditions and then paddled out, eight in a canoe. They timed their departure so that they would arrive on the whaling grounds at daybreak.<br /> <br />Paddling silently, whalers studied the breathing pattern of their quarry. As the whale finished spouting and returned underwater, the leader of the hunt directed the crew to where it would next surface. There the men waited.<br /> <br />When the whale rose, the paddlers held the canoe just to its left, their speed matched to the animal's. As the back broke the surface, the harpooner struck and the crew instantly paddled backward, putting all possible distance between the canoe and the wounded prey so as to avoid the thrashing tail flukes. A hit in the shoulder blade interfered with use of the flippers and slowed the whale. Floats of sealskin blown up like huge balloons and attached to the harpoon line slowed the whale. Harpoons weren't intended to kill the whale, but to secure the sealskin floats to them until they tired themselves and could be lanced fatally. Shafts of yew wood measured 12 to 18 feet long - heavy wood to add to the harpooner's thrust and help the blade pierce deeply. Splices in the shaft deadened the springiness and furthered the penetration. They also let the shaft break rather than hit the canoe repeatedly if the whale rolled. Furthermore, they allowed a clean break rather than a splintering. This aided repair.<br /> <br />Shafts fell away once the harpoon head had been set. In a whale, the head turned partly sideways. Barbs of elk antler helped to keep it from pulling out. They fit one on each side of the blade, which was mussel shell. Spruce pitch - at Ozette still pungent after 500 years within the earth - faired and smoothed the head. Whale sinew plied into rope and bound with wild cherry bark attached the harpoon head to as much as 40 fathoms of additional rope. This line, which was of twisted cedar boughs, was carried coiled within the baskets so that it would play out easily and wouldn't entangle the canoe's occupants.<br /> <br />A telltale float at the end of the line acted as a marker so that the whalers could follow their prey, setting additional harpoons and staying out over night if need be. Eventually the time came for the final kill which was done using a special lance.<br /> <br />The next step was to tow the whale home - a distance of only a few miles if its spirit had heeded prayers to swim for the beach, perhaps 10 miles or more if not. As a precaution against the whale's sinking, a diver generally laced the mouth shut. This kept water from flooding into the stomach, weighing the carcass down and complicating the tow.<br /> <br />Songs eased the paddling. Songs welcomed the whale to the village; welcomed the returning hunters and praised the power that made it all possible.<br /> <br />The relationship between Makah and whales is very old. Ozette (<i>The Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site is the site of an archaeological excavation at Ozette on the Olympic Peninsula near La Push, Washington, USA. The site was a village occupied by the Makah people until a mudslide inundated the site around 500&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;50 BP </i>) deposits dating from 2&nbsp;000 years ago hold humpback and gray whale bones and barbs from harpoons. The relationship is also very recent. The Makah Tribe resumed whale hunting under international and domestic law, and on May 17, 1999, harvested their first whale in 70 years.<br /> </blockquote><p>Text above from http://www.makah.com/whalingtradition.html<br /> <br />Negative Number	NA740<br />Digital Collection:	American Indians of the Pacific Northwest Images<br />Collection:	Asahel Curtis Photographs of the Makah Indians.

The boat was built in the early 19th century as a dugout canoe made from a large red cedar log. <br /><br />The Tilikum was purchased for $80 in silver from a native woman (Voss describes her as a 'siwash') in a transference ceremony allegedly sealed by a bottle of rye whiskey - the name Tilikum means 'friend' in Chinook jargon. Apparently, John Voss and his companion in this venture, Norman Luxton, were inspired by the voyage of Joshua Slocum, who sailed the 37-foot (11 m) sloop Spray around the world a few years earlier and wrote a best selling book about his adventures.</p><br clear ="all"><p>Photo: unknown<br />Permission: Public Domain<br />Text: wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><p><a href="images27/tilicummap.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/tilicummapsm.jpg" alt = "sealing canoe" width="733" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />The boat was refitted - reinforced, covered and rigged with sail, 230 square feet (21 m<sup><small>2</small></sup> in total, and readied for her voyage. The Tilikum was sailed out of Oak Bay harbour on May 20, 1901, captained by Voss and mated by Luxton. After 10&nbsp;000 miles (about 16&nbsp;000 km) and five months on the Pacific Ocean, the Tilikum struck a reef and Luxton was thrown from the boat. His whole body was badly cut by coral. The boat limped into harbour at Penrhyn Island in the Cook Islands on September 2, 1901, and Luxton was forced to abandon the trip in Suva, Fiji on October 17, 1901. The Tilikum was mated by 10 more men between that time and when she finally pulled into harbour on the Thames in London, England in September, 1904.<br /><br />On 25 October 1901, after leaving Suva, the mate, binnacle and compass were lost in 'large breaking seas'. Voss was now alone without a compass, 1&nbsp;200 miles (1&nbsp;900 km) from Sydney. Tilikum is claimed to be the smallest deep-water ship to have ever entered Sydney Harbour until this time.<br /><br />Tilikum arrived in Melbourne on 13 March 1902 and was exhibited in full rig in Collins Street. She was moved to another vantage point at the Exhibition Buildings, but during loading onto a 'wagon', the hook broke and she was damaged, with splits appearing in five different places. Voss repaired it himself using thin steel ribs.<br /><br />She was then sailed on Lake Wendouree, Ballarat, and presented with a new set of sails by local yachtsmen, before travelling to Geelong to be returned to the sea.Voss was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London after lecturing in Britain about the voyage.</p><br clear ="all"><p>Captain John Voss published his sailing memoir as 'The Venturesome Voyages of Captain Voss' in 1913. The Tilikum was placed on display in London and changed hands a number of times, losing her bowsprit and masts over time. In 1929, the Furness Shipping Line returned Tillikum to Victoria, British Columbia. She underwent restoration beginning in 1936 by the Thermopylae Club before she was moved into the Maritime Museum in 1965 and has remained on display there since.<br /><br />Photo: Sardon<br />Permission: Public Domain<br />Text: wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images27/vossincockpit.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/vossincockpitsm.jpg" alt = "Voss at Port Apia" width="441" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />The 'Tilikum' at anchor, Port Apia, Samoa, October 1901. <br /><br />Voss standing, Luxton sitting. <br /><br />Photo:  Major James Skitt Matthews (1878-1970)<br />Source: http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/sailed-canoe-tilikum-at-anchor;rad<br />Permission: Public Domain</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images27/tilikumondisplay.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/tilikumondisplaysm.jpg" alt = "Tilikum canoe" width="590" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Cedar dugout canoe 'Tilikum' on display at Totem Park<br /><br />The photo was taken sometime between 1940 and 1948.<br /><br />Photo:  Major James Skitt Matthews (1878-1970)<br />Source: http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/cedar-dugout-canoe-tilikum-on-display-at-totem-park-2;rad<br />Permission: Public Domain</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><center><a href="images27/sturgeoncanoeimg_1315.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/sturgeoncanoeimg_1315med.jpg" alt = "sturgeon canoe" width="1000" height="377"></a></center><br clear ="all"><center><a href="images27/sturgeoncanoeimg_1316.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/sturgeoncanoeimg_1316med.jpg" alt = "sturgeon canoe" width="1000" height="321"></a></center><br clear ="all"><center><b><big>Ktunaxa - Sturgeon-nosed Canoe<br /></big></b><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2012<br />Source: Display, Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia </center><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images27/sturgeoncanoeinsideimg_1317.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/sturgeoncanoeinsideimg_1317sm.jpg" alt = "sealing canoe" width="490" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images27/sturgeoncanoeimg_1318.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/sturgeoncanoeimg_1318sm.jpg" alt = "sealing canoe" width="400" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Ktunaxa people have inhabited the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers and the Arrow Lakes region of British Columbia for more than ten thousand years.

The unique flat bottom design tapers on both ends resulting in a streamline shape that cuts easily through the water. Sturgeon-nosed canoes were traditionally made from birch bark, western white pine bark, cedar wood and roots, maple sap and pitch. The light construction made for easy transport on lakes and marshy wetlands. Cedar strips sewn together with sinew or hide strips would be placed on the bottom of the canoe for the area where the paddler sits; the canoes were not normally constructed with seats as the paddler knelt directly on a cedar mat at the bottom of the boat, his feet under him and his knees spread hard against the sides. Normally the thwart would have an O ring to hold the paddle when not in use. Today, sturgeon-nosed canoes are made primarily by the Yaqan Nukiy people (also known as the Lower Kootenay Indian Band).<br /><br />The canoe hull has a  long, pointed bow and stern, creating a sharp angle back up to the top rim (gunwale). Black painted canvas over rib and slat wood frame. Nails along inner top gunwale, metal wire at each end. Bark and cloth lashings used on frame.

The original covering of the canoe was said to have been bark from the wild cherry tree (prunus emarginata), sewn together. The bark was replaced with canvas at some point, and the frame work is all original.<br /><br />Collected in Creston, British Columbia, Canada during 1950<br />Received from James Dunn (Donor) on August 9, 1972<br />Identification Number: Nd714<br />bark, cotton fibre, paint and metal<br />Height 40 cm, beam 70 cm, length 490 cm<br />Case 031<br />Accession number: 207/1<br /><br />Photo and text: http://www.rrnpilot.org/items/21813</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />Scottish botanist David Douglas, the first scientific traveller to visit the Arrow Lakes wrote about the Sinixt People his 1827 journal: "The canoes of the natives here are different in form from any I have seen before … The under part is made of the fine bark of Pine (<i>Pinus canadensis</i>) and about one foot from the gunwale of birch-bark, sewed with the roots of Cedar (<i>Thuya</i>) and the seams neatly gummed with resin from the pine. They are 10 to 14 ft long, terminating at both ends sharply and bent inwards so much at the mouth that a man of middle size has some difficulty in placing himself in them. One that will carry six persons and their provisions may be carried on the shoulder with little trouble.<br /><br />The Sturgeon-nosed Canoe was designed with a reversed prow to be most suitable for travel through bulrushes, and manoeuverable in turbulent waters. <br /><br />Author Eileen Delehanty Pearkes records in her book about the Sinixt, 'The Geography of Memory' that ethnographer William Elmendorf recorded the process of making a Sturgeon-nosed Canoe based on a description by Sinixt Nation elder Nancy Wynecoop: <br /><br /><blockquote>The mature tree must be felled in spring, when the sap is running. The outer bark is scraped off, then the inner bark is split and peeled off the heartwood in one sheet. The outside shape of the canoe is marked on the ground with stakes. Poles used for the gunwales are fastened to these stakes. Next, willow ribs are fastened to the gunwales, using willow bark twine. The bark is then sewn onto the ribs, using cedar root. An additional layer of bark is fastened less securely on to the outer side of the craft. All seams are glues with warm pine pitch. On the bow and stern of the canoe, the bark is folded over rings of willow. Extra layers are added for strength, shaped into a point, and sewn. A frame of woven poles is placed in the bottom of the canoe and covered with loose grass to sit on. </blockquote><br /><br />Elmendorf also refers to a ceremony, including dancing, fasting and sweatbathing, held by Sinixt men prior to the building of a new canoe. The purpose of the ceremony was to make the group 'more agreeable with each other and focus their energy'.<br /><br />The 'Sturgeon-nose' design is unique to North American canoes, but craft of similar design were discovered in the Amur River region of Siberia in the mid-19th century.<br /><br />Text above: Wikipedia<br /><br /><p><a href="images27/sturgeoncanoeoriginal.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/sturgeoncanoeoriginalsm.jpg" alt = "model canoe" width="474" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />This is a model canoe of the Ktunaxa culture, collected in 1920.

The old suspension bridge that connected the two communities is in the background. <br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><p>A description of the use of these canoes by the Bella Coola First Nations:<br /><br />The crew take their places at equal intervals between, each ready to work on the opposite side from the man in front. Each is provided with a ten-foot pole and also a paddle for use in spots where the river is too deep for poling. The rivers of central British Columbia are shallow, but swift, and their navigation requires considerable skill. Going upstream, the captain constantly seeks the smoothest water, where he knows the current will be least strong, and uses his pole to keep the craft headed in the right direction. Should it be caught in a violent eddy, he exerts his full strength, and it is his voice that rallies the crew for a final exertion to shove the canoe through. Coming downstream is more dangerous though less wearying. The water is so cold and the current so swift that a capsizing usually causes the drowning of one or more of the occupants, and the captain must never relax. Spoon canoes are very stable, and cannot be upset by a faulty distribution of weight. This is essential in view of the rapids, but they are heavy and cumbersome, unsuited to carrying large loads. <br /><br />When a carpenter wishes to make a canoe, he fells a cedar of suitable size and trims off bark and branches to leave the central stem available. Slowly and laboriously he chips with his adze until he has hollowed out the trunk to the proper shape, and at the same time has smoothed away the outer surface. Sometimes a small fire is built on the trunk so that it will char the wood beneath and make it easier to remove, but the carpenter must be careful that the flames do not spread too far. Finally, as his work reaches completion, he becomes even more painstaking than before. The sides and bottom are whittled to a thickness of no more than three inches, and at this stage a faulty stroke may pierce the shell and ruin the toil of weeks.<br /><br /> When completed, it is necessary to widen and harden the canoe.  A fire is built beside it and stones thrown into the flames to heat; then lifted out and dropped into the water with which the craft has been partly filled. Steam rises, and the carpenter confines it by covering the canoe with matting, at the same time endeavouring to pull and force the sides apart. Sometimes he can do so by mere muscular effort, more often it is necessary to lay transverse thwarts within and, by pounding them downwards, extend the sides. No great extension is possible, nor is it required, but the steaming process is considered to harden the wood as well as widen the canoe.<br /><br /> 	Photo: Cliff Kopas, 1933-1956<br />Accession#:	2002.002.017P<br />Source: Bella Coola Valley Museum BC Central Coast Archives, http://www.bellacoolamuseum.ca/en/photo_detail.php?id=178<br />Text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">McIlwraith (1992)</span></a></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images27/eulachonspooncanoe2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/eulachonspooncanoe2sm.jpg" alt = "bella coola river canoe" width="388" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Spoon canoe, with eulachon, taken on the Bella Coola River. <br /><br />Photo: Iver Fougner<br />Source: British Columbia Central Coast Archives, via  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Moody (2008)</span></a></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images27/stringingfish.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images27/stringingfishsm.jpg" alt = "Pacific North West" width="397" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Stringing eulachons.

The name 'candlefish' derives from the fact that it is so fat during spawning, with up to 15% of total body weight in fat, that if caught, dried, and strung on a wick, it can be burned as a candle. This is the name most often used by early explorers. The name eulachon (occasionally seen as oolichan, oulachon, and uthlecan) is from the Chinookan language and the Chinook jargon based on that language. <br /><br />Photo: C.

And yet the Haidas were able before the advent of the white men to turn out their canoes as perfectly with their stone tools as they do now with steel.'<br /><br />  David writes:<br /><br /> The sketch of the Haida Canoe was worked up from old photocopies in my old design files, doubled and married into full-hull underbodies with the computer.  With the large original size and finer drafting lines, the canoe unfortunately does not take kindly to re-sizing, losing both sharpness and detail.  However, a fair approximation can be seen to compare the hull lines.  </p><br clear ="all"><p>Left to right: The 1845, 50 metre Rainbow – considered by historian Howard Chapelle as the first American clipper ship, the Rainbow achieved fame for her fast passages.  Fast passage speeds  were obtained by her sharp entry and tapered fish-like torpedo shape - with the main beam well forward and her afterbody greatly tapered.<br /><br /> The 2007 Saaduuts-carved Haida Canoe was built to the traditional design.  In some ways the high prow Haida designs are quite reminiscent of traditional Japanese small craft. <br /><br />The 1902, 145 metre seven-masted schooner Thomas W. Lawson was arguably the world’s first 'Supertanker'.   Designed for sheer cargo capacity, the Lawson was basically a tapered, wall-sided barge with sails: A true whale of a ship and a terrible sailer, the schooner was a disappointment to her designer (B.B. Crowninshield – a man renowned for his sleek yachts).  Photographs of the great slab-sided ship under full sail and in ballast are awe inspiring - even today. <!-- (NLA even has several in their on-line archives if I remember correctly…) --> <br /><br />The 1902, 147 metre, five-masted nitrate carrier Preussen.  A fast sailer and an able ship, the Preussen marked the apex of giant, sail-powered cargo carrier design and technology. One of the last of the great iron ships sailing under canvas, not surprisingly, the Preussen’s design served as the basis for the present day five-masted cruise ship, the 'Royal Clipper',  launched in 2007. <br /><br />Photo and text: &copy; 2008 D.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 43 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/canoesnwc.html responseCode 3 200

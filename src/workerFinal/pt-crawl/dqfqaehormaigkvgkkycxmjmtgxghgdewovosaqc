            <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">I just thought 
              I'd share one of my experiences with taking in older, completely 
              untamed iguanas, as it touches upon several subjects that come up 
              regularly on the IML: taming older iguanas, and iguana longevity.</font> 
            </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">About 5-6 years ago, 
              I took in a completely untamed 6 year old male, Godzilla. After 
              repeatedly biting his owners, they stuck him in the garage for a 
              year or so before finally deciding find someone to take him.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">When they brought him to 
        me, he was about the size of a 1-2 year old iguana, had been fed mostly 
        on monkey biscuits and lettuce through the years, and had never, ever 
        had his claws trimmed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">&lt;sigh&gt;</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">I reached into the Vari-Kennel 
        carrier they brought him in and took him out, and went through the usual 
        5 minutes or so of thrashing and gaping and hissing (well, he did - I 
        just sorta stood there, holding him, letting him do it) before he calmed 
        enough for me to clip his claws. His owners stood there, amazed: they 
        had never seen him so calm, let alone anyone ever attempt to clip his 
        claws.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Fast forward one year.</font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Zilla tamed up beautifully 
        - so much so that he started going to schools and education events. He 
        did lose part of his tail at one such event - I had taken one of our volunteers, 
        a young man with a broken ankle, off to the food booths to get some lunch. 
        While I was gone, the volunteer holding Zilla got too close (for Zilla) 
        to the volunteer who was holding the first 4 feet or so of my ultra-tame 
        Burmese python. Apparently, Zilla struggled to get away and either dropped 
        his tail or the volunteer holding him inadvertently stepped on it during 
        the struggle. It did make for, uhm, an educational moment for the general 
        public who was crowded around at the time, as another volunteer jumped 
        in and started talking about autotomy, predator perception, etc. Both 
        the volunteers collapsed in my arms when I returned; Zilla just gave me 
        the Stink Eye.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Zilla thrived on good 
        food and lots of room to roam, doubled in size, and hit breeding season, 
        becoming burnished with gold and orange. He stayed sweet to me and got 
        along well with most of the other igs. But I had too many igs, the flood 
        of incoming never stopping, so I decided he was ready to go to a good 
        home.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">About that time I was 
        contacted by a fellow who was blind, married to a woman who is visually 
        impaired. We talked and wrote for a long time, and decided to meet. I 
        figured if it was going to work, it would work with Zilla, but we all 
        wanted to see how it would go. We met and spent several hours together, 
        during which time they handled Zilla, even learned how to clip his claws. 
        Zilla did marvelously well with them, his bright colors and relaxed posture 
        testifying to his comfort, in stark contract to his meeting with another 
        man who wanted to adopt him about the same time. (During that 3 hour encounter, 
        Zilla went from happy colors in my arms to total dark brown within just 
        a few moments in his arms, back to happy colors in mine.) Zilla's colors 
        never wavered when he was with this husband-and-wife. After they went 
        home and discussed it at length, and a few more phone conversations and 
        more email, Zilla moved to Central California via overnight Express Mail.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Fast forward to today.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Zilla is 12 years old, 
        ruler (or so he thinks) of the house that includes cats, a guide dog (whom 
        he still doesn't care for), snakes, a bearded dragon and blue-tongue skink 
        as well as two doting humans. While his early care has stunted him, he 
        has continued to grow in the years since he left me (yes, they feed the 
        &quot;MK diet&quot; ;), now more than double the size (mass) he was when 
        he came to me. He goes to schools and herp events, helping to educate 
        the public about iguanas and why they aren't the best pet for everyone, 
        thrives in his daily routine, and really likes the caretaker who comes 
        in when his &quot;folks&quot; are out of town.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">I sometimes regret having 
        adopted out many of the very personable of the healthier igs that have 
        come to me through the years. I made it a point to adopt out the ones 
        I figured had the *least* chance of dying young from animal-protein related 
        kidney failure or effects of their horrendous early care, keeping the 
        &quot;time-bomb&quot; iguanas here with me, figuring that they've been 
        through and will go through enough stress in their lives as it is, without 
        my adding more by sending them to new homes and people. So, I miss growing 
        older with igs like Zilla, making it doubly nice to hear about them from 
        time to time and see pictures of them as they continue to grow and interact 
        with their humans.</font></p>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 530]]</font> I very much regret to learn that my friend Prof. Flower thinks I have done great
injustice to the British Museum of Natural History in my article on &quot;American Museums,&quot; which
has appeared in the September number of the <em>Fortnightly Review</em>. The article was sent to
England last February, and I had no opportunity of correcting the proofs, as some very bad
misprints will sufficiently indicate. Nothing was farther from my mind than to make any
reflections on the management or arrangement of the Museum by <font color="990000">[[p. 531]]</font> Prof. Flower and the
able heads of departments, for all of whom I have the greatest respect; and I am further
convinced that much credit is due to them for doing the very utmost that is possible under the
circumstances of the case. My strictures on the Museum were intended to apply solely and
exclusively to the fundamental <em>principle</em> underlying its arrangement, which principle is embodied
in the new building as in the old one. I contrasted strongly the principle of moderate-sized rooms
as compared with large galleries,--the principle of exhibiting, to the public, on the one hand,
strictly limited typical collections; on the other, almost complete series of species,--the principle
of making a geographical arrangement the main feature of a museum, as compared with that in
which almost no provision at all is made for such an arrangement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had always understood that for this fundamental system of arrangement neither the present
Director nor the heads of departments of the Museum were in any way responsible, and that in
criticising it frankly I should not be considered to reflect on them. So clear was I in my own mind
that I was discussing this general system only, that I used some expressions which I now see,
with much regret, were capable of being misunderstood. After referring to some of the
improvements in the New British Museum, I say, &quot;but the great bulk of the collection still
consists of old specimens exhibited in the old way in an interminable series of overcrowded wall-cases, while all attempt at any effective presentation of the various aspects and problems of
natural history as now understood is as far off as ever.&quot; To the latter part of this sentence, Prof.
Flower objects, as not recognizing the many improvements recently made and still making; but I
intended it to apply, as I think the whole context of my article shows, to the <em>system</em> and the
<em>building</em>, which themselves, from the point of view I have taken throughout the article, render
any attempt at an &quot;effective&quot; presentation of these aspects and problems impossible. Again, at the
end of my article I speak of Prof. Agassiz having said that he intended his museum &quot;to illustrate
the history of creation as far as the present state of scientific knowledge reveals that history,&quot; and
then go on: &quot;It is surely an anomaly that the naturalist who was most opposed to the theory of
evolution should be the first to arrange his museum in such a way as best to illustrate that theory,
while in the land of Darwin no step has been taken to escape from the monotonous routine of one
great systematic series of crowded specimens arranged in lofty halls and palatial galleries, which
may excite wonder, but which are calculated to teach no definite lesson.&quot; Here I was referring to
the fact that the new Museum at South Kensington was constructed and arranged substantially on
the same lines as the old one at Bloomsbury, and regretting that the only effective step towards
inaugurating a new system of arrangement was not then taken. Prof. Flower, I find, thinks that I
imply that no steps are being taken now to render the Museum more instructive and generally
interesting. This was very far from my meaning, and I am exceedingly sorry that such an
interpretation of my words should have been possible. I visited the Museum several times last
summer before leaving for America, and I noted many improvements that were being introduced
in all departments; but I could not fail to see that the main principle of the arrangement, both of
the building itself and of the collections in it, had not been changed, and it was to this that all my
criticisms were directed.</p>

</p><p><font color="990000">[[p. 740]]</font> To the Editor of the <em>Fortnightly Review</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,--I regret to learn that my article on &quot;American Museums,&quot; which appeared in the
September issue of the Fortnightly Review, has been supposed to reflect unfairly on the Director
and heads of departments of the British Museum of Natural History. I therefore beg leave to add
a few words of explanation. Every reference that I made to the British Museum was intended to
apply exclusively to the fundamental principles which have always governed its arrangement,
and which is embodied in the new building at South Kensington as distinctly as in the old one at
Bloomsbury. I contrasted, as strongly as I could, the principle of numerous moderate-sized rooms
as compared with that of a few extensive galleries--the principle of exhibiting to the public
carefully chosen and strictly limited typical collections only as opposed to that of making public
exhibition of enormous series of closely-allied species--the principle of making a geographical
arrangement a main feature of the Museum as compared with that in which almost no provision
at all is made for such an arrangement. The former set of principles, which are carried out at the
Museum of comparative Zoology at Harvard University, I hold to be greatly superior in every
way, and I regretted that on the erection of a new building at South Kensington provision was not
made for carrying out some such arrangement. Believing it to be generally known that the present
Director and heads of departments are not responsible for the system, but have to make the best
of it under considerable difficulties, I did not think it necessary to say explicitly that my remarks
had no application to them, I therefore now wish to state my belief that they have already made
considerable improvement in the methods of arrangement and illustration, and will, have no
doubt, succeed in rendering the Museum as interesting to the public and useful to naturalists as it
can be made under the existing system.</p>

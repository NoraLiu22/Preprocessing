/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 3]]</font> As there seems 
          to be considerable difference of opinion on this question, and as success 
          or failure in the first steps towards obtaining free access to land 
          for all who desire it is a matter of vital importance for the progress 
          of our cause, I think it will be useful to set forth for the consideration 
          of Land-nationalisers what seem to me to be the principles which should 
          guide us in this matter. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I begin with the proposition, which will probably 
          be generally accepted, that the primary object of giving the people 
          free access to land is, to enable as many as possible to obtain either 
          the whole or a portion of their living by its cultivation, and, by thus 
          withdrawing some of them altogether from competition with wage-earners, 
          and by giving others a temporary alternative to wage labor, to raise 
          the rate of wages of the less remunerative kinds of work all over the 
          country. And as secondary benefits resulting from this, we shall have, 
          in the first place, an enormous increase in the production of food, 
          displacing much that is now imported from abroad; secondly, an increased 
          consumption of manufactured goods by these self-supporting workers; 
          thirdly, a diminution in the poors' rate from the disappearance of paupers 
          and out-of-works; and, lastly, a public revenue arising from the continuous 
          increase in the value of land owing to the growth and increased well-being 
          of the population. These various benefits I conceive to be important, 
          somewhat in the order in which I have given them; at all events the 
          first is undoubtedly the most important, while the last--the money profit-is 
          the least important. It is a valuable incidental result, but is not 
          to be sought after as one of the chief ends in itself to the diminution 
          of the other kinds of benefit.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in order that the various good results above 
          enumerated shall be, in their due order, most certainly obtained, it 
          is of the highest importance that the workers who gain access to the 
          soil shall be able, not only to live upon it, but to live well and thrive 
          upon it. We do not want them merely to earn a living as long as they 
          can work, and go to the poor-house in their old age or during sickness; 
          neither do we want them to be ruined by the first bad season, or by 
          any of the chances and misfortunes to which Agriculture is especially 
          liable. On the contrary, it is of the highest importance to the whole 
          community that the land-cultivators should be in such a position that 
          even in bad years they should not lose, while in average years they 
          should obtain such profits, that, either by increase of the size of 
          their holding or the amount of their stock, their condition should steadily 
          improve, and thus insure them against poverty in old age. If land-nationalisation 
          is to be the success we hope it will be, some such result as this must 
          be aimed at, and we must be sure that we do nothing to prevent its attainment.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to bring about this result two things are 
          especially required,--first, a certain amount of knowledge, of experience, 
          of prudence, and of industry in those who first obtain small holdings; 
          in the second place, such very moderate rents and such favorable conditions 
          of tenure as to give them not only a chance but almost a certainty of 
          success. Nothing, in my opinion, is more likely to bring about the failure 
          of the first, and therefore the most important experiments, than the 
          methods usually suggested by politicians, and more or less implied in 
          the various Acts of Parliament, whether already passed or proposed, 
          dealing with this matter. It is, for example, almost always proposed 
          or taken for granted, that before the men can have the land a large 
          cost must be incurred in preparing it for them. We hear of road-making, 
          fencing, draining, and house-building, as if these were absolutely necessities; 
          and in addition to all this, it is generally thought that it will be 
          necessary to advance capital to the proposed tenants to enable them 
          to stock and crop their holdings, and support themselves till they get 
          a return from the land. Now I can hardly imagine a more certain way 
          of bringing discredit on the whole system of small holdings--and with 
          it of land-nationalisation--than such a method. In the first place, 
          this work of &quot;laying out&quot; and &quot;improvement,&quot; when it is not done by 
          the occupiers themselves, but for them, by persons who have no interest 
          in doing the work economically but often the reverse, and who have besides 
          no personal knowledge of what these small cultivators really require, 
          will often be unnecessary work and will always be done in an unnecessarily 
          costly way, and will thus add to the rent of the land, without proportionately 
          increasing its value. Then again, the advance of money on loan to men 
          who have never, perhaps, had ten pounds to spend at once in their lives, 
          will in many cases lead to its injudicious expenditure, and be antagonistic 
          to that prudence, thrift, and industry, which are vital to success.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is yet another, and a very important objection 
          to such methods as these. All this expenditure of public money by other 
          people than those who are to directly benefit by it, will certainly 
          lead to wastefulness and jobbery, since they constitute that very &quot;management 
          of land by public officials,&quot; the evils of which form one of the chief 
          objections to land-nationalisation, and which all our proposals and 
          methods have been calculated to avoid. We must therefore never cease 
          to urge that such management is not only unnecessary, but is calculated 
          to defeat the very purpose for which free access to land is required.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we consult the reports of the various Royal Commissions 
          on Agriculture we shall find numerous cases of laborers, miners, mechanics, 
          and others, who have become successful cultivators of small holdings 
          and sometimes of considerable farms, often having begun with a lease 
          of waste land which they enclosed, improved, and built houses on, entirely 
          on their own resources and through their own industry; and whenever 
          we find a successful small farmer he has usually worked his way up in 
          some such way. It is an extraordinary thing that whenever it is proposed 
          to allow men to obtain small holdings in England, there is always this 
          talk of &quot;improvements&quot; and &quot;house-building,&quot; in addition to giving the 
          land at a fair rent and on a secure tenure; while over a large part 
          of Scotland and Ireland all improvements and all buildings have been 
          done by the tenants themselves, with no security of tenure whatever, 
          so that whenever a misfortune prevents payment of rent--usually rent 
          on the tenants' own improvements--the landlord ejects the poor tenant 
          and confiscates his improvements. The Irish cottar and the Highland 
          crofter ask nothing better than a sufficiency of land at a moderate 
          rent and on a secure tenure. All the perennial misery and often-recurring 
          famine of these two countries have arisen from a denial of this very 
          moderate instalment of bare justice; and if we give this easy access 
          to the land to our English workers, they too will ask for nothing else, 
          and will be far more likely to succeed without any attempt to do for 
          them what they will do much better and more economically themselves. 
          But we do undoubtedly require some process of selection of the best 
          men for this great experiment in the regeneration of our country; and 
          the natural, self-acting, and therefore best mode of selection, will 
          arise from the fact that no man can take a holding unless he has saved 
          money to stock and crop it, or has such a character for industry, sobriety, 
          and capacity as to induce some friend to advance him the money; while 
          the certainty that he is risking the loss of his own savings if he fail, 
          will be the best guarantee that he will have some amount of intelligence 
          and some agricultural experience. No artificial mode of selection will 
          compare with this. A man may get testimonials to character, but no testimonials 
          can show that he will spend borrowed money prudently, or be able to 
          make a profit on land burdened with unnecessary and costly improvements, 
          which, for his purpose, will often be no improvements at all.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the second great essential 
          of success, which is, the rental to be paid for the land and the conditions 
          of tenure. Many of our fellow-workers maintain that the competition-rent 
          offered for land is the best, and in fact the only certain way, of determining 
          its value, and therefore what should be paid for it. From a landlord's 
          or speculator's point of view--considering the money income to be got 
          from the land to be everything, the well-being of the tenants nothing--this 
          is <font color="990000">[[p. 4]]</font> undoubtedly the case; but, from 
          our point of view--looking at the cultivation of the land as leading 
          primarily to the well-being and progressive advancement of the cultivator, 
          and through him the similar advancement of all other manual laborers--it 
          seems to me to be the very worst mode possible. Let us therefore consider 
          it a little in detail. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the present time, wherever there are allotments 
          to let, there we find it to be the rule that agricultural laborers do 
          most willingly hire them at a rental per acre, sometimes double, sometimes 
          four or five times as much as is paid by Farmers for the same quality 
          of land, and there can be no doubt that if arable land were now offered 
          for allotments and small holdings almost anywhere in England, and the 
          quantity thus offered was not in excess of the demand at the time, it 
          would, if let by auction, realise somewhat similar rentals. Many agricultural 
          laborers, as well as village tradesmen and mechanics, find it advantageous 
          to them to have land even at these high rents, and there is sufficient 
          land thus held all over the country to afford a guide to the prices 
          at which such land would let by auction, even in quantities of from 
          one to five acres. Now the reason such high rents have been, and are 
          paid, is, simply, that the laborers' wages have been always so low and 
          his condition so miserable, that anything by which he could add two 
          or three shillings a week to his earnings by means of overtime work 
          and the assistance of his wife and family, was eagerly accepted. It 
          was his low standard of living that rendered him willing to pay a rent 
          which left him some little profit on his labor; and if he were now offered 
          a small holding on which to live he would be willing (if he could not 
          get it cheaper), to pay a rent which would enable him to live in about 
          the same way as he had hitherto done, but with the chance of occasional 
          better luck and with the satisfaction of being his own master. We see 
          this result very prevalent on the continent, especially in Belgium and 
          in parts of France, where the price of land, and consequently its rental, 
          is very much higher than with us, and as a consequence the small holders 
          often work harder and live as near the starvation line as our poorly 
          paid agricultural laborers or our rack rented Irish cottars. It will 
          be said, no doubt, that this arises from the demand for land being greater 
          than the supply, and that if the land were offered in larger quantities, 
          competition would be less keen and prices lower. But is it at all likely 
          that for a long time the supply of land will be greater than the demand, 
          except quite locally, and temporarily? Is it not, on the contrary, almost 
          certain that the demand will, at first and for a long time to come, 
          perhaps always, be greater than the supply? Is it not our contention 
          that the depression of agriculture and the deplorable condition of so 
          many of our workers is due to the denial of access to land, and that 
          when that access is freely given it will bring about the well-being, 
          first of those who cultivate it, and afterwards of all other wage-earners? 
          There will therefore be a constant and ever increasing demand for land; 
          but unless we take care that those who apply for it have it on such 
          terms that they can not only make a good living from it, but also provide 
          for a comfortable old age, the benefits we anticipate will not arise. 
          It is to avoid any such failure, to prevent the recurrence of the miserable 
          spectacle of men being ejected from their holdings for non-payment of 
          rent, to secure for them something better than a struggle ending in 
          dependence on charity in old age, that I urge the fixing of rents by 
          valuation, taking always the amount paid by prosperous farmers in the 
          same district, rather than that of allotment-holders, as the standard 
          of value. The land when purchased by the local authorities, will be 
          purchased at the farm value, and it can be let at that value at first 
          without loss to the community.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above sketch of the reasons why I object to 
          the system of competition-rents sufficiently exhibits the principle 
          on which, in my opinion, our dealings with the land should be founded. 
          But there is also a practical objection to that system--that it would 
          be very unequal in its results, and also that it can hardly be carried 
          out unless based on a preliminary valuation. I presume the advocates 
          of competition rents do not propose that land should always be let to 
          the highest bidder, without any reserve whatever. For, if so, whenever 
          the intending tenants were less numerous than the lots to be offered, 
          these lots might be let at much less than agricultural rents. No doubt 
          it will be said there must be a reserved price for each lot, or group 
          of lots of the same kind of land; but such a reserve cannot be fixed 
          without a careful valuation by an expert; so that we should require 
          two processes, both involving some expense, first the valuation, then 
          the auction. The result would be, that in some cases, where there happened 
          to be little competition, the land would be let at the reserved rent, 
          while in other cases--perhaps a few months later, and in the same place--similar 
          land would be run up by competition to much higher rents; and this would 
          inevitably lead to dissatisfaction, and inequality in the prosperity 
          of the tenants,--a dissatisfaction which would compel the authorities 
          to adopt the plan of letting all land at the reserved rent, that is 
          at that fair but low rent which should have been adopted at first.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I maintain, therefore, that it is essential to adopt 
          from the first the only just and equable method, which is, the valuation 
          of the lots by an expert, founded on what would be fair rents of similar 
          land to a large tenant farmer. These lots, with the rents thus determined, 
          would then be open to selection, either on the system of &quot;first come 
          first served,&quot; or if thought fairer, of a ballot for the order of choice 
          on certain fixed days. By either of these two methods, supposing the 
          valuation to be fairly made, there would be no inequality of opportunities, 
          no feeling that either by chance or through any other cause, some of 
          the tenants were paying higher rents than others.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point of some importance is, that men should 
          be allowed to have as much land as they wished, up to a certain limit--say 
          five or ten acres according to circumstances; and also that the land 
          first let should always be that abutting upon roads or lanes, the inner 
          portion of the farms thus let being reserved for some years, so that 
          any man wishing to add to his holding could have it extended by taking 
          a plot or field behind it, thus avoiding the great inconvenience and 
          loss arising from the separation of plots under one holding. In the 
          meantime this central portion of the farm could be let by the year to 
          any adjacent farmer.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other point arises in connection with this question, 
          the vital importance of <i>security</i> to the occupier and cultivator 
          of land. We want men to be able to form and keep a home; to be practically 
          as secure in that home, so long as they pay the moderate ground-rent 
          for the land, as if they were the actual owners of the freehold, subject 
          only to the payment of taxes. We want the new tenants under land nationalisation 
          to be really free holders in the old sense--free men holding land from 
          the community never to be interfered with so long as they continued 
          to pay the moderate dues and to be law-abiding citizens. To give this 
          full security all the rights of bequest or sale now appertaining to 
          freehold land should appertain to these state tenancies.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, I believe, only by some such process as that 
          which I have here indicated that we can possibly obtain the full benefit 
          of land nationalisation or of the first steps which we may be able to 
          make towards it. We must always remember that the community will be 
          benefited just in proportion to the well-being of the cultivators and 
          of those who obtain access to land. If we rack-rent them so that they 
          just make a living out of the land, they will have little influence 
          in raising the wages of other workers or in enabling them to make a 
          successful bargain with capitalist employers. But if, on the other hand, 
          we allow all occupiers of land to have it on such terms and conditions 
          that they are able to make a good living, provide well for their families, 
          and enjoy an old age of secure repose in their own homesteads, this 
          state of well-being will serve to establish a standard of living which 
          will react on the whole working population, and lead to a corresponding 
          rise in the rate of wages throughout the whole industrial world. There 
          appears to me to be no proposition in the domain of political and social 
          science more certain than this. On the other hand, no mistake can be 
          more fatal than to think that the community would be benefited by screwing 
          from 20 to 50 per cent. more rental from the occupiers of land, thus 
          reducing their profits, rendering their position less secure, and lowering 
          their standard of living, and with it that of the whole working population.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, therefore, I would, urge most strongly, 
          that in all our arrangements or proposals with regard to the land, we 
          should throw aside altogether the idea of getting the highest possible 
          rents, but should always aim at the maximum of well-being for the cultivators. 
          By thus acting we shall best secure the equal well-being of the whole 
          of the industrial community, and shall initiate that progressive improvement, 
          with the diminution and ultimate abolition both of enforced idleness 
          and of undeserved poverty, which is the whole aim and object of land 
          nationalisation.</p>

<title>What is monophony, polyphony, homophony, monody etc.?</title>
</head><body>

<h2>What is monophony, polyphony, homophony, monody etc.?</h2>

<p>The terms <i>monophony</i> and <i>polyphony</i> have very
straight-forward literal meanings.  <strong>Monophony</strong>
means music with a single &quot;part&quot; and a &quot;part&quot;
typically means a single vocal melody, but it could mean a single
melody on an instrument of one kind or another.  <strong>Polyphony</strong>
means music with more than one part, and so this indicates simultaneous
notes.</p>

<p>In practice, these simple definitions can be blurred by various
performance techniques or refined by other terms.  The principal
example of <i>monophony</i> is
<a href="../beginlst/chant.htm">plainchant</a>, with its single
unaccompanied vocal melody.  When sung by multiple voices in
<i>unison</i> (i.e. the same pitch), this music is still considered
<i>monophonic</i>.  When doubled at the octave or other interval,
as is done not infrequently in practice, it is arguably <i>homophonic</i>
(see below).  However, this is the sort of precision which only
plainchant specialists would typically consider important.  Another
important example of <i>monophonic</i> music is the
<a href="../composers/trobador.html">troubadour</a> repertory.
Although the surviving musical sources are <i>monophonic</i>, they
are often performed with accompaniment today.  Literally speaking,
this would make them <i>monody</i> in practice (see below).  Finally,
the music of e.g.  <a href="../composers/hildegard.html">Hildegard</a>
is also <i>monophonic</i>, and of course closely related to
plainchant.</p>

<p>Although <i>polyphony</i> literally means more than one sound,
and so any example of non-<i>unison</i> doubling or accompaniment
would be <i>polyphony</i> in the strict denotational sense, the
word generally has a more specific connotation.  Namely, it suggests
that there is melodic interest in each part, and rhythmic distinction
between each part.  It frequently implies even rhythmic independence.
<strong>Homophony</strong>, in contrast, implies no such independence.
In <i>homophonic</i> music, multiple parts generally move in the
same rhythm.  This could also be called <i>chordal</i> music.  One
could therefore suggest that early note-against-note <i>organum</i>
is <i>homophonic</i>, but the word is not generally used in that
context.</p>

<p>There is often some confusion between the terms <i>monophony</i>
and <i>monody</i>.  <strong>Monody</strong> is a term with a definite
historical origin.  The 16th century madrigal was a <i>polyphonic</i>
secular song form, with melodic interest shared between the (most
frequently 5) voices.  In the development of the more soloistic
style which was one of the driving forces in the origin of the
<a href="../beginlst/baroque.htm">Baroque</a>, and with it
<a href="modality.html">modern tonality</a>, emphasis was shifted
to a single upper line for melodic interest as <i>accompanied</i>
by instrumental parts to fill a harmonic texture.  In a prototypical
example, the latter could be chords on a lute.  <i>Monody</i> was
the name given to this style.  From this perspective, one might
note that even recent orchestral music is frequently <i>monodic</i>:
i.e., a primary melody in the upper range accompanied harmonically.
There is some lingering overlap between the terms <i>homophony</i>
and <i>monody</i>.  The term <i>monody</i> emphasizes the distinct
or soloistic role of the main melody, while the term <i>homophony</i>
emphasizes the concord and alignment between voices in the texture.
In practice, it may be difficult to give many sections of &quot;common
practice&quot; music one label or the other.  The <i>quodlibet</i>
is frequently in quintessential <i>homophonic</i> form, as is the
later &quot;barber shop&quot; music.</p>

<p>Another term which sometimes appears is <i>heterophony</i>.
<strong>Heterophony</strong> means that multiple parts use the same
melody, but at somewhat different times.  In other words, it is
like doubling, but not at the same time.  The term <i>heterophony</i>
was invented to distinguish many world musical styles from Western
<i>polyphony</i>, and so is sometimes considered prejudicial.  It
does, however, designate a more specific kind of <i>polyphony</i>.
In <i>heterophony</i>, generally speaking, any vertical alignment
of intervals is coincidental and not important.  This is as
distinguished from a <i>fugue</i> or other imitative forms, which
we might otherwise term <i>heterophonic</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, some discussion of when these words appeared in the
English language may shed further light on the nuances of their
meanings.  <strong>Monody</strong> appeared in print in 1589, as
part of the original discussion of this music when it was new.
<strong>Homophony</strong> appeared with Burney in 1776, emphasizing
the concord of harmonized melody.  <strong>Polyphony</strong>
appeared in 1864 to distinguish certain contrapuntal sections from
<i>homophony</i>.  <strong>Monophony</strong> appeared in 1890, as
the clear analog to <i>polyphony</i>.  <strong>Heterophony</strong>
finally appeared in 1919, as a term to apply to music of other
cultures, as noted.  This sequence illustrates that the concept of
<i>accompaniment</i> has always been central to <i>monodic</i>
music, and that <i>monophonic</i> music per se was distinguished
only later.</p>

<p>Addendum on <i>contrapuntal</i> or counterpoint:  When this word
first appeared in (Latin) theory around 1300, it designated
note-against-note writing which we might call <i>homophonic</i>
today (I emphasize &quot;might&quot; because this style usually
had melodic interest in each part, rather than a main line and
accompaniment) as opposed to what was then the more typical
<i>polyphonic</i> style.  Today, the meaning of <i>contrapuntal</i>
is virtually reversed:  It indicates a <i>polyphonic</i> texture,
often with rhythmic independence.  This is only one of the ironies
which can continue to cause confusion in the use of these terms
for music of different eras.</p>

<p>The above appears to have been written in March 2000, and for
whatever reason, has become one of the most read pages on the site.
It also appears that I never really went back &amp; did some copy
editing, and the syntax sometimes makes me cringe &mdash; as I look
back at my writing again after all these years (here in 2019).  I'm
tempted to edit it (purely for syntax), but I guess I'll swallow
my pride, and leave it as is for historical reasons....</p>

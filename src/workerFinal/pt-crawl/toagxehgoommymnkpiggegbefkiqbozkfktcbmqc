    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC">...After a very short time, out of eighty men who had come there in
our two parties only fifteen remained alive.
      <p>Then the natives fell sick from the stomach, so that one-half of them
died also, and they, believing we had killed them, and holding it to be
certain, they agreed among themselves to kill those of us who survived.
<p>But when they came to execute it an Indian who kept me told them not
to believe we were the cause of their dying, for if we had so much power
we would not have suffered so many of our own people to perish without
being able to remedy it ourselves.&nbsp; He also told them there remained
but very few of us, and none of them did any harm or injury, so that the
best was to let us alone.&nbsp; It pleased Our Lord they should listen
to his advice and counsel and give up their idea.
<p>To this island we gave the name of the Island of Ill-Fate....
<p><center><img src="inline008.gif" width="123" height="35">
</center>

<p>On the island I have spoken of they wanted to make medicine men of us
without any examination or asking for our diplomas, because they cure diseases
by breathing on the sick, and with that breath and their hands they drive
the ailment away.&nbsp; So they summoned us to do the same in order to
be at least of some use.&nbsp; We laughed, taking it for a jest, and said
that we did not understand how to cure.
<p>Thereupon they withheld our food to compel us to do what they wanted.&nbsp;
Seeing our obstinacy, an Indian told me that I did not know what I said
by claiming that what he knew was useless, because stones and things growing
out in the field have their virtues, and he, with a heated stone, placing
it on the stomach, could cure and take away pain, so that we, who were
wiser men, surely had greater power and virtue.
<p>At last we found ourselves in such stress as to have to do it, without
risking any punishment.&nbsp; Their manner of curing is as follows:&nbsp;
When one is ill they call in a medicine man, and after they are well again
not only do they give him all they have, but even things they strive to
obtain from their relatives.&nbsp; All the medicine man does is to make
a few cuts where the pain is located and then suck the skin around the
incisions.&nbsp; They cauterize with fire, thinking it very effective,
and I found it to be so by my own experience.&nbsp; Then they breathe on
the spot where the pain is and believe that with this the disease goes
away.
<p>The way we treated the sick was to make over them the sign of the cross
while breathing on them, recite a <i>Pater noster</i> and <i>Ave Maria</i>,
and pray to God, Our Lord, as best we could to give them good health and
inspire them to do us some favors.&nbsp; Thanks to His will and the mercy
He had upon us, all those for whom we prayed, as soon as we crossed them,
told the others that they were cured and felt well again.&nbsp; For this
they gave us good cheer, and would rather be without food themselves so
as to give it to us, and they gave us hides and other small things.&nbsp;
So great was the lack of food then that I often remained without eating
anything whatsoever for three days, and they were in the same plight, so
that it seemed to me impossible for life to last, although I afterwards
suffered still greater privations and much more distress, as I shall tell
further on....
<p><center><img src="inline008.gif" width="123" height="35">
</center>

<p>On the night we arrived there some Indians came to Castillo complaining
that their heads felt very sore and begging him for relief.&nbsp; As soon
as he had made the sign of the cross over them and recommended them to
God, at that very moment the Indians said that all the pain was gone.&nbsp;
They went back to their abodes and brought us many <b>tunas</b> [<font size=-1>prickly-pear
cacti</font>] and a piece of venison, something we did not know any more
what it was, and as the news spread that same night there came many other
sick people for him to cure, and each brought a piece of venison, and so
many there were that we did not know where to store the meat.&nbsp; We
thanked God for His daily increasing mercy and kindness, and after they
were all well they began to dance and celebrate and feast until sunrise
of the day following....
<p>Early the next day many Indians came and brought five people who were
paralyzed and very ill, and they came for Castillo to cure them.&nbsp;
Every one of the patients offered him his bow and arrows, which he accepted,
and by sunset he made the sign of the cross over each of the sick, recommending
them to God, Our Lord, and we all prayed to Him as well as we could to
restore them to health.&nbsp; And He, seeing there was no other way of
getting those people to help us so that we might be saved from our miserable
existence, had mercy upon us, and in the morning all woke up well and hearty
and went away in such good health as if they never had had any ailment
whatever.&nbsp; This caused them great admiration and moved us to thanks
to Our Lord and to greater faith in His goodness and the hope that He would
save us, guiding us to where we could serve Him.&nbsp; For myself I may
say that I always had full faith in His mercy and in that He would liberate
me from captivity, and always told my companions so.
<p>When the Indians had gone and taken along those recently cured, we removed
to others that were eating tunas also, called Cultalchuches and Malicones,
which speak a different language, and with them were others, called Coayos
and Susolas, and on another side those called Atayos, who were at war with
the Susolas, and exchanging arrow shots with them every day.
<p>Nothing was talked about in this whole country but of the wonderful
cures which God, Our Lord, performed through us, and so they came from
many places to be cured, and after having been with us two days some Indians
of the Susolas begged Castillo to go and attend to a man who had been wounded,
as well as to others that were sick and among whom, they said, was one
on the point of death.&nbsp; Castillo was very timid, especially in difficult
and dangerous cases, and always afraid that his sins might interfere and
prevent the cures from being effective.&nbsp; Therefore the Indians told
me to go and perform the cure.&nbsp; They liked me, remembering that I
had relieved them while they were out gathering nuts, for which they had
given us nuts and hides.&nbsp; This had happened at the time I was coming
to join the Christians.&nbsp; So I had to go, and Dorantes and Estevanico
went with me.
<p>When I came close to their ranches I saw that the dying man we had been
called to cure was dead, for there were many people around him weeping
and his lodge was torn down, which is a sign that the owner has died.&nbsp;
I found the Indian with eyes up turned, without pulse and with all the
marks of lifelessness.&nbsp; At least so it seemed to me, and Dorantes
said the same.&nbsp; I removed a mat with which he was covered, and as
best I could prayed to Our Lord to restore his health, as well as that
of all the others who might be in need of it, and after having made the
sign of the cross and breathed on him many times they brought his bow and
presented it to me, and a basket of ground tunas, and took me to many others
who were suffering from vertigo.&nbsp; They gave me two more baskets of
tunas, which I left to the Indians that had come with us.&nbsp; Then we
returned to our quarters....
<p><center><img src="inline008.gif" width="123" height="35">
</center>

<p>We remained with the Avavares Indians for eight months, according to
our reckoning of the moons.&nbsp; During that time they came for us from
many places and said that verily we were children of the sun.&nbsp; Until
then Dorantes and the negro had not made any cures, but we found ourselves
so pressed by the Indians coming from all sides, that all of us had to
become medicine men.&nbsp; I was the most daring and reckless of all in
undertaking cures.&nbsp; We never treated anyone that did not afterwards
say he was well, and they had such confidence in our skill as to believe
that none of them would die as long as we were among them....
<p><center><img src="inline008.gif" width="123" height="35">
</center>

<p>Those who were with us took away from those people who came to get cured
their bows and arrows, their shoes and beads, if they wore any, and placed
them before us to induce us to cure the sick.&nbsp; As soon as these had
been treated they went away contented and saying they felt well.
<p>So we left there also, going to others, by whom we were also very well
received, and they brought us their sick, who, after we had made the sign
of the cross over them, would say they were healed, and he who did not
get well still believed we might cure him.&nbsp; And at what the others
whom we had treated told they rejoiced and danced so much as not to let
us sleep....
<p><center><img src="inline008.gif" width="123" height="35">
</center>

<p>Here they brought to me a man who, they told, a long time ago had been
shot through the left side of the back with an arrow, the head of which
stuck close to his heart.&nbsp; He said it gave him much pain, and that
on this account he was sick.&nbsp; I touched the region of the body and
felt the arrowhead, and that it had pierced the cartilage.&nbsp; So, with
a knife, I cut open the breast as far as the place.&nbsp; The arrow point
had gotten athwart, and was very difficult to remove.&nbsp; By cutting
deeper, and inserting the point of the knife, with great difficulty I got
it out; it was very long.&nbsp; Then, with a deer-bone, according to my
knowledge of surgery, I made two stitches.&nbsp; After I had extracted
the arrow they begged me for it, and I gave it to them.&nbsp; The whole
village came back to look at it, and they sent it further inland that the
people there might see it also.
<p>On account of this cure they made many dances and festivities, as is
their custom.&nbsp; The next day I cut the stitches, and the Indian was
well.&nbsp; The cut I had made only showed a scar like a line in the palm
of the hand, and he said that he felt not the least pain.
<p>Now, this cure gave us such fame among them all over the country as
they were capable of conceiving and respecting.&nbsp; We showed them our
rattle, and they told us that where it had come from there were a great
many sheets of the same (metal) buried, that it was a thing they valued
highly, and that there were fixed abodes at the place.&nbsp; We believe
it to be near the South Sea, for we always heard that sea was richer (in
metal) than the one of the north....
<p><center><img src="inline008.gif" width="123" height="35">
</center>

<p>One night I went away to sleep out in the field apart from them; but
they soon came to where I was, and remained awake all night in great alarm,
talking to me, saying how frightened they were.&nbsp; They entreated us
not to be angry any longer, because, even if it was their death, they would
take us where we chose.&nbsp; We feigned to be angry still, so as to keep
them in suspense, and then a singular thing happened.
<p>On that same day many fell sick, and on the next day eight of them died!&nbsp;
All over the country, where it was known, they became so afraid that it
seemed as if the mere sight of us would kill them.&nbsp; They besought
us not to be angry nor to procure the death of any more of their number,
for they were convinced that we killed them by merely thinking of it. In
truth, we were very much concerned about it, for, seeing the great mortality,
we dreaded that all of them might die or forsake us in their terror, while
those further on, upon learning of it, would get out of our way hereafter.&nbsp;
We prayed to God our Lord to assist us, and the sick began to get well.&nbsp;
Then we saw something that astonished us very much, and it was that, while
the parents, brothers and wives of the dead had shown deep grief at their
illness, from the moment they died the survivors made no demonstration
whatsoever, and showed not the slightest feeling; nor did they dare to
go near the bodies until we ordered their burial....
<p><center><img src="inline008.gif" width="123" height="35">
</center>

<p>All those people came to us that we might touch and cross them; and
they were so obtrusive as to make it difficult to endure since all, sick
and healthy, wanted to be crossed.&nbsp; It happened frequently that women
of our company would give birth to children and forthwith bring them to
have the sign of the cross made over them and the babes be touched by us.&nbsp;
They always accompanied us until we were again in the care of others, and
all those people believed that we came from Heaven.....

			<h2>The Yacht Design Process</h2>
			<p>
				The following article is a summary of how a new custom yacht design is imagined, sketched and drawn. 
				In addition to the following notes, our <a href="intro.htm">Introduction</a> web page 
				provides an outline of our general approach to yacht design.&nbsp;  
			</p>
			<p>
				While seemingly complex, the design process is made up of a series of incremental steps, much like the 
				building process itself.  The goal of undertaking the design of any new yacht is to take a unique set of 
				owner requirements and to turn them into the best possible solution to those requests. 
				If the resulting design is to be what it should be, each of the steps 
				outlined below must be addressed thoroughly. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				There is first the idea, and then the bringing forth of the idea into a functioning reality.  In 
				order to get the relevant information on the table, two primary ingredients are necessary:</p>
			<p class="p_indent_40px">
				<b>I. Owner's Specification: </b>The first 'design task' is actually performed by the prospective boat 
				owner.  It is first to imagine the goal, and then to create an 'Owner's Specification' or 'mission 
				statement' for the proposed vessel. 
			With that information 
				understood, we will provide a written Design Proposal to outline 
				how we propose to meet the goals that have been set forth.&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<ul class="p_indent_80px">
				<li>Rather than being a detailed description of the <b>result</b> of the design process, the Owner's 
				Specification is better if seen as a general guide to the <b>intent</b> of the design. </li>
				<li>Toward that end, ideally the owner's 'mission statement' will be kept fairly simple, since the 
				details of the design will emerge as a result of the design process itself. </li>
				<li>The basic information needed is an outline of the intended vessel's size, layout, materials of 
				construction, the intended use, range, speed, rig, and general aesthetic. </li>
				<li>The essential information should include the intended 
				schedule for designing and building the yacht.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="p_indent_40px">
				<b>II. Design Proposal:</b>  My first job is to understand the preliminary Owner's Specification, 
				then to provide the prospective client with a detailed outline for creating the new design. This is in 
				the form of our standard written 'Design Proposal' which includes the following:
			</p>
			<ul class="p_indent_80px">
				<li>A written outline of the design process itself. </li>
				<li>A list of the deliverable drawings and documents. </li>
				<li>An estimate for the design work required in order to create the design and to detail the plans for 
				the vessel as described. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following paragraphs describe our design process, 
				and outline the deliverable drawings and documents.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4 class="h4_indented">Stage I - The Preliminary Design Study</h4>
			<p>
				After our '<b>Design Proposal</b>' has been reviewed, if the 
				prospective boat owner approves of what we have proposed, then the actual 
				design work can begin.  </p>
			<p>
				A custom design starts with listening to the requirements of my 
				clients.  The objective is to create the best 
				mutual design solution in terms of vessel type, layout, size and style.  
				My goal is to propose an appropriate form and function to suit 
				the vessel's intended purpose, and to follow that up with a thorough analysis of 
				structure, stability and performance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There will first be a series of information 
				exchanges, possibly including clippings of similar vessels or sketched layouts provided by the client. 
				After the owner's requirements have been articulated I will 
				usually begin by creating a preliminary 3D CAD model of the intended vessel, 
				which is most often created by adapting one or more of our 
				existing designs or prototype designs to its new purpose.</p>
			<p>
				The 3D model allows us to determine:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The envelope available for the accommodations </li>
				<li>The overall size and hull form </li>
				<li>The preliminary internal structure (bulkheads and soles) </li>
				<li>The rig (if for a sailing vessel or motor sailor) </li>
				<li>The styling and features of the superstructure  </li>
				<li>The preliminary hydrostatics </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				With that, I will prepare a few CAD generated drawings in 
				order to show the proposed layout in
				<a href="_drawings/sarah_50_interior_plan.png">Plan</a> 
				and
				<a href="_drawings/sarah_50_interior_profile.png">Profile</a> 
				views and a perspective view of the proposed
				<a href="_screenshots/sarah_50_v17_above_aft_sketch.png">Exterior Styling</a>. 
				Combined with a description of the proposed dimensions and other 
				particulars of 
				the vessel, this is the beginning of what I refer 
				to as 'Stage I' or the preliminary '<b>Design Study</b>.'&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
				<strong>Stage I</strong> is basically a process of ‘discovery’ 
			wherein we mutually discover the best solution to your requests.  
			In pursuit of that ‘discovery’ process we will review our proposed 
				design solutions against the original specification -- or possibly the 
				initial specification will be revised 
			according to what we discover.  This process is both flexible and adaptable. </p>
			<p>
				During <b>Stage I</b> we will strive to establish the 
				accommodations, styling, size, dimensions, and the target 
				displacement.&nbsp; Our goal here is to provide a "proof of 
				concept" for the design so that further changes can be kept to a 
				minimum.&nbsp; When the preliminary design has been approved by the owner, <b>Stage II</b> can begin.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4 class="h4_indented">Stage II - The Estimating Plans</h4>
			<p>
				The goal of Stage II<strong> </strong>is to create the first few sheets of 
				the actual Building Plans, and to generate a number of essential 
				documents that will be required by builders so that an accurate 
				construction estimate can be provided.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				The first part of <strong>Stage II </strong>involves finalizing 'Stage I Study Drawings'.&nbsp; 
				The preliminary <strong>Estimating Plans</strong> will therefore 
				include:  
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The proposed Sail Plan or Outboard Profile </li>
				<li>The proposed Interior Profile and Arrangement Plan </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Once those drawings have been approved, we can proceed knowing that further changes will be minimized.  
				When completed, the <b>Estimating Plans Package </b>will include: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sail Plan / Outboard Profile </li>
				<li>Interior Profile and Arrangement Plan</li>
				<li>Structural Profile and Arrangement Plan</li>
				<li>Equipment List </li>
				<li>Vessel Specification </li>
				<li>Painting Specification </li>
				<li>Preliminary Weight Study </li>
				<li>Preliminary Power and Range Analysis </li>
				<li>Preliminary Hydrostatics Analysis </li>
				<li>List of Boat Builders Suited to the Project </li>
				<li>Designer's Cover Letter to Builders </li>
				<li>Sample Owner's 'Request for Quotes' Letter to Builders </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For smaller vessels there will be three drawing sheets at this point. For larger vessels there may be 
				two or more sheets in each category.
				The goal of <b>Stage II</b> is that enough information be presented in the Estimating Plans Package that 
				firm quotes can be obtained from prospective builders for construction of the vessel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would like to review an example of our design work up to 
				this point, Estimating Plans are available for any of the designs listed on our <a href="plans_list.htm">Plans List</a> 
				page.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4 class="h4_indented">Stage III - The Building Plans</h4>
			<p>
				During '<strong>Stage III</strong>' the remaining design work is 
				completed. With additional owner and builder feedback, further 
				decisions can be made with regard to equipment and finish as 
				needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The drawings, Equipment List and Vessel Specification are refined and the remaining 
				drawings are completed in order to create a final<b> Building Plans </b>package.  These drawings 
				and documents will finalize the interior and exterior details, the machinery arrangement, the deck 
				plan, scantlings, construction sections, the boat's final dimensions and hull shape, and the 
				as-designed displacement, range, performance, hydrostatics and stability.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>Building Plan Drawings</b> will include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Outboard Profile: Sail plan or other exterior details of the hull </li>
				<li>Deck Plan: Cabins, hatches, fittings, mooring and anchor gear </li>
				<li>Interior Profile and Arrangement: The vessel's accommodations </li>
				<li>Sectional Views: Structure and interior joinery sections </li>
				<li>Inboard Profile: Structure and primary equipment </li>
				<li>Various Structural Details as needed </li>
				<li>Mechanical / Machinery Details as needed </li>
				<li>Rudder Details</li>
				<li>Spar and Rigging Plan as needed </li>
				<li>Hull Fitting Details </li>
				<li>Hatch and Deck Fitting Details </li>
				<li>Companionway, Door and Portlight Details </li>
				<li>Interior Joinery Details </li>
				<li>Lofting Conventions Drawing</li>
				<li>Lines Drawing&nbsp; </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Several of the above drawing categories may include a number of 
				individual sheets.&nbsp; 
				Depending on vessel size and complexity, the Building Plans may 
				include anywhere from 10 to 40 or more drawing sheets.</p>
			<p>
				During Stage III the Equipment List and Vessel Specification are finalized in order to accurately describe the intent, 
				the layout, the scantlings, the construction, the systems and the outfit of the vessel.
				In addition to the above listed drawings, the following <strong>
				Documents</strong> will be included in the Building Plans 
				set:  
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Equipment List: The complete list of equipment items. </li>
				<li>Vessel Specification: Details of the intent, rationale and construction. </li>
				<li>Painting Specification </li>
				<li>Scantling List </li>
				<li>Welding Specification for metal structure </li>
				<li>Fastening Schedule for wooden structure </li>
				<li>Laminate Schedule for GRP structure </li>
				<li>Offsets Table (unless the vessel will be NC cut). </li>
				<li>Power and Range Analysis Report</li>
				<li>Weight Budget Summary</li>
				<li>Hydrostatics Report </li>
				<li>Stability Compliance Report</li>
				<li>Cover Letter to Builder </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Having finished Stage III, the <strong>Design Phase</strong> of the new yacht will be complete. Sufficient 
				information will be contained in the drawings and documents to allow any professional or amateur builder 
				to build the vessel as intended.</p>
			<p>
				Then the <strong>Construction Phase</strong> of the project may begin.  <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>Standards Used</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Design Goals</strong>: Throughout the design process we have the following goals:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Suitability to the owner's requirements and to the intended service. </li>
				<li>An interior and on-deck layout per the owner's requirements. </li>
				<li>A pleasing aesthetic. </li>
				<li>A thorough specification to assure longevity and ease of maintenance. </li>
				<li>Sensibility of structure for the sake of ease of construction. </li>
				<li>A functional and accessible machinery and equipment layout. </li>
				<li>A distribution of weights to provide correct trim and adequate stability. </li>
				<li>Performance suited to the expectations of the vessel type. </li>
				<li>Structure per classification society scantling rules. </li>
				<li>Stability per international criteria. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The general attributes of seaworthiness, seakindliness, strength and durability are 
				considered to be requirements for each of our designs.  It is interesting to note that 
				for <strong>private</strong> yachts within the US, there are no requirements for stability 
				or for structure.  However if a US yacht is to be used commercially or Classed and built 
				under survey, one or more of the following standards will apply.&nbsp; Whether or not a 
				private yacht will be Classed, it is our position that <strong>all</strong> yachts be 
				held to the following standards.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="auto-style2"><strong>STRUCTURE</strong></span>:  When creating a new design, classification society rules are 
				the best guide for the adequacy of structure.  We will confirm compliance with one 
				of the following rules as appropriate to the vessel type, size, materials or build venue 
				(for more information, see our article on
				<a href="scantlings.htm">Designing to the ABS Rule</a>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ABS 2000 Motor Pleasure Yachts (applicable to motor yachts from 79' to 200' scantling length - all materials 
				- now obsolete for yachts)&nbsp; </li> 
				<li>ABS 1994 Offshore Racing Yachts (applicable to sailing yachts 
				from 79' to 100' scantling length - all materials - now obsolete 
				for yachts)&nbsp; </li>
				<li>ABS 2016 Steel Vessels (applicable to steel vessels up to 295' scantling length 
				- obsolete for yachts, but still required by the CFR for 
				commercial yachts carrying passengers)&nbsp; </li>
				<li><strong>ABS 2016 Yacht Rule</strong> (<strong>new rule</strong> applicable to 
				<span class="text_underline"><strong>all</strong></span> 
						motor and sailing yachts in <span class="text_underline">
				<strong>all</strong></span> materials up to 90 meters scantling length (295 feet)&nbsp; </li>
				<li> ISO-12215 for vessels subject to the EU-RCD standards (yachts up to 78' measurement length - all materials)&nbsp; </li>
				<li>Germanischer Lloyds (wooden yachts up to 78' scantling length 
				- under revision as GL and DNV begin to merge their rules)&nbsp; </li>
				<li>Germanischer Lloyds (plank-on-frame commercial wooden vessels up to 115' scantling length - applicable to larger 
				vessels on approval)&nbsp; </li>
				<li>British Lloyd's Register (plank-on-frame wooden yachts up to 98' scantling length - applicable to larger 
				yachts on approval)&nbsp; </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<span class="auto-style2">
				<strong>STABILITY</strong></span>:  To assess stability we use a variety of criteria depending on vessel size, use and location, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For private yachts under 24 meters measurement length (78 feet) intended for registry in the EU, stability 
				will be calculated according to the EU-RCD standards (ISO-12217). &nbsp; </li>				
				<li>For private or commercial yachts above 24 meters measurement length, stability will be calculated according 
				to IMO, MCA or other standards appropriate to the vessel type, size and use. &nbsp; </li>
				<li>For commercial charter yachts in the US, safety and stability will be calculated according to the US Code of 
				Federal Regulations (CFR).&nbsp; </li>
				<li>For private or commercial yachts in the US, stability will be calculated according to the <strong>new</strong> 
				ABS 2015 Rules for Building and Classing Yachts, which defer to the IMO or MCA standards depending on vessel type 
				and size.&nbsp; </li>
				<li>For yachts in Canada, stability will be calculated according to criteria established by Transport Canada, which 
				for the most part defer to to the IMO or MCA rules.&nbsp; </li>
				<li>For yachts in other locations, stability will be calculated according to locally applicable criteria - most 
				often the IMO or MCA rules, depending on vessel type, service, and size.&nbsp; </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When a vessel is destined for construction and use within the European Union, we also prepare documentation regarding structure and stability 
						in order to make obtaining a CE Mark a relatively easy process for the builder.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>Construction Support Services</h2>
			<p>
				We ordinarily recommend that plans be submitted to a few selected yards for their construction 
				estimates.  We have worked with a variety of builders in a number of places worldwide.   
				We will try to match a project with an appropriate builder, even if that may be outside the US. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the <b>Construction Phase </b>of the process, there may be various requests for additional 
				services in support of construction.  Although we don't get into project management per se, we 
				remain available to act as the owner's representative during construction whenever we are asked to do so. 
				In other words, although we do not get involved in managing personnel, scheduling or purchasing, we are 
				pleased to remain involved in order to manage the flow of information and specifications for the builder.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4 class="h4_indented">Additional Drawings, Documents, Schematics...</h4>
			<p>
				Ordinarily, system schematics are developed in-house by the builder 
				(e.g. plumbing, fuel system, etc.) or by system suppliers (e.g. electrical, 
				hydraulic, air conditioning, etc.).  On occasion the owner or 
				builder may request that we provide basic schematics or 
				additional drawings to illustrate specialized features or other 
				details in support of construction in order to communicate 
				specific owner requests to the builder.</p>
			<p>
				For passenger vessels or other commercial craft there may be the requirement to provide additional 
				drawings and reports for documentation and compliance with the relevant standards.&nbsp; 
				And when a vessel is destined for use within the European Union, we can prepare documentation that makes 
				obtaining a CE Mark relatively easy for the builder.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4 class="h4_indented">NC Cutting Files</h4>
			<p>
				One of the most valuable Construction Support Services we provide for metal boats is to develop
				<a href="NCcutting.htm">NC Cutting Files</a> in order to automate a portion of the vessel's construction.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is NC...?   It simply means Numerically Controlled...&nbsp; 
				By this method a numerically driven plasma or water-jet cutter can be used to create frames and plates 
				for a metal vessel.  One can also use an NC driven router to cut mould frames for a wood or 
				composite superstructure.
				It is even possible to carve an entire male plug or female mold out of foam for use in building a 
				composite superstructure, directly from the computer generated surface model that was created during the design of the boat.
				</p>
			<p>
				This leverages the work that has already been done in order to create the design and can provide a 
				significant labor savings to the yard.  It also dramatically improves accuracy of construction.  With NC 
				cutting, the labor saved during fabrication of a metal hull will usually pay for the cost of developing 
				the NC cutting files, plus some.</p>
			<p>
				In other words NC cutting is an opportunity to not only effect a true cost savings 
				by shortening the overall build time, but to also improve the quality of the result.  <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>The Role of the Computer</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Designing the Boat</strong>:  We use the
				<a href="file:///C:/Users/micro/Documents/My%20Web%20Sites/Kasten_Marine/maxsurf/index.htm">Maxsurf</a> family of software products, a series of programs 
				for hull modeling, analysis, and construction.  With Maxsurf, a preliminary hull model is quickly generated and an 
				initial round of hydrostatics, stability, and performance calculations performed to see where the design can be improved.
				The computer generated model allows the design to be enhanced quickly at an early stage of design 
				before it has become fixed, or even to be modified without too much fuss later in the process.  In 
				fact, without such an easily used computer modeling tool (as compared to manual drafting) those subtle 
				refinements would rarely be undertaken even if given a substantial budget.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Several other benefits are also evident.  For example, via the computer generated model it is 
				easy to assure that the surfaces are developable, so building a metal or plywood hull is made simpler.
				</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Testing the Design</strong>:&nbsp; With the computer generated model of the hull and superstructure 
				having already been created, it is a simple matter to make a 
				scaled down <a href="modeling.htm">physical model</a> for towing tank testing, or to verify the 
				styling and features of the yacht in three dimensions. </p>
			<p>
				<strong>Building the Boat</strong>:  A substantial benefit of having generated a model of the hull on the computer is that the vessel's
				<b>structure</b> can also be computer generated and actually 
				pre-cut via computer guided laser or plasma cutting - or in the 
				case of a GRP vessel, the mould created using a computer guided 
				router.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
				By this method, having detailed the hull plating and structure, 
				the parts are nested onto available plate sizes. The completed 
				plate nestings are then sent to the metal cutters - usually by 
				email. 
				This is extremely convenient since the cutter can receive the information immediately in order to start 
				the work.  When completed, the cutters have a "boat kit" that can be shipped wherever needed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The Savings</strong>: 
				When building a metal boat in a production environment, assuming 
				one-off construction, industry feedback is generally that NC cutting will save 
				a professional builder some 35% or so of the 
				hull fabrication labor.&nbsp;
				The percentage of fabrication labor saved by an amateur owner-builder is dramatically greater. 
				For example, consider that lofting is eliminated, as are templating for frame and plate patterns. 
				For an amateur builder, this also eliminates most of the "what 
				to do and how to do it and why" kind of worries...&nbsp;
				Other Benefits:  
				Via NC cutting an extremely accurate fit results.  For a metal 
				hull this means there will be far less distortion during the weld-up.</p>
			<p>
				For construction in other materials such as GRP, NC cutting nearly eliminates the labor required for 
				lofting and for mold construction. An entire hull and superstructure mold can be carved by five axis NC router directly 
				from the computer generated model, avoiding nearly all tooling labor.&nbsp;
				A builder can also pre-cut glass fiber or carbon fiber cloth, especially useful with 'pre-preg' cloth 
				(cloth that is pre-impregnated with resin and post-cured by UV or by heat).  Where the materials 
				cost is high, the improved efficiency will quickly offset the cost of having developed the structure via 
				computer modeling.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>
				Design-Stream Overview</h2>
			<p>
				For more detail on our design and build strategy please see our
				<a href="design_stream.htm">CAD Design Stream</a> article.&nbsp;
				The following flow-charts were created in order to show our design process 
				- more or less taking the usual "design spiral" and stretching 
				it out into a linear diagram.  I have used two 
				different ways to represent the work-flow.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<a href="_pdf/KMD_workflow_primary_software.pdf">Software in Use</a> - 
				This is a simplified flow chart showing the 
				software we use, and how a few basic software groups interrelate during 
				the process of creating a new yacht design.  <br />
				  </li>
				<li>
				<a href="_pdf/KMD_workflow_process_software_deliverables.pdf">Process &amp; Deliverables
				</a>- This is a workflow chart showing our Design 
				Process arranged in terms of the "order of operations" that we follow 
				in order to create each new yacht design.  This process 
				starts with our interaction with the client as described above, then moves into the 
				stages of the design process wherein we produce the drawings 
				and documents that we deliver to the client, the builder, and to 
				the metal cutter.  <br />
				<br />
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Cool 3D Models</h2>
			<p>
				The following are two examples of how we make good use of a 3D 
				CAD workflow in order to create a design and its structure, then 
				to communicate the result using 3D PDF files for use by

				<a href="_pdf/chantage_3D_persp.pdf">3D Lines Drawing</a> - This 
				is a 3D perspective file showing the <strong>lines</strong> 
				of one of our designs.  As with all of our designs, it was created in <strong>Maxsurf</strong>, 
				then imported to <strong>Microstation</strong> so that it could 
				be "plotted" to a 3D <strong>PDF</strong> for customer review.  Within the 
				PDF, you can grab the 3D model, rotate it, zoom, pan, 
				walk-through, and you can change the perspective.  If you 
				turn on the PDF menus, you can also manage the layers in the 
				original CAD drawing, turning any of them on or off to simplify 
				the view.  This is an excellent tool for visualization of 
				the spaces, and to see the vessel's shape from any angle.  <br />

				<li>
				<a href="_pdf/valdemar_3D_parts.pdf">3D Structure Drawing</a> - 
				This is a 3D perspective file showing the <strong>structure</strong> 
				of a metal yacht design.  Having been designed in <strong>
				Maxsurf</strong>, the vessel's structure was then created in
				<strong>Workshop</strong>; after which the basic structure was 
				brought into <strong>Microstation</strong> for editing and 
				detailing, and then "plotted" to a 3D <strong>PDF</strong> for 
				the builder to use as a guide during assembly.  It is an 
				excellent way to view the structure using simple, free <strong>
				Adobe Reader </strong>software.  This enables the builder and 
				his crew to see exactly how the structure interrelates.  <br />

			<h2> Why Develop A New Design...?</h2>
			<p>
				As you may have surmised from the above, there is a fair bit of work involved in designing a boat 
				well, even if it is a simple one!&nbsp;
				Given the number of designs that already exist it may seem a little bit wild to commission a new 
				yacht design. On the other hand, it is an unquestionable delight to see one's ideas turned into one's 
				own personal yacht.  
			</p>
			<p>
				You will be surprised to discover that the cost to develop a new and unique yacht design is 
				ordinarily <em><strong>less 
				than</strong> a yacht broker's typical fee to purchase an existing yacht...! 
				</em> 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll repeat that in case you missed it...  Even though 
				there is quite a lot more work involved to create a boat design, 
				the cost to create a new custom yacht design is ordinarily
				<strong><em>less than</em></strong><em> a yacht broker's fee for the simple act of signing 
				the purchase papers...! 
				</em> </p>
			<p>
				As a percentage of the yacht's cost the amount expended on 
				design is really not very much.  If you also consider that a custom design will be 
				tailored to your particular requirements rather than being an "off-the-shelf" solution, the difference 
				in satisfaction will be well worth the effort expended. 
				This is especially so if a custom designed yacht will better serve its intended purpose and 
				will therefore be able to do so 
				for a longer time, versus a vessel built to a stock design.  
				In other words, by not having to replace the yacht quite so soon, the 
				cost of custom design work will easily have paid for itself, in 
				all likelihood many times over.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>Is It Proven?</h2>
			<p>
				The question inevitably comes up: " Is it a proven design?" 
			</p>
			<p>
				The answer is an unqualified "<b>Yes</b>!"  
			</p>
			<p>
				The basic principles of boat design, while seemingly complex, are well established. If faithfully 
				attended to, the success of a new vessel is assured, and the result will nearly always be an improvement 
				on what has been done before on existing designs.  
				Where unusual features or hull types are requested, it is prudent to involve tank testing, which 
				can provide valuable insight as to vessel behavior; performance; stability; seakeeping; etc.&nbsp;
				What ultimately makes a boat a success is whether the vessel is safe, seaworthy, sea kindly, 
				beautiful to behold, and above all, whether the vessel satisfies the originally stated wishes of the 
				owner. <br /> &nbsp;
			</p>
		
		<h2>Establishing a Design Philosophy...</h2>
			<p>
				My aim is to engender 
				superior aesthetics along with safe and comfortable boating.&nbsp;
				A distinguishing characteristic of our design work during the 
				last few decades has been a focus on
				<a href="nomadic_watercraft.htm" title="Yachts for Voyaging and Living Aboard">Nomadic Watercraft</a>, 
				in other words the design of truly pelagic blue water boats for 
				family cruising and world voyaging. </p>
			<p>
				I strive for long term owner satisfaction with the resulting vessel, 
				using the most 
				up to date methods and design tools, including software optimized for hull modeling, stability and performance analyses.  
				With this approach, I am able to leverage the work done to 
				create the design into subsequent detailing of the vessel's structure 
				in order to provide an NC cutting file package to 
				automate parts of the vessel's construction, a process that is 
				outlined in our
				<a href="design_stream.htm">CAD Design Stream</a> article. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal is to provide a complete "design service" from the point of imagining the vessel, to creating 
				the ideal solution to those conjurings, in other words to take the concept all the way from 
				'napkin sketch' to building plans, and to then provide the various "construction support services" noted 
				above.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>Where To Begin?</h2>
			<p>
				The place to start the design process is to first create an Owner's 
				Specification, or "mission 
				statement."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It need not be more than a 
				few paragraphs that describe the proposed vessel, or possibly a 
				simple list of desired features such as overall size, 
				operational requirements, preferences with regard to rig, power, equipment, materials of 
				construction, accommodations, budget, project timing, and so forth.&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 'mission statement' need not be elaborate, since the 
				vessel's particulars will be generated during the design process 
				itself... however where specific requirements exist, they should 
				be articulated.&nbsp; While sketches or design examples are not 
				necessary, if preliminary sketches or design examples are 
				available and relevant, they should be included.&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once I've 
				understood your requirements I will provide a written '<b>Design Proposal</b>' - usually by 
				return email.  Our Design Proposal is offered at no cost, and 
				implies no obligation; it is just good information for your 
				planning purposes...&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the inevitable questions regarding the cost of boat custom 
				design, our <strong>Design Proposal </strong>will answer them 
				definitively, however please also see our 
				<a href="articles.htm#Boat_Costs">Articles On Costs</a> involved 
				with boat design and 
				boat building.&nbsp; In order to pursue a design inquiry in 
				greater detail, please feel free to
				<a href="mailto:michael@kastenmarine.com">contact me</a> for more information or to request a <b>Design 
				Proposal</b>.&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Creating a new yacht design is by far the most rewarding path to long term boat ownership, and the 
				process itself can be quite a lot of fun...!</p>

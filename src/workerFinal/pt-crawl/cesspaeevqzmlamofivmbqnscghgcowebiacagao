<P>By <A HREF="http://www.vida.com/speakout/People/BarbaraEhrenreich.html">Barbara
Ehrenreich</A> and Janet McIntosh 
<HR width=275 align=left>
  <P>When social psychologist Phoebe Ellsworth took the podium at a recent
interdisciplinary seminar on emotions, she was already feeling rattled.
Colleagues who'd presented earlier had warned her that the crowd was tough
and had little patience for the reduction of human experience to numbers
or bold generalizations about emotions across cultures. Ellsworth had a
plan: She would pre-empt criticism by playing the critic, offering a social
history of psychological approaches to the topic. But no sooner had the
word &quot;experiment&quot; passed her lips than the hands shot up. Audience
members pointed out that the experimental method is the brainchild of white
Victorian males. Ellsworth agreed that white Victorian males had done their
share of damage in the world but noted that, nonetheless, their efforts
had led to the discovery of DNA. This short-lived dialogue between paradigms
ground to a halt with the retort: &quot;You believe in DNA?&quot; </P>

<P>More grist for the academic right? No doubt, but this exchange reflects
a tension in academia that goes far deeper than spats over &quot;political
correctness.&quot; Ellsworth's experience illustrates the trend -- in anthropology,
sociology, cultural studies and other departments across the nation --
to dismiss the possibility that there are any biologically based commonalities
that cut across cultural differences. This aversion to biological or, as
they are often branded, &quot;reductionist&quot; explanations commonly
operates as an informal ethos limiting what can be said in seminars, asked
at lectures or incorporated into social theory. Extreme anti-innatism has
had formal institutional consequences as well: At some universities, like
the University of California, Berkeley, the biological subdivision of the
anthropology department has been relocated to another building -- a spatial
metaphor for an epistemological gap. </P>

<P>Although some of the strongest rejections of the biological have come
from scholars with a left or feminist perspective, antipathy toward innatist
theories does not always score neatly along political lines. Consider a
recent review essay by centrist sociologist Alan Wolfe in <I>The</I> <I>New
Republic</I>. Wolfe makes quick work of Frank Sulloway's dodgy Darwinist
claims (in <I>Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family Dynamics, and Creative
Lives</I>) about the influence of birth order on personality, but can't
resist going on to impugn the motives of anyone who would apply biology
to the human condition: In general, he asserts, &quot;the biologizing of
human beings is not only bad humanism, but also bad science.&quot; </P>

<P>For many social theorists, innate biology can be let in only as a constraint
-- &quot;a set of natural limits on human functioning,&quot; as anthropologist
Marshall Sahlins has written. It has, from this point of view, no positive
insights to offer into how humans think, act or arrange their cultures.
For others, the study of innate human properties is not merely uninteresting
but deeply misguided. Stanford philosopher of science John Dupr&eacute;,
for example, argues that it is &quot;essentialist&quot; even to think that
we are a biological species in the usual sense -- that is, a group possessing
any common tendencies or &quot;universal properties&quot; that might shed
some light on our behavior. As feminist theorist Judith Butler puts it,
&quot;The very category of the universal has begun to be exposed for its
own highly ethnocentric biases.&quot; </P>

<P>But the notion that humans have no shared, biologically based &quot;nature&quot;
constitutes a theory of human nature itself. No one, after all, is challenging
the idea that chimpanzees have a chimpanzee nature -- that is, a set of
genetically scripted tendencies and potential responses that evolved along
with the physical characteristics we recognize as chimpanzee-like. To set
humans apart from even our closest animal relatives as the one species
that is exempt from the influences of biology is to suggest that we do
indeed possess a defining &quot;essence,&quot; and that it is defined by
our unique and miraculous freedom from biology. The result is an ideological
outlook eerily similar to that of religious creationism. Like their fundamentalist
Christian counterparts, the most extreme antibiologists suggest that humans
occupy a status utterly different from and clearly &quot;above&quot; that
of all other living beings. And, like the religious fundamentalists, the
new academic creationists defend their stance as if all of human dignity
-- and all hope for the future -- were at stake. </P>

<P>The new secular creationism emerged as an understandable reaction to
excess. Since the nineteenth century, conservatives have routinely deployed
supposed biological differences as immutable barriers to the achievement
of a more egalitarian social order. Darwinism was quickly appropriated
as social Darwinism -- a handy defense of economic inequality and colonialism.
In the twentieth century, from the early eugenicists to <I>The Bell Curve</I>,
pseudo-biology has served the cause of white supremacy. Most recently,
evolutionary psychology has become, in some hands, a font of patriarchal
social prescriptions. Alas, in the past few years such simplistic biological
reductionism has tapped a media nerve, with the result that, among many
Americans, schlock genetics has become the default explanation for every
aspect of human behavior from homosexuality to male promiscuity, from depression
to &quot;criminality.&quot; </P>

<P>Clearly science needs close and ongoing scrutiny, and in the past decade
or two there has been a healthy boom in science studies and criticism.
Scholars such as Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding, Emily Martin and Donna
Haraway have offered useful critiques of the biases and ethnocentric metaphors
that can skew everything from hypothesis formation to data collection techniques.
Feminists (one of the authors included) have deconstructed medicine and
psychology for patriarchal biases; left-leaning biologists such as Stephen
Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin and Ruth Hubbard have exposed misapplications
of biology to questions of social policy. However, contemporary antibiologists
decry a vast range of academic pursuits coming from very different theoretical
corners -- from hypotheses about the effects of genes and hormones, to
arguments about innate cognitive modules and grammar, to explorations of
universal ritual form and patterns of linguistic interaction. All these
can be branded as &quot;essentialist,&quot; hence wrongheaded and politically
mischievous. Paradoxically, assertions about universal human traits and
tendencies are usually targeted just as vehemently as assertions about
differences: There are no differences between groups, seems to be the message,
but there is no sameness among them either. </P>

<P>Within anthropology, the social science traditionally friendliest to
biology and now the one most bitterly divided over it, nineteenth-century
claims about universal human nature were supplanted in the early twentieth
century by Franz Boas and colleagues, who conducted detailed studies of
particular cultures. By the mid-1960s, any role for biological commonalities
in cultural anthropology was effectively foreclosed when Clifford Geertz
remarked that &quot;our ideas, our values, our acts, even our emotions
are, like our nervous system itself, cultural products.&quot; </P>

<P>As neo-Marxist and behaviorist theories of the tabula rasa human gained
ground over the next decade, other disciplines followed anthropology's
lead. So completely was sociology purged of biology that when Nicholas
Petryszak analyzed twenty-four introductory sociology textbooks in 1979,
he found that all assumed that &quot;any consideration of biological factors
believed to be innate to the human species is completely irrelevant in
understanding the nature of human behavior and society.&quot; In general,
by the seventies, antibiologism had become the rallying cry of academic
liberals and feminists -- and the apparent defense of human freedom against
the iron chains of nature. </P>

<P>It was only with the arrival of the intellectual movements lumped under
the term &quot;postmodernism&quot; that academic antibiologism began to
sound perilously like religious creationism. Postmodernist perspectives
go beyond a critique of the misuses of biology to offer a critique of biology
itself, extending to all of science and often to the very notion of rational
thought. In the simplified form it often takes in casual academic talk,
postmodernism can be summed up as a series of tenets that include a wariness
of meta-narratives (meaning grand explanatory theories), a horror of essentialism
(extending to the idea of any innate human traits) and a fixation on &quot;power&quot;
as the only force limiting human freedom -- which at maximum strength precludes
claims about any universal human traits while casting doubt on the use
of science to study our species or anything at all. Glibly applied, postmodernism
portrays evolutionary theory as nothing more than a sexist and racist storyline
created by Western white men. </P>

<P>The deepest motives behind this new secular version of creationism are
understandable. We are different from other animals. Language makes us
more plastic and semiotically sophisticated, and renders us deeply susceptible
to meanings and ideas. As for power, Foucault was right: It's everywhere,
and it shapes our preferences and categories of thought, as well as our
life chances. Many dimensions of human life that feel utterly &quot;natural&quot;
are in fact locally constructed, a hard-earned lesson too easy to forget
and too important not to publicize. The problem is that the combined vigor
of antibiologism and simplified postmodernism has tended to obliterate
the possibility that human beings have anything in common, and to silence
efforts to explore this domain. Hence we have gone, in the space of a decade
or two, from what began as a healthy skepticism about the misuses of biology
to a new form of dogma. </P>

<P>As a biologically oriented researcher who has made controversial innatist
claims, Rutgers social theorist Robin Fox notes with irony that secular
creationist academics seem to have replaced the church as the leading opponents
of Darwinism: &quot;It's like they're responding to heresy.&quot; Stephen
Jay Gould, who has devoted much of his career to critiquing misuses of
biology, also detects parallels between religious and academic creationist
zeal. While holding that many aspects of human life are local and contingent,
he adds, &quot;Some facts and theories are truly universal (and true) --
and no variety of cultural traditions can change that...we can't let a
supposedly friendly left-wing source be exempt from criticism from anti-intellectual
positions.&quot; </P>

<P>The new creationism is not simply a case of well-intended politics gone
awry; it represents a grave misunderstanding of biology and science generally.
Ironically, the creationists invest the natural sciences with a determinative
potency no thoughtful scientist would want to claim. Biology is rhetorically
yoked to &quot;determinism,&quot; a concept that threatens to clip our
wings and lay waste to our utopian visions, while culture is viewed as
a domain where power relations with other humans are the only obstacle
to freedom. </P>

<P>But these stereotypes of biological determinism and cultural malleability
don't hold up under scrutiny. For one thing, biology is not a dictatorship
-- genes work probabilistically, and their expression depends on interaction
with their environment. As even Richard Dawkins, author of <I>The Selfish
Gene</I> and a veritable Antichrist to contemporary creationists of both
the secular and Christian varieties, makes clear: &quot;It is perfectly
possible to hold that genes exert a statistical influence on human behaviour
while at the same time believing that this influence can be modified, overridden
or reversed by other influences.&quot; And if biology is not a dictatorship,
neither is culture a realm of perfect plasticity. The accumulated lessons
of ethnography -- and, paradoxically, postmodern theories of power themselves
-- suggest that even in the absence of biological constraints, it is not
easy to remold human cultures to suit our utopian visions. In fact, in
the extreme constructivist scenario borrowed by secular creationists, it's
hard to imagine who would have the will or the ability to orchestrate real
change: the people in power, who have no motivation to alter the status
quo, or the oppressed, whose choices, preferences and sentiments have been
so thoroughly shaped by the cultural hegemony of the elite? Judged solely
as a political stance, secular creationism is no less pessimistic than
the biologism it seeks to uproot. </P>

<P>Milder versions of the &quot;nature/nurture&quot; debate begat a synthesis:
&quot;There is no biology that is not culturally mediated.&quot; But giving
biology its due while taking cultural mediation into account requires inclusive
and complex thinking -- as Phoebe Ellsworth puts it: &quot;You need a high
tolerance of ambiguity to believe both that culture shapes things and that
we have a lot in common.&quot; Despite the ham-fisted efforts of early
sociobiologists, many (probably most) biologically based human universals
are not obvious to the naked eye or accessible to common sense. </P>

<P>Finally, many secular creationists are a few decades out of date on
the kind of &quot;human nature&quot; that evolutionary biology threatens
to impose on us. Feminists and liberal academics were perhaps understandably
alarmed by the aggressive &quot;man the hunter&quot; image that prevailed
in the sixties and seventies; and a major reason for denying the relevance
of evolution was a horror of the nasty, brutish cavemen we had supposedly
evolved from. But today, evolutionary theory has moved to a more modest
assessment of the economic contribution of big-game hunting (as opposed
to gathering and scavenging) and a new emphasis on the cooperative -- even
altruistic -- traits that underlie human sociality and intelligence. We
don't have to like what biology has to tell us about our ancestors, but
the fact is that they have become a lot more likable than they used to
be. </P>

<P>In portraying human beings as pure products of cultural context, the
secular creationist standpoint not only commits biological errors but defies
common sense. In the exaggerated postmodernist perspective appropriated
by secular creationists, no real understanding or communication is possible
between cultures. Since the meaning of any human practice is inextricable
from its locally spun semiotic web, to pluck a phenomenon such as &quot;ritual&quot;
or &quot;fear&quot; out of its cultural context is, in effect, to destroy
it. Certainly such categories have different properties from place to place,
and careful contextualization is necessary to grasp their local implications.
But as Ellsworth asks: &quot;At the level of detail of 'sameness' that
postmodernists are demanding, what makes them think that two people in
the same culture will understand each other?&quot; The ultimate postmodern
retort would be, of course, that we do not, but this nihilism does not
stand up to either common sense or deeper scrutiny. We manage to grasp
things about each other -- emotions, motives, nuanced (if imperfect) linguistic
meanings -- that couldn't survive communicative transmission if we didn't
have some basic emotional and cognitive tendencies in common. </P>

<P>The creationist rejection of innate human universals threatens not only
an intellectual dead end but a practical one. In writing off any biologically
based human commonality, secular creationists undermine the very bedrock
of the politics they claim to uphold. As Barbara Epstein of the History
of Consciousness Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, remarks:
&quot;If there is no human nature outside social construction, no needs
or capacities other than those constructed by a particular discourse, then
there is no basis for social criticism and no reason for protest or rebellion.&quot;
In fact, tacit assumptions of human similarity are embedded in the theories
of even such ostensible social constructionists as Marx, whose theory of
alienation assumes (in some interpretations, anyway) that there are authentic
human needs that capitalism fails to meet. </P>

<P>Would it really be so destructive to our self-esteem as a species to
acknowledge that we, like our primate relatives, are possessed of an inherited
repertory of potential responses and mental structures? Would we forfeit
all sense of agency and revolutionary possibility if we admitted that we,
like our primate relatives, are subject to the rules of DNA replication
(not to mention the law of gravity)? In their horror of &quot;determinism,&quot;
academic creationists seem to forget postmodernism's finest insight: that,
whatever else we may be, we are indeed creatures of symbol and &quot;text.&quot;
We may be, in many ways, constrained by our DNA, but we are also the discoverers
of DNA -- and, beyond that, the only living creature capable of representing
its biological legacy in such brilliant and vastly condensed symbols as
&quot;DNA.&quot; </P>

<P>The good news is that a break may be coming. In spite of the nose-thumbing
inspired by the Alan Sokal/<I>Social Text</I> hoax, constructive debates
and conversations between scientists and social theorists have been initiated
in newsletters, journals and conferences across the country. A few anthropology
departments, including those at Northwestern, Penn State and Emory, are
encouraging communication between their cultural and biological subfields.
And although interactionist work has not had adequate space to flourish,
achievements so far suggest that regardless of creationist disclaimers,
biological and cognitive universals may be acutely relevant to social theory.
Ann Stoler, an anthropologist, historian and scholar of Foucault at the
University of Michigan, agrees. By failing to take our innate cognitive
tendencies seriously, she writes, social constructionists may be dodging
the &quot;uncomfortable question&quot; as to whether oppressive ideologies
like racism and sexism &quot;acquire the weight...they do...because of
the ways in which they feed off and build upon [universal] categories of
the mind.&quot; As Ellsworth says, the meeting of human universals and
culture is &quot;where the interesting questions begin.&quot; </P>

<P>But for the time being it takes more than a nuanced mind to deal with
the interface of culture and biology. It takes courage. This climate of
intolerance, often imposed by scholars associated with the left, ill suits
an academic tradition rhetorically committed to human freedom. What's worse,
it provides intellectual backup for a political outlook that sees no real
basis for common ground among humans of different sexes, races and cultures.

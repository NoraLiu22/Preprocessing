					<h3 class="line">Howâ€™s Life?</h3>
					<p align="left">Since 1994 South Africa has made great progress in reducing absolute poverty by rolling out social grants for pensioners, the disabled and children. Access to education, housing, water, electricity and other services has been greatly broadened. As a result, well-being has increased substantially. Notwithstanding, South Africa performs poorly in many dimensions of well-being relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. It underperforms average in income, jobs, education, health, environmental quality, social connections, civic engagement, safety and life satisfaction. These assessments are based on available selected data.</p>
<p align="left">Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In South Africa,<strong>&nbsp;the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;9 338 a year</strong>, considerably less than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490 a year.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of employment,&nbsp;<strong>about 39% of people aged 15 to 64 in South Africa have a paid job</strong>, considerably below the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 44% of men are in paid work, compared with 33% of women.<strong>&nbsp;In South Africa, 15% of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, well above the OECD average of 10%, with 20% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 10% of women.</p>
<p align="left">Good education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>48% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, much lower than the OECD average of 79%. In terms of the quality of the education system,<strong>&nbsp;the average student scored lower than the OECD average of 488 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).</strong></p>
<p align="left">In terms of health,&nbsp;<strong>life expectancy at birth in South Africa is around 64 years</strong>, seven years lower than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 68 years, compared with 61 for men.&nbsp;<strong>The level of atmospheric PM2.5</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>is 28.5 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, well above the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In South Africa, <strong>72% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 84%.</p>
<p align="left">Concerning the public sphere, there is a moderate sense of community and moderate levels of civic participation in South Africa, where<strong>&nbsp;89% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need</strong>, less than the OECD average of 91%. <strong>Voter turnout,</strong>&nbsp;a measure of citizens' participation in the political process,&nbsp;<strong>was 66% during recent elections</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 69%.</p>
<p align="left">When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, South Africans gave it&nbsp;<strong>a 4.9 grade on average,&nbsp;much lower than the OECD average of 6.7.</strong></p>

<p align="left">Trust in government is essential for social cohesion and well-being. High voter turnout is a measure of citizens' participation in the political process. In the most recent elections for which data are available,&nbsp;<strong>voter turnout in South Africa was 66% of those registered</strong>&nbsp;below the OECD average turnout of 69%.</p>
<p align="left">Broader public engagement in the decision-making process is also important for holding the government to account and maintaining confidence in public institutions. The formal process for public engagement in developing laws and regulations is one way to measure the extent to which people can become involved in government decisions on key issues that affect their lives. In South Africa, the level of stakeholder engagement in developing regulations is lower than the OECD average of 2.1.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Co-creating the future</em></p>
<p align="left">South Africa&rsquo;s National Development Plan, known as &ldquo;Our future, make it work&rdquo;, launched in 2012, establishes a vision for the country through to 2030. To better involve citizens, the council managing the development of the plan established an inclusive engagement process, which brings together policy communities, community-based organisations, political parties, labour unions, business organisations, government departments, the Forum of South Africa Directors General, the Cabinet, and provinces and municipalities. Taking an innovative approach to consultation, stakeholders were engaged through a number of mediums, such as television and radio shows, newspaper inserts and co-edited press articles, roundtable discussions, fireside chats, social media and online brainstorming sessions, YouTube animations and a dedicated email address for written comments and submissions. This process is helping people to define overarching goals, build consensus and provided a common framework for action.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Humans are social creatures. The frequency of our contact with others and the quality of our personal relationships are thus crucial determinants of our well-being.</p>
<p align="left">A strong social network, or community, can provide emotional support during both good and bad times as well as provide access to jobs, services and other material opportunities. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>89% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in a time of need</strong>, below the OECD average of 91%.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">A weak social network can result in limited economic opportunities, a lack of contact with others, and eventually, feelings of isolation. Socially isolated individuals face difficulties integrating into society as a contributing member and fulfilling personal aspirations.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. South Africans go through&nbsp;<strong>fewer years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, than the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>48% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left">No data are available for South Africa, but evidence from other OECD countries suggests that the best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Collaborating to advance skills</em></p>
<p align="left">The South African government and non-governmental organisations have engaged in a number of initiatives to develop skills. The Massive Open Online Varsity (MOOV) project provides greater access to quality education through online courses from across the world. MOOV centres were set up in 12 public libraries in Johannesburg, targeting poor areas. Each centre accommodates 50 students and there are no fees or entry requirements. In the first 12 months after the project was launched, 8 000 students were registered and over 500 certificates from accrediting institutions were earned.</p>
<p align="left">The National Skills Fund is primarily used for investment in education and training, skills infrastructure development and skills development research. Examples of projects co-funded by the Fund include the Itukise Internships for Unemployed Graduates Programme and a dual-track apprenticeship pilot. The Itukise programme offers a paid 12-month internship in the private sector to help unemployed graduates get relevant work experience. In the first two years, around 1 500 people were placed in 169 companies. The dual-track apprenticeship pilot is based on the German and Swiss systems, combining school-based and workplace-based training. First implemented on three sites, the pilot has helped both colleges and employers, but more needs to be done to encourage employers to participate.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Increasing education resources</em></p>
<p align="left">The Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Development Initiative (ASIDI) programme was a one-off project to upgrade the infrastructure of 400 schools. The programme was expanded to address shortages of learning materials such as textbooks. Between 2013/14 and 2014/15 the share of learners with access to required textbooks in all grades and subjects increased from 92% to close to 100% coverage. Gauteng province has also committed to expanding the use of technology in education. It has started a pilot using smart boards, tablets and the requisite connectivity in selected schools in poor areas.

<p align="left">The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people&rsquo;s lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions,&nbsp;<strong>the health impacts of urban air pollution&nbsp;continue to worsen</strong>, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p align="left">PM2.5 &ndash; tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung &ndash; is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>PM2.5 levels are 28.5 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, higher than any country in the OECD, where the average is 14 micrograms per cubic meter and much higher than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the&nbsp;World Health Organization.</p>
<p align="left">Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>72% of people say they are satisfied with water quality,</strong>&nbsp;lower than the OECD average of 84%.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

It provides informal workers and disadvantaged entrepreneurs with training to provide effective waste management. Tedcor obtains waste treatment contracts with municipalities and subcontracts tasks to these small businesses. The company thus ensures regular demand for the entrepreneurs' services. This business model lowers the overall cost of the waste management services, meaning that waste collection services can be extended to previously underserved areas.</p>

<p align="left">Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care.&nbsp;<strong>Life</strong>&nbsp;<strong>expectancy at birth in South Africa stands at only 64 years</strong>, seventeen years below the OECD average of 81 years. Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher health care spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?"<strong>&nbsp;fewer people in South Africa reported themselves to be in good health</strong>&nbsp;than the OECD average of 69%.

<p align="left">Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people's lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. All of these elements help make a house a home. And of course there is the question whether people can afford adequate housing.</p>
<p align="left">Housing costs take up a large share of the household budget and represent the largest single expenditure for many individuals and families, by the time you add up elements such as rent, gas, electricity, water, furniture or repairs. In South Africa, households on average spend&nbsp;<strong>18% of their</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gross adjusted disposable income on keeping a roof over their heads</strong>, below the OECD average of 20%.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">In addition to housing costs it is also important to examine living conditions, such as the average number of rooms shared per person and whether households have access to basic facilities. The number of rooms in a dwelling, divided by the number of persons living there, indicates whether residents are living in crowded conditions. Overcrowded housing may have a negative impact on physical and mental health, relations with others and children's development. In addition, dense living conditions are often a sign of inadequate water and sewage supply. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>the average home contains less rooms per person</strong>, than the OECD average of 1.7 rooms per person. In terms of basic facilities however,&nbsp;<strong>only 64%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of dwellings in South Africa contain private access to an indoor flushing toilet</strong>, considerably lower than the OECD average of 97%.</p>

<p align="left">Having a job brings many important benefits, including: providing a source of income, improving social inclusion, fulfilling one's own aspirations, building self-esteem and developing skills and competencies. In South Africa&nbsp;<strong>about 39%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 has a paid job</strong>. This figure is much lower than the OECD employment average of 66%.</p>
<p align="left">Unemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at 17.9%</strong>, much higher than the OECD average of 1.3%.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality.&nbsp;<strong>South Africans earn per year, on average</strong>, much less than the OECD average of USD 49 165.</p>
<p align="left">Another essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In South Africa,&nbsp;<strong>workers face an expected loss of earnings if they become unemployed</strong> much higher than the OECD average of 5.1%.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

<p align="left">In South Africa, many people participate in the informal economy where the quality of jobs and access to training is low. At the Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator, young people are connected to employers looking for entry-level talent to help them get their start in the formal economy. This project is co-funded by the South African government under the Job Fund, and aims to match young people with potential employers through psychometric and qualitative assessments. Young people with at least upper secondary education are targeted in particular and training is provided for those testing with low levels of numeracy proficiency. Candidates are also provided with bridging courses to improve their employability. Since the project was first launched in 2011, Harambee has placed about 35 000 young people in 300 South African businesses.</p>

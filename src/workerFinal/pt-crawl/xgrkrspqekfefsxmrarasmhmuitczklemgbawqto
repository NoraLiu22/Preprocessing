<h1>Chord structure in medieval music</h1>

<p>For many musicians, especially those more familiar with other
styles, a fundamental early question concerns the chords of medieval
music.  While a description of chords can become rather technical,
the interested amateur will find it fascinating when supplemented
by <a href="../beginlst/medieval.htm">recorded examples</a>, and
when considered in small pieces.  The following discussion is
written in an open and inclusive manner, and should remain approachable
for the careful reader.</p>

<p>The use of chords, or what we might call &quot;vertical
structure&quot; to distinguish it from the &quot;horizontal
structure&quot; defined principally by melody, is a topic which is
both crucial for understanding the music itself and illustrative
of general conclusions about <a href="../misc/homophony.html">polyphonic
music</a>.  First it is important to understand that medieval
composers did not use &quot;harmony&quot; in a sense which classical
composers would have understood.  This is perhaps most easily
grasped by realizing that the lowest voice of many of the most
elaborate polyphonic works of the period consists of a pre-existing
melody, often plainchant.  Other melodies were added to these, and
each layer would have its own horizontal concerns.  Of course, in
the greatest masterpieces, the vertical elements add something
tangible to this mix, without sacrificing the horizontal beauty.</p>

<p>Cadential motion, i.e. the way in which individual phrases are
brought to a close, is crucial for understanding this structure,
and so must play a major role in subsequent discussion.  Such ending
motion is crucial to horizontal ideas as well, just as the
&quot;final&quot; (or last note) of a <a href="../misc/modes.html">mode</a>
is fundamental to defining it.  Of course modality is a theoretical
idea specifically developed for application to the system of
<a href="../misc/gregorian.html">Gregorian</a> plainchant which
underlies medieval polyphony, and so is never too far removed from
polyphonic music.  Nonetheless, it is generally not possible to
assign modality to polyphonic music of this period, unless it is
notionally assigned based on that of the lowest voice, a common
technique.  Ideas to let this modality dictate chord structure,
and thus accidentals in other voices, are frequently flawed.</p>

<p>Much of Early Music history can be viewed as a series of changes
to cadential formulas &amp; combinations.  For instance, the
<a href="../cds/vir45135.htm">earliest Western polyphony</a>
generally cadences on the unison.  Shortly afterward (by epochal
standards, anyway) composers start cadencing on octaves &amp; fifth
combinations.  Eventually this gives way to more frequent use of
the third, and then to fully third-based cadences in the high
Renaissance.  At this point, cadential formulas become more evidently
analogous to the triadic system which today we call &quot;common
practice&quot; harmony.  Nonetheless, the differing idioms of these
intervening centuries provide many stimulating ideas on chord
construction &amp; combination.  A developing set of articles here,
most by Margo Schulter, will hopefully provide a glimpse of some
of this richness.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="13c.html">Thirteenth-Century Polyphony - A Quick Guide
to Combinations and Cadences</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This article provides a fine orientation to the general context
in which discussions on chord structure in medieval music will take
place, illustrating examples from what is perhaps the most dynamic
&amp; exciting period in the history of the development of
polyphony.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="pyth.html">Pythagorean Tuning and Medieval Polyphony</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This article is even more extensive, surveying what is known
about medieval approaches to tuning, the Pythagorean system in
particular, as well as a broader history of Western tuning in
general.  It provides a wide range of informative discussion on
tuning issues in polyphony.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="hex.html">Hexachords, solmization, and musica
ficta</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This extensive article discusses the role of hexachords &amp;
solmization in medieval music, how they affect musica ficta choices,
and how they interact with other concerns of the era.</p>

<p>The articles on hexachords &amp; Pythagorean tuning serve to
illuminate underlying concepts which frame the idea of medieval
chord structure per se.  In many ways, issues of tuning and
solmization are sufficiently different from the modern reader's
intuition that without these discussions, it can be difficult to
appraise the medieval approach to vertical structure.</p>

<p>With some luck, and some interest from readers, other articles
of this type can be developed.</p>

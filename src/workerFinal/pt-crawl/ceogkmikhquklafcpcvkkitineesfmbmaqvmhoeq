In our everyday social lives we routinely understand the behaviour of others by 
attributing mental states to them. This book is the first to draw together from 
a range of disciplines research into the origins and emergence of this fundamental 
and astounding ability--the use of a natural 'theory of mind.'... In developmental 
psychology researchers have begun to trace the child's developing understanding 
of such concepts as desires, emotional states and intentions. Ethologists and 
comparative psychologists have asked how and why an ability to read the mind of 
another might emerge in the course of evolution. In computer science, the question 
is how to shape the emergence within computational systems of representations 
of the minds of others, be it to copy their expertise or to interact with users 
in a more 'human' fashion.... This volume brings together contributions from these 
three disciplines, with others from philosophy and anthropology, on the central 
topic of the emergence of theories of mind. The interdisciplinary cross-talk it 
initiates ranges from the conceptual and methodological foundations to exploration 
of common patterns in machine, animal and man.

of a theory of mind</b>. <a href="#top">Whiten (1991)</a>, pp. 19-38. 
<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) the term 'mind,' as I am using it, is an everyday 
one rather than a scientific one, it is a term within an everyday theory; this 
everyday theory construes overt human behaviour as the consequence of covert mental 
states, such as the actors' beliefs, hopes, ideas, and desires; when do children 
adopt this everyday mentalistic construal of human behaviour... this question 
has a complicated and fascinating answer; to be brief, however, I am going to 
answer simply: at three years... to elaborate on this simplistic answer I discuss 
three points; sketch what I believe constitutes our everyday theory of mind; this 
analysis revolves around characterizing everyday mentalism as a brief-desire psychology; 
review some recent findings showing that children as young as three years understand 
and utilize belief-desire psychology and hence evidence a first theory of mind; 
suggest that children younger than three, say two-year olds, fail to understand 
belief-desire psychology; they utilize instead, a simple desire psychology.

studies of children</b>. <a href="#top">Whiten (1991)</a>, pp. 51-61. 
<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) make inferences about children's mindreading abilities 
from naturalistic observations; our strategy has been to examine a broad range 
of aspects of children's behaviour and conversation, with different partners and 
in different emotional settings: their disputes and arguments, their empathetic 
and cooperative behaviour, their discussion of other people, their fantasy play 
and jokes, their response to the interactions between others... the evidence from 
these different aspects of children's behavior, drawn chiefly from three longitudinal 
studies of children at home with their mothers and siblings, has been brought 
together and discussed in a recent book entitled "The Beginnings of Social Understanding" 
(Dunn, 1988)... this chapter will focus on the implications of that evidence, 
and of further data drawn from an ongoing study in the US, for two important issues 
relevant to the themes of this book; the first issue is the nature of very young 
children's understanding of psychological states in others, and the second is 
the issue of what contexts and processes are involved in the development of that 
understanding.

Evidence for a modular mechanism of development?</b> <a href="#top">Whiten (1991)</a>, 
pp. 63-78. 
<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) there are three broad possibilities for explaining 
autism; (1) there is a basic affective disorder which somehow produces the other 
impairments in cognition and surface behaviour; (2) there are two independent 
basic disorders in autism, one affective, the other cognitive, which jointly produce 
the surface impairments; (3) there is a basic cognitive deficit in high-ability 
autism which produces the secondary consequences, including affective disorder 
and impairment in social and communicative behaviour; it is this last possibility 
that I want to argue for.

Abstract: (from the chapter) explore a rule-based computational approach to a 
particular problem in ETM (early theories of mind), the concept of agency, then 
proceed to describe the current model of agency, and finally turn to a discussion 
of related issues such as transition mechanisms, concepts related agency and continuity 
in development... the concept of agency explains that a being moves or behaves 
on its own, without the influence of external causation.

Abstract: (from the chapter) the possession of a symbol system is required in 
order to achieve the full semantics that are typically associated with the capacity

statement is true, we will focus on the possible role of such representations 
in the various models of planning and plan recognition that have been developed 
within AI (artificial intelligence).

<center>
  &nbsp;
</center>
Abstract: (from the chapter) in our initial survey of tactical deception in primates 
(Whiten and Byrne, 1988a), we emphasized the implications for primate psychology 
of obtaining good evidence which implied an understanding of others' intentions 
(and those of deception) by the animal; we then attempted to say what would convince 
us to accept an explanation, and evaluated--usually in the negative--the evidence 
available at the time; we now have a much greater corpus of data available against 
which to test the preliminary conculsions made at that time, and to do so is the 
purpose of this chapter.

<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) most psychological research on teasing has looked 
at the very negative effects which teasing can have; the more positive forms of 
teasing have occasionally been mentioned in the psychological literature ...but 
have never been systematically, or even directly, studied; I believe it is an 
important mode of interaction for three reasons, of which I shall in this paper 
be discussing the latter two; for its effects on relationships; for what it shows 
about the understanding of others' minds; for its links with deception and pretence... 
infants' engagement with others' intentions and expectations; physical and psychological 
explanation in understanding others; pretending.

<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) look at two verbal forms of teasing and deception; 
jokes and lies; my aim is to show how children's understanding of falsehood is 
related to their developing understanding of people's intentions and beliefs... 
focus primarily on the child's understanding of jokes and lies because the distinction 
between these two acts seems to rely on distinguishing the higher-order intentions 
and beliefs (i.e. what A wants B to believe).

Reading minds or reading behaviour? Tests for a theory of mind in monkeys</b>. 
<a href="#top">Whiten (1991)</a>, pp. 175-194. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Abstract: (from the chapter) describe two experiments designed to investigate 
the ability of monkeys to attribute mental states to others and to distinguish 
between their own knowledge and the knowledge of others... the first experiment 
examines the issue of informing, and considers whether individuals take into account 
their audiences state of mind when alerting them to the presence of food or danger; 
do signallers recognize ignorance in their audience, and, if so, do they make 
any special effort to alert ignorant individuals more than knowledgable ones... 
the second experiment considers the extent to which a monkey's behaviour is influenced 
by her audience's apparent presence, as opposed to her audiences knowledge; do 
monkeys take into account theory of visual perspective when monitoring one another, 
or do they recognize that another individual's perspective, and hence the knowledge 
derived from it, can differ from their own.

Abstract: (from the chapter) theory of mind, like any other major competence, 
can be studied on both a perceptual and conceptual level, and we will provide 
examples of both levels in this paper; on the perceptual level one relies almost 
exclusively on habituation/dishabituation procedures... consider now the conceptual 
level on which we also study theory of mind; here we supplant habituation/dishabituation 
with higher-order measures involving judgment and choice... the infant's theory 
of self-propelled objects; the conceptual level: next versus relevant; experiment: 
next versus relevant; the chimpanzee's theory of mind: the current verdict.

<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) in attempting ...deception, a child evidences two 
cognitive abilities which go beyond any primary representation of the world whose 
function is to represent perceived reality as faithfully as possible: the ability 
to pretend that something has happened which really has not; and an ability to 
model the mind of another human; we here suggest that a comparative, evolutionary 
approach to the same phenomena now supports and extends the idea that pretence 
and mindreading are part of a fundamental cognitive pattern... consider if pretence 
and mindereading in non-human primates fit this pattern.

<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) recent work in developmental psychology has shown 
that young children explain and predict behaviour in terms of every-day mental 
concepts, notably beliefs and desires; from this evidence, some have concluded 
that children adopt a theory of mind; I shall argue instead that children engage 
in an increasingly sophisticated process of mental simulation that allows them 
to make quasi-theoretical predictions... mental simulation depends on the capacity 
to engage in two successive steps: (1) to imagine having a particular desire of 
belief, and (2) to imagine the actions, thoughts or emotions that would ensue 
if one were to have those desires or beliefs; the products of such a simulation 
can then be attributed to other people who do have the simulated desires or beliefs... 
my analysis incorporates the notion of role-taking ...but seeks to show how such 
a process might operate in early childhood; it provides a framework for interpreting 
two reasonably well-established facts: (1) the increasing accuracy with which 
children can diagnose mental states, and (2) the deficits shown by autistic children 
in making such diagnoses... the capacity for pretence; reasoning with pretend 
premises; altering default settings.

<a name="Carrithers"></a><b>Carrithers, Michael. Narrativity: Mindreading and 
making societies</b>. <a href="#top">Whiten (1991)</a>, pp. 317-331. 
<p>
Abstract: (from the chapter) propose that we might usefully think of a distinct 
capacity, narrativity, a property of the human species which differentiates it 
from other species; mindreading or higher-order intentionality, I argue, is a 
necessary foundation for narrativity; it is narrativity which allows humans to 
grasp a longer past and a more intricately conceived future, as well as a more 
variegated social environment; narrativity supports the more elaborative and mutable 
sociality which differentiates humans from their cousins, the other social primates... 
My arguments therefore are phylogenetic and sociological rather than ontogenetic 
and psychological; if they are acceptable, however, they should also be able to 
be translated into a developmental perspective.

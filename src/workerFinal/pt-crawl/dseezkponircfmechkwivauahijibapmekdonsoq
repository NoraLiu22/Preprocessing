<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Native American Indian Clothing and Regalia</H1>

Originally, there were many different traditional Native American clothing styles in North America. 
Nearly every tribe had its own distinctive style of dress, and the people could often tell each 
other's identities by looking at their tribal clothes, headdresses, and ornamentation.

In most tribes, Native American men wore <B>breechclouts or breechcloths</B> (a long rectangular piece of 
hide or cloth tucked over a belt, so that the flaps fell down in front and behind), sometimes with leather 
<B>leggings</B> attached in colder climates. Here's a page of 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/breechcloth.htm">breechcloth and legging pictures</a>. 
In some tribes Indian clothing for men was a short kilt or fur trousers instead of a breechcloth. 
Most American Indian men did not use shirts, but Plains Indian warriors did wear special buckskin <B>war shirts</B> 
decorated with ermine tails, hair, and intricate quillwork and beadwork. Here are pictures of two traditional Sioux 
<A href="http://www.artsmia.org/beauty-honor-tradition/preview-beadwork.html">war shirts</a>.
Native American clothing for women usually consisted of <B>skirts and leggings</B>, though the length, design, 
and material of the skirts varied from tribe to tribe. In some cultures, Indian women's shirts were optional and were 
treated more like coats. In others, Native American women always wore tunics or mantles in public. And in some tribes 
women usually wore one-piece <B>American Indian dresses</B> instead, like this 
<a href="http://www.artcom.com/Museums/vs/mr/95.jpg">Cheyenne buckskin dress</a>. 
Nearly all Native Americans had some form of <B>moccasin</B> (a sturdy leather shoe) or <B>mukluk</B> 
(heavier boot), with the styles of footwear differing from tribe to tribe (as you can see from 
<a href="http://www.nativetech.org/clothing/moccasin/mocmap.html">these mocasin pictures</a>). Most 
tribes used <B>cloaks</B> in colder weather, but some of the northern tribes wore Inuit-style 
<B>fur parkas</B> instead. Most variable of all were <B>headgear</B> and <B>formal clothing</B>, 
which were different in nearly every tribe. Here's a page illustrating 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/hair.htm">traditional hairstyles</a> from several different tribes.
<BR><BR>
After colonization, the clothes of Native Americans began to change. For one thing, as Indian tribes were driven from 
their ancient lands and forced into closer contact with each other, they began to borrow some of each other's 
tribal dress, so that fringed buckskin clothing, 
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/headdresses.htm#warbonnets">feather headdresses</a>, 
and woven blankets became popular among Indians outside of the tribes in which they originated. 
For another, Indians began to adapt some articles of European costume to their own style, 
decorating cloth garments with characteristic Native American beadwork, embroidery, and designs. 
These clothes were not original to the Americas, but by the 1800's they were recognized by anyone 
viewing them as American Indian apparel. Such post-colonial native dress 
includes <a href="http://www.civilization.ca/aborig/stones/clothing/I22701.htm">beaded jackets and shirts</a>, 
<a href="http://www.littlecrowtradingpost.com/pageshirt.htm">ribbon shirts</a>, 
<a href="http://www.littlecrowtradingpost.com/East14.jpg">Seminole patchwork skirts</a>, 
<a href="http://www.littlecrowtradingpost.com/FS26.jpg">satin shawls</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cvvm.com/cvvmzine/sweater.htm">woolen sweaters</a>, 
<a href="http://www.littlecrowtradingpost.com/Ribw1.jpg">broad ribbon applique</a>, 
<a href="http://www.littlecrowtradingpost.com/pagejingle.htm">jingle dresses</a>, and 
the <a href="http://www.littlecrowtradingpost.com/East5.jpg">Cherokee tear dress</a>. 
Today, most Native Americans wear contemporary American and Canadian clothes in their daily life<B>;</b> 
however, unique American Indian clothing styles still exist. Some traditional American Indian garments, 
such as buckskins, ribbon dresses, and beaded moccasins, are still worn in many tribes, particularly to formal events. 
Others, such as breech<img src="singledot.png">cloth, leggings, headdress and dance shawl, are only worn at powwows and religious ceremonies. 
In general, American Indians use the word <B>regalia</b> for traditional clothes which are used for ceremonial 
occasions. Some native people find the phrase "Native American costume" offensive, due to long 
association with hurtful red-faced Halloween costumes.
</p>
If you are looking to buy native regalia or other clothes that were actually made 
by Native Americans--either because it's important to you to have the real thing or because you want 
to support native people with your purchase--then here is our list of American Indian clothing designers 
whose garments are for sale online. We have grouped them into
<B>Traditional Native American Clothing</b> (both ordinary Indian clothes and ceremonial regalia),  
<B>Contemporary Native American Clothing</b> (modern clothes like tee-shirts made with native designs), and 
<B>Native American Designer Clothes</b> (contemporary Indian clothing styles designed as wearable art and priced accordingly). 
If you have a website of Native American clothes to add to this list, 
<A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">let us know</A>. We gladly advertise any individual 
native artist or native-owned clothing store here free of charge, provided that all clothes were made by 
tribally recognized American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists.
<BR><BR>
Thank you for your interest in Native American clothing!

Since all of these traditional Native American clothes are handmade and many are custom-made, they don't usually
have a large inventory of identical items. So if you love an artist's work but they don't seem to have the
right size, color, or style currently for sale, I recommend you contact them with your ideas. Many of these artists will 
make native clothes to your specifications, and others have a much larger selection of clothing in their store 
than they have featured for sale on their website.

<B>About us:</b> This website belongs to Native Languages of the Americas, a <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/help.htm">non-profit 
organization</a> dedicated to preserving and promoting endange<img src="singledot.png">red Native American languages. 
We are not artists ourselves, so if you are interested in buying some of the Native American Indian clothes 
featured on this page, please contact the artists directly. Though we have featured only Native Indian clothing and regalia 
identified with the name and tribal affiliation of each artist, we haven't 
called the tribal offices to check up on any of them, and we only know a few of them personally. 
This is not an exhaustive list of American Indian clothing--if you would like us to add your native clothing 
site to this page, please <A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">contact us</A> with your 
URL and tribal affiliation. We advertise any individual native artist or 
native-owned art business here free of charge. We do <U>not</u> link to clothing or regalia which is 
not made by tribally recognized American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists. And finally, websites do 
expire and change hands, so use your common sense and this general rule of thumb<B>:</b> if the creator 
of each individual outfit is not identified by name and specific tribe, 
you are probably not looking at authentic American Indian clothes.

<p>Communities around the world have responded to language endangerment with unique and effective approaches. The Sustaining Minoritized Languages in Europe (SMiLE) project shares some of the accumulated knowledge about language revitalization efforts to help language use grow worldwide.</p>
<p>Language revitalization efforts can be formal or informal; they can be community-wide or initiated by small groups. They can focus on maintaining a language in bilingual contexts, revitalizing a language that has skipped one or more generations of active speakers, or they can awaken a language that has not been spoken for a generation or much longer. These initiatives have accumulated knowledge about language revitalization in practice: how they started; how they sustain and build their motivation even through political, economic, and cultural changes; and how they manage issues in language policy and planning that challenge all language efforts.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage established SMiLE as an interdisciplinary and international research program, examining several minoritized language communities and their revitalization initiatives. In Europe, some language programs have continued in various forms for over a hundred years, and although language revitalization is community-driven and responsive to local traditions and concerns, efforts everywhere can learn from each other in how they work through common problems.</p>
<p>The SMiLE  research project produced seven in-depth case studies,  accessible here, that  focus on how language revitalization programs and efforts sustain and build on  their accomplishments over time. In doing so, they reveal how community-driven motivations and efforts not  only survive and grow but how they gain control—or agency—over the future of  their languages. In  addition, the primary researchers published a volume exploring how grassroots  actors shape and propel language revitalization.</p>

<p><i>Afrolatinidad: Art & Identity in D.C.</i> is an interview series highlighting the vitality of the local Afro-Latinx community. Before the term Afro-Latinx entered popular discourse, Latin Americans of the Diaspora have been sharing their stories through artistic manifestations online and in community spaces throughout the district. Their perspectives are intersectional in nature of existing in between spaces of Blackness and Latinidad.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Case Studies</h2>
          <div class="link-underline">  
				
			<p class="top-20">In 2017, the Center granted Collaborative Research Awards to six research teams headed by two to three principal researchers: community-based scholars, language advocates, academic researchers, policy experts, instructors, and others. The selections were based on the merit of the proposals, a team&rsquo;s connections with the source community, and the goal to have a balanced geographical and language family spread in the case studies.</p>
            <p>Over the next eighteen months, the teams carried out research, using interviews, participant observations, and existing literature and program records to build their case studies. Because the principal researchers already had ongoing expertise and research in the communities, the case studies also reflect this rich knowledge set. In addition, the teams and advisory board met at three collaborative workshops to discuss the questions and findings. </p>
            <p>The case studies represent various types of language efforts and communities. Two study sites were grassroots programs or organizations: Semente in Galicia, Spain, and Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne in County Kerry, Ireland. Three sites looked at small language communities in their traditional heartland areas. These three all had internal comparisons: Greko and Griko, two Greek languages in Italy; the Upper and Lower Sorbian communities in Lusatia, Germany; and North Frisian, with different dialects spoken on the islands and mainland in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The sixth case study was situated in the long history of Occitan language revitalization and the larger political lens of the newly formed Occitanie province in France and then focused on the current activities in the Toulouse area. </p>
            <p>In order to produce comparable profiles across such differing communities and programs, each research team was responsible for answering <a href="https://folklife-media.si.edu/docs/folklife/smile/SMiLE_Research_Questions.pdf" target="_blank">research questions</a> developed by the advisory board. The questions were formulated with a wide range of stakeholders in mind, including program staff and administrators, language advocates, language learners, teachers, family members, policy makers, culture bearers, and others. The first set of questions were used to build a more traditional outline of the community or program and to provide context for the rest. They included questions designed to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>explore the use of the minority language in new domains, with new modes of transmission, with new and emerging speakers. </li>
              <li>reveal patterns in community responses to internal and external influences regarding their use of their languages. </li>
              <li>explore the interplay between social processes and individual motivations for the maintenance of a minoritized language. </li>
              <li>reveal new or changing patterns in the interactions of <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00120-EN.pdf" target="_blank">language vitality indicators</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We encourage anyone to use these questions for their own research or in self-reflection and assessments of their own programs.</p>
            <p>The research teams completed their field work and case studies in 2019. Several   teams held community-wide meetings to present and discuss their findings. The teams collected more data than ended up in the case studies, so while the SMiLE research project was formally completed in 2019, publications and outcomes continue.</p>

Although it is Ireland&rsquo;s primary official language, the number of daily speakers outside the education system is estimated at less than 80,000.

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
In September 2000, the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB), the national library of The Netherlands, teamed up with IBM-Netherlands in the project DNEP-i (Deposit of Netherlands Electronic Publications-implementation) to actually create solutions for preservation and long-term access of electronic publications (ep's). In the same month, the British Library signed a contract with IBM-UK to develop a deposit system.</p>

<p>Starting several years ago, the KB engaged in local and international projects (e.g., NEDLIB) 
&lt;<a href="http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib">http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib</a>&gt; toward building an operational system. Within two years, the KB and IBM will build an OAIS-compliant deposit system for the Deposit of Netherlands Electronic Publications (DNEP). The project also includes applied research for creating the long-term planning function of the OAIS mode  &lt;<a href="http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib/results/OAISreviewbyNEDLIB.html">http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib/results/OAISreviewbyNEDLIB.html</a>&gt;. Both the emulation and the canonical transformation approaches are being considered. For the latter approach, a proof of concept for data preservation is executed. For information on these approaches, see &lt;<a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/u/gladney/Lorie.pdf">http://www.almaden.ibm.com/u/gladney/Lorie.pdf</a>&gt; and 
&lt;<a href="http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib/results/emulationpreservationreport.pdf">http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib/results/emulationpreservationreport.pdf</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The strategy</strong><br>
In order to preserve ep's and to guarantee long-term access to the information contained in them, the KB has adopted NEDLIB (Networked European Deposit Libary) guidelines. Essentially these guidelines include two steps: creation of a high quality and well controlled environment (deposit system) for storage and maintenance of ep's; and transfer of the ep's from their original environment to the deposit environment. One of the NEDLIB guidelines requires the deposit system  be designed and implemented as a separate entity within the organization's Information and Communication Technolgy (ICT) environment. </p>

<p>Before starting the DNEP-i project, in 1999 the KB investigated the feasibility of obtaining an operational deposit system through a Request for Information (RFI). In essence, such a system should support three main functions: archiving, preserving, and long-term access. The KB concluded that the  archiving and preserving functions could be obtained from the ICT market. For long-term access, it seemed possible to commission applied research that, within a few years, would probably result in the required functionality.</p>

<p><strong>The realization</strong><br>
After the promising RFI response, the KB set up a European tendering procedure to find a partner to build an operational deposit system. This Request for Proposal (RFP) procedure was innovative in that the KB only made up a detailed list of functional specifications, whereas the technical solutions had to be proposed completely by the suppliers. The KB provided as much information as possible and organized meetings for interested parties so the parties could form alliances to offer solutions. Everything was done to stimulate the interested parties to think seriously about tackling the problem in a way that would achieve the best possible result. Information about both the RFI and RFP can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.kb.nl/dnep-project">http://www.kb.nl/dnep-project</a>&gt;. </p>

<p>Following the RFP procedure, IBM Netherlands was selected as supplier of hardware and software and as system developer. On one hand, IBM offered a system for large-scale archival storage and preservation of electronic material based on the OAIS-model. On the other hand, IBM offered a practical study on the issue of long-term preservation solutions. The KB demanded that design of the system and study of the long-term issue would be strictly connected to one another. </p>

<p>The DNEP-i project began in September 2000. As indicated above, the project is divided in two parts: design and implementation of the deposit system, and applied research for long-term access. The deposit system must meet the demands of scalability, openness and modularity. The KB formulated these demands to make the system durable. In addition, the results of the long-term preservation (LTP) study had to be applicable to the deposit system. Thus, in the near future an operational LTP-module can be fitted into to the system. IBM has developed the data model of the system taking this into account. </p> 

<p>The KB insisted that the LTP study lead to practical solutions, instead of to another research report in this field. The LTP working group performing the study and providing a proof of concept is chaired by IBM, and the group consists of KB experts in the field of document handling, as well as Raymond Lorie of IBM USA 
and Jeff Rothenberg of RAND Europe.  In addition, the British Library preservation officer is involved in the working group as an observer.  Information about the project DNEP-implementation can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.kb.nl/dnep-project">http://www.kb.nl/dnep-project</a>&gt;.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
The joint effort of the KB and IBM in the DNEP-i project will result next year in an OAIS-compliant operational deposit system as well as pave the path for the development of a Preservation Planning module. Up to now, this innovative and complicated project is developing successfully and on schedule. As DNEP-i project manager, I consider critical successes that the project was scoped carefully and that both partners, the KB and IBM, have discussed, in advance and in detail, the requirements for the system. It took three months to compose a detailed contract between the KB and IBM, but after that, both parties knew exactly what to expect of each other. Furthermore, the focus of the project is carefully maintained.  Last, but not least, the two project partners, the KB and IBM, enjoy open and positive cooperation.</p>

<h3 class="blue">The Z39.50 Interoperability Testbed, Phase 1 Testing</h3>

<p class="italics">

&lt;<a href="mailto:wemoen@unt.edu">wemoen@unt.edu</a>&gt;</p>

<p>The Z39.50 Interoperability Testbed (Z-Interop) Project &lt;<a href="http://www.unt.edu/zinterop/">http://www.unt.edu/zinterop/</a>&gt; invites integrated library system vendors, Z39.50 developers, and individual libraries to participate in Phase 1 interoperability testing.</p>

<p>Z-Interop is an applied research and demonstration project funded by the U.S. federal Institute of Museum and Library Services &lt;<a href="http://www.imls.gov/">http://www.imls.gov/</a>&gt; through a National Leadership Grant awarded the School of Library and Information Sciences &lt;<a href="http://www.unt.edu/slis/">http://www.unt.edu/slis/</a>&gt; and the Texas Center for Digital Knowledge &lt;<a href="http://www.txcdk.org/">http://www.txcdk.org/</a>&gt; at the University of North Texas (UNT).  Z-Interop is developing rigorous methodologies, test procedures, and measures to assess interoperability between systems using the ANSI/NISO Z39.50 standard protocol for information retrieval.  The goal of Z-Interop is to improve Z39.50 semantic interoperability among libraries for information access and resource sharing.</p>

<p>Specifically, Z-Interop provides a technically and organizationally trusted testing environment for Z39.50 clients and servers configured to support the <em>Bath Profile: An International Z39.50 Specification for Library Applications</em> &lt;<a href="http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/bath/bp-current.htm">http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/bath/bp-current.htm</a>&gt; or the <em>U.S. National Z39.50 Profile for Library Applications</em> (current draft &lt;<a href="http://www.unt.edu/zprofile/Profile/specifications.htm">http://www.unt.edu/zprofile/Profile/specifications.htm</a>&gt;).</p>

<p>A team of researchers at UNT is conducting research, prototyping components of the testbed, and developing policies and procedures for interoperability testing.  The Z-Interop testbed consists of the following components:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Z39.50 profiles</strong>: Current initiatives have produced the <em>Bath Profile: An International Z39.50 Specification for Library Applications and Resource Discovery</em> and the <em>U.S. National Z39.50 Profile for Library Applications</em>.  Z-Interop testing is based on the specifications in these profiles.</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Test dataset</strong>: OCLC has provided a weighted sample of approximately 400,000 MARC 21 records from its WorldCat database.  The Z-Interop research team used various tools and procedures to "understand" the content of the records to determine records that should be returned in test searches.</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Reference implementations</strong>: SIRSI and Sea Change corporations have contributed products that serve as reference implementations.  SIRSI's Unicorn integrated library system serves as a reference implementation for the Z39.50 server and the information retrieval system (in the form of its online catalog).  Sea Change's Bookwhere 2000 product serves as a reference implementation for the Z39.50 client.  The Z-Interop research team, SIRSI, and Sea Change configured the reference implementations according to the Z39.50 profiles.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Test searches and results</strong>:  For bibliographic database searches defined in the profiles, Z-Interop provides a set of test searches with search terms.  Analysis of the test dataset identified records that meet the search criteria.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Benchmarks</strong>:  Benchmarks for Z-Interop testing are established by executing the test searches using the testbed reference implementations.</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Policies and procedures</strong>: Detailed instructions and systematic procedures, along with published policies, exist for the operation of the testbed and for participants wanting to go through interoperability testing.</li></ul>

<p>A Call for Participation available on the Z-Interop website details the Phase 1 testing opportunities.</p>

<h3 class="blue">Creating a National Fine Art Education Digital Collection - the UK's Visual Arts Data Service Investigates the Feasibility of Curating a Virtual, Distributed Collection</h3>

<p class="italics">

&lt;<a href="mailto:polly@vads.ahds.ac.uk">polly@vads.ahds.ac.uk</a>&gt;</p>

<p>Over the past few years, the Visual Arts Data Service has been concerned with providing, promoting and preserving digital resources, created throughout the UK, that relate to the visual arts.  In so doing, VADS not only delivers a cross-searchable image database of significant UK-held art collections, but also has become an expert in the field of image digitization, metadata production and related issues.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, the creation of a National Fine Art Education Digital Collection is being investigated and implemented by VADS.  In this new feasibility study, it is proposed that the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of works held within UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) will be hand-picked and delivered through a Virtual Collection, therefore serving as a high quality showcase of British Fine Art practice, generated by the alumni (both teachers and students) from the art schools and institutes in the UK.</p> 

<p>VADS intends, through the creation of this pilot resource and feasibility study, to define best practices for the digitization and delivery of distributed Institute-held collections of Fine Art Education related materials. The sample will consist of works held in as many as 10 collections, along with the full digitization of the rich Council for National Academic Award's Art Collection, which includes work by many extremely important figures in British Art, such as Henry Moore, Bridget Riley and Richard Hamilton.</p>

<p>Issues investigated will include: copyright clearance, image digitization, direct digital capture, metadata creation and research, collection and item level descriptors, virtual delivery, and digital preservation. VADS will use the expertise it has gained to date to develop solutions for this distributed environment, cutting through institutional barriers and practices, and providing practical and prescriptive resolutions.</p>

<p>While establishing a protocol for sharing resources across institutions, the quality and relevance of individual works is paramount in order to guarantee the project's success. To that end, VADS has established a Hanging Committee consisting of eminent figures in British Fine Art Education, who will be instrumental in picking individual works, but will also act as consultants on the rationalism, processes and benchmarks established in the feasibility study, thereby highlighting scalability issues and defining models for the full implementation of a National Fine Art Education Digital Collection.  As part of the investigation, VADS will also report on the state, number and nature of HEI-held collections.  Dependant on these findings, it is anticipated that an expandable version of the project would firstly attempt to hold fine art works representative of all HEIs across the country, and then broaden the model to include the wider ‘visual arts'.</p>

<p>VADS will not only draw from the Hanging Committee, but will establish a list of key stakeholders from Higher Education, the Museums and Galleries community, the arts councils, funding bodies, digital libraries, information hubs and other institutions.  The project will build relationships with these stakeholders by communicating with them to raise awareness of the initiative and its results, thus ensuring dissemination to relevant communities. The project will also pursue an appropriate level of participation from stakeholders, where applicable, and investigate the potential for joint-funding of future activity.</p>

<p>The end user community for the resulting pilot digital resource is identified as going beyond VADS primary audience of the UK HE / FE (Higher Education / Further Education) research, learning and teaching community, to provide for the broader promotion of UK HE associated fine art practice to a national and international audience.</p>

<p>Spend the summer of 2002 helping communities gain access to the information they need to build a better future. In light of the recent tragic events in the USA the WLP believes that global education and cross-cultural exchange are more important than ever.  As an Inform the World (ITW) Volunteer Librarian, you can use your professional skills to help rural librarians in South Africa or Honduras. If living and working in these areas sounds like a challenge you would enjoy, join us for this exciting service project.</p>

<p>ITW 2000 volunteer Debbie Kilcup put it best when she said; 
<em>"We left not only a very functional and appealing facility behind for the eager learners, but also a piece of our hearts. We are different for the experience."</em></p>

<p><em>"I never imagined I'd find such a perfect fit to combine my interest in volunteering, traveling in developing countries, cross-cultural understanding and also make use of my skills as a librarian,"</em> said Kara Malenfant (ITW 2001).</p>

<p><b>Who</b>: The World Library Partnership (WLP) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to building global understanding by promoting literacy, learning and access to information. We believe that libraries empower individuals and enrich communities and we advocate for sustainable, community-based libraries in developing areas of the world. </p> 

<p><b>What</b>: The Inform the World Program will train and place professional librarians from around the world. The volunteers will conduct practical service projects determined by the needs of their South African and Honduran host libraries. Previous ITW volunteers have trained librarians in basic library skills. They've used their knowledge and creativity to help libraries reach out to and meet the needs of their communities. They have painted murals, taught workshops, made display boards, produced publicity fliers and helped clean, brighten and re-organize libraries.</p>    

<p><b>When</b>:<br>
South Africa: July 15 - August 15, 2002<br>
Honduras: June 9 - July 9, 2002</p>

<p>The volunteers will have three days of training in Africa or Honduras. They will then spend three weeks working on service projects in their host community and will reconvene for a book fair and a debriefing/evaluation session at the end of the program.</p>

<p><b>Eligibility</b>:  WLP invites professional librarians and library school students from all disciplines to apply.  We will also have placements for several Information Technology professionals. Flexibility, a sense of adventure and the ability to adapt to very basic living conditions are a must. Basic conversational Spanish is required for the Honduras program (English fluency required for the South Africa program).</p>  

<p><b>Cost</b>:  $2,200. This includes placement, training, materials, in-country orientation and debriefing, accommodations, most meals, site visit by the trip coordinator during the project, and in-country transportation.  Note: Airfare is NOT included in the cost of the trip.</p>

<p><b>Deadline</b>: The application deadline is January 18, 2002. We welcome early applications. We will interview qualified applicants by phone and announce the final selections by the end of February.  An application can be found at &lt;<a href="http://rtpnet.org/wlp/itw2002/ITW02.htm">http://rtpnet.org/wlp/itw2002/ITW02.htm</a>&gt; or contact Maggie Hite &lt;<a href="mailto:hitem@ils.unc.edu">hitem@ils.unc.edu</a>&gt; or Mary Alice McCarthy &lt;<a href="mailto:mamccart@email.unc.edu">mamccart@email.unc.edu</a>&gt;, or by phone at 919/479-0163.</p>

<h4>NSF / EU Digital Library All Projects Meeting</h4>

<p>The following announcement by Constantino Thanos appeared in <em>ERCIM NEWS</em> - News from DELOS - Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries.</p>

<p>"DELOS is planning to hold an NSF/EU All Projects meeting in Rome, Italy, 10 - 11 January 2002 (tentative date).
The European Commission's Information Society Technologies Programme and the National Science
Foundation are supporting substantial research concerned with digital libraries. Both expect to develop 
enabling technologies as well as principles for DL design and operation, to study the economic and legal issues
surrounding electronic distribution of IR, and to better understand the social context -- for example, human
information needs -- in which DLs will operate. By and large, scientists involved in the EU and NSF projects have
not had the opportunity to meet regularly. A coordination effort in the DL field can help avoid duplication of
effort, prevent the development of fragmented digital systems, and encourage productive interchange of scientific
knowledge and scholarly data around the world."</p>

<p>"In this context, DELOS is planning to hold the first of a series of annual meetings to bring together scientists
involved in European and NSF projects. The objectives are to exchange working experiences and research
results in the field of digital libraries, and to establish collaborative links between on-going projects. From the US
side, participants will be representatives from the Digital Library Initiative (phase2) projects. From the European
side, representatives will be from EU funded Digital Library projects and from DL projects funded by European
National Initiatives."</p>

<h4>Naval Research Laboratory, Optical Society Cooperate to Expand Web Access to Journals</H4>

<p>"(Washington DC - November 5, 2001) The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the Optical Society of America (OSA) have entered into an agreement to expand Web access to OSA journals by creating a digital archive of issues published prior to 1995."</p>

<p>"Under this agreement, NRL's Ruth H. Hooker Research Library plans to assist the OSA in digitizing the following journals: <em>Applied Optics</em> from 1962 through 1994; <em>Journal of the Optical Society of America A</em> and <em>B</em> from 1984 through 1994, and <em>Optics Letters</em> from 1977 through 1994.  NRL will scan these journals into high quality Portable Document Format (PDF) files so that they can be made available from OSA's Optics InfoBase Web-based repository in a format consistent with that of more recently published journals.  Optical character recognized (OCR) text will be bundled with the PDF files delivered by NRL, enabling OSA to seamlessly integrate retrospectively converted journals with the digitally created journals already available through Optics InfoBase.  In addition, NRL plans to add OSA journals to the more than 400 journals mounted locally at NRL and searchable through the Libary's TORPEDO <em>Ultra</em> system."</p>

<h4>Openly Informatics Announces 1Cate Adapter for CrossRef</h4>

<p>"Bloomfield, New Jersey - October 17, 2001 - <em>Openly Informatics, Inc.</em> (<a href="http://www.openly.com/">http://www.openly.com</a>) today revealed a new tool that will simplify the use of the CrossRef linking system in CrossRef Affiliate Libraries.</p>
<p>"CrossRef was conceived as a technology to transform the flow of information and ideas everywhere, by offering the scientific and scholarly community a milestone for online publishing -- a collaborative reference linking system -- through which a researcher can click on a reference citation in a journal and immediately access the cited article.  CrossRef links are widely being adopted by publishers to enable reference linking.  Although libraries have been eligible for affiliate membership in CrossRef for almost a year, 1Cate Adapter for CrossRef is the first commercially available software designed to help integrate the CrossRef system into the library digital environment."</p>

<p>"[The] 1Cate Adapter for CrossRef lets a patron of an affiliate library retrieve links, manually or automatically, to over 3 million articles using bibliographic metadata, such as journal name, volume and page number."</p>

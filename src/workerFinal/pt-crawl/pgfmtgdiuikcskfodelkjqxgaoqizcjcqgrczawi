The transistor advances in the next 2nm chips mean some elements need to be built laterally, rather than vertically, bringing extra challenges, he adds.</p><p>“There are a lot of things happening in the same node [generation], even though we give them just a simple number, like 2nm.”</p><p>But before any of these complex steps of fabrication begin, the base of the chip is still made with a simple, common substance called silicon, extracted from sand or quartz.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="silicon-composite-wrapper" aria-label="A graphic with 8 sections showing the chip manufacturing process, from silicon purification to wiring"><div class="o-grid-container"><div class="o-grid-row"><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><div class="vs-image-header"><hr/><h3 class="vs-image-header__title">The chip manufacturing process</h3></div></div></div></div><div class="o-grid-container"><ol class="silicon-composite-wrapper__image-container"><li><figure><picture><source media="screen and (max-width: 490px)" srcSet="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=640 640w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1080 1080w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1520 1520w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1960 1960w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 740px) 25vw, 50vw"/><source media="screen and (min-width: 980px)" srcSet="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=640 640w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1080 1080w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1520 1520w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1960 1960w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 740px) 25vw, 50vw"/><img class="vs-image" srcSet="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=640 640w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1080 1080w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1520 1520w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1960 1960w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=2400 2400w" src="https://ig.ft.com/microchips/assets/static/01-ingots.1de0937f.png" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 740px) 25vw, 50vw"/></picture></figure><p><span>1</span>Silicon is extracted from sand and purified.

The machines are the size of a bus, but so accurate they could direct a laser to hit a golf ball as far away as the Moon.</p><p>Every stage of this process requires “PhD thesis level of knowledge”, says Koch.</p><p>A wafer full of chips can be worth thousands of pounds when it leaves a top fabrication plant.</p><h2>Rethinking power and packaging</h2><p>While leading manufacturers are hoping the 2nm chip will solve many of the 3nm generation’s problems, the limits of scaling mean engineers are already developing alternative ways of getting more power and efficiency out of the same space.</p><p>Building on current 3D designs, engineers plan to stack transistors on top of each other, rather than cramming them in side-by-side.</p><p>“You’re really starting to expand that third dimension, which is something that hasn’t been used in the first 60 years of transistor technology,” says Intel’s Auth. “[When] you build skyscrapers, you start to run out of the ability to shrink things laterally, so you start to build up and that’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>The way chips are packaged is also going upwards. The growing field of “advanced packaging” — how chips are bundled together to boost capability as well as reduce cost — is moving towards stacking chips to improve performance and better use available space.</p><p>This pivot to vertical design and development is “kind of a big deal”, says Koch of SemiAnalysis, because it is the first time the industry has acknowledged that it’s running out of horizontal options. “We’re slowing down in one direction, but speeding up in another,” he says.</p><p>Cao says advanced packaging is where major progress can be made — a field in which TSMC is heavily invested. “There are a lot of different configurations that can be used . . .  a lot of things are happening in this field.”</p><p>Packaging developments have paved the way for another shift in semiconductor architecture: “chiplets”.</p><p>Engineers are moving away from building an entire microprocessor on a single piece of silicon — the monolithic “system on a chip” — and towards multi-chip modules (MCMs). These MCMs see groups of chips with different functions built on separate pieces of silicon and then bundled together to work like a single electronic brain.</p></div></div></div></div><section class="vs-scrolly vs-scrolly--xl vs-scrolly--lift-steps vs-scrolly--step-1" id="meteor-lake-scrolly"><div class="vs-scrolly__background"><!--$--><div class="loader" style="display:flex"><div class="g-loading g-loading--large g-loading--dark"></div><p class="load-text dynamic-ellipsis"><span class="loading">Loading<span> .</span><span> .</span><span> .</span></span></p></div><!--/$--></div><div class="o-grid-container"><div class="o-grid-row"><div data-o-grid-colspan="12"><div class="vs-scrolly__step meteor-lake-scrolly__step"><div class="vs-card vs-card--light vs-card--left vs-card--text-left vs-card--font-sans vs-card--font-standard"><p>Intel’s Meteor Lake, for example, consists of four <span class="highlight-yellow">chiplets, or tiles</span>, arranged on a base of <span class="highlight-blue">silicon circuitry</span> which connects them together.

Intel, AMD and Apple have already launched products, while others, like Nvidia, have indicated they have them in development. AMD’s latest MI300 employs modular architecture.</p><p>The companies investing in MCMs say one of their key advantages is flexibility — they can be adapted for different customers because makers can swap in chiplets depending on requirements. They also offer manufacturers the option of mixing older and newer designs and upgrading elements incrementally, rather than overhauling a chip’s entire system at once.</p><p>This means companies can “react quickly”,  says Auth. “If the market wants more of one thing or another, you don’t necessarily have to change the GPU [graphics processing unit] or the CPU [central processing unit], you can just change one component.”</p><p>This can lead to improved performance overall, he says, because you can “pick and choose what provides the best outcome for the end customer”.</p><p>One of the things that has been holding back the wider adoption of chiplets is the lack of standard rules for interfaces, which means it is not yet possible to mix and match products from manufacturers. But this remains the long-term goal for many companies, including TSMC, Intel, Samsung, AMD and Google, who have formed a consortium in the hope of doing so.</p><p>A number of chipmakers are hoping further performance gains can be made through a major rethink of how chips get their power.</p><p>Upcoming 2nm designs include separating the metal wiring that joins a chip’s elements from those that bring in power — something never done before. Power wires will move from the top (front), to the bottom (back side) of the chip, sitting below the transistor layer, rather than above. The interconnects will stay put. Early tests show this direct route for power and reduced tangle of wires results in greater efficiency.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="wiring-graphic-container" aria-label="A graphic showing

High-mobility or 2D materials, such as graphene, which allow electrons to move around quickly, could pave the way for “faster switches” and a leap in capabilities, says Sell.</p><p>“The periodic table has a lot more elements to work with, so there’s plenty of room for us to innovate,” he adds.</p><p>Another emerging field is photonics, where photons, the building blocks of light, are used in place of electrons to carry data at higher speeds. Companies, including TSMC, are currently experimenting.</p><p>Although nothing in chipmaking is ever certain, the accelerating demand for AI, illustrated this month by Nvidia’s bumper results and bullish forecasts, will mean no shortage of incentives for chipmakers to continue increasing computing power.</p><p>“It’s so integral to what we do in our everyday lives and I think we take it for granted,” says Intel’s Auth, reflecting on the leaps in science enabling chip development. “I’m excited to see what we can do over the next 20 years.”</p><p>Cao is equally confident his team of TSMC engineers can continue to be pioneers, developing new generations of chips at a “regular pace” well into the future. The company’s customers demand it.</p><p>“It stops when no one’s asking for it,” he says. “And that is not the case.”</p></div></div></div></div><div class="o-grid-container"><div class="o-grid-row"><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><p style="margin-top:0"><em>This story is free to read so you can share it with family and friends who don’t yet have an FT subscription.</em></p></div></div></div></div><div class="o-grid-container"><div class="o-grid-row"><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><div class="vs-credits"><div class="vs-credits__team"><p> </p><p class="bylines-mobile"><b>Visual storytelling team:</b> <a href="https://ft.com/irene-de-la-torre-arenas">Irene de la Torre Arenas</a>, <a href="https://ft.com/dan-clark">Dan Clark</a>,<!-- --> <a href="https://ft.com/bob-haslett">Bob Haslett</a>, <a href="https://ft.com/sam-joiner">Sam Joiner</a>, <a href="https://ft.com/sam-learner">Sam Learner</a> and <a href="https://ft.com/lucy-rodgers">Lucy Rodgers</a>.</p><p> <!-- -->Additional reporting by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.ft.com/qianer-liu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Qianer Liu</a>.</p><p>Intel and TSMC consulted on chip manufacturing processes.<!-- --> <a href="https://scaleofuniverse.com/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scale of the Universe</a> <!-- -->and Nikon’s<!-- --> <a href="https://www.nikon.com/company/corporate/sp/universcale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Universcale</a> <!-- -->provided inspiration for the opening sequence.</p></div><div class="g-share g-share--undefined"><div class="o-share" data-o-component="o-share"><ul><li class="o-share__action"><a class="o-share__icon o-share__icon--twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://ig.ft.com/microchips/&amp;text=Inside the miracle of modern chip manufacturing&amp;via=ft" rel="noopener"><span class="o-share__text">Share on <!-- -->Twitter<!-- -->.

    CONSCIOUSNESS DEFINED <BR>
    &nbsp; <BR>
    Imagine you are in a deep, dreamless coma. Your brain is operating on its 
    lowest setting, merely keeping your body alive—heart beating, lungs working. 
    Your mind is completely inactive. It is all blank within. Gradually, you begin 
    to come out of the coma, thanks to the tireless efforts of your doctors. First 
    you experience the position and temperature of your body; you feel comfortable 
    and warm, no aches and pains anywhere. You hear the murmuring of the doctors, 
    human voices all around you. There is an acrid taste in your mouth and a sensation 
    of thirst. You catch a whiff of formaldehyde in the air. You feel confused 
    and excited, your thoughts barely coherent. You struggle to open your eyes 
    and a flood of bright colors assails you. Your head aches slightly, under 
    this barrage of sights, sounds, and smells. You try to speak. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have, as we say, recovered consciousness. All those 
    sensations and feelings, those emotions, thoughts, and perceptions, are instances 
    of consciousness. You were unconscious, now you are conscious: your mind is 
    up and running again. You have made it back into the world of sentience. You 
    are an experiencing subject once more. This transition is not simply the change 
    from sleep to wakefulness. Remember I said you were in a <I>dreamless</I> 
    coma. If you had been dreaming, your mind would still be working while you 
    were asleep. You would be unconscious in one sense, unaware of your surroundings, 
    but conscious in another, since you would still be having sensations, feelings, 
    emotions, and thoughts. Dreams are just another form of consciousness, the 
    kind you have when you are in the strange state called sleep. You are indeed 
    not conscious of your surroundings while you are asleep and dreaming, but 
    your mind still plays host to the same kinds of conscious goings-on as when 
    you are awake. You are quite unlike a mindless rock or a brain-dead accident 
    victim. You could in principle spend a mentally rich life in a state of uninterrupted 
    "dreaminess." There is all the difference in the world between a dreamer and 
    someone whose mind is a complete blank. In dreams you do not cease to experience, 
    to be a subject of consciousness. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This inclusive phenomenon of consciousness is the topic 
    of this book: the having of sensations, emotions, feelings, thoughts. Consciousness 
    is not the same as wakefulness. Nor is it the same as self-awareness. When 
    you woke from the coma you experienced various sensations, but whether you 
    reflected <I>on</I> those sensations is another question. To <I>experience</I> 
    those sensations is not the same as to <I>think</I> that you experience them, 
    or to say that you do. We do often reflect on our own experiences and tell 
    each other about them, but this is not the same thing as merely having them. 
    So we should not confuse consciousness with self-consciousness. When you are 
    at the movies, immersed in the experience of watching the action, you seldom 
    ascend to the level of reflecting <I>that</I> you are having all those experiences. 
    You just <I>have</I> the experiences without forming any reflective thoughts 
    about them. Babies presumably undergo a range of conscious states, but it 
    is doubtful that they are reflectively self-conscious: they have no notion 
    of self at all, at least in the early stages. And many animals are in the 
    same state: they have a conscious life, but they do not aspire to reflect 
    on this fact. They do not, to put it another way, apply mental <I>concepts</I> 
    to themselves. To have a conscious state is not the same thing as applying 
    a concept <I>of</I> that conscious state to oneself, any more than to have 
    a certain color hair is to <I>describe</I> oneself as having that color hair. 
    Being a certain way and characterizing yourself as being that way are logically 
    independent facts. So we are interested here in <I>being</I> conscious, not 
    in characterizing oneself <I>as</I> conscious—in the <I>fact</I> of consciousness, 
    if you like, not its self-ascription. Our interest is in the sensation of 
    pain itself, for example, not in the ability to think about the fact that 
    you are in pain when you are. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mature humans do, however, occasionally reflect on our 
    consciousness. In fact this book is a prolonged reflection on it. And when 
    we reflect on it we are struck by the fact, which so gripped Ren&eacute; Descartes, 
    that our consciousness is among the world's great certainties. I may not be 
    certain that I am awake now and not dreaming, and I may entertain rational 
    doubts about whether I am really sitting at a keyboard typing, but I cannot 
    feel this kind of insecurity about whether I am currently having experiences 
    of a certain kind. For it certainly <I>seems</I> to me that I am typing and 
    looking at a computer screen, even if in reality I may not be. The entire 
    world may not exist for all I know, but my experiences of it certainly do. 
    I can be certain of the existence and nature of my conscious experiences, 
    even though I cannot be certain of what causes them. Thus I am certain that 
    I am conscious: beyond a shadow of a doubt my stream of consciousness is full 
    and flowing. I just heard a loud bang and then the sound of a car alarm in 
    the street: hearing (the conscious state) was immediately given to me, although 
    the cause was a matter of conjecture. This means that consciousness is a <I>datum</I>, 
    a given, something whose existence we cannot coherently dispute. It is therefore 
    something whose explanation we cannot duck, no matter how difficult this may 
    be. Consciousness is always with us, as long as <I>we</I> are around. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The central topic of this book is the explanation of consciousness. 
    Suppose I had asked you to imagine waking from a coma without having a brain 
    in your head. You would have been rightly perplexed. Having a brain is what 
    makes it possible to have a mental life. The brain is "the seat of consciousness." 
    But it is not merely that the mind sits <I>on</I> the brain, like a monarch 
    on her throne, a convenient place to take the weight off her legs. It is more 
    that the brain is what enables the mind to exist at all; it is more of a womb 
    than a seat. The machinery of the brain allows the mind to work as it does 
    and to have the character it does. A queen can walk away from her throne and 
    take a stroll in her palace gardens, but the mind is not able to detach itself 
    from the brain in this way (if you think it can, see chapter 3). Consciousness 
    is locked to the brain, rooted in its tissues. But this raises the question 
    of the nature of this deep and intimate link. Can the mind be fully explained 
    by the brain? Or are they really separate entities? What kind of thing <I>is</I> 
    a brain, that it makes consciousness possible? What is the nature of the bond 
    that connects our conscious experience with the workings of the gray matter 
    in our heads? 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this book I argue that the bond between the mind and 
    the brain is a deep mystery. Moreover, it is an ultimate mystery, a mystery 
    that human intelligence will never unravel. Consciousness indubitably exists, 
    and it is connected to the brain in some intelligible way, but the nature 
    of this connection necessarily eludes us. The full import of this thesis will 
    take some time to unfold. I am especially concerned to examine the <I>reasons</I> 
    for this mystery. I am not just throwing my hands up in despair; I am interested 
    in uncovering the deep reasons for our bafflement and examining the consequences 
    of our constitutional ignorance. Socrates was concerned to show people that 
    they know less than they think they do. I too am concerned with the nature 
    and source of human not-knowing; I want to know <I>why</I> some things are 
    so hard to know. What <I>is</I> it about consciousness that makes it so elusive 
    to theoretical understanding? And what is it about the knowing mind that makes 
    it founder here? For the rest of this chapter, however, I want to articulate 
    the problem of understanding the link between the mind and the brain further 
    and indicate why the standard traditional responses to it do not work. Then 
    we can move on to explore the mystery in more depth. <BR>

    CONSCIOUS MEAT 
    <P>
    Consciousness is so familiar that it is hard to appreciate what an odd phenomenon 
    it is. We tend to take our consciousness for granted and not wonder about 
    its origins and grounds. Let us then try to step back from our consciousness 
    and defamiliarize it. In particular, let us try to develop a sense of the 
    oddity of the mind-brain link. We can start with an extract from a clever 
    science fiction story by the writer Terry Bisson. (The link between mind and 
    brain can seem like pure science fiction.) It takes the form of a conversation 
    between an alien explorer who has visited earth and his commander: 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"They're made out of meat." 
      <P>
      "Meat?" ...
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts 
      of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way 
      through. They're completely meat."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages 
      to the stars?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals <BR>
      don't come from them. The signals come from machines."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat 
      made the machines."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking 
      me to believe in sentient meat."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the 
      only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence 
      that goes through a meat stage."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for 
      several of their lifespans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any 
      idea of the life span of meat?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like 
      the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Nope, we thought of that, since they do have meat heads like 
      the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"No brain?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made 
      out of meat!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"So.... what does the thinking?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. 
      The meat."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. 
      The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    The point of this parable is to bring out how surprising it is that the squishy 
    gray matter in our heads—our brain meat—can be the basis and cause of a rich 
    mental life. From one point of view, our prized cerebral organ <I>is</I> just 
    a hunk of meat. After all, people do sometimes eat animal brains with potatoes 
    and peas, and there is no hint in that culinary experience of what the tasty 
    tissue used to accomplish when it was still the animal's organ of consciousness. 
    (Not that I've ever tasted brains; I'm a vegetarian.) If someone were to eat 
    your brains while you were still alive and conscious—which heaven forbid!—that 
    person would not taste the mental events that he or she was gradually consuming. 
    The person would certainly not taste what you were tasting as you bit into 
    a fresh pineapple. Calling the brain "meat" is a way of classifying it along 
    with other meaty body parts, such as muscles, kidneys, and hearts. There is 
    nothing in this classification, itself perfectly legitimate, to prepare us 
    for the remarkable fact that brains alone make organisms into conscious beings. 
    Your deepest feelings might turn into a masticated mouthful if your brain 
    falls into the wrong hands. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can it really be true that your consciousness can be eaten 
    and digested? The alien commander's incredulity should be ours: How <I>is</I> 
    sentient meat possible? We know that it is possible because we all have sentient 
    brains, but what explains this bizarre and rather comical fact? It appears 
    so improbable to the aliens I "quoted" that minds can be engineered from the 
    kind of thing that can be bought at a butcher's shop that they have a hard 
    time accepting it. It <I>ought</I> not to be so, and yet, miraculously, it 
    is. How can this be? (Of course, the same enigma exists for the aliens and 
    their own brain unit, but they are so familiar with it in their own case that 
    they are as complacent as we are about what makes their minds possible.) 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can state the problem this way: Isn't there some kind 
    of violation of the uniformity of nature in the fact that brains produce consciousness? 
    Brains seem very similar to other parts of animal bodies, being basically 
    a big collection of cells organized according to biochemical principles. Yet 
    there is a yawning chasm between the natures of these entities, because brains 
    produce consciousness and those other meaty organs do not, not even a little 
    bit. This fundamental difference is not predictable from the physical similarities 
    we observe. If we were to observe all the body parts apart from brains, we 
    would arrive at the conclusion that body parts do not produce consciousness. 
    But then we encounter brains and are brought up short. They violate the natural 
    belief that collections of cells do not generate minds. This puzzle is like 
    observing that balls roll down hills and then discovering one that takes off 
    into the air of its own accord. We examine this exceptional ball from every 
    angle, but can't find anything to distinguish it from all the others. We conclude, 
    reasonably enough, that nature is not uniform after all. Except that this 
    never happens: we always find an underlying difference that explains the different 
    powers of the superficially similar object. (The ball has a special kind of 
    motor in it that is hard to detect.) But in the case of the brain, this kind 
    of explanation apparently does not apply: one ball of matter does have the 
    power to bring consciousness into existence, but it seems so similar to all 
    the other mindless balls of matter rolling around in the world. Worse yet, 
    only <I>some</I> of the states of brains are connected to consciousness, because 
    some brain processes occur without any accompanying conscious process. The 
    parts of the brain connected to maintaining basic bodily functions have no 
    conscious correlate, any more than states of the liver do. But the two kinds 
    of brain process appear quite similar to each other, just neurons and their 
    interactions. How can such similarity mask such dissimilarity? This incongruity 
    flies in the face of our deep-seated and highly confirmed belief in the uniformity 
    of nature. How can like causes produce such vastly unlike effects? To maintain 
    our belief in the uniformity of nature, we are forced to deny that the brain 
    causes the mind or to try to find new properties of the brain to distinguish 
    it from other all other physical objects. We cannot just note the violation 
    and shrug our shoulders. The aliens are operating on this principle when they 
    react with such incredulity to the fact of conscious meat. None of the meat 
    <I>they</I> have ever seen has come with an inner life. How can nature tolerate 
    such inconsistencies in the way it works? 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people like to harp on the complexity of the brain, 
    as if this gave a clue to its mental productivity. But sheer complexity is 
    irrelevant: merely adding more neurons with more synaptic connections doesn't 
    explain our problem a bit. The problem is how <I>any</I> collection of cells, 
    no matter how large and intricately related, could generate consciousness. 
    The trouble is that neural complexity is the wrong <I>kind</I> of thing to 
    explain consciousness; it is merely a matter of how many cells a given cell 
    can causally interact with. If our kidneys had as many cells as our brains, 
    that would not make them conscious. Nor is a galaxy conscious just because 
    it has a tremendous number of interacting parts. If complexity is to play 
    a role in generating consciousness, then we need to be told what <I>kind</I> 
    of complexity is involved. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another red herring is the "hiddenness" of the brain, the 
    fact that it is inside an opaque skull and has an invisible interior (unless 
    you cut it open). There is no logical necessity about this. Imagine an organism 
    whose brain is distributed over its outside, like its skin. (Insects have 
    an <I>exoskeleton</I>; this organism has an <I>exocerebrum</I>). We can see 
    its brain perfectly plainly whenever we met up with it. And suppose we are 
    all naturally equipped with brain scanners (MRIs) that enable us to see the 
    patterns of brain activity in this skinlike brain. I think this would make 
    us feel the puzzle of mind and brain even more acutely than we do now, because 
    we would not be inclined to think that the brain's inner recesses somehow 
    correspond to the private consciousness of the Other. We would gaze in wonder 
    at this pulsating grayish skin and wonder how <I>that</I> could possibly be 
    the foundation of a mental life. Examining an area around the organism's left 
    toe, we would ask ourselves how on earth an experience of red could possibly 
    arise from such inauspicious and unpromising materials. But the tissue inside 
    your brain that corresponds to an experience of red is really just the same 
    <I>kind</I> of tissue as could be spread out over your left foot. Bunching 
    up my actual skin and stuffing it into my skull certainly effects no magical 
    transformation in its mind-generating powers. The "privacy" of consciousness 
    has nothing to do with the fact that the brain is buried out of sight. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can also formulate the problem historically. Consciousness 
    has not always been here. For millions of years after the Big Bang, the universe 
    was without life or mind, just brute matter suspended in space. Eventually 
    life evolved on this planet (and maybe on others, too), and in the fullness 
    of time organic brains came into existence. We can think of this slow development 
    as the cumulative reorganization of matter under the laws of physics and biology. 
    With evolution by natural selection, a new principle entered into the ways 
    in which matter clumped its constituents together: the fitter the clump, the 
    more likely it was to replicate itself. Thus, matter came to exhibit a certain 
    sort of design, the kind that results from chance mutations being honed into 
    organisms that reproduce more effectively than their competitors. The design 
    of organisms is undoubtedly a remarkable fact of nature, calling for a very 
    special kind of explanation, the kind that Darwin provided. Thus the long 
    neck of the giraffe results from the fact that earlier giraffes with longer 
    necks than their brethren could reach to higher places for food. The genes 
    for longer necks were passed on more frequently than genes for shorter necks 
    because those giraffes that could eat more had a better chance of reproducing 
    themselves. In other words, longness of neck conferred survival advantage 
    on giraffes that had this trait, and this produced a selection pressure that 
    favored longer necks. But the existence of consciousness cannot be explained 
    in this way. We are not stunned by the fact that matter is <I>capable</I> 
    of forming the elaborate designs of animal bodies: ultimately it is all just 
    a matter of ever more complex combinations of particles. We are not amazed 
    that a telephone can be made from matter either, although we would be amazed 
    if its design were not explicable in terms of some organizing principle. But 
    in the case of consciousness the Darwinian explanation does not tell us what 
    we need to know, for the simple reason that it is unclear how matter <I>can</I> 
    be so organized as to create a conscious being. The problem is in the raw 
    materials. It looks as if with consciousness a new kind of reality has been 
    injected into the universe, instead of just a recombination of the old realities. 
    Even if minds showed no hint of design, the same old problem would exist: 
    How can mere matter originate consciousness? How did evolution convert the 
    water of biological tissue into the wine of consciousness? Consciousness seems 
    like a radical novelty in the universe, not prefigured by the after-effects 
    of the Big Bang, so how did it contrive to spring into being from what preceded 
    it? 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This big problem manifests itself countless times a day. 
    Every time a sentient organism comes into existence, its consciousness freshly 
    minted, we have the same transition from insentient matter to "mindedness." 
    Cells combine and grow during gestation until the brain is mature enough to 
    decant experiences: At first this clump of cells is without mentality, and 
    before you know it there is consciousness throbbing away in there. Where does 
    it come from? What manner of secretion is this? How does mere meat turn itself 
    into conscious awareness? Once you were just insentient cells, no more aware 
    of anything than your liver is now. Today you are brimming with consciousness. 
    How did you make the grade? What catapulted you into consciousness? There 
    must be some kind of natural process behind this astonishing leap, but this 
    process is obscure. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the universe before conscious beings came along: 
    the odds did not look good that such beings could come to exist. The world 
    was all just physical objects and physical forces, devoid of life and mind. 
    The universe was as mindless then as the moon is now. The raw materials for 
    making conscious minds—matter in motion—looked singularly unpromising as the 
    building-blocks of consciousness. Yet now there is plenty of consciousness 
    around, and it is as certain as anything can be. Human beings have lots of 
    it, and the other species have their fair share, too. Just think of the amount 
    of <I>pain</I> the universe has contained by now! It appears as if the impossible 
    has occurred. Unconscious physical particles have conspired to generate conscious 
    minds. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we call the original upsurge of consciousness in the 
    universe the "Soft Shudder," then the question becomes how to get from the 
    Big Bang to the Soft Shudder. We have a good idea how the Big Bang led to 
    the creation of stars and galaxies, principally by the force of gravity. But 
    we know of no comparable force that might explain how ever-expanding lumps 
    of matter might have developed an inner conscious life. Consider the problem 
    in the way an astronomer might. Astronomers tell many exotic tales about the 
    way matter behaves under certain special conditions: extremes of heat and 
    cold, extremes of gravitational pressure, extremes of explosive power. Matter 
    is not everywhere as mundane as it appears to us on mild little planet Earth. 
    Black holes—those concentrations of matter so fierce in their gravitational 
    fields that nothing can escape their iron grip, not even light—are the favorite 
    popular example. This is matter at its most occult and souped up. Black holes 
    can only be known about indirectly, by the ripples of their extreme gravity, 
    because no light can escape their clutches to reach our telescopes. The properties 
    of a black hole are indeed singular and striking. But compare brains: imagine 
    coming across these peculiar concentrations of matter in the course of your 
    astronomical explorations. Their gravitational force is minimal, but their 
    effects on surrounding objects are even more astounding than the effects of 
    a black hole. Brains cause technology, society, art, science, soap operas, 
    sin. A remarkable set of effects for such a small chunk of coagulated atoms. 
    And the brain's influence doesn't stop there. The brain also produces inside 
    itself a whole new dimension of reality: conscious experience. Each living 
    brain contains its own center of thought and feeling, its own experienced 
    world. A brain is a piece of mind-matter, a subspecies of matter in general. 
    And like a black hole, it presents problems of knowability: that inside dimension, 
    that subjectivity, is something that can only be inferred from external effects. 
    Certainly no light is reflected from consciousness! A brain is a celestial 
    object with more bizarre properties than any black hole or red dwarf or infinitely 
    dense singularity. What would our roaming alien astronomer christen it? A 
    "gray mind-pump," a "damp soul-source," a "mentaroid?" That astronomer would 
    certainly need a whole new taxonomic category to do it justice. She would 
    proceed to crack a brain open to reveal the consciousness inside it, thus 
    dispelling the mystery of its operation. But the astronomer would be bitterly 
    disappointed: The brain is just a soup of boring old biological cells. These 
    mentaroids are queer objects indeed! Much head-scratching (or the alien equivalent) 
    would ensue. What does this do to the received theories of matter? 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The astronomical perspective is useful in alerting us to 
    what a peculiar object sits in our heads. The brain begins to seem like a 
    magic box, a font of sorcery. Thomas Huxley captured this sense of miracle 
    beautifully when he wrote in 1886: "How it is that anything so remarkable 
    as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous 
    tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the djinn when Aladdin 
    rubbed his lamp in the story." How could simply rubbing a lamp produce something 
    like a djinn (itself a subject of consciousness)? What have brass and oil 
    got to do with beings like djinns? In what sense could a djinn exist <I>inside</I> 
    a lamp (some of these djinns are huge)? The whole idea sounds like nonsense 
    when you think about it, just a fairy tale. But, equally, how can sending 
    an electric current into a bunch of cells produce conscious experience? What 
    do electricity and cells have to do with conscious subjectivity? How could 
    a conscious self exist <I>inside</I> such a soggy clump? It begins to seem 
    that we are all djinns, each magically ensconced in our own personal brain 
    lamps, waiting to be rubbed into life. And just as Aladdin's lamp violates 
    the uniformity of nature, because lamps do not <I>generally</I> have such 
    djinn-generating powers, so we appear to exist by courtesy of a breach in 
    nature's uniformity. Electrochemical reactions don't generally result in subjective 
    experience, yet in the case of our brains they seem to. It is all very puzzling, 
    very puzzling indeed. 
    <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that you are now feeling a cramp in your intellectual 
    parts, a sense of mystery, even awe, that you are conscious at all. You should 
    be thinking: <I>Something is wrong here</I>. The existence of your consciousness 
    should strike you as a paradox, a sleight of hand. Am I now about to reveal 
    where I mischievously led you astray and guide you back to sanity? Unfortunately, 
    the solution to the paradox is not so simple. It will take some work to find 
    our way out of this paradox (but it will be worth it in the end). What I want 
    to do now is outline and criticize the standard historical approaches to the 
    problem, just to get them out of the way. We need a fresh perspective on the 
    problem, but first we need to know why the orthodox explanations, materialism 
    and dualism, don't work.

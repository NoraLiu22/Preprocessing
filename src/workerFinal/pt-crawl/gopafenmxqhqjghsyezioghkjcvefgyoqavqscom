1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 1]]</font> The distinction between oceanic and continental islands was first made by Charles
Darwin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This classification, now universally accepted by scientific men, was the result of the
observations and studies of Mr. Darwin on his famous voyage in the &quot;Beagle.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others took up and continued the work on the lines laid down by him; and a careful
examination of the accounts of the early voyagers has added a great body of testimony to the
soundness of the theory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to their structure, oceanic islands are volcanic, or of coral formation; and with
regard to their fauna, they have no indigenous mammals and no amphibia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existence of these islands implies, therefore, a continuous ocean; since, if they had at
any time formed part of a mainland, some representatives of the amphibia and the mammals of
the continent must have kept their place on the island. The ocean has been the insuperable and
<font color="990000">[[p. 2]]</font> permanent barrier to the dispersion of animal forms, and there is every reason to believe
that there has been no serious change in the ocean area of the globe from the very earliest days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Darwin says on this subject (&quot;Origin of Species,&quot; 6th ed., p. 288):</p>

      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Looking to existing oceans, which are thrice as 
        extensive as the land, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly 
        one truly oceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this can 
        be called a truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford even a fragment 
        of any Pal&aelig;ozoic or Secondary formation. Hence we may perhaps infer 
        that during the Pal&aelig;ozoic and Secondary periods neither continents 
        nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they 
        existed, Pal&aelig;ozoic and Secondary formations would in all probability 
        have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear; 
        and these would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations 
        of level which must have intervened during these enormously long periods.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If, then, we may infer any thing from these facts, we may infer that where our oceans now
extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record; and, on the
other hand, that where continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no
doubt, to great oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have myself said in another place that the general permanence of the continental areas
cannot be doubted, but they have undergone wonderful and repeated changes in detail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every square mile of their surface has been again and <font color="990000">[[p. 3]]</font> again under water. Lakes and
inland seas have been formed, and filled up with sediment, and been subsequently raised into
hills and even mountains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arms of the sea have existed, crossing the continent in various directions and isolating the
divided portions for varying intervals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seas have been changed into deserts and deserts into seas. Volcanoes have grown into
mountains, have been degraded and sunk beneath the ocean, have been covered with sedimentary
deposits, and again raised up into mountain ranges; while other mountains have been formed by
the upraised coral reefs of inland seas. The mountains of one period have disappeared by
denudation or subsidence, while the mountains of the succeeding period have been rising from
beneath the waves. The valleys, the ravines, and the mountain peaks have been carved out and
filled up again; and all the vegetable forms which clothe the earth and furnish food for the
various classes of animals have been completely changed again and again. All these changes,
however, have taken place within the continental areas, substantially the same as they now are.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing to show that other continents have existed in any part of what is now the
ocean. The very extended and careful soundings made in the great oceans, and most of all those
made but recently by the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition, have proved beyond question that the waves
roll everywhere over a floor surprisingly uniform and regular, and more level in many places
than the most level prairie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one distinction to be made here. Outside of the shore-line of the continents, there
extends beneath the <font color="990000">[[p. 4]]</font> surface of the waters, for distances varying between 50 and 150
miles, a sloping base or pedestal of the continental mass. The outer edge of this base, the true
limit of the continent, is known as the thousand-fathom line; and it marks the beginning of the
ocean. Islands that lie within this line are continental islands. These are of ancient or of recent
formation, the former being generally divided from the mainland by a greater depth of water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the continent comes to an end at the thousand-fathom line, the ocean suddenly
deepens to two or three miles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The continental islands, still attached as they are to the base of the mainland, are to all
intents and purposes a portion of the continent, as well in structure as in the forms of animal and
vegetable life which they afford. It is in the oceanic islands that we should meet with limited and
peculiar types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first group that we are to examine is the collection known as the Bermuda Islands. These
islands, or islets, for they are very small, number about one hundred, with a total area of not more
than fifty square miles. They are composed of coral and coral-sand, hardened into rock; they are
but little elevated above the ocean, and they are surrounded by reefs, some at a distance of thirty
miles from the main group. Immediately beyond these reefs the ocean is very deep, soundings in
four directions showing 2,500 fathoms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Nares, of the &quot;Challenger,&quot; in his report, speaks of Bermuda as a &quot;solitary peak
rising abruptly from a base only 120 miles in diameter.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These islands may, therefore, be regarded as typically oceanic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 5]]</font> They are situated in 32° N. Lat., at a distance of 700 miles from the continent.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are in the islands no indigenous land mammals, no frogs, and no snakes; and there is
but one species of lizard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are in all 180 species of birds known in the group; but of these only ten are resident,
and one of these, the English sparrow, has been introduced by man. More than half of the whole
number of species consists of waders and swimmers, and about 85 are land birds which, it might
be thought, could hardly fly so far. Most of these birds are migratory, and all are American.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well known that North America possesses a greater number of migratory birds than any
other continent, because of its variable climate and great extremes of temperature. These
meteorological conditions give rise to sudden and violent storms, and these, blowing from the
land, catch and carry out to sea the birds on their periodical journeys to the north and to the
south. Immense numbers of these birds must perish every year, when swept out in this way on the
stormy Atlantic, and those that find refuge on the little group of the Bermudas are comparatively
few.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This continual accession of new individuals has kept the birds of these islands from
developing any distinct variety, such as oceanic islands ought to show.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The insects of the Bermudas are but few, and they are all common North American or West
Indian species. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plants number about 300, exclusive of those European and tropical forms which have
been introduced by man. Less than half of the 300 are indigenous.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 6]]</font> The majority are West Indian, and they are supposed to have been brought to the
islands by the Gulf Stream. Those plants which are North American were undoubtedly
introduced by the agency of birds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeds are carried by birds in various ways. Very minute seeds are caught in the feathers or
under the wings, and so transported; others again, as the seeds of berries and small fruits, remain
undigested when the fruit is eaten, and germinate when deposited; and in many cases mud,
containing the seeds of grasses and plants, clings to the feet of birds and is borne with them in
their flight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see, therefore, that two conditions are required for the introduction of plants into an
oceanic island by means of birds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adjacent continent must have a number of migratory birds, and the ocean between the
continent and the island must be stormy, and frequently swept by gales from the land.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds and the plants of Bermuda are, as we have seen, almost identical with those of the
continent, for the reasons given. With the land shells the case is a little different. One fourth of
those found in the islands are peculiar, the whole number being but twenty; and the explanation
is that the difficulty in the way of transmission is immensely great in the case of land shells.
Terrestrial mollusks reach the islands only by accident, on floating logs, on bits of timber, and
sometimes, perhaps, on portions of dams or weirs, established on inland creeks or rivers and
borne away to sea by freshets. A species thrown up in this way on those remote islands would
remain isolated for an unknown length of time, and undergo modification in its new habitat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 7]]</font> The second group of islands to be considered is the Azores. These islands lie in the
North Atlantic, between 37° and 39° 40' N. Lat., and stretch southeast and northwest, over a
distance of 400 miles. The largest of the islands, San Miguel, is about 40 miles long, and the area
of the whole group is 700 square miles. It should be noted that the Azores are almost equidistant
from the three continents, Europe, Africa, and America, though they are generally classed as
African islands. They are of volcanic origin and have frequently suffered from earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions; and they present all the marks of volcanic islands--extinct craters, beds of
lava broken into friable soil, precipitous mountains, and a dangerous coast. New islands
sometimes rise within the group or very near it, and disappear again. The coasts are high and the
surface is undulating, with a number of mountain peaks, of which St. Mary's, the lowest, is about
2,000 feet high, and Pico, the highest, not far from 8,000.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nearest mainland is that of Portugal, to which country the islands belong, and the
distance is a little under 900 miles. The ocean lying between is 2,500 fathoms deep. The
thousand-fathom line encloses the whole group, but the least depth encountered within 300 miles
is 1,800 fathoms. It is not to be supposed, therefore, that these islands were ever united with the
European continent; and their volcanic structure makes it incredible that they could have formed
part of an Atlantis which included Madeira and the Canaries, the former also volcanic, and the
latter a continental group, though volcanic. In all their physical features the Azores come within
the strict definition of oceanic islands. In the fauna of the group, the great feature of oceanic
islands-- <font color="990000">[[p. 8]]</font> the absence of all indigenous land mammalia and amphibia--is well shown;
and there are, furthermore, neither snakes, nor lizards, nor frogs, nor fresh-water fishes. It is true
that rats and mice, rabbits and weasels, and a small lizard, which belongs to Madeira and
Teneriffe, are now found wild in the Azores, but there is every reason to believe that all these
have been introduced by man. The goldfish and eels now found in some of the lakes have the
same origin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flying creatures, birds and insects, are abundant; and there is also a small European bat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are fifty-three species of birds in the Azores; but of these thirty-one are swimmers or
waders, birds whose powers of flight are so great that their presence in any island, however
remote, is not remarkable. All these aquatic birds are of common European species, and twenty
of them are resident in the islands, while eleven are stragglers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the twenty-two land birds, only four are stragglers, the other eighteen being permanent
residents. All of these are common in Europe and in North Africa, excepting three, the Atlantic
chaffinch and the canary, which inhabit Madeira and the Canaries, and the Azorean bullfinch,
which is peculiar to the Azores.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did these continental birds reach the islands? Mr. Fred. Du Cane Godman, in his
&quot;Natural History of the Azores,&quot; tells us that, &quot;Hardly a storm occurs in Spring or autumn
without bringing one or more species foreign to the islands; and I have frequently been told that
swallows, larks, grebes, and other species not referred to here are not uncommonly seen at those
seasons of the year.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 9]]</font> Here again, therefore, we find one of the conditions for the stocking of oceanic
islands with animal life, working even at the great disadvantage of 200 additional miles of
distance to be overcome. That it works much less effectively in the Azores than in Bermuda is
shown by the very much smaller number of species of birds in the former group, 53, as against
180 in the latter. The ratio between these figures would be greatly reduced if the relative areas of
the groups were taken into the account, and it is evident that the additional 200 miles of distance
act as a very severe means of natural selection, since only exceptionally vigorous birds could
survive the buffeting of Atlantic storms for 900 miles. New species may, of course, be added to
those already existing; and Mr. Godman has found the wheat-ear breeding in the old crater of the
island of Corvo. This is probably a recent immigrant establishing itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds of the group are most abundant in the islands nearest to Europe and Africa, and
this is almost conclusive evidence that they arrived as stragglers. There are three groups in the
islands, an eastern one of two islands, a central one of five, and a western one of two. The
species diminish in number from the east to the west.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peculiar bullfinch of the Azores is undoubtedly the result of climatic and other
conditions operating through a long period of time. This bird does not migrate and, as it inhabits
woody districts, is less likely to be blown out to sea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The insects, excepting the beetles, are few in number and nearly all of European species. The
beetles number 212, and 175 of these are European; but only 74 are <font color="990000">[[p. 10]]</font> really indigenous,
the others having been brought in by man. Twenty-three of the indigenous species are not found
in any other of the Atlantic islands and must have been introduced directly from Europe. Only
fourteen out of the whole number are peculiar to the Azores. The chances of the same species of
insects arriving in the islands are very few, and this fact tends to develop and establish
peculiarities; and we find accordingly that while the birds are proportionately more numerous
than the beetles, there are very many more peculiar species of the latter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the land shells the number of peculiar species is yet greater than among the insects;
and this was to be expected, for the introduction of a mollusk is a rare event, owing to the
difficulties in the way of transmission, and a distinct type would soon be developed under the
new conditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of sixty-nine species, thirty-seven are common to Europe, or to the Atlantic islands, and
thirty-two are peculiar to the Azores.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flora of these islands presents 480 species of flowering plants and ferns, and of these
440 are also found in Europe, Madeira, or the Canary Islands, while 40 are peculiar to the
Azores. The agencies already named are sufficient to account for the presence of the European
and other exotic plants; and it is significant that most of the trees and shrubs with large and
heavy fruits are wanting in the Azores. There are no oaks, chestnuts, hazels, apples, beeches,
alders, or firs; and the laurestinus, myrtle, Portugal laurel, elder, and other trees or large shrubs
found in the islands bear berries, and might, therefore, have been introduced by birds <font color="990000">[[p. 11]]</font> in
one of the ways described. Of the forty species supposed to be peculiar, all but six, which have
affinities in the Canaries or Madeira, are allied to European plants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The almost wholly European character of the Azorean animals and plants leads to the
conclusion that what may be called extraordinary and exceptional causes are more potent in the
transfer and introduction of forms than the ordinary and more regular causes. The Azores lie in
the track of the return southwesterly trade winds and also of the Gulf Stream, and it might be
expected that these forces, working steadily in one direction, would fill the islands with
American animals and plants, and prevent the introduction of European species. It is the action of
the violent storms to which the Azores are subject that has disappointed this expectation, and
impressed the European stamp on their fauna and flora.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, the third group we shall examine, differ in important respects from
the Azores and the Bermudas. In these we find but a small number of peculiar animals and
plants, and we have to note the constant arrival in the Bermudas and, in a lesser degree, in the
Azores, of migratory birds and even of insects and plants, brought by the recurring storms of the
Atlantic. In the Gal&aacute;pagos the sea and the air are equally undisturbed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>These islands, discovered by the Spaniards in the 16th century and named from the
numerous <em>gal&aacute;pagos</em>, or giant tortoises, which inhabit them, are still not very well known. The
group consists of five large and ten small <font color="990000">[[p. 12]]</font> islands, and the total area is estimated at 2,250
square miles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the large islands, Albemarle, Chatham, Narborough, Indefatigable, and James, there are
mountains of from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When discovered the Gal&aacute;pagos were uninhabited, and they have remained so to this day,
with the exception of two or three penal settlements, kept up by the government of Ecuador. The
largest of these settlements, that named La Floreana, on Charles Island, contained at one time
200 or 300 inhabitants, but when the U. S. Steamer &quot;Hassler&quot; visited the group in 1871, there
were only about a dozen. Cattle, swine, and goats have been introduced and now run wild.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gal&aacute;pagos lie in the Pacific Ocean exactly under the equator, at a distance of about 600
miles from the South American coast; and they are occasionally visited by traders from
Guayaquil who collect the <em>orchilla</em> for market.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The climate is tempered by the cold Antarctic currents 
        which turn northwest from Cape Blanco on the Peruvian coast and pass through 
        the islands. There is very little rain except from November to January. 
        There is a good deal of low cloud and the nights are misty, but it is 
        only on the higher land, from 800 to 1,000 feet above the sea, that there 
        is any luxuriant vegetation. The low lands are rocky and parched, with 
        a bare growth of stunted shrubs and Peruvian cactus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole group is volcanic, and stands upon a deeply submerged bank, the thousand-fathom line encircling all the more important islands at a few miles' distance, whence there
seems to be a steep descent all round to the <font color="990000">[[p. 13]]</font> average depth of that portion of the Pacific,
between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in all other oceanic islands, so here we find no truly indigenous mammals; and frogs and
toads, the only tropical representatives of the Amphibia, are equally unknown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reptiles are, however, represented by the land tortoises, lizards, and snakes. The tortoises are
of two peculiar species, one found on most of the islands, and the other but recently discovered
on Abingdon Island, from which it has been named. There is also one extinct species. These are
all of very large size, and it is thought that they may have been originally derived from the
American continent. It does not seem extravagant to suppose, considering the tenacity of life of
these animals, that some ancestral form, carried out to sea by a flood, may have been drifted to
these islands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lizards are five in number--a peculiar species of Gecko, and four species of the
American family Iguanid&aelig;. One of these is aquatic and is found in all the islands, swimming at
some distance from the shore and feeding on sea-weed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident that these lizards were derived from the American continent, and at some remote
epoch; but how they reached the islands it is impossible to say, though we know that animals of
this kind have some means of crossing the sea, since they are found in a considerable number of
islands which possess no mammals, nor any other land reptiles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two species of snakes, and this fact is remarkable, because serpents are very rarely
found in oceanic islands. Both these snakes are closely allied <font color="990000">[[p. 14]]</font> to South American
varieties, and one is almost identical with a Chilian snake. This fact seems to show that their
presence in these islands dates from a comparatively recent period; and it may be accounted for
without straining the probabilities. Snakes survive a long time at sea, and an instance is on record
of a boa-constrictor that once reached the island of St. Vincent from the coast of South America,
a distance of two hundred miles by the shortest route. Snakes are very often found in trees, and
might easily be carried long distances if floated out to sea on a tree swept down by a tropical
flood or uprooted by an earthquake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of birds there are in all fifty-seven species, and of these thirty-eight are peculiar to the
Gal&aacute;pagos. Eighteen of the others belong to the aquatic tribes, which are pre-eminently
wanderers. The true land birds are thirty-one in number, and all but one are entirely confined to
these islands; while more than half of them present such peculiarities that they are classed as
distinct genera. They are all allied, and some of them very closely, to birds inhabiting tropical
America; while one, the common American rice-bird, is the only land bird identical with those of
the mainland. A classification of the birds shows that the diversity between the island and the
continental types is greater in proportion to the difficulties and the obstacles in the way of
migration. The rice-bird is the only completely unchanged species of land bird in the Gal&aacute;pagos.
This bird, which breeds in Canada, swarms over the whole United States, migrates to the West
Indies and to South America, visits the Bermudas, distant as they are, almost every year, and
ranges as far as Paraguay; and we may conclude that it reaches <font color="990000">[[p. 15]]</font> the Gal&aacute;pagos often
enough and in sufficient numbers to keep up the purity of the breed. The short-eared owl is found
here, as it is on the mainland and the continental islands of the Old and the New Worlds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more distinct species are allied to non-migratory species peculiar to tropical America;
while the distinct genera are allied to South American finches and sugar-birds, which have but a
restricted range. The remote ancestral forms of these which reached the Gal&aacute;pagos have
remained, therefore, uninfluenced by later migrations and have been developed into a number of
distinct types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The insects of the islands are very few; the beetles, the most plentiful of all, furnishing only
thirty-five species, belonging to twenty-nine genera and eighteen families. They are almost all
peculiar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are about twenty land shells, most of them peculiar species. The currents bring to the
southeastern shores of the islands canes, bamboos, driftwood, nuts of the palm, and other floating
objects, and in this way some, at least, of these insects and land shells have been introduced.
Besides the waves and the winds, which bring leaves with small insects and eggs of mollusks,
there must have been, in islands like these, still subject to volcanic action, an elevation of
intervening islands between the coast and the present group, to facilitate the passage of
organisms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plants of the Gal&aacute;pagos are much more numerous than the known animals, including the
insects. There are, in all, 332 flowering plants, 174 of which are peculiar, while 158 are common
to other countries. Twenty of these are known to have been introduced by <font color="990000">[[p. 16]]</font> man. Of the
plants which may be called American, 42 are found in North and South America, 21 in South
America alone, and 20 in North America and the West Indies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Joseph Hooker has observed that the plants peculiar to the Gal&aacute;pagos are allied to the
plants of temperate America or to those of the high Andes, while the non-peculiar species are
such as inhabit the hotter regions of the tropics near the level of the sea. The seeds of this class of
plants possess special vitality, and are known to stand long voyages, or they have special means
of transport.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One characteristic, and a very significant one, marks the vegetation of these islands. All the
plants, without exception, are pale in tone and lack color and beauty; and the flowers are feeble
and of a greenish hue. The importance of insects, in the development and vitalization of plants, is
nowhere more decidedly shown; for it is impossible not to associate the weakness of the
vegetable creation with the scarcity of insects in this group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to arrive at some intelligible theory of the peculiar fauna and flora of these islands, it
is necessary to take into account the long-past conditions of sea and land and past changes of
climate. The affinities of so many of the plants and of some of the birds in the Gal&aacute;pagos with
those of a north temperate and high mountain region point to great changes of climate in the
northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen that in the Bermudas and the Azores the birds are almost exclusively
continental and migratory, and that their presence is due to the frequent storms from the direction
of the continent; and it is not <font color="990000">[[p. 17]]</font> difficult to understand why the Gal&aacute;pagos should be far
richer in peculiar forms, both of animal and vegetable life, than either of the Atlantic groups
considered.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE. The following communication, made by Mr. D. Morris, of Kew, to <em>Nature</em>, of Dec.
16, 1886, possesses great value as bearing directly on the main argument of Mr. Wallace's
lecture:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The part taken by birds in the dispersion of plants is one of great interest in view of the
difficulty of accounting for the appearance of certain species in remote islands, no less than in
localities nearer to each other, or divided by such barriers as mountain ranges or deep seas. This
subject has, more or less, engaged the attention of botanical travellers from the time when
Darwin published his classical &quot;Journal of Researches,&quot; nearly fifty years ago, down to the
publication of Mr. Hemsley's &quot;Botany of the <em>Challenger</em> Expedition,&quot; part 1, which was issued
as lately as last year. In the careful summary of plants probably distributed by birds, <em>loc. cit.,</em> pp.
44-49, it is mentioned that seeds may be carried by birds in either of two ways: First, by seeds,
especially those provided with barbs and hooks, attaching themselves to the feathers of birds, and
in the case of aquatic or burrowing birds being embedded in mud and thus carried accidentally
outside; or, secondly, by seeds swallowed by frugivorous birds being for a time lodged within,
and dejected afterwards in such a state as to be capable of germination. My object now is not to
treat generally of this subject, but to place on record two remarkable and striking instances where
seeds carried and <font color="990000">[[p. 18]]</font> dispersed by birds have come immediately under my own observation.
The examples which I shall here describe will, I believe, show clearly that birds are capable of
acting as very effective agents in the dispersal of plants, and that the results are so apparent as to
be placed beyond reasonable doubt. In cases where seeds of a light character are provided with
barbs or hooks, they are well adapted for attaching themselves to passing objects, and are most
favorably placed for dispersal by means of birds. The particular plant with barbed seeds which I
described under this category has not, I believe, been mentioned before; but it is deserving of
notice, as it fully meets all the requirements incidental to this form of dispersal, and, moreover, I
have had, for some years, very favorable opportunities of observing its behavior. This plant is
<em>Uncinia jamaicensis</em>, Pers. (<em>Cyperace&aelig;</em>), which grows in damp places in the mountains of
Jamaica, at elevations of 5,000 to 6,000 feet. It is generally found overhanging small pools of
stagnant water or on banks of mountain rivulets. Its slender tapering spikes, when ripe, literally
bristle with long exserted rachilla, each shaped something like a shepherd's crook (hamate), but
with the hooked part so closely fitting and elastic that, if drawn along the back of the hand, it
would grasp and draw out the finest hairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, such places as are affected by this Uncinia are also the frequent resort of numerous
birds that come there to drink, or bathe, or to seek coolness and shade. In the case of migratory
birds, and especially those that cover long distances in their flight, the high lands are generally
those first touched. This is doubtless owing to the elevation at which they fly to escape surface
currents <font color="990000">[[p. 19]]</font> or local objects. I have often noticed birds from the North (the United States)
on their way South, and again birds from the South returning to the North in early spring,
frequenting the highlands of Jamaica, find resting there for a time before continuing their
journey. Some such birds have been easily caught by hand, so exhausted were they with their
long flight. In two instances I have found small migratory birds so completely entangled in the
hooks of the Uncinia (<em>Gardeners' Chronicle</em>, 1881, p. 780) that they were unable to extricate
themselves; and, unless set at liberty at the time, would probably have died in that situation. In
these instances the hooks of the Uncinia overstepped their proper function; for, obviously, no
benefit would arise to the plant from the death of the birds, but only in the removal of the seed to
another place. Larger birds, of course, would not be caught; but on the other hand, if they came
within reach of the Uncinia, they could hardly get away without detaching a large number of the
fruits and transporting them wherever they went. In the case of the Uncinia, there is present
nearly every condition necessary to secure a very complete dispersion of its fruits. The plant, in
the first place, is possessed of light portable seeds easily carried about from one locality to
another; in the second place, the seeds are provided with highly specialized hooks which
effectually grasp anything that comes within their reach; and lastly, the plant affects just those
places which are visited by birds, and seldom fails to secure a sure and trusty carrier. It follows,
as a matter of course, that <em>Uncinia jamaicensis</em> is found plentifully distributed in the track of
migratory birds, and is found in similar situations in the mountains <font color="990000">[[p. 20]]</font> on the mainland in
Central America, Venezuela, Ecuador, etc. So much for seeds with barbs and hooks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now come to the second class of seeds, namely, those which are swallowed by
frugivorous birds, and dejected in a state suitable for germination. The most striking examples I
know of the dispersion of such seeds, and of the results which immediately follow, are shown in
connection with the pimento industry of Jamaica, which, as shown below, depends entirely for its
existence on the offices of frugivorous birds. The pimento of commerce is the dried fruit of the
pimento allspice, or Jamaica pepper tree (<em>Pimenta vulgaris</em>). No other country supplies this
article, although the tree itself is widely distributed froth in the West Indies and on the mainland,
and the value of the exports of pimento from Jamaica has reached (in 1880) a total of £100,000.
This is probably the largest spice industry in the world, and to repeat what is mentioned above, it
is wholly dependent upon the action of frugivorous birds. In Lunan's &quot;Hortus Jamaicensis,&quot; vol.
ii., p. 67, published about the end of last century, it is stated that &quot;the usual method in forming a
new pimento plantation or 'pimento walk' is nothing more than to appropriate a piece of
woodland in the neighborhood of a plantation already existing; or in a country where the
scattered trees are found in a native state, the woods of which being fallen, the trees are suffered
to remain on the ground till they become rotten and perish. In the course of twelve months after
the first season's rains, abundance of young pimento plants will be found growing vigorously in
all parts of the land, being without doubt produced from ripe berries scattered there from the
birds, while the fallen trees, etc., <font color="990000">[[p. 21]]</font> afford them both shelter and shade.&quot; In a foot-note it is
added that &quot;birds eagerly devour the ripe seeds of the pimento, and, muting them, propagate these
trees in all parts of the woods. It is thought that the seeds passing through them undergo some
fermentation which fits them better for vegetation than those gathered immediately from the
tree.&quot; The present plan for forming pimento plantations in Jamaica is exactly as described above.
In fact, the planters firmly believe that no other plan is likely to produce good pimento walks,
although it has been shown by experiments in the Botanical Gardens that by careful treatment
plants of pimento can be raised in nurseries in large numbers, exactly as any other economic
plants. It remains, however, that all the present pimento plantations in Jamaica have been formed
by the action of frugivorous birds, and to this agency alone we are indebted for the commercial
supply of a most valuable and wholesome spice.</p>

        trends to the northwest and to the southwest, and Mr. Wallace's statement 
        is substantially correct. <font color="990000">[[on p. 5]]</font></font></p>

        called also the Enchanted Isles--Islas Encantadas--because of the strong 
        current and the calms, which made it difficult for ships to approach or 
        to leave them. The Spaniards named also the larger islands, Mascaron, 
        Diablo, Santiago, and others, but the English names have prevailed. <font color="990000">[[on

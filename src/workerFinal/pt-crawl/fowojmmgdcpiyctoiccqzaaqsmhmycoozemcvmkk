Although soccer is a relatively safe sport, the game does involve contact.
This contact can be:

<li>player-to-player
<li>player-to-ground
<li>player-to-goalpost
<li>player-to-ball<p>

As you might expect, most (50-80%) soccer injuries affect the feet and
legs.  However, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the
<a href = "http://www.aap.org/policy/re0046.html">contact that occurs
while playing soccer is at the same level</A> as during
boxing, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, rodeo and wrestling and field
hockey.<p>

Head injuries account for between 4% and 22% of all soccer injuries.  Can
this contact cause brain damage? Let's look at the data.<p>

occur when someone's head strikes an object. A person with a concussion
may lose consciousness or suffer memory loss and appear confused. In
soccer, concussions make up 2-3% of all injuries.  This is the <a href =

study involving men's and women's college soccer teams</A> from the
Atlantic Coast Conference found a total of 29 concussions in a 2-year
period.  The most common cause of the concussions was when one player's
head struck the head of another player.  This was also the most common
source of concussions in a <a href =
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=9617409&dopt=Abstract">group
of soccer players</A> at the US Olympic Sport Festival in 1993.  The
second most common cause of concussions occurred when a ball struck a
player's head.  These head-to-ball concussions happened when a player was
hit in the head by a ball kicked from close range.  In many cases, the
ball traveled so quickly the player did not have time to react.  <font
color=red>NONE</font> of the concussions were caused by proper heading of
the ball.<p>

<img src = "facean.gif" width="88" height="52" align=right
hspace=15>Heading the ball, however,
is
not without consequences. A player may head the ball many times
during
practice sessions and about eight times during a game. Many players at the
1993 US Olympic Festival experienced headaches after heading the ball.  
These headaches lasted from a few seconds to several days.</td>

<TD>Soccer balls kicked by highly skilled players can travel over 100
km/hour.
Although these ball speeds are not reached during most recreational games,
some people believe that young players should wear protective helmets. <p>

Heading of the ball <i>may</i> have caused the neurological problems
reported in soccer players.  However, it is possible that other types of
head injury were responsible for these injuries.  For example, many
professional soccer players suffer head injuries when they collide with
other players or hit the ground.  Therefore, soccer-related brain injury
may not necessarily be due to heading the ball.  On the other hand, it is
unknown if repeated low intensity impacts, like those that occur when the
ball is headed, make players more susceptible to later impacts.<p>

Most of the data come from players at the elite level who have played
soccer for many years.  Professional soccer players head the ball
thousands of times during their careers.  There has not been much research
on the effects of heading the soccer ball on children or recreational
players.  Although helmets may protect players from concussions, their
usefulness has not been tested.  At least <a href =
"http://www.soccerheadgear.com/"> one company is selling
helmets</A> to be used by children while playing soccer. <td

<h2>Possible Protections</h2>
<img src = "./gif/socgroup.gif" width="150" height="140"
hspace=10 align=right> So, how can head injuries be
reduced and minimized? Here are some
recommendations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Players should have <font color=red><b>proper instruction</b></font>
on the
correct way to head the ball.<P>
<li>The ball should be the <font color=red><B>appropriate size</b></font>
for the
age of the players. Smaller balls are less likely to cause injury.  Also,
make sure the ball is inflated properly.<p>
<li>Use <font color=red><B>"no heading" rules</b></font> for younger
players. If
a player is not allowed to head the ball, the ball is less likely to hit a
player's head.<P>
<li>Use <font color=red><B>padded goalposts</b></font>.

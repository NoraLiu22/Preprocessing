                        <p>World Vision is a global humanitarian aid and development organisation that provides short-term and long-term assistance to children and families living in poverty. The World Vision International Partnership spans nearly 100 countries, employs 37,000-plus staff and in 2019 raised more than US$2.9 billion.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For 70 years, World Vision has been engaging people to work towards eliminating poverty and its causes. World Vision works with people of all cultures, faiths and genders to achieve transformation. We do this through emergency relief, long-term development projects, advocacy, collaboration and education.
</p>
<p>World Vision Australia is one of the nation&rsquo;s largest charitable groups. With the support of more than 200,000 Australians, we are helping to create lasting change in the lives of the world's most vulnerable children.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Our work is made possible by the support of generous Australians, including many who sponsor a child or donate to support our emergency appeals. Other funding sources include donations from philanthropists and corporate partners, as well as the Australian Government and institutional donors.</p>

<br />
World Vision brings globally proven approaches together with each community's own strengths to address their specific challenges. Our work includes long-term development programs, emergency relief projects, advocacy and education.&nbsp;<br />

                        <p>Australians are part of a global community where basic human rights should be afforded to all, no matter where one is born. Yes, charity begins at home but it doesn&rsquo;t have to end there. We are lucky in Australia that we can afford to respond to those in need at home as well as providing life-saving aid to those beyond our borders. </p>
<p>Australia has the 13th highest GDP per capita in the world according to International Monetary Fund figures and our level of government debt is low compared to other developed countries. Although we are well placed to support developing countries, currently the Australian Government spends around 21 cents in every hundred dollars of national income on overseas aid. We are lagging behind other wealthy countries such as Sweden, who contribute 0.91 percent of Gross National Income, Germany at 0.76 percent, and the Netherlands at 0.50 percent.</p>
<p>
Most importantly, overseas aid and development help save and transform lives. For example, the mortality rate for children under five has fallen by 59 percent since 1990. This is equivalent to one in 11 children dying before reaching age five in 1990, compared to one in 38 in 2021. Overseas aid has played a big part in this progress. Unfortunately, thousands of children still die every day so more still needs to be done.</p>

                        <p>World Vision is all about transforming the lives of vulnerable children and their community - and making it easy for you to be a part of that. Together we've impacted the lives of 200 million vulnerable children in the past five years. Whether it's helping through sponsorship to meet the basic needs of a child, their family and community, helping rescue children from exploitation, funding vital development work, helping people in emergency situations or participating in advocacy campaigns, every person who supports our work is making a positive difference in someone's life.</p>
<p>Around 200,000 Australians now contribute to World Vision's work around the world. As a part of a broader movement against global poverty, this is creating broad-ranging changes to the living standards of those living in desperate poverty. Including reaching one new person with clean water every 10 seconds and three more schools every day with clean water. 89% of the severely malnourished children we treated made a full recovery over the last five years and because of our community-focused solutions, for every child you help, four more children benefit, too.</p>

<p>While we are motivated by our Christian values and faith, at World Vision we recognise that many people in the world do not share our beliefs. It is not our goal to convert anyone through our work, and we never seek to do so.</p>
<p>The primary focus our work is addressing the immediate and long-term development needs of communities, particularly the most vulnerable. We respond to these needs regardless of the religion or beliefs of a community or of individual community members.</p>
<p>As we do work in partnership with communities, depending on specific circumstances we may partner with local faith-based groups and encourage their participation in the development process. &nbsp;</p>

                        World Vision programs support modern contraceptive methods as part of an integrated approach to effective family planning. World Vision&rsquo;s family planning guidelines encourage both men and women to take equal responsibility for their children&rsquo;s birth and development. With both maternal and child mortality rates at alarming levels in many developing countries, individuals and couples are provided with the knowledge and the means to determine the number and spacing of their children to ensure the survival and wellbeing of both mother and child. These objectives are consistent with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.<br />
<br />
All contraceptive methods promoted by World Vision are reviewed with respect to ethical, medical and development standards. World Vision programs are also designed and implemented in partnership with communities, and in collaboration with national health policy, the local health system, local faith-based organisations and other non-government organisations undertaking similar programs.<br />
<br />
Contraceptive needs and preferences may vary depending on the cultural context. That's why our programs providing integrated voluntary family planning services offer a range of natural and artificial methods. Given the high risk for sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), dual protection methods are encouraged. Examples of protection methods include abstinence, consistent and correct use of condoms, use of a contraception method, and mutual monogamy.

                        World Vision&rsquo;s primary aim is to help people work their way out of poverty &ndash; we do not tell families how many children they should have.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, improvements in the lives of the poor do have an impact on reducing family size.&nbsp; For example, the UN Population Fund says when a girl in the developing world receives seven or more years of education, she marries four years later and has 2.2 fewer children.<br />
<br />
Depending on the laws, policies and community attitudes in the countries where World Vision operates, our work might include things like the educating girls, improving childbirth facilities and support for women in remote communities, fostering economic opportunities, and providing information about family planning and birth spacing &ndash; including contraception, where it is appropriate.&nbsp;<br />

The World Vision International Partnership spans nearly 100 countries, employs 37,000-plus staff and in 2019 raised more than US$2.9 billion.\u0026nbsp;    For 70 years, World Vision has been engaging people to work towards eliminating poverty and its causes. World Vision works with people of all cultures, faiths and genders to achieve transformation. We do this through emergency relief, long-term development projects, advocacy, collaboration and education.    World Vision Australia is one of the nation\u0026rsquo;s largest charitable groups. With the support of more than 200,000 Australians, we are helping to create lasting change in the lives of the world\u0027s most vulnerable children.\u0026nbsp;    Our work is made possible by the support of generous Australians, including many who sponsor a child or donate to support our emergency appeals. Other funding sources include donations from philanthropists and corporate partners, as well as the Australian Government and institutional donors."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Australians are part of a global community where basic human rights should be afforded to all, no matter where one is born. Yes, charity begins at home but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to end there. We are lucky in Australia that we can afford to respond to those in need at home as well as providing life-saving aid to those beyond our borders.    Australia has the 13th highest GDP per capita in the world according to International Monetary Fund figures and our level of government debt is low compared to other developed countries. Although we are well placed to support developing countries, currently the Australian Government spends around 21 cents in every hundred dollars of national income on overseas aid. We are lagging behind other wealthy countries such as Sweden, who contribute 0.91 percent of Gross National Income, Germany at 0.76 percent, and the Netherlands at 0.50 percent.    Most importantly, overseas aid and development help save and transform lives. For example, the mortality rate for children under five has fallen by 59 percent since 1990. This is equivalent to one in 11 children dying before reaching age five in 1990, compared to one in 38 in 2021. Overseas aid has played a big part in this progress. Unfortunately, thousands of children still die every day so more still needs to be done."

Around 200,000 Australians now contribute to World Vision\u0027s work around the world. As a part of a broader movement against global poverty, this is creating broad-ranging changes to the living standards of those living in desperate poverty. Including reaching one new person with clean water every 10 seconds and three more schools every day with clean water. 89% of the severely malnourished children we treated made a full recovery over the last five years and because of our community-focused solutions, for every child you help, four more children benefit, too."

  "name": "Does World Vision support the use of contraceptives?",
  "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "World Vision programs support modern contraceptive methods as part of an integrated approach to effective family planning. World Vision\u0026rsquo;s family planning guidelines encourage both men and women to take equal responsibility for their children\u0026rsquo;s birth and development. With both maternal and child mortality rates at alarming levels in many developing countries, individuals and couples are provided with the knowledge and the means to determine the number and spacing of their children to ensure the survival and wellbeing of both mother and child. These objectives are consistent with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.    All contraceptive methods promoted by World Vision are reviewed with respect to ethical, medical and development standards. World Vision programs are also designed and implemented in partnership with communities, and in collaboration with national health policy, the local health system, local faith-based organisations and other non-government organisations undertaking similar programs.    Contraceptive needs and preferences may vary depending on the cultural context. That\u0027s why our programs providing integrated voluntary family planning services offer a range of natural and artificial methods. Given the high risk for sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), dual protection methods are encouraged. Examples of protection methods include abstinence, consistent and correct use of condoms, use of a contraception method, and mutual monogamy."

Depending on the laws, policies and community attitudes in the countries where World Vision operates, our work might include things like the educating girls, improving childbirth facilities and support for women in remote communities, fostering economic opportunities, and providing information about family planning and birth spacing \u0026ndash; including contraception, where it is appropriate.\u0026nbsp;    Population growth rates in most countries are falling and the global average for the number of children born to each woman has dropped from 3.7 in 1980 to 2.4 today."

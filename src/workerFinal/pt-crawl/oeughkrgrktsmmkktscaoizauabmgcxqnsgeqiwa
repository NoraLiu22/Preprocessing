(Previous customers: $35.00) </P></B>
<P>This hobbyist astrology calculation program is easy to use and very accurate. It includes the new Yellow Book Atlas with time zone change histories going back to WW II for 250 countries and 9,000 cities, color U.S., Europe, and World maps, two sharp color wheels including one with graphic aspects and chart aspect patterns, an aspects grid as well as scrollable list, transits list, solar and lunar returns, biwheels with synastry and current transits displays, and composite charts. Once you have calculated either a chart or a transits list, you can select Interpret to generate the included 40-50 page Classic British Astro Report or the Soul Healing Transits Report, in either pdf format for display in Adobe Reader or in html format for display in your web browser. </P>
<P><A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/astwin30.htm">Click to read</A> a more detailed description of the
Astrology for Windows program. </P>
<P>The new 32-bit version 3.0 of <EM><STRONG>Astrology for Windows</STRONG></EM> is 100% compatible with 64-bit Vista and Windows 7, 8, and 10.  The  electronic Help file has been converted from *.hlp format to *.chm  format, making it unnecessary for the Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 10 user to  download the engine to read *.hlp files from Microsoft's website.  The Europe and World map files have been replaced by the newer and politically up-to-date maps created in 2002 for AstrolDeluxe ReportWriter. The major improvement for version 3 is the addition of the Yellow Book Atlas of 9,000 cities for 250 countries with reliable time zone observance histories going back to World War II and which can be updated in the future through a menu selection for automated Internet download. Version 3 also adds the ability to do interpretation reports, aspect patterns, and composite charts, both between two people and the triad chart with one's parents, which acts like a second birth chart that can say for what purpose the child was born. </P>
<P> The $45 registration codes are new with version 3 - the old $26.50 registration codes from versions 1 and 2 are incompatible with Astrology for Windows, version 3.</P>
<P>For sale now to version 3 registered users for $75 each: Halloran Software's most popular adult natal report, the Personal Path natal (in <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/ppspears.pdf"target=sister>English pdf</A> or <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/ppspears.htm"target=sister>English html</A>), the LifeTrends transits (in <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/ltobama.pdf"target=sister>English pdf</A> or <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/ltobama.htm"target=sister>English html</A>), and the Personal Path natal in good quality <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/ppspgabr.pdf"target=sister>Spanish pdf</A> or <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/ppspgabr.htm"target=sister>Spanish html</A>.</P>

<P>Detection and interpretation of Aspect Patterns is the biggest addition to version 7, with the ability to customize these patterns, search for charts with particular patterns, see all patterns listed in the Chart Analysis table with the planets or sectors that are part of each, and display the patterns graphically in a visually dramatic way in the zodiac-proportional Graphic Aspects wheel.  As of version 7.1, you can add the $50.00 Halloran Aspect Patterns interpretations set which has 392 delineations for the 35 aspect patterns with all their possible focus and pattern planets.  Besides generating a short Aspect Patterns Only report, you can now generate a Standard with Aspect Patterns natal report in which the final section delineates the chart's Aspect Patterns.  A chart often has 4 or 5 aspect patterns, but we have seen all the way from 0 aspect patterns to 17 aspect patterns between the planets and Chiron (you have the choice of turning on the Ascendant and Midheaven, the Moon's Nodes, or the four major asteroids as additional pattern points, but these points are not delineated).  Also new, Version 7.1 integrates with the ACS <EM>PC Atlas</EM> a new <EM>Geo Names Atlas</EM> of three million world cities.  We have worked on this atlas for two years - the file for France is included with <EM><STRONG>AstrolDeluxe ReportWriter</STRONG></EM> and all 230 countries are a $100 program add-on. Additionally, version 7 added to the reportwriter the ability to delineate minor asteroids, both their sign and house placements and their aspects to planets, but you must supply these interpretations.</P>
<P><A NAME="localspace"></A><A HREF="madonna_local_space_map.gif">View sample world map showing local space planet lines for Madonna. </A>  These planet direction lines are also called azimuth lines or horizon chart lines. From her birthplace in Michigan, Madonna followed a line to New York City for Vesta, the asteroid goddess of devotion and focus, which asteroid has only positive aspects in her chart, including sextiles to her Moon and Ascendant and a sextile to Mars.  Then Madonna chose to relocate to the southern coast of England, in between her prosperous Jupiter and spiritual Neptune conjunction.  Users of <EM><STRONG>AstrolDeluxe ReportWriter</STRONG></EM> can also select and see more detailed maps, showing the local space planet lines crossing Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and the United States.  I am still in the early stage of exploring this technique among charts known to me, but already I see the asteroid Juno line correlated with partnerships and the asteroid Ceres line correlated with parenting and child care.  A unique feature is that the user can select to see a line for any of the 80 additional asteroids as well as to interactively turn on/off different planet lines or glyphs.  By observing what line a person has followed to their present location, the astrologer can zero in on what body is especially characteristic for a person's life.</P>

<P>John Halloran spent nine months researching the lives of real people who have the 35 different aspect patterns that <I><STRONG>AstrolDeluxe</STRONG></I> (ver. 7.1 or higher) can detect.  The result are these 392 well-grounded, non-theoretical interpretations which include the planets out to Chiron.  Print just a patterns report or include at the end of a natal report.  Since these patterns represent configurations of at least three or more of the planets in the native's chart, their interpretation represents a higher-level synthesis of how the planets uniquely express their energies in the native's life.  The low price should enable all astrologers to start adding these syntheses to their chart interpretation.</P>

All these new interpretations have been laid onto the interpretation framework provided by the well-written Spirit Success report.

<P>To the sign placement and synastry aspect delineations in the DOS-based StarMatch compatibility software program, these interpretations for the Windows-based ReportWriter add delineations for one person's planets in the other person's houses, producing a truly professional report of romantic compatibility between two people. The StarMatch 25- to 30-page compatibility report outlines the needs and strengths that the two subjects bring to their relationship, as well as how they affect and support each other. The report lets the client see the similarities, differences, rewards, and challenges of being with this other person, based on the personal planet sign placements, the mutual house placements, and the aspects between the planets of the two charts, where these interpretations appear in order of strength.  The report gives a numerical evaluation of the communication and the harmonious versus inharmonious aspects at the end.  Some clients describe using these reports to evaluate prospective partners, whereas other clients have described how the reports gave them a better understanding of their relationship and saved their marriage.  Although romantic in nature, the report is free of gender-bias. </P>

<B><P><A NAME="composite"></A>Composite Couples Report - $100.00</B> </P>
<P> This compatibility report interprets the composite chart that is formed from the midpoints of the planets in two people's charts.  Our report interpreting composite charts is different because we looked at so many sample composite charts for our research - a collection with birth times of 150 couples and a collection without birth times of 1068 married couples and 238 divorced couples - enough to finally see what attracts couples and what keeps them together. The results support what conscious marriage relationship counselors have been advocating for twenty years now. <EM><STRONG>Composite Couples</STRONG></EM> is a modern astrology report that puts astrologers on the same page as modern relationship therapists.  Partners do not get bored when the relationship enables continued personal growth by providing challenges as well as support.  We also found plenty of evidence that couples are being brought together by Fate from The Other Side in order to be together. There are two sample reports that you can examine now - a report for a couple with birth times and a report for a couple without birth times.  <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/adolf_eva.pdf">Click here</A> to read a 38Kb Adobe Acrobat format timed report for Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/duane_beth.pdf">Click here</A> to read a 20Kb Adobe Acrobat format untimed report for Duane and Beth Chapman, whom you can see every week on cable television in the reality series <EM>Dog the Bounty Hunter</EM>.

<B><P><A NAME="ltrends"></A>LifeTrends(tm) professional transits reports - $100.00</B> <BR>
Price for users of <I><STRONG>the $59 LifeTrends for DOS</STRONG></I> - $50</P>
<P>This interpretation set for the Windows-based ReportWriter has greatly expanded the transiting Jupiter through Pluto delineations (compared to the DOS-based LifeTrends program). Jupiter through Pluto are the most significant transiting planets. If you are new to astrological forecasting, I suggest that you start with transits before learning about progressions.  Progressions are a more advanced technique. You will probably make more use of the LifeTrends transits forecast reports than any other interpretation set on your computer - the transiting planets overhead are constantly moving and forming different aspects to the planets in the natal chart. Transits to the natal chart by the slow-moving planet Pluto are very effective in shaking up one's life, during those years when transiting Pluto aspects one's natal chart angles and personal planets.  Talk to any astrologer about Pluto's transits and you will find emphatic agreement about its life-changing power.  Astrologers also know how the transits of Saturn correlate with life decisions and career climax points.  Jupiter transits are usually times of glamor and prosperity.  The LifeTrends interpretation set has interpretations for all the transiting planets, from the fast-moving Moon through slow-moving Pluto and, if you choose to include it, transiting Chiron.  The fast-moving planets up to transiting Mars have one-paragraph interpretations.  The slower-moving planets starting with Jupiter have three- to five-paragraph interpretations.  The report-length depends on which transiting planets you select, the time period of your report (usually from one to three months, but can be as short as one day or several years if you select just the slowest-moving planets), and on the fact that some months are busier and have more transiting aspects than do other, quieter months.</P>

<B><P><A NAME="returns"></A>Journey Returns(tm) professional Solar Return reports - $100.00</B> </P>
<P>This well organized yearly forecast report by Anthony Louis delineates the placements and aspects for all of the solar return planets and indicates when, during the year following the birthday, aspects will perfect in a Standard 40-page report.  You can also choose the Intermediate, Advanced, or Concise Advanced template in order to add exact timing calculation and interpretation of the sun's transits and the progressed Ascendant and Midheaven during the course of the solar return year in reports that range from 60 to 110 pages. </P>
<P>For many years the author was disappointed with the predictive value of solar returns.  Then he discovered the work of the French astrologer Volguine, which forms the framework of this report.  Volguine studied the existing literature on solar returns and experimented with innumerable charts to refine a method for interpreting return charts that is surprisingly powerful and accurate.  The <I><STRONG>Journey Returns</STRONG></I> report provides thorough delineations of all factors in the return chart compared to the natal chart, and you have the option of ending the report with a step-by-step summary of Volguine's method that will delight astrologers.  As with all of the reports by Anthony Louis, the author has carefully tested the delineations for accuracy in hundreds of charts of individuals with well documented biographies. </P>

<P>To run the <I><STRONG>Journey Returns</STRONG></I> reports, you need version 6.1 or later of Halloran Software's <I><STRONG>AstrolDeluxe</STRONG></I>.

<B><P><A NAME="progs"></A>Journey Progressions(tm) professional Secondary Progressions reports - $100.00</B> </P>
<P>This is a very complete, professionally written set of progressed interpretations, suitable for delineating the progressions list that <I><STRONG>AstrolDeluxe</STRONG></I> calculates.  The report begins with a general overview of the house and sign placement of each secondary progressed planet.  It then lists and delineates each progressed to natal planet aspect as it perfects in chronological order. </P>
<P>Secondary progressions are a time-honored method of forecasting major trends for the year ahead.  They are based on the symbolic movement of the chart at a rate of one day in the ephemeris for each year of life; this is sometimes called the "day equals a year" formula.  Secondary progressions represent a powerful technique that provides insight into the dynamic unfolding of the chart during the course of the life cycle.  Used in conjunction with a study of transits and the solar return, the method of secondary progressions provides a framework for understanding future trends. </P>
<P>The author based the delineations in this report on a review of the astrological literature and the study of hundreds of charts of family, friends, clients, and public figures.  Interpretations were included only if they could be demonstrated to hold water when tested in the lives of actual individuals.  The result is a set of delineations of secondary progressed aspects that are often uncannily on target. </P>
<P>The author, Anthony Louis, called my attention to his interpretation for Progressed Mars SemiSquare Neptune as this dangerous progressed aspect was exact for Princess Diana on September 2, 1997, one day after her death involving machinery and drink. </P>

<B><P><A NAME="careers"></A>Journey Careers(tm) Reports - $100.00</B> </P>
<P>These career-oriented natal interpretations allow <I><STRONG>AstrolDeluxe</STRONG></I> to produce a comprehensive 35-page natal report filled with vocational astrology suggestions about the type of work for which the native is best suited. This ambitious report takes advantage of the report writer's ability to 1) delineate the native's three most dominant planets, signs, and houses, 2) to refine the sign placements by delineating the actual decan within the sign for the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, and Midheaven, 3) to delineate intercepted signs within houses, and 4) to outline the dates of the native's career rise and fall cycle based on the fourth house cusp sign. </P>
<P>The author based his delineations on a review of the astrological literature and the study of hundreds of charts of individuals with demonstrated success in various careers.  Each interpretation was further tested against a database of clients, friends, and notable figures to verify the accuracy.  The focus of the report is both vocational and psychological because personality traits and preferences play a major role in career selection.  The result is a fascinating natal chart interpretation with a special emphasis on vocational factors in the chart. </P>
 <P> To run these reports, you need at least version 4.1.11 of <I><STRONG>AstrolDeluxe</STRONG></I>.</P>

Price for users of <I><STRONG>16-bit Astrodynes for Windows</STRONG></I> or <I><STRONG>Astrodynes for DOS</STRONG></I> - $39.00 </P>
<P>This is a new 32-bit CD version of the <I><STRONG>Astrodynes for Windows</STRONG></I> calculation program by John Molfese (of the Church of Light).  It calculates astrodynes for charts saved by <EM>AstrolDeluxe</EM> or by the registered <EM>Astrology for Windows</EM>. The Astrodynes software program is an accurate computerized replication of astrodynes as created by Elbert Benjamine and the Church of Light. To calculate astrodynes by hand for one chart takes about ten hours. The computer performs these valuable calculations of power, harmony and discord immediately. Displays and prints the astrodynes results in the form of tables or colorful bar charts, pie charts, etc. which may be copied to the clipboard or printed. The Astrodynes program is especially useful to anyone who is doing astrological counselling. By totaling the power of each planet, sign, and house in the native's chart, astrodynes quickly reveal the native's true ruling planet and dominant factors. Astrodynes show the counselor the areas of life in which the native is able to operate most easily and effectively. </P>
<P>The batch processing feature of the new program automates finding power and harmony signatures for logical groups of charts.</P>

<P>Version 7.0 of <I><STRONG>Placidus</STRONG></I>is still the top program for calculating primary directions, but it includes the extensive <I><STRONG>Porphyrius Magus</STRONG></I> module for ancient astrology which can also be purchased stand-alone for $250.  New <I><STRONG>Porphyrius Magus</STRONG></I> features include The Celestial Pentagram of Venus, The Circle of Petosiris, The Oktatopon, Heliacal Calendar, Paranatellonta, Parapegma, Heliacal phases of stars and planets, 2D images of the zodiac with the stars, and The Hermetic Zodiac with all 3 kinds of projection of the stars (simple, paranatellonta and ortus). <I><STRONG>Porphyrius Magus</STRONG></I> will find the Hyleg, Alcocoden, and Almuten of the chart - the astral trinity of Hellenistic, Arab, and Medieval Astrology which are needed in order to do traditional style prognostication.  The module can calculate according to the rules of 6 Hellenistic, 3 Arab, and 1 Medieval author: Dorotheus, Rhetorius-Valens, Valens, Ptolemy, Porphyry, Paulus Alexandrinus, Omar Tiberiades, Alchabitius, Abenragel, and Regiomontanus.  The graphic interface shows in an organized way the intermediate thought processes that lead from candidacy to final winner for The God's Light (Hyleg), The Guardian Angel (Alcocoden), and The Ego (Almuten) or Ruler planet that most epitomises the Nativity. The module shows whether a planet is in a degree of hays, if it is a solar or lunar doriphoria (or 'spearbearer', a condition of eminence), or in its own bounds according to the Egyptian, Chaldean, and Ptolemaic systems.  The dynamic Heliacal Module features heliacal phase calculations which, based on over 300 observations, are more accurate than any other modern source.  This program is for the serious researcher who wants to go deep into Ancient, Hellenistic, and Arab Astrology.  Rumen Kolev has investigated firsthand ancient Akkadian and Hermetic sources and the medieval Greek and Latin books which have been preserved in the large national libraries of Europe (see his book <A HREF="https://www.halloran.com/Medieval_Astrological_Prognosis_Description.pdf"><EM>Gauricus & Henry II - Medieval Astrological Prognosis</EM></A> which is volume 1 of <EM>The Primary Directions & History of Astrology</EM> series).  We are fortunate that he has created the technology to reproduce the calculations in these sources and has made that technology accessible to all in this attractive modern computer program. </P>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

      <p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">&nbsp;[[p. 473]]</font> In December 
        1856, I left Macassar in one of the trading prows which make an annual 
        voyage to these islands. On January 1st, 1857, we arrived at the K&eacute; 
        Islands. Here we remained six days, while the natives, who are clever 
        boat-builders, finished two small vessels our captain purchased for the 
        Aru trade. During this time I made daily excursions in the forests, collecting 
        birds and insects; but the weather was showery, and the coralline-limestone 
        rocks, which everywhere protrude through the thin soil, are weather-worn 
        into such sharp-edged, honey-combed, irregular surfaces, as to make any 
        distant excursions almost impossible. The great Fruit Pigeon of the Moluccas 
        (<em>Carpophaga &aelig;nea</em>) was abundant, its loud, hoarse cooings 
        constantly resounding through the forest. Crimson Lories of two or three 
        species were also plentiful, but were so wary that we could not obtain 
        any. All other birds were scarce, and I only obtained thirteen species 
        in all, many of which will, however, I think, prove new, viz.:--
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1"><em>Megapodius</em>, sp., same species at Aru.<br />
        <em>Carpophaga &aelig;nea</em>.<br />
        <em>Ptilonopus</em>, n. sp.<br />
        <em>Macropygia</em>, sp., same at Aru.<br />
        <em>Dicrurus</em>, sp.<br />
        <em>Tropidorhynchus</em>, n. sp.?<br />
        <em>Cinnyris</em>, n. sp.<br />
        <em>Zosterops citrinella</em>, M&uuml;ll.<br />
        <em>Rhipidura</em>, two species.<br />
        <em>Muscicapid&aelig;</em> ali&aelig;, two species.<br />
        <em>Psittacus</em> (<em>Geoffroyus</em>?), sp.</font></blockquote>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the birds offered for sale, <em>Eclectus 
        Linn&aelig;i</em> and <em>Psittacodis magnus</em> were the most abundant. 
        Of Mammalia I saw none, and could only learn that a wild pig and a species 
        of <em>Cuscus</em> inhabited the island. The only reptiles I saw were 
        lizards of two or three kinds, one of which, a very long and slender species, 
        with a finely-pointed tail of a most brilliant blue, swarmed everywhere 
        on the low herbage, gliding among leaves and twigs in the most rapid and 
        elegant manner. Of insects I made a nice little <font color="990000">[[p. 
        474]]</font> collection, the natives bringing me several very fine Coleoptera. 
        A considerable proportion appear to be quite new; those known being a 
        mixture of New Guinea and Molucca species. It would occupy too much space 
        to enter into any details on this extensive class; I shall therefore give 
        only the results of my six days' work, as follows:--</p>
      

<table style="font-size:11pt; margin-left:.4in" cellspacing="6">
<tr><td>Coleoptera</td><td>70 species.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lepidoptera</td><td>50 &quot;</td></tr>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was here I first made acquaintance with the 
        Papuan race in their native country, and it was with the greatest interest 
        I studied their physical and moral peculiarities, and noted the very striking 
        differences that exist between them and the Malays, not only in outward 
        features, but in their character and habits.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day and a half's sail brought us to the trading 
        settlement of Dobbo, situated on a sandy spit running out in a northerly 
        direction from the island of Wamma, which here approaches to within a 
        mile of the great island of Aru. Having obtained the use of one of the 
        palm-thatched sheds here dignified with the name of houses, arranged my 
        boxes and table, and put up a drying-shelf indoors and out, protected 
        by water-insulation from the attacks of ants, I was ready to commence 
        my exploration of the unknown fauna of Aru. I had brought with me two 
        boys, whose sole business was to shoot and skin birds, while I attended 
        entirely to insects, and to the observation and registry of the habits 
        of the birds and animals I met with in my walks in the forest. The first 
        fortnight was very unpropitious, violent gusts of wind and driving rain 
        allowing us to do very little out of doors, and making the drying of the 
        little we obtained a matter of great difficulty. It soon became apparent 
        that in this small island there was a very limited number of birds, and 
        I determined to go as soon as possible to the large island; but that was 
        not an easy matter, and I now found that I should have brought from Macassar 
        three men accustomed to the islands, and who could take me wherever I 
        wanted to go. As it was, I had to get natives, and there was, as usual, 
        all sorts of delay, and then there was an alarm of pirates, and unfortunately 
        it was not a false alarm. A fleet of the celebrated Ilanun pirates, from 
        the island of Maguidanao, had really arrived; they attacked a small vessel 
        not far from Dobbo, which, escaping from them with one man wounded, brought 
        the news. Then came messengers from one of the northern islands, telling 
        how they had been attacked, and many <font color="990000">[[p. 475]]</font> 
        taken prisoners, and the rest of the population had all fled to the mainland. 
        Now for some time there was no more hope of my getting boats and men. 
        Guards were set in Dobbo, and prows were got ready to go after the pirates. 
        A few days more, and the crew of one of our captain's small vessels which 
        had gone trading among the islands, returned stripped of everything. They 
        had got on shore, while the pirates plundered the prow, taking everything, 
        even to the men's boxes and clothes. They reported that the pirates were 
        all at the east side of the islands, where the merchants send their small 
        vessels to buy pearl-shell and tripang, and there was no danger of their 
        returning again to this side, where they had more to fear and less to 
        get. Now, too, I received a letter I had been expecting from the Governor 
        of Amboyna, with orders to the Aru chief to give me assistance; and, after 
        two months' residence in Dobbo, I succeeded in getting a boat and two 
        natives, and set off for the great island of Aru.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited several localities, and at length, 
        finding a good one near the centre of the island, I stayed there six weeks, 
        and got, on the whole, a very fine collection of birds. Returning to Dobbo, 
        I intended to make another short excursion; but lameness, produced by 
        the constant irritation of insect-bites on my legs, kept me in the house 
        for several weeks, and the east wind became so strong, and the weather 
        so wet and boisterous, as to render travelling by sea in a small boat 
        out of the question. A little later, one of my bird-skinners left me, 
        and the other was laid up with intermittent fever, so I was compelled 
        to make the best of it, and get what I could in the small island till 
        the commencement of July, when we returned direct to Macassar.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having thus given an outline of my journey, 
        I shall proceed to give some account of the ornithology and general natural 
        history of the Aru Islands, and a summary of the collections I have made 
        there. The very first bird likely to attract one's attention at Dobbo 
        is a most beautiful brush-tongued parroquet, closely allied to <em>Trichoglossus 
        cyanogrammus</em>, Wagl. It frequents in flocks the Casuarina-trees which 
        line the beach, and its crimson under wings and orange breast make it 
        a most conspicuous and brilliant object. Its twittering whistle may be 
        heard almost constantly in the vicinity of the trees it frequents. Almost 
        the only other birds which approach the village are a swallow (<em>Hirundo 
        nigricans</em>, Vieill.), found also in New Guinea and Australia, and 
        an <em>Artamus</em>, probably <em>A. papuensis</em>, Temm., which perches 
        occasionally on the house-tops, or on dead trees in the neighbourhood. 
        A little black-and-white wagtail flycatcher (<em>Rhipidura</em>, sp.) 
        may also often be seen among bushes, and on the sea-beach, chirping musically, 
        and waving laterally its expanded tail whenever it alights.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 476]]</font> In the 
        forest which everywhere covers the islands, sombre and lofty as on the 
        banks of the Amazon, a different set of birds is met with, the two most 
        abundant being both New Guinea species, <em>Cracticus varius</em>, Gm., 
        sp., and <em>Phonygama viridis</em>, L. The former has a loud and very 
        varied note; sometimes a fine musical whistle; at others (principally 
        when alarmed), a harsh, toad-like croak. It is very active, flying about 
        from tree to tree and from bush to bush, seeking after insects, or feeding 
        on small fruits. It is a long time before one can recognize its various 
        cries for those of one and the same bird. The <em>Phonygama</em> is a 
        very powerful and active bird; its legs are particularly strong, and it 
        clings suspended to the smaller branches, while devouring the fruits on 
        which alone it appears to feed. Its affinities seem to be with the Paradiseas 
        rather than with the Garrulid&aelig;. Next to these, two species of <em>Dacelo</em> 
        are most frequently met with, and their loud monotonous cry, very much 
        resembling the bark of a dog, most frequently heard. A large crow, with 
        a fine sky-blue iris, and hoarse cawing cry, is also not uncommon; and 
        now I have mentioned all the birds, except parrots and pigeons, that are 
        common enough to be at all characteristic of the forest near Dobbo. For 
        noise, however, the Psittacid&aelig; surpass all others, and the Yellow-crested 
        Cockatoo (<em>Plyctolophus galerita</em>) is an absolute nuisance. Instead 
        of flying away when alarmed, as other birds do, it circuits round and 
        round from one tree to another, keeping up such a grating, creaking, tympanum-splitting 
        scream, as to oblige one to retire as soon as possible to a distance. 
        Far more agreeable is the low cooing of the pigeons, several fine species 
        of which are not uncommon. <em>Carpophaga pinon</em>, Q. &amp; G., is 
        plentiful, and another, which seems to be <em>C. Zo&euml;</em>, Less., 
        rather scarce; while <em>C. alba</em>, L., is common everywhere. Of the 
        smaller and more beautiful species there are also three, <em>Ptilonopus 
        perlatus</em>, Temm., <em>P. pulchellus</em>, Temm., and <em>P. purpuratus</em>, 
        Lath. These birds are all very difficult to obtain in good condition, 
        because their feathers fall so readily; but they are always acceptable, 
        as their flesh (especially that of the smaller species) is perhaps equal 
        in delicacy and flavour to that of any birds whatever.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one or two excursions which I made to the 
        mainland, immediately opposite Dobbo, I obtained the two beautiful flycatchers, 
        <em>Arses telescophthalma</em>, Garn. &amp; Less., and <em>A. chrysomela</em>, 
        G. &amp; L., as well as some species of <em>Ptilotis</em> and other small 
        birds new to me. It was not, however, until I was regularly established 
        in the central forests of the large island that I obtained a true insight 
        into the ornithological fauna of Aru. Then a host of new species burst 
        upon me, revealing the richness of the country, and its intimate connexion 
        with New Guinea. <em>Paradisea apoda</em>, L., <em>P. regia</em>, L., 
        <em>Microglossus aterrimus</em>, Wagl., <font color="990000">[[p. 477]]</font> 
        <em>Brachyurus Macklotti</em>, Temm., <em>B. nov&aelig;-guine&aelig;</em>, 
        Schlegel, <em>Tanysiptera</em>, sp., <em>Eurystomus gularis</em>, Vieill., 
        <em>Carpophaga</em>, n. s., with several small flycatchers, thrushes and 
        shrikes, and that most magnificent of the swallow-tribe, <em>Macropteryx 
        mystaceus</em>, Less., were what I now obtained,--almost all New Guinea 
        species, or new, and none of them found on the smaller islands. Of the 
        beautiful little &quot;King Bird of Paradise,&quot; I obtained several specimens 
        in perfect plumage and excellent condition. It feeds, I believe, entirely 
        on fruit, frequenting lofty trees in the deep forest, where it is very 
        active, flying from branch to branch, shaking its wings, and expanding 
        its beautiful fan-shaped breast-plumes.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> When 
        quite at rest, or feeding, these plumes are closed and concealed beneath 
        the wing. Of the &quot;Great Bird of Paradise,&quot; I have recorded my observations 
        in a separate paper. The Black Cockatoo is a very curious bird, of most 
        disproportionate form and dimensions. Its huge head certainly weighs as 
        much as its whole body. The legs are very long and slender for the tribe, 
        while its wings are large and powerful. Its cry is a shrill whistle, very 
        different from that of most other cockatoos. The bill of the male is larger, 
        and the apex more produced, than in the female; but the crest-plumes are 
        equally long in both. The <em>Tanysiptera</em> is a Kinghunter, feeding 
        on insects, worms, &amp;c., which it picks up from the ground in the damp 
        forest. Its coral-red bill is always dirty from this cause, and sometimes 
        so incrusted with mud that the bird seems to have been actually digging 
        for its food. The <em>Syma torotoro</em>, Less., also occurs, but much 
        more rarely, and seems to have very similar habits. Two species of <em>Megapodius</em> 
        are plentiful, and the immense mounds of earth and leaves formed by them 
        are scattered all over the forest. These mounds are generally from 5 to 
        8 feet high, and from 15 to 30 feet in diameter. But the giant of the 
        Aru forests is the Cassowary (<em>Casuarius galeatus</em>, Vieill.); it 
        is by no means uncommon, and the young are brought in numbers to Dobbo, 
        where they soon become tame, running about the streets, and picking up 
        all sorts of refuse food. When very young, they are striped with broad 
        lines of rich brown and pale buff. This gradually fades into a dull pale 
        brown, and in the old bird changes to black. They <em>sit</em> down to 
        rest on their tib&aelig;, and lie down on their breast to sleep; they 
        are very frolicsome, having mock fights, rolling on their backs, and leaping 
        in a most ridiculous manner with all the antics of a kitten. The same 
        species is said to be found in Ceram, and also in the small island of 
        Goram, as well as in New Guinea. The following list shows the number of 
        species in each of the principal tribes and families which I have observed 
        in Aru:--</p>

	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this list, and the preceding observations, 
      it will be seen that many Australian genera and some species occur in Aru; 
      while, considering the very small number of species known from New Guinea, 
      and the necessarily very imperfect exploration of Aru in such a short time, 
      the number of identical species is very remarkable. I believe that nearly 
      one-half of the hitherto-described species of passerine birds from New Guinea 
      will be found in my Aru collections, a proportion which we could only expect 
      if all the species of the latter country inhabit also the former. Such an 
      identity occurs, I believe, in no other countries separated by so wide an 
      interval of sea, for the average distance of the coast of Aru from that 
      of New Guinea is at least 150 miles, and the points of nearest approach 
      upwards of 100. Ceylon is nearer to India; Van Diemen's Land is not farther 
      from Australia, nor Sardinia from Italy; yet all these countries present 
      differences more or less marked in their faunas; they possess each their 
      peculiar species, and sometimes even peculiar genera. Almost the only islands 
      possessing a rich fauna, but identical with that of the adjacent continent, 
      are Great Britain and Sicily, and that circumstance is held to prove that 
      they have been once <font color="990000">[[p. 479]]</font> a portion of 
      such continents, and geological evidence shows that the separation had taken 
      place at no distant period. We must, therefore, suppose Aru to have once 
      formed a part of New Guinea, in order to account for its peculiar fauna, 
      and this view is supported by the physical geography of the islands; for, 
      while the fathomless Molucca sea extends to within a few miles of them on 
      the west, the whole space eastward to New Guinea, and southward to Australia, 
      is occupied by a bank of soundings at a uniform depth of about 30 or 40 
      fathoms. But there is another circumstance still more strongly proving this 
      connexion: the great island of Aru, 80 miles in length from north to south, 
      is traversed by three winding channels of such uniform width and depth, 
      though passing through an irregular, undulating, rocky country, that they 
      seem portions of true rivers, though now occupied by salt water, and open 
      at each end to the entrance of the tides. This ph&aelig;nomenon is unique, 
      and we can account for their formation in no other way than by supposing 
      them to have been once true rivers, having their source in the mountains 
      of New Guinea, and reduced to their present condition by the subsidence 
      of the intervening land. </p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This view of the origin of the Aru fauna is 
        further confirmed by considering what it is not, as well as what it is; 
        its deficiencies teach as much as what it possesses. There are certain 
        families of birds highly characteristic of the Indian Archipelago in its 
        western and better-known portion. In the Peninsula of Malacca, Sumatra, 
        Java, Borneo and the Philippine Islands, the following families are abundant 
        in species and in individuals. They are everywhere <em>common birds</em>. 
        They are the <em>Bucerid&aelig;</em>, <em>Picid&aelig;</em>, <em>Bucconid&aelig;</em>, 
        <em>Trogonid&aelig;</em>, <em>Meropid&aelig;</em>, and <em>Eurylaimid&aelig;</em>; 
        but not one species of all these families is found in Aru, nor, with two 
        doubtful exceptions, in New Guinea. The whole are also absent from Australia. 
        To complete our view of the subject, it is necessary also to consider 
        the Mammalia, which present peculiarities and deficiencies even yet more 
        striking. Not one species found in the great islands westward inhabits 
        Aru or New Guinea. With the exception only of pigs and bats, not a genus, 
        not a family, not even an order of mammals is found in common. No Quadrumana, 
        no Sciurid&aelig;, no Carnivora, Rodentia, or Ungulata inhabit these depopulated 
        forests. With the two exceptions above mentioned, all the mammalia are 
        <em>Marsupials</em>; in the great western islands there is not a single 
        marsupial! A kangaroo inhabits Aru (and several New Guinea), and this, 
        with three or four species of <em>Cuscus</em>, two or three little rat-like 
        marsupials, a wild pig and several bats, are all the mammalia I have been 
        able either to obtain or hear of.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the full development of such interesting 
        details that <font color="990000">[[p. 480]]</font> the collector and 
        the systematist contribute so largely. In this point of view the discovery 
        of every new species is important, and their correct description and accurate 
        identification absolutely necessary. The most obscure and minute species 
        are for this purpose of equal value with the largest and most brilliant, 
        and a correct knowledge of the distribution and variations of a beetle 
        or a butterfly as important as those of the eagle or the elephant. It 
        is to the elucidation of these apparent anomalies that the efforts of 
        the philosophic naturalist are directed; and we think, that if this highest 
        branch of our science were more frequently alluded to by writers on natural 
        history, its connexion with geography and geology discussed, and the various 
        interesting problems thence arising explained, the too prevalent idea--that 
        Natural History is at best but an amusement, a trivial and aimless pursuit, 
        a useless accumulating of barren facts,--would give place to more correct 
        views of a study, which presents problems as vast, as intricate, and as 
        interesting as any to which the human mind can be directed, whose objects 
        are as infinite as the stars of heaven and infinitely diversified, and 
        whose field of research extends over the whole earth, not only as it now 
        exists, but also during the countless changes it has undergone from the 
        earliest geological epochs.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine if the theories of modern 
        naturalists will explain the ph&aelig;nomena of the Aru and New Guinea 
        fauna. We know (with a degree of knowledge approaching to certainty) that 
        at a comparatively recent geological period, not one single species of 
        the present organic world was in existence; while all the <em>Vertebrata</em> 
        now existing have had their origin still more recently. How do we account 
        for the places where they came into existence? Why are not the same species 
        found in the same climates all over the world? The general explanation 
        given is, that as the ancient species became extinct, new ones were created 
        in each country or district, adapted to the physical conditions of that 
        district. Sir C. Lyell, who has written more fully, and with more ability, 
        on this subject than most naturalists, adopts this view. He illustrates 
        it by speculating on the vast physical changes that might be effected 
        in North Africa by the upheaval of a chain of mountains in the Sahara. 
        &quot;Then,&quot; he says, &quot;the animals and plants of Northern Africa would disappear, 
        and the region would gradually become fitted for the reception of a population 
        of species <em>perfectly dissimilar in their forms, habits, and organization</em>.&quot; 
        Now this theory implies, that we shall find a general similarity in the 
        productions of countries which resemble each other in climate and general 
        aspect, while there shall be a complete dissimilarity between those which 
        are totally opposed in these respects. And if this is the general law 
        which has <font color="990000">[[p. 481]]</font> determined the distribution 
        of the existing organic world, there must be no exceptions, no striking 
        contradictions. Now we have seen how totally the productions of New Guinea 
        differ from those of the Western Islands of the Archipelago, say Borneo, 
        as the type of the rest, and as almost exactly equal in area to New Guinea. 
        This difference, it must be well remarked, is not one of species, but 
        of genera, families, and whole orders. Yet it would be difficult to point 
        out two countries more exactly resembling each other in climate and physical 
        features. In neither is there any marked dry season, rain falling more 
        or less all the year round; both are near the equator, both subject to 
        the east and west monsoons, both everywhere covered with lofty forest; 
        both have a great extent of flat, swampy coast and a mountainous interior; 
        both are rich in Palms and Pandanace&aelig;. If, on the other hand, we 
        compare Australia with New Guinea, we can scarcely find a stronger contrast 
        than in their physical conditions: the one near the equator, the other 
        near and beyond the tropics; the one enjoying perpetual moisture, the 
        other with alternations of excessive drought; the one a vast ever-verdant 
        forest, the other dry open woods, downs, or deserts. Yet the faunas of 
        the two, though mostly distinct in species, are strikingly similar in 
        character. Every family of birds (except <em>Menurid&aelig;</em>) found 
        in Australia also inhabits New Guinea, while all those striking deficiencies 
        of the latter exist equally in the former. But a considerable proportion 
        of the characteristic Australian <em>genera</em> are also found in New 
        Guinea, and, when that country is better known, it is to be supposed that 
        the number will be increased. In the Mammalia it is the same. Marsupials 
        are almost the only quadrupeds in the one as in the other. If kangaroos 
        are especially adapted to the dry plains and open woods of Australia, 
        there must be some other reason for their introduction into the dense 
        damp forests of New Guinea, and we can hardly imagine that the great variety 
        of monkeys, of squirrels, of Insectivora, and of Felid&aelig;, were created 
        in Borneo because the country was adapted to them, and not one single 
        species given to another country exactly similar, and at no great distance. 
        If there is any reason in the hardness of the woods or the scarcity of 
        wood-boring insects, why woodpeckers should be absent from Australia, 
        there is none why they should not swarm in the forests of New Guinea as 
        well as in those of Borneo and Malacca. We can hardly help concluding, 
        therefore, that some other law has regulated the distribution of existing 
        species than the physical conditions of the countries in which they are 
        found, or we should not see countries the most opposite in character with 
        similar productions, while others almost exactly alike as respects climate 
        and general aspect, yet differ totally in their forms of organic life.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 482]]</font> In a 
        former Number of this periodical we endeavoured to show that the simple 
        law, of every new creation being closely allied to some species already 
        existing in the same country, would explain all these anomalies, if taken 
        in conjunction with the changes of surface and the gradual extinction 
        and introduction of species, which are facts proved by geology. At the 
        period when New Guinea and North Australia were united, it is probable 
        that their physical features and climate were more similar, and that a 
        considerable proportion of the species inhabiting each portion of the 
        country were found over the whole. After the separation took place, we 
        can easily understand how the climate of both might be considerably modified, 
        and this might perhaps lead to the extinction of certain species. During 
        the period that has since elapsed, new species have been gradually introduced 
        into each, but in each closely allied to the pre-existing species, many 
        of which were at first common to the two countries. This process would 
        evidently produce the present condition of the two faunas, in which there 
        are many allied species,--few identical. The great well-marked groups 
        absent from the one would necessarily be so from the other also, for however 
        much they might be <em>adapted</em> to the country, the law of close affinity 
        would not allow of their appearance, except by a long succession of steps 
        occupying an immense geological interval. The species which at the time 
        of separation were found only in one country, would, by the gradual introduction 
        of species allied to them, give rise to groups peculiar to that country. 
        This separation of New Guinea from Australia no doubt took place while 
        Aru yet formed part of the former island. Its separation must have occurred 
        at a very recent period, the number of species common to the two showing 
        that scarcely any extinctions have since taken place, and probably as 
        few introductions of new species.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we now suppose the Aru Islands to remain 
        undisturbed during a period equal to about one division of the Tertiary 
        epoch of geologists, we have reason to believe that the change of species 
        of Vertebrata will become complete, an entirely new race having gradually 
        been introduced, but all more or less closely allied to those now existing. 
        During the same period a new fauna will also have arisen in New Guinea, 
        and then the two will present the same comparative features that North 
        Australia and New Guinea do now. Let the process of gradual change still 
        go on for another period regulated by the same laws. Some species will 
        then have become extinct in the one country, and unreplaced, while in 
        the other a numerous series of modified species may have been introduced. 
        Then the faunas will come to differ not in species only, but in generic 
        groups. There would be then the resemblance between them that there is 
        between the West <font color="990000">[[p. 483]]</font> India Islands 
        and Mexico. During another geological period, let us suppose Aru to be 
        elevated, and become a mountainous country, and extended by alluvial plains, 
        while New Guinea was depressed, reduced in area, and thus many of its 
        species perhaps extinguished. New species might then be more rapidly introduced 
        into the modified and enlarged country; some groups, which had been early 
        extinct in the other, might thus become very rich in species, and then 
        we should have an exact counterpart of what we see now in Madagascar, 
        where the families and some of the genera are African, but where there 
        are many extensive groups of species forming peculiar genera, or even 
        families, but still with a general resemblance to African forms. In this 
        manner, it is believed, we may account for the facts of the present distribution 
        of animals, without supposing any changes but what we know have been constantly 
        going on. It is quite unnecessary to suppose that new species have ever 
        been created &quot;perfectly dissimilar in forms, habits, and organization&quot; 
        from those which have preceded them; neither do &quot;centres of creation,&quot; 
        which have been advocated by some, appear either necessary or accordant 
        with facts, unless we suppose a &quot;centre&quot; in every island and in every 
        district which possesses a peculiar species.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that, for the complete elucidation 
        of the present state of the fauna of each island and each country, we 
        require a knowledge of its geological history, its elevations and subsidences, 
        and all the changes it has undergone since it last rose above the ocean. 
        This can very seldom be obtained; but a knowledge of the fauna and its 
        relation to that of the neighbouring countries will often throw great 
        light upon the geology, and enable us to trace out with tolerable certainty 
        its past history. A consideration of the birds of Aru has led us at some 
        length into this subject, both on account of the interest attached to 
        it, and because we are not aware of any attempt to explain in detail how 
        the existing distribution of species has arisen, or strictly to connect 
        it with those changes of surface which all countries have undergone. The 
        Birds and Mammalia only have been used for illustration, because they 
        are much better known than any other groups. The Insects, however, of 
        which I have made a very extensive collection, furnish exactly similar 
        results, and were these, particularly the Coleoptera, well known, they 
        would perhaps be preferable to any group for such an inquiry, from the 
        great number of their genera and species, and the very limited range which 
        many of them attain. In imperfectly explored countries, however, Birds 
        are almost always better known than any other group, as a larger proportion 
        of the whole number of species may be obtained in a limited time. I think 
        it probable that I have <font color="990000">[[p. 484]]</font> collected 
        more than half the birds inhabiting Aru, while I do not imagine I have 
        obtained one fifth part of the Insects. The following is a brief summary 
        of my collections in this class:--</p>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the conchologists should think I have quite 
        neglected their interests, I may mention, that I have collected all the 
        land-shells I could find or procure from the natives. I have only obtained, 
        however, 25 species. Almost all are Helices (20 species), some pretty 
        and some of curious forms, but I am not sufficiently acquainted with shells 
        to say how much novelty they present. It is remarkable that I have not 
        found a single <em>Bulimus</em>, which in Celebes was the most abundant 
        group; the few <em>Cyclostomata</em> are also small and obscure. Reptiles 
        are scarce. I did not see a snake six times in as many months. There are, 
        however, on the shores many sea-snakes, whose bite is very deadly. The 
        natives spear and eat them. Lizards are rather plentiful in species and 
        individuals; they are almost all plant-dwellers, and run on the leaves 
        and twigs with great agility. The coasts swarm with fish in immense variety, 
        and mollusca innumerable. A shell-collector would obtain a fine harvest, 
        but I have been too fully occupied myself to attend to any of these last-mentioned 
        groups; having often found the greatest difficulty in properly drying 
        and securing my bird and insect collections in the rude houses, boats, 
        and sheds I have been compelled to occupy. Damp, mites, ants, rats and 
        dogs, are all enemies which must be guarded against with ever-watchful 
        vigilance, and from all of them I have suffered more or less severely. 
        Bird and animal skins require daily exposure to air and sun for weeks 
        before they are dry enough to pack away. In this time they accumulate 
        to such an extent, that it is a constant puzzle and difficulty to find 
        places to put them in, so as to keep them free from ants, which establish 
        colonies inside the skin, whence they sally out to gnaw the eyelids, the 
        base of the bill and the feet; arsenic they laugh to scorn; and there 
        is absolutely nothing that will keep them away but water-isolation, which 
        again requires space and constant care to keep perfect. When to these 
        are added insect specimens by thousands, requiring still greater care, 
        the mere labour of watching the collections during the time they must 
        remain exposed to the air, to <font color="990000">[[p. 485]]</font> sunshine, 
        and often to artificial heat, is greater than a collector in a temperate 
        climate, and residing in weather-tight roomy houses, can have any conception 
        of. These remarks are merely my apology for not collecting <em>everything</em>, 
        which stay-at-home naturalists often imagine may be as easily done anywhere 
        else as in England.</p>

       <p align="left"><i>These empirical regularities emerge from this report concerning the biogeography of the Aru Islands: Similarities among species, within genera or families, are greatest when spatial and temporal proximity is greatest. Greater differences correlate with longer periods and distances of separation, and not with environmental differences. One would expect at Lyellian 'centres of creation' novel forms closely adapted to their immediate environments and thus manifesting differences between distinct ecological regions, but little similarity to others in these environmentally distinct regions. Thus divergence from parental type occurs continuously producing specific, generic and familial differences and driven by like natural causes, yet to be specified. Whether of not self-consciously, Wallace employs an inductive methodology vindicated in the success of Newton's celestial mechanics.</i></p>
       <p align="center"><i><strong>Wallace and Newtonian Parsimony<sup>1</sup></strong></i></p>
       <p align="left"><i>
         Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace both left behind private notebooks recording thoughts leading to their respective discoveries of natural selection. During the few years preceding their discoveries both deliberately sought a novel kind of explanation of the occurrence of new species. Both offered compelling conceptual arguments against Charles Lyell's explanation by occasional creationism. Their search for a naturalistic explanation of speciation is a revolutionary research program that is supported by reasons whose force is vindicated by Isaac Newton's use of similar arguments. There are important circumstantial differences between the search paths of Darwin, in the years 1836-9, and Wallace, in the years 1845-58. Darwin followed Lyell in initially becoming interested in speciation as a means of maintaining plenitude and ecological balance to counter losses generated by pervasive extinction. Wallace's search took place later than Darwin's and was stimulated by Robert Chambers's <u>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</u>, which appeared in 1845, after Darwin had formulated his theory in unpublished papers. Wallace follows Chambers in taking evolution, as evidenced in the fossil record, to be essentially progressive, whereas Darwin compromises Lyell's anti-progressivism in holding evolution to be only contingently progressive, i.e. sometimes regressive. In spite of differences, their arguments against Lyell's creationism are remarkably similar.<br />
         <br />
         Lyell's <u>Principles of Geology</u> (first edition 1830-3) contains a schema for explaining the distribution of animals and plants on continents and islands. Species are adapted, endowed with powers of dispersal, and introduced by the 'author of nature' at 'centers of creation' and then disperse to ecological barriers. Extinction occurs when adaptations are exceed by changes in climatological and ecological circumstances that offer organisms no avenue of escape. Lyell argues for a 'barrier' to natural speciation as follows: &quot;. . . varieties will differ in some cases more decidedly than some species, if we admit that there is a gradual scale of being, and assume that the following laws prevail . . . : first that the organization of individuals is capable of being modified to a limited extent by the force of external causes; secondly that these modifications are, to a certain extent, transmissible to their offspring; thirdly that there are fixed limits beyond which the descendants from common parents can never deviate from a certain type; fourthly, that each species springs from one original stock, and can never be permanently confounded, by intermixing the progeny of any other stock . . .&quot; <sup>2</sup><br />
         <br />
         Turning to Wallace's criticisms, Wallace argues thus: &quot;If there is no other character [than differences of degree distinguishing permanent varieties from species], that fact is one of the strongest arguments against the independent creation of species, for why should a special act of creation be required to call into existences an organism differing only in degree from another which has been produced by existing laws?&quot; <sup>3</sup><br />
         <br />
         Wallace's argument here is similar in form to that offered by Newton for the identity of terrestrial and celestial gravity. Newton's argument is that the transition in thought from celestial bodies moving just above mountain tops to terrestrial objects is not marked by any distinct characteristic of the bodies or the forces to which they are subject. Hence, if there were a difference between celestial centripetal forces and gravity, a moon with the motion of a projectile would descend with twice the acceleration of terrestrial gravity.<sup>4</sup> In such a scenario there would be two forces, where one is sufficient, in violation of Newton's parsimony (Rules I and II, [1962], p. 398).<br />

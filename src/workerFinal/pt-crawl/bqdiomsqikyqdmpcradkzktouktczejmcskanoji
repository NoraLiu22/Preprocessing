    An essential requirement of a recording system for broadcasting is that it 
    should be possible to playback as soon as possible after making a recording. 
    When broadcasting began the manufacture of gramophone records was a well established 
    industry, but the process involved in making a record took at least twelve 
    hours. It wasn't until 1930 that a tape recording system suitable for broadcast 
    use was available.<br />
    <br />
    As early as 1900 the Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen (1869-1942) was demonstrating 
    his Telegraphone at the Paris Universal Exhibition. This machine magnetically 
    recorded telegraphy transmissions on a steel wire. In 1924 Dr. Kurt Stille 
    (1873-1957), a German engineer, developed a practical office dictating machine 
    which was produced by the Vox Gramophone Company. This, too, recorded onto 
    steel wire but the quality fell far short of broadcast standards. The BBC 
    became aware of this machine and closely followed developments in magnetic 
    recording. Its interest increased with the coming of the Empire Service, where 
    the same programme would be repeated several times for different time zones.<br />
    <br />
    Film producer and showman Louis Blattner (1881-1935), a German who lived in 
    England, formed a company to develop and market Stille's inventions. Among 
    the projects that he set his engineers was to produce a machine which he hoped 
    could be used as a source of sound synchronised to film.<br />
    <br />
    In September 1930 a machine was installed for trials at Avenue House, then 
    the home of the BBC's Research Department and the results were deemed good 
    enough for speech, but not for music. The BBC negotiated a five-year rental 
    agreement with the British Blattnerphone Company in January 1931 at &pound;500 
    for the first year, &pound;1000 per year thereafter, plus &pound;250 for each 
    additional machine.<br clear="all" />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="blattner/blattner_6.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="The Blattnerphone 
		at Savoy Hill" title="The Blattnerphone at Savoy Hill" /></div>
    In May 1931 the Blattnerphone was moved to Savoy Hill <i>(right)</i> and entered 
    service. In March the following year it was moved again, this time to the 
    newly constructed Broadcasting House where it was installed on the seventh 
    floor. A second machine soon joined it, allowing recordings of any length 
    to be made by switching between the two recorders. These first machines were 
    made in Germany. They recorded onto 6mm wide steel tape which ran at 5ft/sec. 
    A full spool weighing 21lbs contained just over a mile of tape giving a recording 
    time of twenty minutes. The speed of the D.C. motor had to be controlled by 
    watching a stroboscope attached to the capstan and operating a sliding rheostat. 
    The machines soon proved to be mechanically unreliable. In September 1932 
    a third machine was installed at BH. Again of German manufacture it used 3mm 
    wide tape which came on spools allowing 32 minutes recording time. The drive 
    was by an A.C. motor. With careful adjustment this machine gave better results 
    than its predecessors, but still suffered from uneven tape speed. <br />
    <br />
    At the end of 1932 a programme called &quot;Pieces of Tape&quot; was produced 
    in the Blattnerphone room, being a compilation of several tapes recorded that 
    year. However, the mechanics of the editing process were too laborious for 
    regular productions using the technique.<br />
    <br />
    The following February a second 3mm machine arrived. Designed (by von Heising 
    of the British Blattnerphone Company) and built in England it was bench mounted 
    and used two A.C. motors, one for the tape drive and the other for the spools. 
    Although it was better engineered and more reliable than the other machines 
    it was mechanically noisy and had worse speed constancy than the original 
    machine.<br />
    <br />
    By now the original 6mm machines were being used only for transferring the 
    recordings they had made to discs. The 3mm machines required considerable 
    maintenance effort to keep them working, and this had an impact on the number 
    of bookings that could be fulfilled. When the Marconi Company bought the Blattnerphone 
    rights in March 1933 they offered to sell the BBC the four rented machines. 
    The Corporation wanted British Blattnerphone to replace all four with a new 
    improved design from Marconi as soon as possible. In the meantime it hired 
    three machines of the von Heising design which were installed by January 1934.<br />
    <br />

    <br clear="all" />
    <br />
    These machines had five heads on the central pillar - spare record and play 
    heads had been added allowing immediate change-over should one of the heads 
    fail. This seems to have been done at the suggestion of BBC engineer R. C. 
    (Reggie) Patrick, then working for Research Department, who was installing 
    the BBC machines. When an edit damaged the pole pieces the other head was 
    brought into contact with the tape and the damaged head's pole pieces were 
    replaced.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="atL"><img src="blattner/blattner_4.jpg" width="425" height="343" alt="Rear" title="Rear removed, showing motors" /></div>
    <div class="atR270">The two motors were of similar type. The left one, via 
      gearing and a friction clutch, drove the left spool and, via a V-section 
      belt and similar clutch, the right one too. The clutches were adjusted so 
      that the tape was just in tension and when the main tape drive was applied 
      the tape would unwind from one spool and take up on the other.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <br clear="right" />
    <div class="atR"><img src="blattner/blattner_5.jpg" width="200" height="236" alt="detail" title="Driving wheel and friction belt" /></div>
    <br clear="left" />
    <br />
    The second motor was connected through a worm gear and flexible coupling to 
    drive a flywheel, which was rigidly coupled to the 'driving wheel', or capstan. 
    The motion of the driving wheel was transmitted to the tape by a moving canvas 
    friction belt which ran round four jockey pulleys (one of which was adjustable) 
    and also passed below the driving wheel.<br />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="blattner/blattner_channel.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="Channel" title="Channel at Maida Vale" /></div>
    During 1934 it was clear that recording was outgrowing its space in BH and 
    in November the three Marconi Blattners and the first von Heising machine 
    were moved to Maida Vale. By this time twenty tapes a week were being recorded 
    for the Empire Service, keeping the machines busy for up to seventeen hours 
    a day. The arrival of the Marconi-Stille machines (see next page) during 1935 
    allowed the Blattners to be taken out of service and returned to the manufacturer, 
    though one was retained for research purposes. In September 1939 this machine 
    was hurriedly sent up to Wood Norton in Worcestershire, which was about to 
    become the temporary home of several production departments.

    I came across the Blattnerphone when we tried to interest the BBC Governors 
    in setting up a museum at the Washford transmitting station. Senior management 
    meetings were held in the early 1980s to discuss the issues. The final answer, 
    sent to me by the BBC Secretary, was that the BBC is in the broadcasting business 
    and could not spend money on a museum.<br />
    <br />
    The Blattnerphone had been one of several historical BBC items stored unofficially 
    in a number of places and subsequently dispersed so parts became separated. 
    I scoured round for many of the parts, including the head assembly, which 
    had found its way to Start Point – I had to crawl under a large piece of equipment 
    to retrieve it.<br />
    <br />
    The two original machines provided by Louis Blattner used 6mm wide steel tape 
    which weighed about 10kg and used a mile of tape in 20 minutes. The preserved 
    machine is probably the third one to be delivered in 1932, and was the first 
    to use 3mm wide tape.<br />
    <br />
    When I got the machine going, Reg Patrick, the BBC Engineer responsible for 
    installing the Blattnerphones in the 1930s, helped me with advice and a number 
    of the original and specially made pole pieces.<br />
    <br />
    I made up a (valved) amplifier with the right equaliser settings and to provide 
    DC bias. Erase was DC through the erase head. Power came from a substantial 
    induction motor to give fairly constant speed at the capstan, but it was very 
    difficult to set up the clutches to maintain reasonable tension on the tape 
    all the time.<br />
    <br />
    I had to wear thick gloves when working with the machine – on record and replay 
    the reels of steel tape whirled round at quite a speed and during fast rewind 
    it was wise to step right back in case of breakage. Health & Safety wouldn't 
    permit it today! Most of the tapes I found were rusty; however a reasonable 
    one enabled me to record and play sufficiently well to prove that it worked 
    - though way short of broadcast quality. I was able to demonstrate the Blattnerphone 
    working at a BVWS meeting back in the 80s.<br />
    <br />
    At the time, I was a BBC Engineer working at Washford Cross. Edward Pawley 
    and other senior BBC staff had produced a number of books about the technical 
    history of the BBC who were at the forefront of technological advances at 
    the time. I was fortunate to drive around the country (my own time and expense) 
    to see some of the hardware before it was finally dispersed. Much of this 
    could have been saved had the BBC Governors decided otherwise, though I have 
    to agree their decision was correct in the circumstances.<br clear="all" />
    <div class="subTitleBanner">Footnote by Roger Derry</div>
    It was in 1987. As Assistant Organiser Production Facilities I occasionally, 
    with David Stripp from Engineering management, organised internal to the BBC 
    exhibitions by manufacturers. This one was in studio 8A at the top of Broadcasting 
    House and was a two day event. The first was a closed day for managers and 
    senior operational staff. <br />
    <br />
    The second was advertised in the BBC Magazine &quot;<i>Ariel</i>&quot; and 
    entirely open to all staff. The manufacturer was the German company Sennheiser 
    and on the first day we heard a presentation by Manfred Hibbing, Sennheiser's 
    designer. The core design innovation was to reduce the noise figures which 
    was done by leaving the mechanical resonances undamped and to equalize them 
    out electrically.<br />
    <br />
    On the second day there was a considerable number of people visiting all of 
    who looked like the &quot;usual suspects&quot;. Then about four o'clock a 
    figure who stood out came in. He seemed to be in his 70s and was wearing a 
    black 3-piece suit with a fob watch in his waist coat. Indeed he was in his 
    70s: &quot;I've come up for the Savoy Hill reunion dinner&quot; he said &quot;so 
    I thought I would come and look at the exhibition&quot;.<br />
    <br />
    This was Reggie Patrick, as I discovered when I introduced myself. That was 
    a fairly impressive opening line that was trumped by his next statement. He 
    looked round 8A and said &quot;I accepted this studio when BH was opened&quot;. 
    (This is the full engineering test required before the studio could be used). 
    Then that statement was itself trumped as we went on to talk about the purpose 
    of the exhibition - new microphones. He started to talk about spending night 
    shifts testing new microphones; many of them with Alan Blumlein, the legendary 
    pioneer of stereophonic sound and electronic television. Reggie said how one 
    of the best tests was rattling a bunch of keys and hearing how well they reproduced. 
    Coincidentally, a few days earlier, I had been at an Institute of Broadcast 
    Sound meeting where the identical method was being advocated for testing radio 
    microphones and their companding systems. <br />
    <br />
    &quot;The best one&quot;, he said, &quot;was Alan Blumlein's - the one with 
    the balsa wood diaphragm&quot;. I had read about this microphone and knew 
    that it was highly regarded but I was not prepared for what followed. &quot;He 
    had this idea to reduce the noise level. What he did was to leave in all the 
    resonances and equalise them out electrically&quot; This was the very idea 
    that had been presented as new high tech the previous day. So it was with 
    a big smile on my face that I introduced him to Sennheiser's designer.<br />
    <br />
    Returning to steel tape; one of my studio manager colleagues Rowena Taylor 
    had actually edited Marconi Stille steel tape recordings. This involved using 
    a spot welder. She told me that this resulted in a fade-out/fade-in at the 
    edit. This was caused by the temperature of the tape exceeding its Curie point 
    destroying the magnetism. Rowena had also been responsible for transferring 
    old Philips-Miller film recordings to archive 7.5ips tape in the early fifties.
    <br /><a name="croll"></a>
    <span class="subTitleBanner2">A Memory by Mike Croll</span><br clear="all" />
	My first experience of the world of archive recordings was when I was working 
	with Bill Manson in about 1969 and he was asked to replay a dozen reels of old 
	steel tape recordings that had been unearthed.  There was a feeling that these 
	were probably 30 years old and could be significant. Arrangements were made 
	to have an old Blattnerphone recorder shipped down from the Science Museum, 
	clean it up and connect it to a suitable amplifier.  It turned out that the 
	spools were loaded with short lengths of tape that needed to be welded together 
	and the joints ground down before they could be played.  The machine made an 
	awful clattering sound as the joints ran through the replay magnetic pole 
	that was pressed against the recordings by springs.  The output from the 
	amplifier was recorded on magnetic tape and contained none of the clatter 
	of the mechanics.  Sadly, after all the work it turned out that the tapes 
	only contained offcuts and speech recordings of no significance.<br clear="all" />

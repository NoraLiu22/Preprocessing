<tr>
<td><u>Teagan D. (Kindergarten)</u><br />
It is very important to grow your brain.<br />
If you do not use your brain<br />
You do not do good in class.<br />
<strong>B</strong>usy boxes are my favorite (and brain breaks, too)<br />
<strong>R</strong>esting my head down on my desk<br />
<strong>A</strong>lways playing at recesss and in the calm room<br />
<strong>I</strong> have an idea. A good idea!<br />
<strong>N</strong>ever talking during quiet time<br />
I get smarter and smarter every single day<br />
When I use my brain!
</td>
<td><u>Alex K. (4th grade)</u><br />
In my skull, a universe spins,<br />
Where logic reigns and chaos begins,<br />
Neurons fire, sparking bright,<br />
In the theater of mind, I take flight.<br />
A symphony of thought, a cosmic dance,<br />
In this brain of mine, I'll take my chance.<br />
For in the labyrinth of my mind's design,<br />
Endless wonders, I shall find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><u>Amos R. (6th Grade)</u><br />
Brains are like forest,<br />
Tree-shaped neurons signaling<br />
Messages of life<br />
</td>
<td><u>Milo S. (10th Grade)</u><br />
Your memory helps you know what to do,<br />
Process the past, or remember a clue;<br />
think of a face,<br />
route to a place,<br />
Or even recall if something is new.
<pre>

</pre></td></tr>

<tr><td>
<u>Alena C. (12th Grade)</u><br />
The brain, such a curious thing,<br />
Full of thoughts and ideas that it brings,<br />
It's such a delight,<br />
And loves to excite,<br />
To your body and head it's the king.</td>

<td><u>Poushali D. (Adult)</u><br />
To learn new things<br />

Truly comprehend the link<br />
Between the physical brain<br />
Helps train.<br />
To remember things<br />
Understand how the brain creates new thoughts.<br />
Understanding will help us connect the dots.<br />
Take some time to understand.<br />
Cause your brain is a whole new land!

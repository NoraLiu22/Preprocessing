   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">The topic of
   this and the adjoining sessions is data collection for action and
   research.&nbsp; This session describes one particular approach to
   data collection.&nbsp; It is known as convergent
   interviewing.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">I begin with
   an overview of the technique.&nbsp; This is followed up by a more
   detailed description, first of an individual interview, then of a
   series of interviews.&nbsp; Finally I offer some suggestions for
   applications, and further reading.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">I have a
   number of reasons for describing convergent interviewing at this
   stage in the program.&nbsp; It illustrates many of the principles
   discussed in the previous session.&nbsp; It was designed as an
   action research technique.&nbsp; It is systematic enough that it
   can be described easily, but flexible enough that it can be used
   in messy situations.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">If I used
   only one data collection method (though that is quite often
   inadvisable) I think this might be it.&nbsp; At first glance it's
   less participative than I might wish.&nbsp; But this can be
   remedied, or at least alleviated.&nbsp;
   <A NAME="a_s8_brief"></A></FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">In
   brief...</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">To start each
   interview you ask a very open ended question, and then keep your
   informant talking.&nbsp; The content of a convergent interview
   therefore comes almost entirely from the informant.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Each
   interview starts this way.&nbsp; All informants are given the
   chance at first to contribute their perceptions unshaped by more
   detailed questions.&nbsp; In most interviews, but especially the
   later ones, you add more specific questions.&nbsp; This occurs
   towards the end of the interview.&nbsp; The specific questions
   become more precise from interview to interview.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">The process
   is structured.&nbsp; There are some definable stages to each
   interview.&nbsp; You interpret the information as you proceed --
   you don't save it up for analysis at the end of the program.&nbsp;
   The series of interviews is structured in such a way that
   information is interpreted from interview to interview.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">In analysing
   the data, you identify disagreements: when different people offer
   different views of some issue.&nbsp; You use them to guide the
   development of probe questions which take you deeper into
   explanation.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">The result is
   a reasonably efficient form of data collection and
   interpretation.&nbsp; It allows the quality of data and
   interpretation to be checked.&nbsp; The process is driven by the
   informants and the data they provide.&nbsp; If sampling is
   reasonably good, you can obtain a good understanding from
   surprisingly few people.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">All of this
   will become clearer as we go into more detail.&nbsp;

   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">There are

   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman"><B>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapport.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make

      &nbsp;</FONT></LI>
      
      <LI><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">what the
      purpose of the interview is</FONT></LI>
   </UL>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">and any other
   information which your informants are likely to want to know about
   the study.&nbsp; Use this stage to build initial
   rapport.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Your
   informants will probably want to know who will get the
   information, and in what form.&nbsp; My preference is to collate
   information in such a way that I preserve the anonymity of
   informants.&nbsp; I also prefer to make the same information
   available to everyone.</FONT></P>
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">"I'll
      report the results of the interviews only in summary.&nbsp;
      I'll do it in such a way that you can't be identified as the
      source of any information.&nbsp; Any information which I give
      to <B>anyone</B> is also available to you."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">I think it's
   important to be clear about your motives, who is paying you, who
   gets your allegiance, and what is likely to happen as a
   consequence of the interviews.&nbsp; If the informants have to
   guess at this, their paranoia may blossom.&nbsp; People may assume
   that unstated motives are deliberately hidden motives, and they
   may suspect the worst.</FONT></P>
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">"I've
      been asked to do this interviewing by the chief executive of
      the organisation.&nbsp; I've agreed to do so only if certain
      conditions apply.&nbsp; One is that I will act for everyone's
      benefit, not just the chief executive.&nbsp; Another is that
      we've set up a working party to guide the research, and on
      which all levels of the organisation are represented.&nbsp;
      Another is that any information which goes to the chief
      executive also goes to everyone who asks for it."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman"><B>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask
   the opening question.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This defines the
   general area without being more specific.&nbsp; Think of it as a
   question which is almost free of content.</FONT></P>
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">"I'm
      interested in learning how this organisation works.&nbsp; I'd
      like to know what's good about it, and what can be
      improved.&nbsp; So, what do you like, and what do you dislike,
      about working for this organisation?"</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Or, more
   simply: "Tell me about this program."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman"><B>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep
   the informant talking.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the key
   part.&nbsp; Your goal is for the informant to talk, without being
   asked specific questions, for about 45 minutes to an
   hour.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Nod, smile,
   say "Mmhmm".&nbsp; Pause and look expectant.&nbsp; Repeat their
   last word or phrase with a questioning intonation: "Trust?".&nbsp;
   Say "Tell me more".&nbsp; "You mentioned..." Use all of the
   techniques that the counselling literature calls "minimal
   encouragers".</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Be curious
   about the informant's experience.&nbsp; Give her <B>100 per
   cent</B> of your attention.&nbsp; This requires effort.&nbsp; But
   if you do this, you probably don't need to use any specific
   rapport-building techniques.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Your task is
   to understand what it is like to be this person in this
   situation.&nbsp; Most informants find this an affirming
   experience.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">(A note for
   more experienced interviewers...&nbsp; You can, with some risk of
   bias, improve the depth of rapport and the quality of information
   by the use of careful self-disclosure.&nbsp; This has the effect
   of making it a little more like a conversation.&nbsp; However, it
   is difficult to do well.&nbsp; It lowers the efficiency of the
   interview if overdone.&nbsp; After all, it is the
   <B>informant's</B> views which are being sought, not yours.&nbsp;
   And, unless you are scrupulously careful, you may shape the
   informant's responses.)</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">When their
   early suspicion and reticence have lowered, many informants talk
   very freely.&nbsp; I have often been given information which would
   have placed the informants at risk if I had reported it in a way
   that allowed them to be identified.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Memorise the
   themes as they arise.&nbsp; Or (after getting permission) take
   "key word" notes.&nbsp; I suggest you learn ways of doing this
   without losing eye contact.&nbsp; Detailed note-taking interferes
   with rapport.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">In case you
   were wondering, I think tape recorders are fine.&nbsp; They
   interfere with rapport initially, but usually not for long.&nbsp;
   But you have to listen to each interview twice, once in reality
   and once on tape.&nbsp; I'd rather use the time to conduct another
   interview.&nbsp; To my mind, that's usually a more efficient use
   of time.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Your views
   may differ.&nbsp; Why not experiment, then make up your own
   mind.&nbsp; If you do use a tape recorder I suggest you place it
   within reach of your informant, and let her know how to turn it
   off any time she wishes to do that.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">"This is the
   pause button. Please use it any time you wish something not to be
   recorded. Please use it any time you want me to erase something
   you've just said."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman"><B>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probe
   questions.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end, ask the
   probe questions developed after earlier interviews.&nbsp; You
   won't have to ask them all, as some will have already been
   answered during the interview.&nbsp; There may not be any probe
   questions in the first pair of interviews.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">If you have
   any probes about the actual <B>conduct</B> of the interview and
   the research, ask them now.&nbsp; It's useful to have such probes
   to refine your process.&nbsp; They may be about such matters as
   the project as a whole, the interview, the sample, and so
   on.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">I often make
   a practice of asking who else I ought to talk to, "...especially
   people whose views are different to yours".&nbsp; This serves to
   check my sampling.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman"><B>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask
   informants for a summary of the key points they have
   mentioned.&nbsp; Compare this to your own mental
   summary.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Thank the
   informant profusely.&nbsp; Very briefly repeat the key points
   about what will happen to the information, and how the person can
   access it.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Write up the
   results of the interview while it is still fresh in your
   mind.&nbsp; Bullet-points are adequate -- this doesn't have to be
   a polished report.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">That's the
   interview.&nbsp; The work done between interviews is also an
   important part of the process.&nbsp;

   interview series</B></FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">For best
   effect, interviewers work in pairs.&nbsp; You interview one
   informant each, and then each prepare a brief summary of the
   interview themes.&nbsp; Immediately after, you meet to compare
   results and develop probe questions.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">After each
   interview you also review your methods.&nbsp; Is the opening
   question working as intended? How appropriate does the overall
   interview format appear to be? Does the sample appear to include
   all of the various points of view?

   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Choosing a
   good sample is important.&nbsp; For reasons I've mentioned
   elsewhere in this program I prefer a maximum diversity
   sample.&nbsp; I like to have all interests, including minority
   interests, represented.&nbsp; I often add to the sample as I
   develop a better understanding of the diversity of people within
   the organisation or community.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">If I can
   arrange it I also like to interview very different people in the
   early stages.&nbsp; This generates more disagreement between the
   interviews.&nbsp; Where agreement arises it usually turns out to
   be widespread.&nbsp; Because it's an early interview, you have
   lots of opportunities to find exceptions.</FONT></P>

      questions</B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">A key element
   in the process is the development of probes.&nbsp; You compare
   your summaries, looking for themes mentioned by both informants
   (or by one informant and an earlier informant).&nbsp; If you are
   doing the interviewing on your own, compare adjacent
   interviews.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Suppose the
   two informants agree.&nbsp; For instance, both may say "We plan
   poorly."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">When this
   happens, devise a probe question or questions to find
   exceptions.&nbsp; "What's <B>good</B> about the planning you do?"
   Or "Who is best at planning?" Or "When do you plan
   well?"</FONT></P>

   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Consider,
   now, some of the features of the method that you've just read
   about.&nbsp; In particular, notice its cyclic nature and its use
   of dialectic.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Each pair of
   interviews, including the review session immediately following
   them, constitutes an action research cycle.&nbsp; The review
   sessions interpret the data emerging from the interviews.&nbsp;
   During the review sessions you also plan the questions which will
   give you a better understanding of the situation.

   the interview series may also form a larger cycle.&nbsp; The

   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">The probe
   questions contribute much to the efficiency of the
   technique.&nbsp; You don't need to carry forward copious amounts
   of data: you record the interpretations.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">You will
   recall that there were two types of overlap in the themes, and two
   corresponding types of probe.</FONT></P>

   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">In other
   words, in later interviews you <B>challenge</B> the
   interpretations arising from early interviews.&nbsp; You also ask
   more specific questions, pursuing deeper understanding as you
   follow up the explanations and disagreements.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">By seeking
   exceptions you allow disconfirmation of your data and
   interpretations.&nbsp; The disagreements, and the explanations you
   seek, are important.&nbsp; They guide you deeper into the pool of
   potentially-available data.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Notice, too,
   how the process is driven by the informants and the data they
   provide.&nbsp; Although the probes become more specific, each
   interview begins with a very open-ended question.&nbsp; Each
   informant is give a chance to contribute data uncontaminated by
   your interpretations so far.&nbsp;

   <P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Avant Garde, Arial, Helvetica"><B>Applications</B></FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">In the early
   stages of contracting for an action research project, a potential
   client will often expect a detailed proposal.&nbsp; My preference
   is to negotiate something much more flexible.&nbsp; I seldom know,
   from initial contact, what process will appropriate.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">In this
   situation, I may offer to do some convergent interviewing (for a
   fixed price, it this is a paid engagement).&nbsp; After the
   interviewing, I can present a report, and a more detailed proposal
   of how the project might proceed.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">I have found
   that relatively small samples, carefully chosen, can allow a good
   diagnosis.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Sometimes,
   low-impact data collection is needed.&nbsp; For example, it may be
   a large community or organisation, and time may be short.&nbsp;
   Some quick data collection may be useful; and convergent
   interviewing is one possible method for collecting the
   data.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Again, for
   large organisations and communities, you may be working more
   directly with a smaller working party.&nbsp; Convergent
   interviewing is easily learned.&nbsp; The working party can use it
   for initial data gathering.&nbsp; (They will also need some
   effective way of reporting back to the other
   stakeholders.)</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">On some
   occasions, you will find that your client group members have
   already done some data collection.&nbsp; If so, it's likely that
   they used some form of written survey.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Palatino,  Garamond, Times New Roman">Unless they
   designed it well, it may not have given them the information they
   wanted.&nbsp; Often the information is hard to interpret.&nbsp; A
   relatively small number of convergent interviews may help you
   clarify and interpret the survey data.&nbsp;

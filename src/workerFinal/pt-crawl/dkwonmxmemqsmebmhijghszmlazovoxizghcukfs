                     </span>
                  </h2>
                  <p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
                  <p>Libraries have been an incredible engine of opportunity this past year, rising above all of the turbulence to deliver information digitally, support online learning, and provide communities with other resources they need. You have played a role that no one else could, by increasing access to technology and being among the first community services to safely reopen.</p>
                  <p>OCLC has been proud to support libraries in all of these efforts. Though how we work and where we work have shifted, our work on behalf of libraries remains at the forefront of everything we do.</p>
                  <p>The environment was very difficult in FY21. With all of the uncertainty in higher education, community budget concerns, and impacts on the economy around the world, we looked hard at every dollar spent. We froze hiring, salary increases, and price increases. We also did not make big cuts, unlike many other organizations, to keep critical services running and continue investing in new services for the future.</p>
                  <p>Yet, looking back over this past year, we have accomplished a great deal. The enormous challenges presented by the pandemic reinforced what we have always known to be true: Libraries can do anything when they work together. Here are a few examples.</p>
                  <div class="pullquote">
                     <p>Never have we done so much for libraries, in the midst of the most challenging of circumstances. And never have we initiated so many projects in research, programs, and services to partner with libraries for the future.</p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>Advancing library values</h3>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Our work with the “Reimagine Descriptive Workflows” project is generating a community agenda to inform steps that libraries, archives, and allied organizations can take to address obsolete, discriminatory, and harmful language in bibliographic records.</li>
                     <li>Our partnership with the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and Battelle in the REALM project helped libraries reopen safely and produced science-based information about how materials in libraries, archives, and museums could be handled and returned into circulation.</li>
                     <li>We provided thousands of hours of professional development for librarians at no charge through our WebJunction<sup>&reg;</sup> platform. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Increasing library impact</h3>
                  <ul>
                     <li>We made strong progress in building the infrastructure that will enable libraries, OCLC, and other stakeholders to jointly curate linked data, which is critical to improving discovery of library materials in the consumer web space.</li>
                     <li>We built smart fulfillment capabilities in our resource sharing services to help libraries streamline processes and deliver materials faster. These include the new Express digital delivery program, in which digital items arrive on average within 10 hours.</li>
                     <li>Our new Capira<sup>&#8480;</sup> software and mobile apps helped libraries provide users with access to collections and schedule curbside pickups, all from the convenience of their mobile phones.</li>
                     <li>We added new features to WorldShare<sup>&reg;</sup> Management Services, our cloud-based library services platform, to better allow library staff to draw on the collaborative data and work of libraries worldwide for more efficiencies.</li>
                     <li>We grew the number of libraries in the US and Benelux using Wise<sup>&reg;</sup>, our community engagement system that’s expanding the impact libraries have on their communities.</li>
                     <li>We developed new APIs, making it easier to share library data and connect library systems with other institutional or community systems.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Overcoming library challenges</h3>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The New Model Library, a research project based on interviews with library leaders, will help equip libraries to excel in a post-pandemic world.</li>
                     <li>Working with several groups, we are establishing the vision for a national discovery system for archives, something needed to help students and researchers uncover valuable historical materials.</li>
                     <li>And in partnership with Washington State University’s Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation, we are creating free online courses for staff at tribal archives, libraries, museums, and small public libraries on digital stewardship and community-centered curation of cultural collections.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Contributions no other organization can do</h3>
                  <p>These are just a few of the many things we accomplished. Others follow, in more detail, in our report. But as you can see, never have we done so much for libraries, in the midst of the most challenging of circumstances. And never have we initiated so many projects in research, programs, and services to partner with libraries for the future.</p>
                  <p>Thank you for continuing to be a part of this community, which brings the voice of libraries into the technology and information landscape. It’s an honor to serve you and share in the success of this essential organization. Our work together has never been more important.</p>

               <p>Dr. K. Wayne Smith died on October 13, 2020, at the age of 82. Wayne was OCLC’s third President and CEO, serving from 1989 to 1998, and led OCLC during a period of enormous growth. He came to OCLC after a distinguished career in government, education, and business.</p>
               <p>He was a teacher in higher education, worked in national security at the highest levels of the US federal government, and was a successful leader in the business world. He served as CEO at World Book Encyclopedia before coming to OCLC.</p>
               <p>Under his leadership, OCLC increased its capacity to deliver innovative information services to libraries and their users. He led the creation of new services in electronic reference, electronic publishing, resource sharing, and training. He oversaw the introduction of FirstSearch as the first online end-user reference service and began making OCLC services available on the internet. He was a fierce advocate in support of research to expand the possibilities for library and information science.</p>
               <p>Wayne graduated summa cum laude with a BA in political science from Wake Forest University, where he was a Hankins Fellow and Phi Beta Kappa. He received MA and PhD degrees in economics and political science from Princeton University, where he was a Danforth Fellow and Woodrow Wilson Fellow. He did post-graduate work in economics at the University of Southern California.</p>
               <p>Wayne led OCLC into the internet age. He deserves a great deal of credit for putting OCLC on firm financial footing at a critical time in the organization’s history. His contributions have had a profound influence on the course of OCLC, and on libraries around the world.</p>
               <div class="pullquote">
                  <p>“We in the OCLC community share in a responsibility not only to our institutions and to our users, but to future generations who will build on the knowledge we made available to them.”</p>
                  <p class="attr">&mdash;Dr. K. Wayne Smith in his last annual report to the OCLC membership, October 6, 1997.</p>

A recorded webinar gives a guided tour of what the tool does and how individual institutions and the library community can benefit.</p>

                        <p>It has been my honor to serve as Board Chair since 2017, and I’ve never been prouder to represent OCLC than I was this past year. The way OCLC adjusted to serve library users on so many challenging fronts was truly impressive. We partnered with funding agencies and the scientific community to provide sound data to make informed decisions about reopening. We worked with libraries to prioritize product investments to respond to shifting needs during the pandemic disruption. And we stepped up with an action plan to face the challenges of advancing racial equity. The staff of OCLC reached more librarians with virtual events than ever before and completed an astounding number of product enhancements and new infrastructure projects. It has been a historic year of growth, learning, and advocacy.</p>

                  <p>We continued our work with libraries to improve our systems and better serve our members. These efforts helped public libraries reinvent how they build relationships with their users and communities. We added hundreds of new features to upgrade products critical to the success of libraries and library groups. We continued to expand our diverse set of APIs, many of which we develop in partnership with libraries, library service providers, and other partners who share our commitment to increasing access to knowledge. We enhanced our authentication software, which allows libraries to deliver e-resources simply and securely. And we made strong progress on the linked data front, building a shared entity management infrastructure that will enable libraries and other stakeholders to jointly curate linked data.</p>

            <p>In addition to continuing to work closely with early adopters for product development, the US Wise team successfully pivoted to all-remote implementations in FY21. This included the in-depth surveys and analysis of operational workflows, policies, practices, and data to configure each initial instance; library testing and reconfigurations with each data migration; and library administrative staff skills training. During this period, four libraries went live: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID90Waub2ik" target="_blank">Anythink</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHG-Cs59gbQ" target="_blank">Greensboro Public Library</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIMKuFefn9o" target="_blank">Kokomo-Howard County Public Library</a> and Fayetteville Public Library.

            <p>COVID-19 dramatically changed learning and research workflows and user expectations for interacting with library resources.

            <h3 class="first">Ensuring the future</h3>
            <p>Despite holding prices flat and the uncertainty of the impact of the pandemic, FY21 revenues from library services grew 1.5% over the previous year. Growth in our services that support digital access and remote learning, such as EZproxy, along with government grants we received to assist libraries in coping with the pandemic, were the primary drivers that helped revenues reach $217.8 million.</p>
            <p>Net contribution for FY21 was $55.5 million. Just as many university endowments and community investments benefited by investment gains, OCLC’s investment portfolio also saw noncash-related gains in our investment portfolio. This was driven by dividends and interest on the portfolio, as US stocks rose to all-time highs, as well as pandemic-related cost control measures that included a salary freeze, a hiring slowdown, and temporary reductions of facility, travel, and meeting expenses.</p>
            <p>Overall, revenue from library services and income from our investment portfolio provided a stable cash flow to fund operations, improve services, and make strategic capital investments during the pandemic and a time of economic challenge.</p>

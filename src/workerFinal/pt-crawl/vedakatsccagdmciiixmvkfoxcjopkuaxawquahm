So if learning how to run Windows 95 on a version of Virtual PC Microsoft no longer distributes is your thing then you've come to the right place. Nothing here is guaranteed to work or be remotely useful.</p>
		
		<p>Some of the things here are now over 20 years old. Like just about everyone I'm not especially proud of my older work. I've learned to be OK with it all still existing though.</p>

	<p class="lead blog-description">Java Artificial Intelligence Library</p>

		<p>It is with some pain that I have to move Jail to the archive section.
        There are a couple of reasons.. I completed my Masters degree in 2004,
        my thesis paper was on neural networks. After
        spending a few years studying artificial intelligence my interest in it
        has waned. I realize it's a trendy skill to have these day but right now it's not something I want to think about. </p>
        <p>So what made it into Jail anyway?</p>
        <p><b>Neural Networks</b>: Implementations for the Back Propagation network
        and Kohonen Self-Organizing Map are included. Features common to all
        included neural networks are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multithreaded design for efficient processing&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Ability to set punish rate, reward rate, and desired output on
            entire layers or individual neurons</li>
          <li>Ability to set weights and error threshold on individual neurons</li>
          <li>Object oriented design allows for simple extension of activation
            functions and training algorithms</li>
          <li>Neurons can easily be dynamically inserted, removed, and edited
            from a layer</li>
          <li>All objects are serializable to allow saving of network state</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Decision Tree</b>: Fast &amp; accurate decision tree learning
        algorithm. Features include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detailed logging capabilities to monitor the state of the decision
            tree while it's being constructed and tested</li>
          <li>Fast gain and entropy calculations</li>
          <li>All objects are serializable to allow saving of decision tree
            state</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now about the user interface.. I really, truly dislike writing user
        interfaces and Jail is a perfect illustration of this. It came a long
        way since the initial release but still isn't great. The goal was to
        integrate many types neural networks and decision trees into one
        interface that can browse and edit them. Only Backpropagation
        neural networks were integrated.

<p class="lead blog-description">Random Code Examples</p>
		<p>
        <s>MidiPlayer.java - A simple class to play a single MIDI file or a list of files. It also supports looping the playlist, which is not as easy as it should be.</s> <a href="https://github.com/huguesjohnson/DubbelLib">Moved here and occasionally updated now.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
        <s>PathResolver.java - This is an abstract class that contains
        two static methods for resolving absolute and relative paths.</s> <a href="https://github.com/huguesjohnson/DubbelLib">Moved here and occasionally updated now.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
        <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/LaunchBrowser.zip">
		LaunchBrowser.java (7.98 kb)</a> This is a class that launches the OS default web
        browser from a Java application. When I was working on <a href="archive.html">Jail</a>
        I wanted to be able to launch the help files from a menu. Since Java is
        platform independent there is no simple way to launch a web browser. My
        first idea was to write a lightweight HTML container to display the help
        files but what I came up with was so monstrous that I'd be embarrassed
        to post it. Although I consulted a number of articles and discussion
        forums on this topic, the resulting code for this class was original
        work.</p>
		<p>
        <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/IniFile.zip">
		IniFile.java (7.53 kb)</a> This is a class to read/write old-school .ini
        files from Java. I first wrote this for <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/hapsby.html">Hapsby</a>
        to store user preferences. It was made obsolete with
        the introduction of the Properties API in JDK 1.4.</p>
		<p>
       <s>
		NumberConverter - There are three classes in here that at
        the end of the day create a JPanel that converts decimal&lt;-&gt;ascii&lt;-&gt;hex&lt;-&gt;octal&lt;-&gt;binary.
        Originally wrote this for <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/hapsby.html">Hapsby</a> even though
        it only needed decimal&lt;-&gt;hex conversions.</s> <a href="https://github.com/huguesjohnson/DubbelLib">Mostly moved here and occasionally updated now.</a></p>
		<p>
        <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/LogFile.zip">
		LogFile.java (6.46 kb)</a> As the name implies this creates a simple log
        file. I mean a very, very simple log file. It really just opens a file
        and appends lines. This was also made obsolete since JDK 1.4+ has a
        Logging API.</p>
		<p>
        <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/SplashScreen.zip">
		SplashScreen.java (6.84 kb)</a>  This is a fairly lightweight splash
        screen. Like <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/LaunchBrowser.zip">LaunchBrowser</a>,
        I looked at articles and discussion forums to figure out how to do this.
        The resulting code was all original work though. I first wrote this for <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/hapsby.html">Hapsby</a>.</p>
		<p>
        <s>ZipCompressor.java/ZipDecompressor.java - Nothing too
        advanced here. These are just two classes to make zipping and unzipping
        files easier. Wrote these for <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/hapsby.html">Hapsby</a> as part
        of the autobackup feature.</s> <a href="https://github.com/huguesjohnson/DubbelLib">More useful versions of these are maintained here now.</a> </p>
		<p>
        <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/FortuneCookie.zip">
		FortuneCookie.java (8.54 kb)</a> I think some versions of Linux have a
        feature like this. All it does is return a random fortune from a list.
        That's all. I never found a nice way to incorporate it into any of my
        projects.</p>
		<p>
        <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/ImageCropDemo.zip">
		ImageCropDemo.java (6.54 kb)</a>  A while ago I was contacted by someone
        who was working on a game in Java. The game map was going to be one
        giant gif and they wanted to be able to crop and scroll it to fit the
        visible field. For some reason they asked if I knew how to crop images
        in Java. I didn't, but figured it out in about an hour and sent this
        class back to them. Don't know what
        ever happened with the game though..</p>

        (13.2 kb)</a> This is a JavaScript to pop-up an image in a dialog and
        size the dialog to fit the image. Click on the image to the left for an
        example. Currently only works correctly with Internet Explorer, the resize
        doesn't work in some versions of Netscape or Mozilla.</p>

		        <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/download/code_library/DirectoryEntryDemo.zip">DirectoryEntryDemo
        (26.7 kb)</a> This program demonstrates how to perform some simple, yet
        common, operations using the System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry
        class. It loads a list of all available domains into a combo box,
        selecting a domain loads a list of all users in that domain, and
        selecting a user displays all their available properties. Note: if you try to use this code in an ASP.NET application it will fail because you can not anonymously query Active Directory for user information. You'll have to use impersonation and run the code under the identity of the user visiting the site. </p>

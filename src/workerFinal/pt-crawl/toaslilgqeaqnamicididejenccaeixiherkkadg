<p>This is the privacy policy (“policy”) for <em>scientificamerican.com</em> and the Scientific American mobile apps (collectively our “web properties”), which are operated and provided by Springer Nature America, Inc.  (<strong>we</strong>, <strong>us </strong>and <strong>our</strong>). Springer Nature America, Inc.  (<em>Scientific American)</em> is located at 1 New York Plaza New York, NY 10004<em>. </em>We can also be contacted at sadigital@sciam.com.</p>

<p>We will only use the personal data gathered over this website as set out in this policy. Below you will find information on how we use your personal data, for which purposes your personal data is used, with whom it is shared and what control and information rights you may have.</p>

<p>I. Summary of our processing activities</p>

<p>We publish magazines, eBooks, news and data. Some of this material is freely available, some of it is only available to subscribers. The following summary offers a quick overview of the data processing activities that are undertaken on our website. You will find more detailed information under the indicated sections below.</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>When you visit our web properties for informational reasons without setting up an account, only limited personal data will be processed in order to service your request (see III).</li>
	<li>If you are identified as belonging to a customer organization then we collect information in order to be able to provide usage reporting to that customer.</li>
	<li>If you register for one of our services or subscribe to our newsletters, further personal data will be processed in the scope of such services (see IV and V).</li>
	<li>Furthermore, your personal data will be used to provide you with relevant advertising for our services and products (see VII) and for statistical analysis that helps us to monitor the performance of our internet properties, improve those properties, and personalize your experience (see VIII). Additionally, we improve your website experience with third party content (see IX).</li>
	<li>Your personal data may be disclosed to third parties (see X) that might be located outside your country of residence; potentially, different data protection standards may apply (see XI).</li>
	<li>We have implemented appropriate safeguards to secure your personal data (see XII) and retain your personal data only as long as necessary (see XIII).</li>
	<li>Under the legislation applicable to you, you may be entitled to exercise certain rights with regard to the processing of your personal data (see XIV).</li>
</ul>

<p>II. Definitions</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><strong>Personal data: </strong>means any information relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, or an online identifier.</li>
	<li><strong>Processing:</strong> means any operation which is performed on personal data, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or any kind of disclosure or other use.</li>
</ul>

<p>III. Informational use of our web properties</p>

<p>When you visit our web properties for informational reasons, i.e. without registering for any of our provided services listed under IV and without providing us with personal data in any other form, we may automatically collect additional information about you which will contain personal data only in limited cases and which is automatically recognized by our server, such as:</p>

<p><em>Examples might include:</em></p>

<p><em>- your IP address;</em></p>

<p><em>- your device type, name and IDs;</em></p>

<p><em>- the date and time of your requests;</em></p>

<p><em>- the content of your requests;</em></p>

<p><em>- information on your browser version;</em></p>

<p><em>- your screen resolution;</em></p>

<p><em>- information on your operating system, including language settings.</em></p>

<p>We use such information only to assist us in providing an effective service (e.g. to adapt our web properties to the needs of your device or to allow you to log in to our web properties), and to collect broad demographic information for anonymized, aggregated use.</p>

<p>If you are identified by IP or equivalent method as belonging to a customer organization such as university or a company then we will also collect the identity of that organization and use it to create usage reports which show the organization how much of the content we publish is being read by their students, members or employees. This information does not contain anything related to a personal login unless (a) you are a nominated administrator for that organization or (b) your organization specifically requires it as a part of a usage-based access contract.</p>

<p>The personal data automatically collected is necessary for us to provide the website, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR, and for our legitimate interest to guarantee the web properties’ stability and security, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

<p>IV. Registration for our services</p>

<p>Access to subscription content is provided via a variety of mechanisms such as IP site licenses, login via third party federated identity providers or by a personal account with us. If your access to our content is provided by an organization or an institution like a university or a company then they choose the access method on your behalf. A personal account is required to purchase content directly from us, or to receive personal services like newsletters and alerts.</p>

<p><em>If you need to create a personal login with us then we will store and process the following:</em></p>

<p><em>- Information (such as your name, user name and email address) that is provided by registration;</em></p>

<p><em>- Information in connection with an account sign-in facility (e.g. log-in and password details);</em></p>

<p><em>- Communications sent by you (e.g. via e-mail or website communication forms).</em></p>

<p>The information that is necessary for the performance of the service is labeled accordingly. All further information is provided voluntarily.</p>

<p><em>We will process the personal data you provide to:</em></p>

<p><em>Examples might include:</em></p>

<p><em>- Identify you at sign-in;</em></p>

<p><em>- Provide you with the services and information offered through the website or which you request; </em></p>

<p><em>- Administer your account;</em></p>

<p><em>- Communicate with you;</em></p>

<p><em>- (behavioral) Advertising and profiling</em></p>

<p><em>- Facilitate attendance of conference</em></p>

<p><em>- Provide access (where appropriate) to other Springer Nature group content if you so request</em></p>

<p>For this, the legal basis is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR. The use of your personal data for behavioral advertising and profiling is done with consent, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p>

<p>We use the personal data and contact data you provide by registration to inform you directly about our additional products and services and to improve your experience on our web properties. The use of your personal data for directly advertising related products and services is with consent, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p>

<p>You can object to the use of your personal data for direct marketing at any time. We will then refrain from any processing to the extent it is related to such purposes. You may opt-out of direct marketing via opt-out links in any marketing communication or via user profile pages on the website (where available). You can also inform us about your objection by contacting our Data Protection Office at dataprotection@springernature.com.</p>

<p>We offer notification services such as table-of-contents or new book alerts. This service is provided by means of a double-opt-in. Thus, you will receive an email containing a link by which you can confirm that you are the owner of the email address and wish to be notified via our email service. You can end this service by opting out via the link provided in each notification email. This notification service is based on your consent, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p>

<p>Registration data is kept until such time as an account deletion request is made. If such a request is received we will erase your data within 30 days. Statutory storage obligations or the need for legal actions that may arise from misconduct within the services or payment problems can lead to a longer retention of your personal data. In this case, we will inform you accordingly.</p>

<p>V. Information about the specific uses that require registration</p>

<p>1. Subscription store</p>

<p>For the use of our store you have to set up an account as described under IV.  Your customer account retains your personal data for future purchases. You can change your personal data in your account’s settings. To delete your account, please contact customer service at help@sciam.com.  If you have made a purchase with your account, your account cannot be deleted.  However, we can render your account inoperable by removing your personal information, including your email address.  We will not perform any action to your account without your expressed permission. This processing is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b.</p>

<p>When purchasing a product that requires shipping we may share the delivery data with a Contractor to provide shipment tracking to you. Such a transfer will be based on data processing agreements in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR. Therefore, our Contractors will only use your personal data to the extent necessary to perform their functions and will be contractually bound to process your personal data only on our behalf and in compliance with our requests.</p>

<p>By statutory law we are required to retain the provided financial data in relation to transactions (including address, payment and order information) for ten years. However, after 2 years we will restrict the processing of your personal data to comply with the statutory requirements and will not process the personal data any further.  Regarding this, the retention of your personal data is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. c GDPR.</p>

<p>2. Article alerts and Newsletters</p>

<p>With your email address you can subscribe to our newsletters that provide you with the latest news about our products and services if you consent to receiving such newsletters. </p>

<p>You can further sign up for our newsletter via Facebook. For this purpose, we are using Facebook Lead Ads, a service by Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304 U.S. ("Facebook"). Lead Ads makes it even easier for you to sign up for our newsletter as the form will already be pre-populated via Facebook with your data and you only need to submit the form. Of course, you have the opportunity to amend and review the data before submission. For more information on how lead ads works see here - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads">https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads</a>.</p>

<p>If you sign up for editorial newsletters on Facebook and consent to receiving marketing emails or Facebook advertisements, you may or may not receive Facebook advertisements about products or services from Scientific American.</p>

<p>On our web properties, we use the remarketing or “Similar audiences” feature of AdWords offered by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as “Google”</p>

<p>Google uses cookies/tracking technologies, i.e., text files that are stored on your computer and that allow us to analyze your use of our web properties. Information generated by Cookies/tracking technology on your use of our web properties (including your IP address) will be transferred to a Google server in the U.S. and stored on that server. After that, the last three digits of the IP address will be deleted by Google so that it is no longer possible to clearly match this IP address with personal data. Google will use this information to analyze your use of the our web properties, to create activity reports for us and to provide additional services in connection with the use of the website and the internet. Furthermore, Google may transfer this information to third parties, if it is required to do so in accordance with statutory provisions or if third parties process data on behalf of Google.</p>

<p>Third party providers, including Google, place advertisements on websites on the internet. Third party providers, including Google, use stored cookies/tracking information to place advertisements based on previous visits of a user on this website.</p>

<p>For additional information on the anonymous analysis of your search behavior please refer to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</li>
	<li>http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</li>
</ul>

<p>You may object to data collection and storage for the purpose of remarketing at any time - this objection will be effective for the future, but not retroactively - by deactivating interest-based advertising in Google or by deactivating the services on the website of the Network Advertising Initiative. Note: in that case, you may not be able to use all features of our web properties anymore. By using this website, you grant your consent to the processing of data collected about you by Google in the manner and for the purpose described above.</p>

<p>Facebook Custom Audience</p>

<p>This Website uses retargeting tags and Custom Audience of Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304 U.S., hereinafter referred to as “Facebook”.</p>

<p>When you visit our web properties, remarketing tags will build a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. This way, Facebook learns that you have visited our web properties with your IP address. This will enable Facebook to match your visit of our pages with your user account. The information obtained this way can be used to display Facebook ads. Please note that we do not receive any information on the contents of data transferred and their use by Facebook.</p>

<p>With regard to the use of Custom Audience we would like to point out that Facebook and third parties use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect or gather information on this website. Based on the data gained we can make our Facebook activities more efficient and, e.g., arrange for contents or ads to be shown only to visitors of our web properties. The data collected this way will be encrypted and transferred to Facebook and is anonymous for us, e.g., we cannot see personal data of individual users.</p>

<p>We may also utilize other tools, such as Permutive, to build anonymous behavioral segments, and pass the status of membership of these segment(s) into the Facebook cookie. This will enable membership of these segments to be used when building Custom Audiences within Facebook.</p>

<p>For further information on the privacy policy of Facebook and Custom Audience please refer to https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ or https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/custom-audiences-website.</p>

<p><strong>IX. Third party content, social media plugins</strong></p>

<p>The web properties may contain links to third parties. We are not responsible for the content and the data collection on respective third party properties; please check the privacy policy of respective websites for information of respective websites’ data processing activities.</p>

<p>1. Social Media plug-ins</p>

<p>We use the following social media plug-ins: Facebook, Twitter. This allows you to communicate with such services and like or comment from our web properties. Social media plug-ins enable a direct communication between your device and the servers of the social media provider, allowing the social media provider to communicate with you and collect information about you using our web properties. This processing is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR and represents our legitimate interest to improve your experience and to optimize our services.</p>

<p>Transfer of personal data takes place whether you have an account with the provider or not. </p>

<p>Please note that we neither have the control of the extent of personal data that is collected by the respective plug-in provider nor do we know the processing’s purpose or the period your personal data will be retained. </p>

<p>Further information about the processing of your personal data in the provider’s course of operation is provided via their respective privacy policy. Moreover, you will be provided with further information with regard to your rights and setting concerning privacy. </p>

<p>a. Facebook Social plugins</p>

<p>We use so-called social plugins („plugins“) of the social networking site facebook.com provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (white “f” on blue tile or a “thumps-up”-sign) or by the additional text “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via: http://developers.facebook.com/plugins. </p>

<p>If a user visits using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly connects to Facebook’s servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebook’s servers.</p>

<p>Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding property. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the property, Facebook may be able to connect the session to the user’s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something – the user’s browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user’s IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany. </p>

<p>The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user’s rights in this respect and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php. </p>

<p>If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via this homepage and to link this with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off from Facebook before going to this homepage. <br/>
	The user may also block Facebook’s plugins using add-ons for the user’s browser, for example the “Facebook Blocker“. </p>

<p>b. Twitter</p>

<p>We use the twitter-button. The button is provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. (“Twitter”) The buttons are marked using the text “Twitter” or “Follow” and a stylized blue bird. The button enables the user to share on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter. </p>

<p>If a user visits one of the properties using such a button, the user’s browser directly connects to Twitter’s servers. The Twitter-button and its content are loaded directly from Twitter’s servers. According to the provider’s knowledge, Twitter collects the user IP-address and the URL when the button is loaded from Twitter’s servers. However, this data is only be used for loading and displaying the Twitter-button. </p>

<p>Further information can be found in Twitter’s privacy statement under: <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>. </p>

<p>Should you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us via the email address <a href="mailto:dataprotection@springernature.com">dataprotection@springernature.com</a>. </p>

<p>2. Do Not Track</p>

<p>There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts web properties you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that currently our website does not respond to these DNT signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected.</p>

Based on this evaluation, the Licensee will be able to determine e.g. the necessity to obtain more licenses or reduce the number of licenses or to allocate costs internally. Further, the usage data may allow the Licensee to request contributions or funding. The Licensee is contractually limited to use the usage data for no other purposes than these economic efficiency assessment purposes.</p>

<p>In addition, we ourselves have a legitimate interest in enabling the Licensee to use the usage data to conduct respective evaluation and assessments is also in our interest as it makes our service more attractive for the Licensees.</p>

<p>If the Licensee resides outside the EEA, the transfer is safeguarded by a Commission’s adequacy decision such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. You can find further information about the aforementioned safeguards by contacting onlineservice@springernature.com.</p>

<p>You may object to the transfer of the usage data to the Licensee at any time without reason by sending an email to onlineservice@springernature.com. </p>

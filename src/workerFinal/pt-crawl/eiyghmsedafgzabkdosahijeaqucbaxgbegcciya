Jenkins’ moving vision of queer sexuality is compounded by extraordinary performances from the three actors portraying Chiron.” <strong>Whitney Monaghan</strong></p>

<p>“A work of such rare empathy and vision. A transformative experience.” <strong>Anna Möttölä</strong></p>

<p>“Beautiful, romantic, lush and soul-opening.” <strong>Bilal Qureshi</strong></p>

<p>“It’s both an ode to the filmmakers that Jenkins loves, like Wong Kar Wai and Claire Denis, and an ushering in of a new kind of cinema. Film history in the future will be hugely indebted to Moonlight.” <strong>Grace Barber-Plentie</strong></p>

<p>“Longing, heartbreak and beauty in every frame.” <strong>Christopher Neilan</strong></p>

Though it has always been global and inclusive in scope, the poll has expanded significantly each decade. In 1992, 101 directors voted; fast-forward to 2012, when 358 filmmakers took part. This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors. This electorate spans experimental, arthouse, mainstream and genre filmmakers from around the world.

This trend stopped from the 80s on, when Western cinema as a whole underwent a radical corporatisation and shifted inexorably towards blockbusterism and the pre-sold franchise film, and a concurrent shift in critical acclaim occurred, deifying antiquity and undervaluing, I argue, contemporary mastery.

1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />Meeting of 4 April 1864:</p></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 14]]</font> The President exhibited several new Australian Longicornia, presented to him by
Mr. F. G. Waterhouse, of Adelaide, some of which were taken by that gentleman during the
recent exploring expedition under Stuart; among the more interesting was a new genus, in some
respects connecting those remarkable and isolated forms Bimia and Hesthesis. Also a
considerable number of new species from Gawler, near Adelaide, part of a large collection for
which he was indebted to Mrs. Kruesler and Mr. Odewahn; one of these had the appearance of a
Malacoderm, for which, at the first glance, it might very readily be taken. It might, in fact, be
regarded as another case of &quot;mimetic resemblance&quot;; but if so, there was this peculiarity about it,
that the stronger insect was here imitating the weaker, which seemed not quite consistent with the
theory that the imitated form was copied with a view to the protection of the imitating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. A. R. Wallace said that the case was quite consistent with the theory of mimetic
resemblances, and that that theory did not depend upon the relative strength or weakness of the
imitated or imitating forms; an insect might be very weak in structure, and yet be a proper subject
for mimicry; many insects of weak structure were extremely abundant, were, in fact, dominant
species; such species no doubt possessed some protection against their enemies with which we
were unacquainted, <font color="990000">[[p. 15]]</font> and of which other species of stronger structure were deprived; and
having that protection, whatever it might be, they were on that account fit and likely subjects for
imitation. So far from conflicting with the theory, he felt no surprise whatever at finding a
structurally-stronger insect mimicking a Malacoderm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President also exhibited diagrams of the under surface of the abdomen of the females of
Obrium cantharinum and other Longicornia, showing the presence of large lumps or tufts of hair
on particular segments; he was anxious to ascertain whether such a structure was invariably
present in the female; he had reason to believe that in some Australian genera (Penthea and
Symphyletes) it was not invariably present, but further observation was required. If it should
prove that it was not invariably present in the female, this would furnish another instance of
&quot;dimorphism,&quot; by which he (Mr. Pascoe) meant a case where there was an addition to or
alteration of a part or organ; the term, in his opinion, ought to be confined to such a phenomenon,
and was not applicable to simple variation, such, <em>e.g.</em>, as variation in colour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. A. R. Wallace exhibited specimens of Papilio Memnon, P. Pammon, P. Theseus, P.
Ormenus, P. Erectheus and P. Tydeus, for the purpose of illustrating his views on
&quot;polymorphism.&quot; Mr. Wallace remarked that <em>he</em> did not apply the term &quot;dimorphism&quot; to simple
variation; on the contrary, he regarded &quot;polymorphism,&quot; of which &quot;dimorphism&quot; was but the first
and least complicated stage, as a totally different phenomenon from &quot;variation,&quot; and one which
required a separate name. Under the common term &quot;variety&quot; many distinct phenomena were
confounded; he proposed to confine that term to those cases in which there was indefiniteness
and irregularity in the variation. &quot;Variation,&quot; then, was an indefinite and inconstant phenomenon,
the instances of which passed from one to the other by irregular, often by insensible, gradations;
&quot;polymorphism,&quot; on the other hand, consisted in the existence of several distinct forms of the
same insect which do not graduate into each other. Thus, in Papilio Memnon, the male was in
each locality constant; it had rounded hind wings, and was always nearly black, with a few ashy
rays; the female, however, existed under two distinct forms; the first had the wings shaped like
those of the male, but had a very different colouration, being more or less olive-coloured, and
often banded on the hind wings with whitish yellow, and with marginal black spots; the second
form of female differed remarkably from the first, the hind wings being produced into a large
spatulate tail, and marked with white patches radiating from the base. Both these forms exhibited
varieties in the same locality, but there were no connecting links between them. The males paired
with both forms of female, and in each case the resulting brood assumed the distinct forms above
described. This was a case of dimorphism. Papilio Pammon was a parallel case; there was a form
of female resembling the male, and there was as a second aberrant form of female, <em>viz.</em> the form
which had been called P. Polytes: he believed that P. Romulus would prove to be a third form of
the female of P. Pammon, though of this he had not evidence at present; but the male of P.
Romulus had never been found, whilst the females occurred along with P. Pammon in every
collection from India: if that were so, then P. Pammon would exhibit an instance of trimorphism.
P. Ormenus was certainly trimorphic, for three distinct forms of female were found, all differing
greatly from the male; and Mr. Wallace had reason to believe that to some males of Papilio as
many as four distinct wives must be assigned. These forms had hitherto been classed as varieties,
but the physiological differences presented by them were striking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wallace further distinguished between a &quot;variety&quot; and a &quot;local form&quot; or <font color="990000">[[p. 16]]</font> &quot;race,&quot;
denoting by the latter term a form which kept distinct from the parent stock and propagated itself
independently: such a form was not a &quot;variety&quot; by reason of its constancy and the absence of
intermediate links, and could not be considered a &quot;species&quot; by reason of the comparative
unimportance of the characters in which it differed by the type-form. The subject of Mr.
Wallace's remarks had been treated by him at length in a paper recently read before the Linnean
Society: he further illustrated the phenomenon of polymorphism by the following hypothetical
case:--Imagine the discovery of an island inhabited by white men, and black (negro), red
(Indian), and yellow (Chinese) women, and in which the union of these variously-coloured
parents produces children which always resemble one or other of the four above-mentioned
forms, no intermediate forms ever occurring; the boys are always white, whilst the girls are
black, red or yellow, but without any necessary connexion with the colour of the mother, so that
a black girl may be the offspring of a white father and of either a black, red or yellow mother.
Such a phenomenon would certainly be an extraordinary one, but it was exactly parallel to what
took place with the exhibited species of Papilio.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gen. Sir John Hearsey remarked that so long ago as 1831 he had captured Papilio Pammon
and P. Polytes <em>in copul&acirc;</em>, had killed the pair <em>in situ</em>, and so sent them to Prof. Westwood; in
which position they were to be seen at Oxford to this day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Waterhouse enquired whether there was any evidence of the fertility of the abnormal
females, since on theoretical grounds it might almost be expected that they would be
unproductive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wallace replied that he believed one of the abnormal females then exhibited could be
seen to be full of eggs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Westwood exhibited a butterfly recently received at the Oxford Museum from M.
Snellen van Vollenhoven; the specimen was from Ceram, and it appeared to him to differ from
Papilio Peranthus only in its large size and to some extent in its colouring; he found no structural
difference whatever, and he begged to exhibit it as P. Peranthus, <em>var.</em>; it seemed to him to be
precisely one of Mr. Wallace's &quot;local forms,&quot; but Mr. Wallace informed him that <em>he</em> should
describe it as a new species.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. A. R. Wallace said that if structural difference was necessary to constitute a species,
two-thirds, or probably nine-tenths, of the existing species must be abolished; the difference
between a local form and a species was one of degree only, and in his opinion the butterfly
exhibited possessed characters sufficient to entitle it to species rank.</p>

<p><center>Meeting of 2 May 1864:</center>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 21]]</font> Mr. A. R. Wallace exhibited various species of Papilio, Eronia and Pieris, with the
intention of showing the effect of locality in producing change of form in insects. Numerous
species inhabiting the island of Celebes were produced, and in each case in juxta-position
therewith was its nearest ally from the adjoining islands. The Celebes insects, in every instance
exhibited, had the costa of the anterior wings much more strongly arched than was the case with
their congeners with which they were compared. Mr. Wallace remarked that changes in colour
which were due to locality had been frequently noticed, but of instances of a change of form only
few had been recorded; Mr. Bates, however, had mentioned some as having come under his
observation in South America. In the Eastern Archipelago, he (Mr. W.) had found that the
butterflies inhabiting the islands which formed the eastern half were generally larger than those
in the western half; and, especially in the Papilionid&aelig;, that Celebes and Amboyna produced the
largest specimens. Some species which in India were found with a large tail appended to their
hind wings, possessed only a small tail in the Indian Islands, which ceased altogether or was
reduced to a mere tooth in the islands of the Pacific; of this Papilio Agamemnon was an example.
The island of Celebes was as nearly as might be the centre of the Eastern Archipelago, and the
butterflies of that island, especially the Papiliones, possessed the peculiarity in the form of their
wings to which he had invited attention; sixteen or seventeen species of Papilio were found in
Celebes, and, with a single exception to be afterwards noticed, all were distinguished from their
allies in the other islands by having the upper wings strongly arched, in lieu of a gentle and
gradual curve, or, if he might so term it, a flat bend. The same distinction existed also in many
Pierid&aelig; and in a few Nymphalid&aelig;, but he had not observed it in other groups of butterflies. Mr.
Wallace had a theoretical explanation to offer of this phenomenon; he conceived that the insects
had become modified in form by the eternal circumstances to which they had been subjected, and
that this modification was to be accounted for by some physical or organic change which had
occurred in Celebes, but not in the now adjacent isles. Rapidity of flight was generally supposed
to be the consequence or a property of the falcate form of wing; he (Mr. W.) was inclined to
think that the falcate form gave greater facility in twisting or turning about; if that were so, the
Celebes form of butterfly-wing would give the insect this additional facility, and thus enable it
more easily to escape from its enemies. If, then, the Celebes insects were supposed to have been
formerly subject to great persecution, those with the arched form of wing would have the best
chance of escaping, the less favoured forms would be gradually killed off, those that survived
would owe their existence to the form of their wings, their offspring would resemble and some
few would exceed them in the possession of the advantageous shape, and the specimens with the
best developed wings being naturally selected in each succeeding generation would lead to the
gradual and regular increase of the peculiarity. But then it might be asked, How is it that only a
few of the butterflies have the peculiarity in question? <font color="990000">[[p. 22]]</font> The answer was, that different
insects preserve their existence by different means; one may escape by means of its power of
flight, the habits of a second may enable it to avoid its foe, a third may owe safety to its colour,
whilst a fourth may be positively distasteful to animals which prey upon insects. Thus the
Danaid&aelig;, though slow of flight, were very abundant and were the subjects of mimicry or
imitation by other species; in all probability they owed their immunity from destruction to the
strong and unpleasant odour which they indubitably possessed. It was manifest that where
another means of escape already existed, the principle of selection would not be brought into
play; the peculiar form of wing would not be wanted, and therefore would not be acquired. The
obscure Satyrid&aelig; were doubtless protected by their colour; the majority of the Nymphalid&aelig; had
already sufficient power of flight, and those of that group which had acquired the arched form of
wing were precisely the species which possessed only about the same power of flight as a
Papilio. The single Celebesean Papilio which had not assumed the arcuate form of wing was one
belonging to the Polydorus group, a group which was itself imitated by other Papiliones, and
which therefore was doubtless provided with some special defence, though the nature of it was
unknown to us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Westwood, after remarking upon the pleasure he always derived from Mr. Wallace's
speculations, whether he agreed with them or not, said that he was unable to follow Mr. Wallace
in tracing the phenomenon to the causes assigned by him; arched wings were not necessarily, or
even generally, accompanied by the greatest rapidity of flight; and if the original form of the
butterfly must be varied, if one species must imitate another, he (Prof. Westwood) thought it far
more probable that the variation would consist in getting stronger muscles to their bodies, as in
the species of Charaxes he had that evening exhibited, rather than in a minute change in the curve
of the wing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Cox thought that the swiftest fliers had the straightest wings, as, <em>e.g.</em>, the Sphinges,
where the costa was scarcely arched at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Newman also was unable to connect an arcuate wing with rapidity of flight, and
instanced the straight cost&aelig; of the swiftly-flying Diptera.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. F. Smith referred to some of the swiftest Hymenoptera, which had pointed wings, but
with perfectly straight cost&aelig;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baly said that the arched form of wing might be advantageous in giving a greater power
of twisting and turning about, rather than in giving greater rapidity of flight; and this, he thought,
was what Mr. Wallace suggested.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President observed that the theory seemed to be based upon the supposition of a gigantic
persecution to which the butterflies had been subject; but was there any evidence of the existence
of such persecution? had Mr. Wallace ever seen the insects actually pursued by birds or other
enemies? It seemed to him that persecution, to the extent to which it now occurred, was
altogether inadequate to account for the magnitude of the result attributed to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bates said that he had frequently observed in South America that the paths were strewn
with the wings of butterflies; and in this country it was not an uncommon sight to see the Ponti&aelig;
pursued by birds, and sometimes escaping by means of their tortuous or &quot;dodging&quot; flight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Cox had recently seen forty or fifty specimens of Brephos notha destroyed by tom-tits in a single morning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. F. Smith remarked that, on the persecution principle, great change must be impending in
the shape of wing of the butterflies of the London district.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 23]]</font> Prof. Westwood asked whether Mr. Wallace had observed the twisting or &quot;dodging&quot;
flight to be conspicuous in the butterflies which have largely-developed wing-tails? or whether
the tails contributed to or affected the flight in any, and, if any, in what manner?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wallace replied that he had not observed that the wing-tails had any influence upon the
flight of the insect; he did not think they affected the rapidity, or that they acted as a rudder, and
he was at a loss to assign any use to those appendages. With respect to the other points which
had been touched upon, there was in some cases an increase of muscular power as well as an
increase of curvature of the wings, but the wing of a butterfly was far more liable to variation
than the body of the insect; that organ was therefore more accessible to the operation of the
principle of selection, and a modification of its form was consequently more readily produced.
Most of the instances of swift-fliers with straight wings which had been adduced (as <em>e.g</em>. the
Sphinges) were insects with the strongest bodies and the greatest muscular power; moreover, he
did not maintain that any insect with arched wings would have a more rapid flight than any other
with straight wings; all that he had argued was, that, as between two closely allied species, the
one which had the wings most arched would have the flight most rapid; for instance, he should
expect a Sphinx with arched wings to fly more rapidly than a Sphinx with straight wings. But in
truth, though he had referred to the supposed concomitancy of falcate wings and a rapid flight,
his own notion was (as had been correctly stated by Mr. Baly) that the arched form was chiefly
useful in giving greater power of turning or twisting. As to the enquiry whether he had seen the
butterflies actually pursued, he admitted that he had not to any great extent; he offered his
explanation as a theoretical one; but he thought it could scarcely be doubted that butterflies were
subject to the attacks of numerous depredators.</p>

          <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Script">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where
          the women live: look at this village, spread out at the foot of this
          sculpted mountain.&nbsp; As the smoke rises slowly to the rooftops as night falls,
          so is the presence of women.&nbsp; A
          stranger is easily deceived because all he sees is the men.&nbsp; They
          are everywhere; they direct the business of the state, they lead the
          mosques and the churches, they are the teachers and the nurses.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But listen carefully and you will hear the
          rhythmic stirring of a woman sweeping the courtyard as the dawn
          approaches.&nbsp; The morning passes to the sounds of greetings
          addressed to neighbours who pass in the streets.&nbsp; A little later,
          we find her in the village market where the women are selling
          vegetables and buying what is needed for the daily meal.&nbsp; The
          afternoons resound with persistent loud thumps as she grinds the grain or the
          sudden burst of laughter as she sits to chat with friends while shelling
          peanuts.&nbsp; With perfect balance, she climbs and descends roads and
          pathways, with a heavy load on her head or a yoke across her
          shoulders.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman is the one who nourishes in this
          hard land.&nbsp; In the rainy season she works in the fields and grows
          peanuts, sesame seeds and millet from this hard Sahelian soil.&nbsp;
          Every day she finds, buys, prepares and serves the food which supports
          her family.&nbsp; She sits next to the fire and stirs the boule, cooks
          the sauce, prepares the porridge</font><font face="Script">...<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time, the Chadian woman is
          carrying a child,<img border="0" src="../images/Aidjo.jpg" alt="Most of the time, the Chadian woman is carrying a child..." width="224" height="288" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"> 
          either in her womb, or on her breast, or on her back.&nbsp; She takes
          care of her child and knows how fragile he or she is. Unless she is
          extraordinarily lucky, she will know what it is to have one of her
          children die.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man is always the &quot;head&quot; of the
          family.&nbsp; He often goes into town to work, or to look for
          work.&nbsp; Or else he leaves to fight in a war.&nbsp; Or he is
          dead.&nbsp; There are many widows in this place where war&nbsp; and
          rebellion have been a normal part of life for generations.&nbsp; In
          this way also, a woman bears a heavy load.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it must be remembered that she can
          sometimes be lazy and irresponsible.&nbsp; There is no such thing as a
          stereotype of the &quot;Third World Woman.&quot;&nbsp; In reality, she
          is a survivor.&nbsp; And here, the difficult struggle for survival
          takes place daily.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knows her place, but all life here involves the women.&nbsp; When there is a celebration, she is
          there to laugh and sing.&nbsp; When a baby is born, when someone is
          sick, when death comes suddenly or slowly, the women are there to
          prepare food, to help in any way they can, to sit and spend long hours.&nbsp; Her place
          is lived out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          </font><font face="Script">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look again under the
          evening smoke,

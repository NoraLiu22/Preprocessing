<blockquote>
I finished your book yesterday. . . Since I read Von Baer's Essays nine years
ago no work on Natural History Science I have met with has made so great an
impression on me & I do most heartily thank you for the great store of new
views you have given me. . .<br>
As for your doctrines I am prepared to go to the Stake if requisite. . .<br>I
trust you will not allow yourself to be in any way disgusted or annoyed by the
considerable abuse & misrepresentation which unless I greatly mistake is in
store for you. . . And as to the curs which will bark and yelp -- you must
recollect that some of your friends at any rate are endowed with an amount of
combativeness which (though you have often & justly rebuked it) may stand you
in good stead -- <br>I am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness

Letter of T. H. Huxley to Charles Darwin, November 23, 1859, regarding the
<i>Origin of Species</i>
<P>
</center>
<font size="+1">
Thomas Henry Huxley was one of the first adherents to Darwin's theory of
evolution by natural selection, and did more than anyone else to advance its
acceptance among scientists and the public alike. As is evident from the letter
quoted above, Huxley was a passionate defender of Darwin's theory -- so
passionate that he has been called "Darwin's Bulldog". But
Huxley was not only the bulldog for Darwin's theory, but was a great
biologist in his own right, who did original research in zoology and 
paleontology. Nor did he slavishly and uncritically swallow Darwin's theory;
he criticized several aspects of it, pointing out a number of problems.
<P><b>Biography of Huxley</b><P>
He was born on May 4, 1825, in Ealing, near London, the seventh of eight
children in a family that was none too affluent. Huxley's only childhood
education was two years at Ealing school, where his father taught mathematics;
this ended in 1835 when the family moved to Coventry. Despite his lack of
formal education, young Huxley read voraciously in science, history, and
philosophy, and taught himself German. At the age of 15, Huxley began a medical
apprenticeship; soon he won a scholarship to study at Charing Cross Hospital.
At 21, Huxley signed on as assistant surgeon on the
H.M.S. <i>Rattlesnake</i>, a Royal Navy frigate assigned to chart the seas 
around Australia and New Guinea. Huxley vividly described conditions on the 
ship in his diary:

<blockquote>
I wonder if it is possible for the mind of man to conceive anything more
degradingly offensive than the condition of us 150 men, shut up in this
wooden box, being watered with hot water, as we are now. . . It's too hot
to sleep, and my sole amusement consists in watching the cockroaches, which
are in a state of intense excitement and happiness.
</blockquote>

Despite the excited cockroaches and the poor science facilities on board,
Huxley collected and studied marine invertebrates, in particular
<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/cnidaria/cnidaria.html>cnidarians</a>,
<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/chordata/urochordata.html>tunicates</a>,
and cephalopod
molluscs. (He also collected a fianc&eacute;e, Henrietta Heathorn, whom he
met and immediately fell in love with while in port in Sydney, Australia.)
When he returned to England in October
1850, he found that his research results, which he had mailed back to England
from each port of call, had won him acceptance into the ranks of the English
scientific establishment. Huxley soon became acquainted with scientists like the
geologist Charles Lyell, the botanist Joseph Hooker, the philosopher
Herbert Spencer, and the naturalist
Charles Darwin. Professional positions in science were rare at the
time -- most naturalists were affluent amateurs -- but Huxley managed to
support himself on a stipend from the Navy and by writing popular science
articles. After leaving the Navy in 1854,
Huxley managed to secure a lectureship at the School of Mines in London, and
sent for his fianc&eacute;e. They were married in 1855.

<b>Huxley's Scientific Thought</b>

<P>

As the nickname "Darwin's bulldog" would suggest, Huxley was an outspoken
defender and advocate for Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.
Perhaps surprisingly, he was at first an opponent of any evolutionary change
at all, believing that the living world had stayed much the same for as
far back as its history could be traced, and that modern taxa would
eventually be found in the oldest rocks. But he came to accept evolutionary
views: his reaction to reading the <i>Origin of Species</i> was "How
stupid of me not to have thought of that."
<P>
He is best known for his famous debate in June 1860, at the British Association
meeting at Oxford. His opponent, Archbishop Samuel Wilberforce, was
not-so-affectionately known as "Soapy Sam" for his renowned slipperiness in
debate. Wilberforce was coached against Huxley
by <a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/owen.html>Richard Owen</a>. 
During the debate, 
Archbishop Wilberforce ridiculed evolution and asked Huxley whether he was
descended from an ape on his grandmother's side or his grandfather's.
Accounts vary as to exactly what happened next, but according to one
telling of the story, Huxley muttered "The Lord hath delivered him into my
hands," and then rose to give a brilliant defense of Darwin's theory,
concluding with the rejoinder, "I would rather
be the offspring of two apes than be a man and afraid to face the truth."
Huxley's own retelling of the tale was a little different, and quite a
bit less dramatic:
<blockquote>
If then, said I, the question is put to me would I rather have a miserable
ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of
great means of influence & yet who employs these faculties & that influence
for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific
discussion, I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape.
</blockquote>
All accounts agree that Huxley trounced Wilberforce in the debate, defending
evolution as the best explanation yet advanced for species diversity.

<P>

However, Huxley did not blindly follow Darwin's theory, and critiqued it
even as he was defending it. In particular, where Darwin had seen 
evolution and a slow, gradual, continuous process, Huxley thought that
an evolving lineage might make rapid jumps, or saltations. As he wrote to
Darwin just before publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, "You have
loaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in adopting <i>Natura non
facit saltum</i> [Nature does not make leaps] so unreservedly."

<P>

Huxley's support for natural selection is perhaps surprising when contrasted
with his earlier attacks on the evolutionary theories put forth by 
<a href="lamarck.html">Lamarck</a> and Robert Chambers. Both of these
theories advocated some kind of progression -- some kind of general tendency
present in all organisms to evolve "upward" into more and more complex 
forms. Huxley would have nothing to do with such progressionist ideas,
which he regarded as being more metaphysical than scientific; this mistrust 
of progression lay behind his initial skepticism of all evolutionary
ideas. Similarly,
Huxley rejected the then-popular theory of recapitulation, following Karl
von Baer (whose writings Huxley had translated from the German). Huxley 
wrote, "the progress of a higher animal in development is not through the
forms of the lower, but through forms which are common to both lower and 
higher. . . " 

<P>

Huxley's most famous writing, published in 1863, is <i>Evidence on Man's
Place in Nature.</i> This book, published only five years after Darwin's
<i>Origin of Species</i>, was a comprehensive review of what was known at
the time about primate and human paleontology and ethology. More than that,
it was the first attempt to apply evolution explicitly to the human race.
Darwin had avoided direct mention of human evolution, stating only that
"light will be thrown on the origin of Man;" Huxley explicitly presented
evidence for human evolution. In this, once again, he locked horns with
<a href="owen.html">Richard Owen</a>, who had claimed that the human brain
contained parts that were not found in apes, and that therefore humans 
could not be classified with the apes nor descended from them. Huxley
and his colleagues showed that the brains of apes and humans were
fundamentally similar in
every anatomical detail.

<P>

Huxley founded a remarkable dynasty of English scientists and thinkers. His
son Leonard was a noted biographer and "man of letters." Leonard's
oldest son Julian was one of the authors of the evolutionary
synthesis of the early 20th century; Julian's son Francis became a noted
anthropologist. Another of Leonard's sons, Andrew (later Sir Andrew Huxley)
was also an eminent scientist, sharing the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine for his work on nerve impulses and muscle contraction. Julian's
brother Aldous Huxley was a novelist, screenwriter and essayist;
his best-known book is the anti-utopia <i>Brave New World</i>. A more distant
relative, Leonard George Golden Huxley, became a prominent physicist.

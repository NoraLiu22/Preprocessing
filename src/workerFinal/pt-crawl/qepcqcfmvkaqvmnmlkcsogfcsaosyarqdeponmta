1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 665]]</font> Few Englishmen have any adequate idea of the present condition of the study of
prehistoric arch&aelig;ology in America, or are at all aware of the vast extent and interesting character
of the collections which illustrate the early history of that continent. The recognition of the
antiquity of man in Europe, and the establishment of the successive periods characterised by the
pal&aelig;olithic and neolithic implements, are events within the memory of many of us; while even at
the present day the existence of man before the glacial period is vehemently denied by some
geologists, and all the evidence brought forward to establish the fact is sought to be explained
away with as much misspent ingenuity as was exerted in the case of the early finds of McEnery
and Boucher de Perthes. Notwithstanding that almost every fact of the early discoveries has now
been proved to have been a reality, every new fact which goes to show that man is only a little
older than we have hitherto supposed, is still received with incredulity or neglect, although it is
universally admitted that not only is there no antecedent improbability in these new discoveries,
but that the theory of evolution, if it is worth anything, demands that the origin of man be placed
very far back in the tertiary period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While such has been the frame of mind with which each new discovery in Europe has been
met, it was natural that comparative ignorance should prevail as to the course of discovery across
the Atlantic; more especially as there was a common notion that America was really a new world
as regards man, and that except a few puzzling facts, like the ruined cities of Central America,
Mexico, and Peru, its native races were comparatively recent immigrants from Asia by the
northwestern route, and that their prehistoric history was brief, simple, and altogether
unimportant as compared with that of early Europe. The facts, however, point to an exactly
opposite conclusion, the prehistoric remains of North America being really far more abundant,
equally varied, and offering as numerous and as interesting problems for solution as are met with
in the European continent. In no other part of the world has the use of stone for all the purposes
of savage and barbarous life been so extensive and so highly elaborated; nowhere else has a race
which has many features in common, and which was long held to be perfectly homogeneous,
been found to present more diversities in customs, in arts, in language, and in physical
characteristics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 666]]</font> The study of prehistoric arch&aelig;ology and of man's antiquity has run almost a
parallel course in America and in Europe. The early discoveries of Schmerling and Godwin-Austen compare with those of the Natchez human bones in the Mississippi loess, and of arrow-heads, pottery, and burnt wood in close connection with skeletons of the mastodon. The kitchen-middens of Denmark are far less extensive than the shell-heaps of New England, Florida, and
Alaska; while the discoveries in the lake-dwellings, peat-bogs, and tumuli may be compared with
the still more extensive finds in the &quot;mounds&quot; of the great valley of the Mississippi. Even the
mysterious structures at Stonehenge, on Dartmoor, and in Brittany, are not more mysterious than
some of the animal mounds or extensive systems of earthworks, nor offer more difficult
problems than the sculptures and hieroglyphics of Central American and Mexican temples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before giving a brief sketch of the varied specimens which illustrate the history of early man
in America, it may be well to state the character of the museums in which they may be best
studied--the Peabody Museum of American Arch&aelig;ology and Ethnology at Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and the Museum of Prehistoric Arch&aelig;ology at the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington. These two museums illustrate very distinct methods of arrangement, each of which
has its advantages. At Cambridge the collections are arranged according to localities or areas.
Everything found in one mound, or group of mounds, is kept together, so as to illustrate, as far as
possible, the life history of the constructors. Surface finds are grouped according to states or
districts; the instruments, bones, shells, &amp;c., of the shell-heaps are similarly arranged; the same is
done with objects found in caves, in stone-graves, in the old Pueblo villages, &amp;c. In the words of
the curator, Mr. F. W. Putnam, &quot;A natural classification has been attempted, grouping together
objects belonging to each people. By this method is brought out the ethnological value of every
object in the museum, so that in the mind of the student each is put into the great mosaic of
human history. Thus it is that throughout the arrangement of the museum the chip of stone and
the polished instrument are side by side. There is no forcing into line, no selection of material, in
order to illustrate a theory. Every object falls into its place with its own associates, and tells its
part of the story of the efforts of man and the results which he has reached at different times and
in different places. By this method of arrangement nothing is forced, and misconception is
impossible. Separate the objects and classify them by their kind, independently of their source,
and the result is simply a series of collections illustrating the development of the <em>arts</em> of man; and
although such collections will find appropriate places in a museum like this, they <font color="990000">[[p. 667]]</font>
should be secondary to the main collection, and be formed of duplicate material. Upon these
principles and methods the arrangement of the collections in the present building has been
carried on.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great collection in the National Museum at Washington, on the other hand, is arranged to
illustrate the development of prehistoric industry and arts. First we have cases filled with the
rudest chipped implements, many quite as rude as the pal&aelig;olithic flints of Europe, and closely
resembling them in form. These are of the most varied materials--calcite, chalcedony, obsidian,
quartzite, slate, sandstone, or trap. Many are scrapers, rude knives, spears, &amp;c., and come from
every part of the continent. In other cases we find leaf-shaped, arrow-shaped, and spear-shaped
stones; passing on successively to all the varied uses to which stone has been applied, through a
long gallery containing probably a hundred large floor-cases. Besides this progressive series
there are some special cases containing the whole of the contents of certain mounds or graves, or
the weapons and implements from some specially interesting locality or island. This method of
arrangement has the advantage of enabling a visitor more easily to appreciate the endless variety
in the forms of each class of articles, and to compare the development of the stone age in
America with that of Europe. As in the case of zoological collections, a great national museum
should combine both methods of arrangement; and it is therefore fortunate that in the present
progressive condition of the study the two great museums of American prehistoric arch&aelig;ology
should have adopted different systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The first thing that strikes the visitor is the immense number and variety of forms of stone
weapons, implements, and ornaments, far exceeding anything known in Europe. The arrow and
spear heads vary in the most curious and fantastic manner, some having very deep basal notches,
others with the lower points greatly lengthened out, while others again are deeply and
symmetrically notched along their edges in a variety of curious patterns. Many of these are
chipped as finely and regularly as the beautiful Danish neolithic flints. Some fine quartzite spear-heads from Louisiana are nine inches long by three wide, while from California and Oregon there
are some curious weapons with parallel sides, and over a foot long; others pointed at both ends
and narrower in the middle, from fourteen inches up to two feet long. Among the curious forms
of arrow and spear-heads are some which have one strongly bevelled edge on opposite sides of
the weapon, having to some extent the effect of a spiral twist. These are from the mounds of
Ohio and Wisconsin, and may possibly have been designed to produce a revolution of the arrow
about its axis during flight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 668]]</font> Scrapers are innumerable, some resembling our common European types, while
others are most fantastically shaped, offering five or six hollows of different curvature; while
borers are equally numerous and strange in form. Numbers of round or oval pebbles have a
shallow groove cut round them, evidently to fasten them firmly to a handle or to a cord, and these
were probably used either as hammers or as bolas for catching game. Other elongate irregular
pebbles have a groove round one end, probably to serve as sinkers, or as weights for spinning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great numbers of stone knives are found, many spear-shaped implements being thus used by
modern Indians and by the Esquimaux; while there are also many large semi-circular or semi-oval knives, which were fixed in a wooden handle by the straight back, the curved edge forming
the knife, thus admitting of the full power of the hand being exerted in the act of cutting. Some
very large nearly circular stones seem to have been hoes, occasionally having a projection at the
back to fasten to the handle with a hole to secure it by a cord or thong, while others are elongate,
sometimes fifteen inches long, and seem to have been used as spades or diggers. Both these
classes have frequently an exquisite glossy polish on the edge for an inch or more, gradually
diminishing upwards, just as might be supposed to be produced by long use in a fine loamy
alluvial soil. As connected with agricultural work, may be mentioned the numerous heavy rudely
globular stones, pierced through the middle with a round hole an inch or more in diameter. These
were at first thought to have been used as war-clubs, but it has now been found that digging or
planting-sticks are used by some Indian tribes, with similar stones on their lower ends as weights
to assist their entrance into the earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extensive use of roots, nuts, acorns, maize, &amp;c. as food required facilities for cracking,
crushing, or grinding; and hence some of the most common implements, both of modern Indian
tribes and throughout all prehistoric ages, are hammers, grinders, pestles, and mortars, of varied
sizes, forms, and workmanship. The pounding, crushing, and grinding stones are of very varied
forms, from the unworked pebble up to the most elaborate grinder with a broad handle,
something like a tailor's iron, but carved out of solid stone. Corresponding to these are the
grinding-stones and mortars, of equally varied forms and sizes. Some are flat, some slightly
hollowed; some have numerous small pits or cups in them, probably to hold nuts of various
kinds, so as to prevent them from flying away when being cracked. From these we pass on
gradually to shallow basins and large deep mortars, some of the latter found in California being a
foot or eighteen inches wide, and having corresponding stone pestles, some of which are two and
a half feet long. In California <font color="990000">[[p. 669]]</font> also, we find many bowls and dishes of stone, some
shallow, some deeper, either round or oval or boat-shaped, some with pointed and some with flat
broad handles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many parts of the country there are found, in mounds and elsewhere, curious flat stones
cut to definite forms, usually more or less elongate and symmetrical, and bored with either one or
two holes. These were first regarded as gorgets or other ornaments, but have since been supposed
to have been used in twisting or spinning thread or string to make the textile fabrics which have
been found in some of the mounds. Some of these stones are said to be used by modern Indians
as guards to protect the wrist against the rebound of the bowstring, but this is probably a mere
chance application, since a leather guard would be more useful and more easily made. Another
set of stones, even more puzzling, are somewhat boat-shaped, hollowed above and curved or
sometimes triangular, below, and usually with a hole near each end. Some few are very elongate
and pointed with the hollow in the centre only, very like the decked canoes used on our rivers,
and having a small hole at each end of the hollow portion. These look very like shuttles, and may
have been used as such, or the whole set may only be other forms of thread-twisters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genuine tools for various purposes are exceedingly abundant--celts and axes, from the
rudest to the finest workmanship; long, beautifully-formed chisels, adzes, and even gouges,
deeply hollowed out on one side and with a cutting edge of great perfection. Many of the tools
are formed out of the hardest fine-grained rocks, such as syenite or h&aelig;matite, and are sometimes
highly polished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides these varied implements and weapons, whose uses are known from observation of
modern savages, or may be fairly conjectured, there are many others which appear to be either
personal ornaments or objects used in favourite games, or for ceremonial purposes. Of the former
class are small stones of various forms, and more or less decorated with pits or incised lines,
some of which were probably ear ornaments, others gorgets. Great numbers of stone discs have
been found, of various sizes, from two or three up to eight inches in diameter, some of which are
worked beautifully true and smooth. They are usually hollowed on one or both surfaces, and
many have a central perforation. Some are formed of hard quartzite, three or four inches
diameter, and must have required an enormous amount of labour to cut and polish them without a
lathe or any of the appliances of the modern lapidary. These were probably used in a game called
chungke, practised among some Indian tribes, and resembling a combination of bowls and spear-throwing; and the Creek Indians had chungke yards kept smooth and level on purpose for the
game. The supposed ceremonial stones have been found from Connecticut to Florida, mostly in
mounds, and are of very <font color="990000">[[p. 670]]</font> varied symmetrical forms, and all have a central hole
sufficiently large to admit a small stick. One has a form closely resembling the &quot;key&quot; of the
maple, others are cylindrical, but slightly curved; some are like triangles joined by a narrow
connecting bar at the centre of their opposite bases; others, again, like the longitudinal section of
a dice-box, with many more which could only be understood by means of figures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sculptured objects are numerous, and some have considerable artistic merit. Among the
modern Indians the Sioux carve animal and human figures on pipes of catlinite or red pipe stone,
some of which are well executed and of fanciful design. The Haida Indians, of Queen Charlotte
Island, are celebrated for their skilful carving in wood and slate, the latter being very elaborate,
highly polished, and having the appearance of black marble. These are grotesquely idealised into
more or less symmetrical designs, and bear a considerable resemblance to some of the Mexican
sculptures, while in language and physiognomy these tribes differ from all the Indians of the
adjacent regions. It is, however, in the mounds that the greatest variety of sculptures have been
found, and among them are some of a very remarkable character.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pipes from the mounds of Ohio and Illinois are often carved into the form of human
heads, some of which have Indian characteristics, while others seem quite distinct. Animal forms
are also abundant, and among them are seen the dog, bear, otter, prairie-dog, beaver, tortoise,
frog, serpent, hawk, heron, coot, duck, woodpecker, owl, &amp;c. The supposed tropical animals
carved by the mound builders, such as the manatee and the parrot, are errors of identification.
There is, however, a curious carving representing some form of llama or camel found on the site
of a mound in Ohio.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> <font color="990000">[[p. 671]]</font> Many carvings of animals, not on pipes, some rude, others more
delicate, have been found in New York and other States. In Iowa two pipes, with rude carvings of
an elephant or mastodon, but with neither tusks nor tail, have been found by two separate
individuals; but suspicion has been thrown on their genuineness because they both passed
through the hands of the same person, and because they resemble in general form the well-known
elephant mound of Wisconsin. It is, however, absolutely demonstrated, by bones pierced with
stone arrows and others burnt with fire, that the mastodon was coeval with man in America, and
there is therefore no antecedent improbability in its being represented both in mounds and
carvings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very strange are the stone collars, or &quot;sacrificial yokes,&quot; found in great abundance in the
island of Porto Rica, and more rarely in Mexico. These are in shape and size like small horse-collars, but carved out of single blocks of hard volcanic rock. They all have a curious ornamental
projection on one side, as if to represent the junction of the material out of which the type collar
was formed. Some are slender and comparatively light, while others are so massive that they
would be a heavy load for a man. They are said to be found in surface deposits, and along with
them are many finely worked and polished celts and axes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-continued use of stone in America for the most varied purposes, and the occupation
of the country by Indian tribes down to comparatively recent times, is the obvious cause of the
extreme abundance of stone weapons and implements all over the country. As indications of this
abundance, the case of Dr. Abbott's farm at Trenton, New Jersey, may be mentioned. This
gentleman has obtained on a very limited area, about twenty thousand stone implements and
several hundreds of associated objects made of bone, clay, and copper, besides numerous pipes
and carved stone ornaments. In a small field on the banks of the Potomac, near Washington,
arrow-heads of quartz and quartzite have been collected for many years, and are sometimes still
so abundant that hundreds may be collected in a few days. This is on the site of an Indian
settlement abandoned about two hundred years ago. In California, the large stone mortars used
for pounding the acorns, which seem always to have formed the food of the indigenes, are
scattered over the country <font color="990000">[[p. 672]]</font> by thousands; while the beautiful little arrow-heads of jasper
and chalcedony found abundantly in some districts, are systematically collected to be set in gold
and used as ornamental jewellery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next in interest and extent to the stone weapons and implements are the articles of pottery
found abundantly in the various classes of mounds and sites of villages. These consist chiefly of
cooking vessels, water jars, drinking cups, and mortuary urns, extremely varied in form, size, and
ornamentation, and often exhibiting a considerable amount of artistic skill. In a group of mounds
in New Madrid, in Missouri, over a hundred such vessels were found, exhibiting about thirty
distinct types of form, from flat dishes to long-necked jars, vessels with or without handles or
feet, and with the handles greatly varied in number, form, and position. Many of these are
moulded above into the form of human heads or busts, and some of them are in strange attitudes,
recalling the fantastic Peruvian pottery. Similar pottery has been found in the mounds of
Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio, as well as in the curious stone graves found extensively in the
Southern States; but their various peculiarities can only be understood by examining the
specimens or a good series of figures. Very numerous tools and utensils of shell have also been
found in the mounds, a moderate quantity in copper, with many ornaments of mica and some of
silver and of gold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general character of the mounds and earthworks of various parts of the United States,
and which are more especially abundant in the great valley of the Mississippi and its tributaries,
is sufficiently known, though their vast numbers and the great variety of form and structure
which they present is hardly understood in England. A voluminous memoir will shortly be
published by the Bureau of Ethnology, which will give most important information on the entire
subject. In some parts of Indiana and Kentucky a hundred mounds have been found in a hundred
acres. The enclosed area of the ancient earthworks at Aztalan, Wisconsin, is more than fourteen
hundred feet long and near seven hundred wide. The great mound of Cahokia, St. Louis, was
ninety feet high, and covered an area of seven hundred feet by five hundred feet, with an inclined
road up one side to reach the flat platform on the top. Another almost equally large mound exists
at Seltzertown, Mississippi. In Louisiana are some curious platform mounds, in the form of
squares or parallelograms, connected by terraces. Besides the wonderful Fort Ancient in Ohio,
containing five miles of embankment, now, sad to relate, being gradually destroyed by
cultivation, there are in Georgia and other southern states several fortified mountain-tops,
recalling, in their inaccessibility, the hill-forts of India.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Another curious class of works are the ash-pits, discovered a few years since near
Madisonville, Ohio. M. Putnam, curator of the <font color="990000">[[p. 673]]</font> Peabody Museum, has opened no less
than one thousand of these pits, and has obtained from them a large amount of implements,
ornaments, pottery, and other articles. They are found on a plateau which is covered with a
remnant of the virgin forest. There is a surface deposit of twelve to eighteen inches of leaf-mould, below which is hard clay. These pits are found to be circular in form, from three to four
feet in diameter, and from four to seven feet deep. At the bottom there is often a small circular
excavation, either in the centre or at one side. They are usually filled with ashes, in more or less
defined layers, the bottom portion being very fine grey ashes, while the upper part may be more
or less mixed with gravel or sand, with occasional layers of charcoal. Throughout the whole mass
of ashes and sand, from the top of the pit to the bottom, are bones of fishes, reptiles, birds, and
mammals. Those of the larger species of mammalia, such as the elk, deer, and bear, are generally
broken, and appear to have been those of animals used for food. Half a bushel of such bones are
sometimes taken out of one pit. Shells of many species of Unio are also found. There is also
much broken pottery, but rarely any entire vessels. Numbers of implements of bone or horn are
found, some of large size and apparently used for digging, as well as awls, beads, harpoon-points,
and small whistles. Arrow-points, drills, scrapers, and other stone instruments are common, with
some polished celts and rough hammer-heads. Stone pipes and copper beads and finger-rings are
also found. In some of the pits a considerable quantity of charred corn has been found, together
with nuts and other articles of food, and in one case only a human skeleton was found at the
bottom of a pit. A considerable area, including that occupied by the pits, seems to have been used
as a cemetery, both before and since they were constructed. A great number of skeletons are
found buried just beneath the layer of leaf mould, and in some cases these skeletons lie across a
pit, while in others skeletons already buried have been evidently disturbed by digging the pit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same district, but at a little higher elevation, are a number of earth-circles, from forty-three to fifty-eight feet in diameter, which prove to be sites of houses, with a central fire-place of
clay, and with implements and utensils agreeing with those found in the pits. After an extensive
and most laborious investigation of this locality, the only explanation of the peculiar feature of
the pits is, that at certain times or on certain special occasions the whole contents of a house were
burned, and the remains and all the ashes buried in a pit, while the quantity of bones found
indicates that the ceremony was accompanied by feasting. The thick layer of leaf-mould covering
the pits, graves, and house-sites would indicate an antiquity much greater than that of the large
forest-trees which grow on the present surface, while the enormous number of the pits and the
extent of the <font color="990000">[[p. 674]]</font> cemetery, covering over fifteen acres of ground, and from which over five
hundred skeletons have been obtained, indicates that the place was permanently occupied by a
large population.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another class of remains, the shell-banks, are far more numerous and extensive than the
kitchen-middens of Europe. They are found from Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, and on the
west coast they have been discovered in Alaska and in California, while similar mounds,
composed entirely of fresh-water shells, occur in the valleys of the Mississippi, Ohio, and other
rivers. These accumulations are often of great extent. One on the coast of Georgia covers ten
acres to a depth of from five to ten feet. In Florida, on Amelia Island, a shell-heap extends a
quarter of a mile inland by a hundred and fifty yards along the shore; and many others are found
thickly scattered over a district a hundred and fifty miles long. An immense number of works of
art and animal and human remains have been found in them, some of which indicate a
considerable antiquity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America also has its cave dwellings, with characteristic remains of their human inhabitants;
its cliff-houses, forts, and towns, partly excavated and partly built up with good stone walls, so as
to resemble medi&aelig;val castles or eastern rock-cities; and its ruined towns of the Zuni and Pueblo
Indians scattered over the vast desert-regions of Arizona and New Mexico. Some of these are
highly interesting and remarkable. The ruined pueblo of Penasca Blanca in the Chaga Ca&ntilde;on,
New Mexico, forms a regular oval of about five hundred by four hundred feet, the houses being
symmetrically placed around the outside so as to enclose an open area, which contains a
depression, probably a pond for storing water. The walls of the houses are regularly and solidly
built of stone. Equally remarkable is a large round tower about forty feet in diameter with double
walls, the space between which is divided into numerous small rooms. This is in ruins, but was
evidently well constructed of good stone masonry. Accurate models of these and many other
structures exist in the National and Smithsonian Museums.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preceding brief outline of the materials which exist in American Museums for the study
of prehistoric man are sufficient to show that they are not inferior in extent, variety, and interest
to those of Europe; while if we extend our survey to the marvellous prehistoric remains of
Mexico, Central America, Peru, and Bolivia, their pyramids and temples, their ruined cities, their
cemeteries, their highways and aqueducts, their highly characteristic sculpture, their fantastic
pottery, and their still undeciphered hieroglyphics, we may claim for the American continent a
position, as regards the early history and development of the human race, hardly inferior to that
of the whole of the Eastern hemisphere. A body of earnest and painstaking students are now
engaged in the collection, preservation, <font color="990000">[[p. 675]]</font> and study of these various classes of remains;
and at the same time a vast mass of most valuable material is being brought together relating to
the manners and customs, the tools, weapons, and ornaments, the tribal relations, the migrations,
the folk-lore, the religions, and the languages of the aboriginal inhabitants. Already much light
has been thrown on the prehistoric remains by their comparison with objects still in use in some
parts of the continent; and this study has resulted in the formation of two schools of American
anthropologists. The one school, impressed by the very numerous resemblances to be found
between existing Indians and the mound-builders, maintain the practical identity of race and
continuity of habitation from the epoch of the earliest prehistoric remains down to the date of the
European discovery. The other school, laying more stress on the differences between the remains
left by the mound-builders and other prehistoric races and the works of modern Indians, and
being convinced, further, that there are indications of great antiquity and successive occupation
in many areas, believe that there has been a long series of changes in America as in the old
world, that each group of remains and each area has its characteristic features, that there have
been higher grades of civilisation succeeded by lower as well as lower by higher, and that the
facts, no less than the probabilities, are all in favour of successive displacements of tribes or
races, of which the displacement of the mound-builders by the ancestors of the historic &quot;red
men&quot; was perhaps the latest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This divergence of opinion is probably the very best security for the ultimate discovery of the
truth, since it assures us that no important evidence on either side will be neglected. The whole
inquiry is in good hands; fresh material is continually being obtained and elaborated; and we may
look forward with some confidence to a final consensus of opinion which shall disperse, by the
light of accurate knowledge, some portion at least of the obscurity which has hitherto
overshadowed the early history of the American continent.</p>

<p><br /><em>Notes Appearing in the Original Work</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. <em>Nineteenth Annual Report of the Trustees of the Peabody Museum</em>, vol. iii. p. 481. <font color="990000">[[on p. 667]]</font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="2" id="2"></a>2. The history of this remarkable piece of sculpture is as follows. Mr. J. F. Snyder, M.D., purchased it
along with a few other prehistoric relics, flint arrow-prints, stone axes, &amp;c., of a typical backwoodsman,
who was migrating from Marion Co., Ohio, to the west, with his family and household goods. The man
was rough and uneducated, and profoundly ignorant of arch&aelig;ology, but attached some value to the
specimens, partly because others did, but chiefly because he had himself found them.  He stated that he had
ploughed up the llama, together with many Indian bones, and two of the stone axes, and some of the flints,
from a low flat mound in his field, while preparing the ground for corn-planting.  He sold the specimens
because he needed money to prosecute his journey.  These facts were communicated in a letter to myself
from Dr. Snyder, in answer to an enquiry as to the history of the &quot;llama.&quot; There can, I think, be no
reasonable doubt of the genuineness of the find.  A number of similar objects have been found in Peru, and
several of them are figured in &quot;The U.S. Naval Astronomical Expedition to the Southern Hemisphere
during the Years 1845-52,&quot; but none of these <em>exactly</em> correspond with the Ohio specimen. It has been
suggested that this relic was brought to Florida by one of De Loto's men, who had obtained it in Peru while
engaged there under Pizarro, and that it reached Ohio from Florida by Indian conquest or by trade and
barter. This purely hypothetical explanation seems highly improbable and quite unnecessary.  There are
many proofs of widespread intercommunication among most savages, and there can be no doubt that it
existed among such ancient <font color="990000">[[p. 671]]</font> and comparatively advanced peoples as the inhabitants of Peru and
Mexico and the mound builders. In an interesting paper published in the &quot;Proceedings of the American
Antiquarian Society,&quot; in 1886, Mr. F. W. Putnam shows that jade ornaments have been found in a mound
in Michigan, and also in burial mounds in many localities in Central America, which have evidently been
formed by cutting up jade celts; and further, that the same material is nowhere found <em>in situ</em> in America,
while it exactly corresponds with Asiatic jade, some of the specimens exactly matching the material of the
jade celts of New Zealand.  These specimens, as well as the carved llama, may therefore be considered to
prove the widespread intercommunication between distant peoples at a very remote epoch. <font color="990000">[[on pp. 670-671]]</font></font></p>

At the inaugural UFC event, there were three rules: no biting, eye gouging or groin strikes. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-17006701" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Ironically, these were the same rules employed for the ancient Greek sport of Pankration, a precursor to modern mixed martial arts. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">However, even with the limited rules, these early fights appear downright barbaric in comparison to the polished UFC events of today. There were no judges, time limits or rounds. All fights had to be finished via knockout, submission or the opponent's corner throwing in the towel.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The brutality was on display in the first-ever UFC match, which saw Dutch savateur Gerard Gordeau kick a downed Telia Tuli so hard in the face that it sent one of his teeth flying past the announcer's table. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="molecule nr-video-manager"><div class="thumbnail-holder"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><div class="atom lazyImage maintainAspectRatio"><img alt="A Timeline of UFC Rules: From No-Holds-Barred to Highly Regulated" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png" cloudinaryWidth="970" thumbnail_url="https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1714852790/xzwbq0octff0ljcj8txx.jpg" image="https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1714852790/xzwbq0octff0ljcj8txx.jpg"/></div><svg class="atom icon svg videoPlay" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="1 0 59 60"><title>Video Play Button</title><path d="M30.5 0C13.932 0 .5 13.43.5 30s13.432 30 30 30c16.57 0 30-13.43 30-30S47.07 0 30.5 0zm0 54c-13.233 0-24-10.766-24-24s10.767-24 24-24c13.234 0 24 10.766 24 24s-10.766 24-24 24zm-7.274-32.4v16.8c0 2.31 1.637 3.255 3.638 2.1l14.549-8.4c2-1.155 2-3.045 0-4.2l-14.55-8.4c-2-1.155-3.637-.21-3.637 2.1z"></path></svg></a><div class="atom video-indicator"><a href="/videos" class="video-page-link"><span class="text">✨ Watch more top videos, highlights, and B/R original content<!-- --> </span> <svg class="atom icon svg rightArrow" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 17 28"><title>Right Arrow Icon</title><path d="M2.938 0L16.3 14 2.94 28 0 24.41 9.935 14 0 3.59"></path></svg></a></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Obviously, controversy arose, but it was actually the negative press that initially helped propel pay-per-view and VHS sales, turning what was supposed to be a one-time event into an on-going series.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class=""><span style="line-height: 1;">The rules fluctuated with each new event often changing arbitrarily or in order to accommodate local authorities. This happened at UFC 9, when political pressures forced the promoters to ban fighters from punching their opponents in the head with closed-fist strikes. </span></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Ultimate Fighting took a huge hit in 1996 when Sen. John McCain, a supposed boxing fan, saw a UFC tape and famously characterized it as "human cock-fighting." McCain went on a crusade against <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/mma">MMA</a> and was almost successful in getting the UFC banned in all 50 states.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">In response to the backlash, the UFC began implementing more rules in order to legitimize it as a real sport. This included instituting judges, time limits, rounds, weight classes, and a 10-point must scoring system. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-1140951" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_02" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Most importantly, the UFC also made changes to the ways in which a fighter can strike his opponent. Combatants now wore fingerless gloves and were not allowed to headbutt, throw elbow strikes to the back of the head/neck or kick a downed fighter to the face.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">This was not enough though as SEG, the company that produced the UFC, teetered on the verge of bankruptcy. Few states were sanctioning events and the money from pay-per-view had all but dried up.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">However, in 2000, Station Casino executives Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta and business associate <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/dana-white">Dana White</a> entered into a deal with SEG to purchase the UFC for $2 million. They finalized the deal in January 2001 and created Zuffa, LLC.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Another major event happened in 2001 that would shape the future of MMA in the United States. In April of that year, the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board adopted a set of standards that would become known as the <a href="http://www.abcboxing.com/unified_mma_rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</a>. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class=""><span style="line-height: 1;">These rules were also officially recognized by the Association of Boxing Commissions in July 2009.</span></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">This was a huge step forward because for the first time in MMA's history there were an agreed upon set of comprehensive rules that state regulatory bodies could use to sanction the sport. The Unified Rules were very specific and covered all aspects of an MMA event including scoring, round length, fighter attire and fouls.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">These new rule changes even earned the seal of approval from John McCain who stated that, "The sport has grown up. The rules have been adopted to give its athletes better protections and to ensure fairer competition." (via <a href="http://www.mmafighting.com/2008/06/04/dont-forget-john-mccains-other-mma-quote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mmafighting.com</a>).</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-117563927" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The list of fouls ballooned from the original three to 30. Most of the fouls are rarely ever violated in the course of a bout, but there are five that still remain problematic.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">1. Eye-poking has been a foul since the first UFC, but it is still a big problem due to the fingerless gloves the fighters wear. It's a double-edged sword because on one hand a finger to the eye could cause serious injury, but on the other fighters need to have open hands to effectively grapple.  </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">2. The use of 12-6 (straight up-and-down) elbows to the head and face are strictly prohibited. However, elbow strikes are legal, so it is up to the referee to decide if the shots are within bounds.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">3. Groin strikes are illegal and all fighters are required to wear athletic cups; however, most opt to wear the comfortable soft plastic cup as opposed to the steel thai cup which gives more protection. The foul usually occurs accidentally when inside leg kicks and knees to the thighs miss their mark. After the foul, the fighter is allowed a five-minute period to compose himself. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class=""><span style="line-height: 1;">4. Knees to a grounded opponent's head are illegal. A grounded opponent is one who has three points of contact with the canvas, so routinely fighters will be in a standing clinch and put one hand on the mat in order to not to be kneed in the head. This is a flaw with this rule and should be slightly tweaked.</span></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">5. Strikes (punches or elbows) are illegal to the back and top of the head/neck. This is not a new foul, but it still poses quite the quandary. Fighters are allowed to strike the front and side of the head leaving a slim margin between a legal and illegal shot. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-89329696" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">These rules are far from perfect, but their enforcement (and the business savvy of Zuffa) are what helped the UFC to not only climb back from the brink of collapse, but also to make MMA one of the fastest growing sports of the new millennium. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The UFC swallowed up most other competing MMA organizations and built a brand that, in 2011, the FOX family of networks decided to get behind to the tune $700 million over seven years.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">MMA is now sanctioned in almost every state with only a few exceptions, most notably New York, but there is a good likelihood that fight fans could see a UFC card at Madison Square Garden sooner rather than later.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">It's amazing to think that in only 20 years, the UFC has gone from fights with "no rules" to become a sport as mainstream as the NFL, MLB or NBA. And just like all of those sports, the UFC will assuredly continue to evolve, which will inevitably mean more rule changes in the future.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div

Wherefore in the study of these matters it is especially necessary that we adopt, as our guide in these mysteries, the reasoning that comes from philosophy, and consider reverently <A CLASS="Tsubsec" NAME="T378b">b</A>each one of the things that are said and done, so that, to quote Theodorus,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref352" HREF="

The fact that everything is to be referred to reason we may gather from the Egyptians themselves; for on the nineteenth day of the first month, when they are holding festival in honour of Hermes, they eat honey and a fig; and as they eat they say, "A sweet


<A ID="p159"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p159 </SPAN></A>thing is Truth." The amulet&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref353" HREF="

For this reason he keeps his finger on his lips in token of restrained speech or silence. In the month of Mesorê they bring to him an offering of legumes and say, "The tongue is luck, the tongue is god." Of the plants in Egypt they say that the persea is especially consecrated to the goddess because its fruit resembles a heart and its leaf a tongue. The fact is that nothing of man's usual possessions is more divine than reasoning, especially reasoning about the gods; and nothing has a greater influence toward happiness. <A CLASS="Tsubsec" NAME="T378d">d</A>For this reason we give instructions to anyone who comes down to the oracle here to think holy thoughts and to speak words of good omen. But the mass of mankind act ridiculously in their processions and festivals in that they proclaim at the outset the use of words of good omen,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref354" HREF="

Among the Greeks also many things are done which are similar to the Egyptian ceremonies in the shrines of Isis, and they do them at

The Phrygians, believing that the god is asleep in the winter and awake in the summer, sing lullabies for him in the winter and in the summer chants to arouse him, after the manner of bacchic worshippers. The Paphlagonians assert that in the spring he bestirs himself and sets himself free again.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.1">1</A> The season of the year also gives us a suspicion that this gloominess is brought about because of the disappearance from our sight of the crops and fruits that people in days of old did not regard as gods, but as necessary and important contributions of the gods toward the avoidance of a savage and a bestial life. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T379a">379</A>At the time of year when they saw some of the fruits vanishing and disappearing completely from the trees, while they themselves were sowing others in a mean and poverty-stricken fashion still, scraping

Then again, even as we speak of the man who buys the books of Plato as "buying Plato," and of the man who represents the poems of Menander as "acting Menander," even so those men of old did not refrain from calling by the names of the gods the gifts and creations of the gods, <A CLASS="Tsubsec" NAME="T379b">b</A>honouring and venerating them because of the need which they had for them. The men of later times accepted this blindly, and in their ignorance referred to the gods the behaviour of the crops and the presence and disappearance of necessities, not only calling them the births and deaths of the gods, but even believing that they are so; and thus they filled the minds with absurd, unwarranted, and confused opinions although they had before their eyes the absurdity of such illogical reasoning. Rightly did Xenophanes&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref358" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

Is it anything but ridiculous amid their lamentations to pray that the powers may cause their crops to sprout again and bring them to perfection in order that they again be consumed and lamented?
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="71">71</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.1">1</A> This is not quite the case: but they do lament for their crops and they do pray to the gods, who are the authors and givers, that they produce and cause to grow afresh other new crops to take the place of those that are undergoing destruction. <A NAME="71.2"></A>Hence it is an excellent saying current


<A ID="p165"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p165 </SPAN></A>among philosophers that they that have not learned to interpret rightly the sense of words are wont to bungle their actions.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref359" HREF="

But the great majority of the Egyptians, in doing service to the animals themselves and in treating them as gods, have not only filled their sacred offices with ridicule and derision, but this is the least of the evils connected with their silly practices. There is engendered a dangerous belief, which plunges the weak and innocent into sheer superstition, and in the case of the

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="72.1">1</A> The notion that the gods, in fear of Typhon, changed themselves into these animals,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref364" HREF="

The further notion that as many of the souls of the dead as continue to exist are reborn into these animals only is likewise incredible. Of those who desire to assign to this some political reason some relate that Osiris, on his great expedition, divided his forces into many parts, which the Greeks call squads and companies, and to them all he gave standards in the form of animals, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T380a">380</A>each of which came to be regarded as sacred and precious by the descendants of them who had shared in the assignment. Others relate that the later kings, to strike their enemies with terror, appeared in battle after putting on gold and silver masks of wild beasts' heads. Others record that one of these crafty and unscrupulous kings,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref365" HREF="

<A ID="p169"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p169 </SPAN></A>on different peoples to honour and revere different animals; and inasmuch as these animals conducted themselves with enmity and hostility toward one another, one by its nature desiring one kind of food and another another, the several peoples were ever defending their own animals, and were much offended if these animals suffered injury, and thus they were drawn on unwittingly by the enmities of the animals until they were brought into open hostility with one another. Even to‑day the inhabitants of Lycopolis are the only people among the Egyptians that eat a sheep; for the wolf, whom they hold to be a god, also eats it. And in my day the people of Oxyrhynchus caught a dog and sacrificed it and ate it up as if it had been sacrificial meat,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref366" HREF="

The legend would seem to intimate that all irrational and brutish nature belongs to the portion of the evil deity, and in trying to soothe and appease him they lavish attention and care upon these animals. If there befall a great and severe drought that brings on in excess either fatal diseases or other unwonted and extraordinary calamities, the priests, under cover of darkness, in silence and stealth, lead away some of the animals that are held in honour; and at first they but threaten and terrify the animals,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref367" HREF="

It is not that we should honour these, but that through these we should honour the Divine, since they are clearer mirrors of the Divine by their nature also, so that we should regard them <A CLASS="Tsubsec" NAME="T382b">b</A>as the instrument or device of the God who orders all things. And in general we must hold it true that nothing inanimate is superior to what is animate, and nothing without the power of perception is superior to that which has that power — no, not even if one should heap together all the gold and emeralds in the world. The Divine is not engendered in colours or in forms or in polished surfaces, but whatsoever things have no share in life, things whose nature does not allow them to share therein, have a portion of less honour than that of the dead. But the nature that lives and sees and has within itself the source of movement and a knowledge of what belongs to it and


<A ID="p181"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p181 </SPAN></A>what belongs to others, has drawn to itself an efflux and portion of beauty from the Intelligence "by which the Universe is guided," as Heracleitus&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref388" HREF="

</b><font size="+0">James Hayes-Bohanan, Ph.D.<br>
Geographer, Bridgewater State College</font></h2>
Thank you for visiting my web site. This site was originally created
when I was a part-time geography instructor at the University of Texas
at Brownsville-Texas Southmost College (that really is the name of the
school). I had no office hours then, and lived about an hour away from
campus. All of my classes
met just one time per week. The web site began as a way to provide some
extra contact with students between class sessions. The first items on
the site were class notes, some writing tips, and a few links to other
web sites.
<p>When I began teaching geography full-time at Bridgewater State
College in 1997, one of my first acts was to move the web site to my
new academic home. My students continue to be my most important
audience, but I also
put materials here for the many other visitors to my site, including
geography students at all levels (elementary through post-graduate),
educators, and other people throughout the world who share interests in
geography or the other topics found on the site. </p>
<p><b>In my classes, students must always achieve a certain minimum
amount of learning. One purpose of this site is to make sure there is
no maximum to what my students learn. Using this web site as a starting
point, the
possibilities are boundless - partly because of my original content but
mostly
because of the links that I provide.</b> </p>
<p>This an "Environmental Geography" site because that is my specialty
within the discipline of geography. Geography is both a social and a
physical science, and the interactions between the physical and human
realms have long interested geographers. An environmental geographer is
one who focuses on that human/environment interface. See my <a
 href="EnvironmentalGeography.htm">What is Environmental Geography?</a>
page for more details on what this means. </p>
<p>I hope you will take some time to explore the site. If you read the
home page carefully, you will find that it points you to all of the
important
parts of the site, but it is sometimes easy to overlook some fun and
interesting areas. For example, have you noticed the County Map
Project, which provides information about almost every state in the
U.S.? Or have you visited&nbsp; Rondonia Web, which describes the
little-known part of the Amazon where
I have been doing research? Did you know that current news headlines
about
the environment, gay rights, Latin America, and other topics are now
available on the appropriate pages throughout the site? Have you seen
the family page, which includes photos and stories about my terrific
family? Finally, the "Highlights"
section of the main page includes many special and short-term links,
most
of which change every few weeks. Peruse this section frequently for the
latest additions. </p>
<p>The site has grown so much since its earliest incarnation in Texas
that I have added a search engine to the main page, so that visitors
can return to pages that they may have visited previously. I even use
it myself, to
find items that I know I've put somewhere on the site. </p>
<p>I reserve the icons on the left side of the screen for sites that
are
truly special to me. </p>
<p>While visiting the site, if you notice any errors, please let me
know
by e-mail (<a href="mailto:jhayesboh@bridgew.edu">jhayesboh@bridgew.edu</a>
) or on my new <a href="NOT13TH/webextracredit.htm">Corrections and
Suggestions</a>
form, so that I can correct them. Also, feel free to visit the Guest
Book,
located at the bottom of the main page, to share your comments with
other
visitors. Please let me know if you have ideas for material I should
add
to the site - specific links or entire new projects! </p>
<p>This message would not be complete without acknowledging the help
others provide in maintaining this site. The Information Technology
staff at BSC provide the hardware and network support, and respond to
all of my technical requests with cheerfulness and efficiency. Students
in all of my classes
continuously check the pages for broken links or other errors and
sometimes
suggest new resources. I receive e-mail messages from throughout the
world
with comments and suggestions. </p>
<p>Finally, work-study students undertake many creative and/or
time-consuming projects to keep this site in shape. Kim O'Connell, Leah
Chuckran, Mia Mercado, Kelli Bennett, and especially Andrea Peters have
contributed to the quality of this site. </p>
<p>Thanks again for visiting. </p>

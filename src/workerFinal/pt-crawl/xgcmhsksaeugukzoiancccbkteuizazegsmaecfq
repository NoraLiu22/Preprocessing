<h3>Fossil Diptera Catalog -- Web Version</h3>
Go to <a href="index.shtml">Fossil Diptera Catalog Home Page</a>
<P><CENTER><B>CATALOGUE FORMAT</B></CENTER>
<P><BR>
<B>1. General:</B><BR>
The classification of the catalogue is limited to families and generally
follows McAlpine <I>et al.</I> (1981) with additions of extinct families
represented by fossils placed near putative related extant families. No
attempt has been made to classify taxa below the family level. No infraorders,
superfamilies, subfamilies, or tribes are listed. Genera within families
are instead listed alphabetically. See section 4 for a list of alternative
or obsolete family-group names.<BR>
<BR>
Wherever possible, all requirements of the <I>International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature</I> (I.C.Z.N., 1985) have been followed in this catalogue.
Some exceptions occur in the treatment and listing of some names in accordance
with common usage and stability of nomenclature. Where listed, these names
have been fully annotated.<BR>
<BR>
The common practice of placing parentheses around names of authors whose
species-group names are no longer combined with their original genus-group
names is not followed in this catalogue. The reader is referred to Crosskey,
ed. (1980: 18) for a complete discussion of the argument for the elimination
of this practice.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. Taxonomic References:</B><BR>
General: References given after each name pertain to the original proposal
of that name. Additional (secondary) proposals of that name as &quot;new&quot;
are given in square brackets following the original reference. Reference
to date and pagination of reprinted or translated versions of the original
proposal are provided in parentheses. These reprints or translations are
fully annotated with date and pagination under the original work in the
Literature Cited section.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Genus-Group Names</B>: Taxonomically valid genus-group names are listed
alphabetically within each family. Valid subgenera are listed alphabetically
under each nominal genus. Where the current accepted classification calls
for certain genera to be subdivided into subgenera, but only the nominate
subgenus is known in the fossil record, the subgeneric heading is omitted
and species are listed under the nominal genus. Genus-group synonyms are
listed chronologically. Junior synonyms are listed in italics, senior synonyms
are listed in boldface. Only those synonyms that are found in the fossil
literature, are necessary to be mentioned for nomenclatural reasons, or
have not been treated in any previous Diptera catalogue are listed here.
Genus-group names and their species that are provisionally included in a
family are listed at the end of that particular chapter under &quot;Questionably
Included in . . . &quot;. Unplaceable genus-group names are found in the
various &quot;Unplaced&quot; chapters in the catalogue.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Species-Group Names</B>: All taxonomically valid species-group names
are listed under the genus heading in alphabetical order in boldface and
placed flush left. Those taxa not valid nomenclaturally are listed in italics
and listed flush left if no senior synonym is known. Junior synonyms are
listed in italics under the senior synonym in chronological order of original
date of publication. Unplaceable species-group names are listed at the end
of each particular family chapter concerned with original genus-group name
in parentheses after the page number. species-group names that are unplaceable
to family are listed either in &quot;Unplaced Nematocera&quot;, &quot;Unplaced
Brachycera&quot;, or &quot;Unplaced to Family&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Author(s): </B>Authors cited are those responsible for the original proposal
of the genus-group or species-group name in accordance with the <I>Code</I>.
Multiple authorship is listed in full throughout the catalogue. Names proposed
by more than two authors are listed with full authorship in the first mention
of the name and with the second and succeeding authors indicated by &quot;et
al.&quot; in each succeeding mention, e.g., in the introductory paragraphs
to each family chapter and in the genus-group name paragraphs. When authorship
is different from the authorship of the work in which the new name is proposed,
the citation is listed in the form &quot;Kalugina in Kalugina &amp; Kovalev,
1985&quot;, which corresponds to the authorship in the Literature Cited
section (in this case, the work can be found under Kalugina &amp; Kovalev,
1985). Spelling of authors' names follows the orthography most commonly
used. Transliterations from Cyrillic, Kanji and Chinese alphabets follow
this rule and also defer to authors' own personal preference of transliteration
if possible, e.g., &quot;Zaitzev&quot; rather than &quot;Zaytsev&quot; or
&quot;Zaitsev&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Date/pagination:</B> The date of a work given in the catalogue is that
which is cited in the original work. If a name was published in an undated
work, a work in which the date was found through external evidence, or a
work in which the date given was found to be incorrect, the correct date
is given in square brackets in the Literature Cited section, but brackets
are omitted from the date in the catalogue text. <BR>
<BR>
In cases where two or more bibliographic references are given for the same
name, e.g., &quot;<B>magnus</B> Meunier, 1907c: 198 [1907d: 210, 1907i:
269]&quot;, &quot;<I>WILLISTONIELLA</I> Meunier, 1904a: 85 [1904c: 74]&quot;,
the nomenclatural availability of the name dates from the first reference.<BR>
<BR>
Page numbers cited are those on which the name appears in the original work,
except in cases where reprint pagination predates journal issue (having
been issued in advance of the journal version of the article). When a work
is known to have been reprinted or translated with different pagination,
these pages are given in parentheses after the first published version of
the name. If the date of the reprint or translation is the same as the original
work, it is omitted from the parenthetical pagination, otherwise, the different
date is given, e.g., &quot;<B>PROCYRTOSIA</B> Zaitzev, 1986: 817 (1987:
152)&quot;, &quot;<B>fragilis</B> Scudder, 1894: 200 (38)&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Changes in combination/taxonomic status: Changes</B> from the original
combination and taxonomic status for all names listed are fully annotated.
For species-group names that have been transferred from the original nominal
genus to another nominal genus, the original genus is placed in parentheses
after the page number in its original orthography, whether or not the genus
was spelled correctly, e.g., &quot;<B>cruciferella</B> Cockerell, 1917b:
373 (<I>Mongoma</I>)&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
For genus-group names that have had changes of taxonomic status (genus to
subgenus; subgenus to genus), the original status is placed in parentheses
after the page, e.g., &quot;<B>BREMIA</B> Rondani, 1860: 289 (as <I>Cecidomyia</I>
subgenus)&quot;, &quot;<B>LASIOHELEA</B> Kieffer, 1921: 115 (as genus)&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
For species-group names that have had changes in their taxonomic status
(species to subspecies, subspecies or variety to species), the original
status is placed in parentheses after the page number, e.g., &quot;<I>prolifica</I>
Meunier, 1916b: 492 (as <I>vulgaris</I> subspecies).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Type species designation:</B> For nomenclaturally available genus-group
names, the type species and the method of fixation is listed after the date
and pagination or original taxonomic status. Suppressed and other invalid
genus-group names (<I>nomina nuda</I> and incorrect original and subsequent
spellings) do not have type-species information listed. Type species are
listed in their original binomia with original authorship and date with
original orthography (whether or not the spelling was correct). Subgeneric
epithets that may have been included in the original establishment of the
type species are omitted. The correct nominal type species is listed first
with any senior synonyms listed in square brackets, e.g., &quot;Type species:
<I>Phronia rustica</I> Winnertz, 1863 [= <I>Mycetophila exigua</I> Zetterstedt,
1852]&quot;. If the type species is invalid because of homonymy, the citation
takes the following form: &quot;Type species: <I>Geron gibbosus</I> Meigen,
1820 [preoccupied, = <I>Bombylius gibbosus</I> Olivier, 1789]&quot;. If
the nominal species was misidentified so that the actual type species is
different from the proposed type species, it is cited in the following form:
&quot;Type species: <I>Mycetophila discoidea</I> Meigen, 1818 [misidentification,
= <I>Mycetophila fasciata</I> Meigen, 1804]&quot; where the misidentified
type species is <I>Mycetophila discoidea</I> Meigen and the actual type
species is <I>Mycetophila faciata</I> Meigen.<BR>
<BR>
Method of fixation of type species follows Articles 68 and 69 of the <I>Code</I>
and uses the terms (in order of precedence according to Article 68 and 69):
&quot;original designation&quot;, &quot;monotypy&quot;, &quot;subsequent
designation&quot;, and &quot;subsequent monotypy&quot;. There are no cases
of absolute tautonomy in this catalogue. In cases of emendations and new
replacement names, the type species is the same as for the genus-group name
it emends or replaces, thus the term for fixation used here is &quot;automatic&quot;.
Genus-group names that have had no previously designated type species and
have their first designation in this catalogue are listed on p. 28&shyp;30
and are suffixed after the type species information with the boldfaced annotation
&quot;<B>present designation</B>&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Geographical information:</B> Geographical information for each species
follows the date and pagination in the following form: type locality(s);
other distribution. When a species-group name was originally described from
an extant form, but subsequently found in fossil form, the geographical
information is listed in the following form: type locality(s); other extant
distribution; fossil distribution.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Type locality:</I> Only the country, island group or state or province
is listed depending on the format and is prefaced by an abbreviation of
the zoogeographical region in which it occurs (see list of abbreviations
for regions). If the original description is not specific as to a particular
locality within a larger geographical area, the original orthography of
the type locality is listed, e.g., &quot;Ostindische&quot;. If more than
one locality is included for the species-group name and no lectotype has
been designated, all localities are treated as type localities and are separated
by an ampersand (&amp;), e.g., &quot;PA: France (Oligocene) &amp; Croatia
(Miocene) [C]&quot;. In the case of amber from the Baltic region, due to
the fact that the derivation of the amber could be from many geographical
locations within the region, the term &quot;Baltic&quot; is used.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Other distribution:</I> If localities other than the type locality (i.e.,
country) are known, they are placed after the type locality in the same
form as for type locality.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Non-fossil distribution vs. fossil distribution:</I> Distributional information
for extant forms can be distinguished from fossil distributions by the lack
of an abbreviation of taphonomy (see below) and by the order of listing
in the geographical distribution line as stated above.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Geographical equivalents used in this catalogue:</I> Political divisions
separating countries has always been a dynamic process. The Catalogue uses
the most current usage of geographical names. Some of the name changes adopted
in this catalogue include the following (this list is not meant to be an
exhaustive one for geographical equivalents):<BR><PRE>
	<B>Old Name</B>              <B>Current Name</B>

                                Yugoslavia (Serbia)</PRE>
<BR>
<B>Horizon</B>: Immediately after the geographical distribution information,
the geological horizon is listed in parentheses. If the fossil species is
known from more than one horizon or locality, the horizon is given for each
locality and stratum known. In cases where the exact age of the horizon
in which the fossil was found has not been determined, the most specific
information known is given, e.g., &quot;(Undetermined Tertiary)&quot; [for
strata known only to originate from an unspecified age within the Tertiary.]
For specimens found in media that span a number of geological strata, these
are listed, e.g., &quot;(Oligocene/Miocene)&quot; or &quot;(Paleocene/ Eocene)&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Taphonomy</B>: After the geological horizon, an abbreviation for the
method of fossil preservation is listed in square brackets. For species
found preserved in more than one medium, these are all listed separately
for each locality concerned. See list of abbreviations for the methods of
fossil preservation listed in the catalogue.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Special Notations</B>: Genus-group and species-group names that include
extant forms are prefaced by an asterisk (*). Otherwise, all listings are
known only from fossil forms.<BR>

It was a settlement which contained venus figures, dwellings made of mammoth bones, and many flint tools and bone implements. Kostenki / Kostienki is not actually a single site but really an area on the right bank of the Don River in the regions of the villages of Kostenki and Borshevo, consisting of more than twenty site locations, all dating to the Paleolithic.<br /><br /></h2><br /><br /><center><a href="images8/kostenkiview237.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/kostenkiview237sm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki view" width="868" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></center><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><center>View of the village of Kostenki from high ground above the settlement near the Don River, visible to the right of the houses.

The river would have been smaller also, since there was less precipitation, and the viewpoint would have been only a few metres in altitude above the river. Springs and seeps, which are still present in the area today, emanated from the bedrock valley wall. Their presence may account for the unusually high concentration of Upper Paleolithic sites in this part of the central East European Plain. <br /><br />A series of uplifts over the last 35&nbsp;000 years created three terraces, raising the viewpoint nearly seventy metres above the river. <br /><br /><blockquote><b>The villages of Kostenki and Borshevo are located in the Don Valley, roughly forty kilometres south of Voronezh. The western slope of the Don Valley in the vicinity of the villages and for some distance further south forms the eastern boundary of the Central Russian Upland, the eastern slope, the western boundary of the Tambov Lowland. The eastern part of the Central Russian Upland, in contrast to the Tambov Lowland, appears to have been undergoing continued uplift, and partly as a consequence, the Don Valley in the Kostenki - Borshevo region is markedly asymmetrical - the western slope is quite steep, the eastern one quite gentle.</b> <br /><br />(Klein, "Man and Culture in the Late Pleistocene", 1969) </blockquote><br /><br /><i>(Thus the Don River flows down the fault line between the uplifted Central Russian Upland and the Tambov Lowland. This fortuitous circumstance means that there developed a geological  method of preserving the evidence of habitation in this area. The uplift provided ravines and associated springs for water during winter, and also provided high ground above the river terraces which gradually covered the settlements by colluvial action, as well as successive uplifts of the land,  so that successive settlements were separated first (vertically) by colluvial sediments and secondly by the uplift, leading to the settlements being separated by (horizontal) distance as well on the three main terraces. <br /><br />Further, modern settlers found the area to be congenial, and sunk house foundations and cellars which uncovered the mammoth bones which first alerted people to the unusual nature of the area, and erosion of the ravines also provided access to evidence of previous settlements.  However the houses are scattered widely over the area, and excavations of sites can be made without greatly inconveniencing the local population, as would be the case in a large town or city. There is a good road to the region from a major city not far away, but the road does not cross the area of interest, which is serviced by a network of minor, mostly dirt roads.   The area is not under threat of flooding or other disturbance, and the area is politically stable, so long term careful explorations can be made. <br /><br />A (dateable) fall of volcanic ash conveniently delineates the oldest sediments from the younger ones. <br /><br />Archaeologists could hardly ask for more.  - Don)</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href="images24/kostenkipan1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/kostenkipan1sm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki panorama  2011" width="1000" height="259" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /></center><br clear = "all"><center><a href="images24/kostenkipan2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/kostenkipan2sm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki  2011" width="1000" height="265" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" ></a><br /><br />Kostenki Panoramas.

The site also has yielded perforated shell ornaments and a carved piece of mammoth ivory that appears to be the head of a small human figurine.<br /><br />'The big surprise here is the very early presence of modern humans in one of the coldest, driest places in Europe,' Hoffecker said. 'It is one of the last places we would have expected people from Africa to occupy first.'<br /><br />A paper by Michael Anikovich and Andrei Sinitsyn of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Hoffecker, and 13 other researchers was published in the Jan. 12 issue of Science.<br /><br />The excavation took place at Kostenki, a group of more than 20 sites along the Don River that have been under study for many decades. Kostenki previously has yielded anatomically modern human bones and artefacts dating between 30&nbsp;000 and 40&nbsp;000 years old, including the oldest firmly dated bone and ivory needles with eyelets that indicate the early inhabitants were tailoring animal furs to help them survive the harsh climate.<br /><br />Most of the stone used for making tools at the newly discovered site was imported from between 60 miles and 100 miles away, while the perforated shell ornaments discovered at the lowest levels of the Kostenki dig were imported from the Black Sea more than 300 miles away, he said. 'Although human skeletal remains in the earliest level of the excavation are confined to isolated teeth, which are notoriously difficult to assign to specific human types, the artefacts are unmistakably the work of modern humans,' Hoffecker said.<br /><br />The sediment overlying the artefacts was dated by several methods, including  optically stimulated luminescence dating  - which helps them determine how long ago materials were last exposed to daylight  - as well as palaeomagnetic dating based on known changes in the orientation and intensity of Earth's magnetic field and radiocarbon calibration.<br /><br />Anatomically modern humans are thought to have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa around 200&nbsp;000 years ago.<br /><br />Kostenki also contains evidence that modern humans were rapidly broadening their diet to include small mammals and freshwater aquatic foods, an indication they were 'remaking themselves technologically,' he said. They may have used traps and snares to catch hares and arctic foxes, exploiting large areas of the environment with relatively little energy. 'They probably set out their nets and traps and went home for lunch,' he said.<br /><br />Photo:  A.E.

As the uppermost bones of the structure lay within 0.6m of the modern ground surface, and partly within the B-horizon of the modern soil, much of layer K11-Ia was disturbed by modern tree and shrub roots and animal burrows. Nonetheless, the bones themselves were remarkably well preserved and appeared to lie largely intact and undisturbed in their original positions.<br /><br />Source and text:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Pryor et al.

Systematic investigation of Kostenki 1 was begun by I.S. Polyakov in 1879 ("Polyakov's site" is still an alternative designation for Kostenki I) and continued sporadically by a series of workers, among whom the two latest, P.P. Efimenko (working at Kostenki I in 1923, 1926, 1931-1934, and 1936) and A.N. Rogachev (working in 1938, 1948, 1951, and 1953) have contributed most to our knowledge of the site. <br /><br />Five distinct occupation horizons have been disclosed at Kostenki I. These all occur in a series of deposits overlying the second suprafloodplain terrace of the Don. The stratigraphy within these deposits has been repeatedly and intensively studied (see especially Grishchenko 1950, Lazukov 1957, and Velichko 1961: 197-212), and those of the other sites in the vicinity have been largely established (see especially Rogachev 1957:122) Recently, the application of radiocarbon dating to materials from the Kostenki sites has shown great promise of providing a substantial basis for the temporal comparison of the Kostenki occupation horizons with those from far-distant sites. Of particular relevance in the context of this note is the date of 14&nbsp;020&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;60&nbsp;BP (GIN-86, Cherdyntsev et al. 1965:1414) obtained on charred bone from the uppermost level of Kostenki I. <br /><br />By far the most extensively excavated and best-known occupation level at Kostenki I is the uppermost. In addition to presumed remains structure(s), the reconstruction of which is the subject of the paper to follow, the uppermost level has yielded a large assemblage of flint artefacts (including numerous burins, endscrapers, backed blades, shouldered points, etc), a sizeable quantity of bone artefacts (including various objects called polishers, points, mattocks etc), and a considerable collection of bone art, including approximately 50 female statuettes, mostly fragmentary, and some animal figurines. Most numerous among the faunal remains removed from the uppermost level were those of mammoth and horse, but bones of arctic fox, lion, bear, wolf, red deer, reindeer, hare, and rodents were also present. <br /><br /><p><a href="images24/kostenkimuseumpit1915.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/kostenkimuseumpit1915sm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki pit 1915" width="371" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Единственное документальное  свидетельство самых обширных дореволюционных раскопок С.А.Круковского 1915 года - разобранная им яма, всего лишь  «задевшая»  богатейший культурный слой Костенок 1.<br /><br />The only documentary evidence of the most extensive pre-revolutionary excavations by  SA Krukovsky in 1915 - the dig   managed to  just catch the edge of the richest cultural layer of Kostenki 1. <br /><br />Photo: Vladimir Gorodnjanski 2011<br />Source: Kostenki Museum</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images31/img_3672kostenkivlad.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_3672kostenkivladsm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki 11 discovery" width="442" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "25"></a><a href="images31/img_3673kostenkivlad.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_3673kostenkivladsm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki 11 discovery" width="441" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "25"></a><br />Начало планомерного исследования стоянки костенки 1. <br /><br />Раскопки П.П.

In the upper layer were preserved the remains of dwellings within an area of 35m by 15m, arranged in lines, with the hearths located along the central longitudinal axis of the dwellings, together with storage pits. Flint tools, hoes made from mammoth tusks, bone digging implements, a baton from deer horn, about forty female statuettes made from both ivory and marl/limestone, figurines of a bear, cavelion and anthropomorphous marl heads. <br /><br />Triangular flint tools are found in the lowermost layer with a concave base, retouched with a pressure process. <br /><br /><p><a href="images24/gagkostpoints.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/gagkostpointssm.jpg" alt = "Gagarino Kostienki Display" width="284" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Стоянка Костенки 1 ( Воронежская область) - Kostenki Site (Voronezh Region)<br /><br />15.

Univ. of Chicago.<br /><br />Note the alternative plan above, showing animal remains, from the source "les mammouths - DossiersArch&eacute;ologie - n&deg; 291 - Mars 2004". <br /><br />The text below is from the very useful book 'The Prehistory of Europe' 1980 by Patricia Phillips (Allen Lane)<br /><br />This  structure described by Klein comes from the loess-like loams overlying the upper humic bed in the Kostienki-Borshevo terraces. Kostienki 1, Horizon 1, was excavated in the 1930s, and reconstructed as a 'long house' 35 metres long by approximately 16 metres wide. This colossal area encompassed nine hearth pits, mostly down the centre line of the structure, and sixteen large pits around the periphery, four of them interpreted as sleeping areas and twelve as caches, full of mammoth bone.<br /><br />The rest of the floor of the supposed structure was covered with a series of little pits, again regarded as caches. Klein is not convinced by the interpretation of the structure as a single long house.  The agglomeration of features is certainly of great interest, however, as is also the presence of a series of animal figurines, and bone artifacts including possible 'head' bands with incised decoration. Six female figurines from the site were made of local limestone (marl) and ivory (Klein, 1969b) (Fig. 29). Many fragmentary remains of figurines were also found. The figurines are decorated with bands incised around the waist and above the breast. Larger bone artifacts include possible mattocks. The famous Kostienki points, which are elongated flint points with an asymmetrically placed tang, have been examined by Semenov for evidence of microwear (1964). He has concluded that they were used as knives.<br /><br />Another Kostienki site, No. IV, Horizon 1, consisted of two depressions 6 m apart and approximately 6 m in diameter, considered to represent hut floors. The original huts may have been larger as the finds distribution is wider than that of the actual depressions and extends particularly to the south-west where, it is suggested, the doorway was. The excavators believe that points with burin facets on the proximal end may have been used as whittle knives, with the burin end inserted into a handle. Other interesting finds from this site include ground slate discs 3 to 6 cm in diameter which, it is suggested, were used to retouch the flints. In addition there were dotdecorated stylized figurines in ivory, and ivory rods and bone 'clothes fasteners'. Bones from Horizons I and 11 at Kostienki IV were not separated during excavation, but it is assumed that woolly rhinoceros and cave lion at least derived from Horizon 1. As with the other Ukrainian sites previously mentioned, pits occurred in the Kostienki IV-I habitation units, the western hut containing eight pits in the centre, all under a layer of heavy grey ash. In the eastern depression, there were six ash-filled pits and others which seemed to have served as caches. Sandstone slabs around the periphery may have had something to do with the original wall structure, and <b>two cave lion crania found on the top of the deposit are suggested to have been used to crown the original tents</b>. Klein has suggested that from the calories available in the form of animals the different sites in the Kostienki-Borshevo region could have been occupied from as long as forty-three days to four years. He suggests that the sites represent longish occupation, probably during the winter.<br /><br />		East European archaeologists are particularly interested in the origin of raw materials used in Palaeolithic sites, and in the wear marks visible on the retouched tools; for instance, at the Kostienki sites, brown and yellow flint and quartzite are of local origin, but the black flint brought in as blanks is not. Petrographic analysis has proved that some of the black flint comes from approximately 150 km to the south-west, from the valleys of the Valuj and the Oskol rivers. Other black flint may come from as far as 300 km away.<br /><br /></p><br clear = "left">Kostienki I is sometimes also called Polyakovo. P P Yefimenko did some research there during 1931 to 1936, and A N Rogatchev researched during 1938. Yefimenko uncovered an oval-shaped settlement measuring 14 to 15 metres by 36 metres, where numerous tools were found in the deposits inside the dwelling, although only a few implements occurred outside. It is possible that the living room was surrounded by some kind of walls. At the edge of this settlement Yefimenko found four large pits filled with deposits, and he called them the winter hut-pits. He also found twelve smaller ones which were used to keep bones in. If the building covered the whole area, as Yefimenko assumes, the pits at the edge could then be remains of the construction. It is more likely, however, that only part of the area was covered, a fact indicated by the finds. Semi-subterranean hut-pit 'A' could be described as one of the larger dwellings. It is about 2 metres by 3.5 metres and has a small terraced passage leading to the outside. A mammoth tusk and two shoulder-blades were found here with which the entrance could be covered up. Mammoth shoulder-blades were also used in the Upper Palaeolithic to cover graves, so that it is not surprising that they were also used to build huts. A similar entrance at the back of the hut was also found; it was shorter and steeper. But this could have been some kind of light shaft.<br /><br /><p><a href="images31/img_3670kostenkivladyefimenko.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_3670kostenkivladyefimenkosm.jpg" alt = "Yefimenko" width="308" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />P.

One of them was larger and had a fireplace in the centre. The smaller circle had two layers of bones. The upper layer consisted mainly of shoulder-blades, hip-bones, and tusks of the mammoth. The lower layer, which was level with the floor of the hut, consisted mainly of tusks which were laid with the points turned inwards towards the centre of the room. They were fairly regularly spaced. This was presumably the supporting framework of the dome shaped roof which collapsed once the hut-pit was empty. The floor of the hut was approximately I metre below the ground and the top of the hut rose 0.8 to 1.0 metres.<br /><br />		These facts led Polykarpovitch to believe that these pit-huts must have been used for sleeping and somehow were kept warm: otherwise they would not have been sufficient protection against the cold. They showed no traces of typical fireplaces; one layer of coal and ash could be found and there was only a little space left around the remains of embers. It could be that the main fire was kept somewhere else and that the inhabitants collected the hot ash and bone 'coal' in rolled up animal skins and took them back to their huts and slept on them. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that no traces of stone nor large bones could be found inside the huts. Rogatchev also assumed that sick people could have been cured there. But an answer to this suggestion can only be given after further research has been carried out.<br /><br />		Along the middle of the large settlement eleven fireplaces were found. two of them a little further away, towards the edge of it. Several irregular, bowl-shaped depressions and small holes were found inside the dwelling which might have been used as storage places. Beside some of the depressions large mammoth bones had been stuck vertically into the ground. According to Yefimenko they were used as working tables or anvils, and the pits which contained numerous implements could be thought of as the working places. Rogatchev also discovered well-preserved remains of hut constructions in Kostienki-Anosovskaya with several deep store pits, where large bones were used in their construction.<br /><br />										 <br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>An alternative view of the layout of the Kostenki I house</h2>		<p><a href="images31/kostenkigrigorev.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/kostenkigrigorevsm.jpg" alt = "mammoth cut marks" width="422" height="500" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Kostenki I (uppermost level).

He discovered two kinds of settlement which he later attributed to two different cultures. He uncovered two round huts in the upper layer which were overlapping on one side with huts of the lower layer, and which presented a number of fireplaces. A loess deposit, completely sterile, separated the two layers: this loess deposit was found opposite the two round huts of the upper layer. The lower deposits also showed outlines of round huts and contained large dwellings. Rogatchev felt that the two occupation layers must have intermingled at a later date, as there were different types of dwellings as well as differences in other objects. The upper layer contained several quartz, slate, and mammoth ivory flakes, and typical burins and bifacial stone tools which were all totally absent in the lower layer.<br /><br />		The outlines of the two round huts of the upper layer were only 100 to 400 millimetres deep, and each had a bowl-shaped fireplace in the centre of the floor. Many more implements were discovered inside the hut than outside. On the northern edge of the dwelling situated to the west the thinner cultural layer did not reach far beyond the hollowed-out space of each hut. This did not happen on the southern edge where the two round huts were connected by an ochre-coloured substance. The area was sloping slightly at this particular point, and it can be assumed that the upper deposit had slipped down at a later date.<br /><br />		The hut on the western side was more interesting.  It was 400 millimetres deep towards its northern edge but only 100 millimetres on its eastern side. There the floor of the hut was on a level with the ground outside. Six enormous tusks were found inside, the larger part of a humerus bone, a lower jaw, part of a shoulder blade, and parts of the spines and ribs of mammoths At the edge of this deposit twenty large sandstone stabs and pieces of sandstone were found. They lay at the very top of this deposit. and may be considered to be building material.<br /><br /><b>Particularly interesting was the discovery of a lion's skull, found in the upper levels of the layer. Rogatchev thought that the skull might have been kept on top of the roof as a kind of decoration or that it might have had some ritual significance. Yefimenko made an interesting discovery of the skull of an aurochs in dwelling 'A' at the site of Kostienki 1, which might be a parallel.</b><br /><br />		The fireplace which was in the centre of the settlement was surrounded by about twenty holes, about 200 millimetres deep. They were probably used to store or prepare food, because pots or similar containers were unknown at this period. The tusks and bones of mammoths in the eastern dwelling were found at the bottom of the layer, not at the top. It can be assumed that they were not part of the construction (with the exception of the two tusks which were found in a somewhat higher level). The fireplace which was almost round, measured I metre in diameter, was approximately 100 millimetres deep, and slightly tilted in a westerly direction. It had a flat base and was bordered by a very small rim, only slightly protruding above the normal surface of the hut, Five medium-sized holes were found nearby, and from their position it would appear that they were of different periods. On the southern edge of the settlement a clay wall in good condition was found, it was 50 to 90 millimetres high and 400 to 500 millimetres wide. The clay was obviously deposited there when the living area was dug out and was then used either to stabilise the huts or to form a retaining border. The flat stones found at the western side must also have been used in the same way.<br /><br />		The lower layer of this site revealed two large, long dwellings. The one on the southern side was 33.5 metres by 5.5 metres and was distinguishable by the reddish colouring of its cultural layer. The other one was situated between 17 and 20 metres further north and measured 5.5 by 2.3 metres. <b>(this length and width appear to be typographical errors)</b>  The first dwelling had more than ten <b>(11 fireplaces are shown)</b> centrally placed fireplaces in it and the plan shows that there must have been three different parts which are separated from one another by steps about 100 millimetres high. The first part, to the west, was 14 metres long, the centre part was 9 metres long, and the eastern section was 10.5 metres long, and also contained the richest finds. <b>(28.6 metres by 6 metres according to the plan. This could easily be the description for 371 instead of 370)</b> The dwelling was constructed along the slope obviously to protect its shortest side against the rain and water from melting snow. All fireplaces were built along the longitudinal axis of the dwelling, and it can be assumed that the structure must have had a roof which was highest in the middle.<b>( no mention is made here of the add-on semicircular section)</b>  The roof was obviously anchored to the ground and cross-beams were connected to the ridge.<br /><br />This is also substantiated by the way in which it was found. The middle of the dwelling produced more material probably because all activities were carried out there. On the north end of the western section was a kind of passage which was obviously the only entrance and faced the valley of the Don. Most of the stone and bone flakes were found around the fireplaces which means that meals were prepared here, and tools made. All activities were obviously carried out inside the dwelling. Most of the bones found here belonged to hares; other animals are rarely found. On the north, and south-east side of the dwelling two smaller areas were found; they were not dug out, but were covered with flaked stones and bones. In the warm season people obviously used to sit outside and work.<br /><br />		The outlines of the second dwelling were clearly marked by the tool-finds. This dwelling, too, was divided into three parts and had altogether nine bowl-shaped fireplaces. There were two fireplaces in the western part, four in the central section, and three in the south-eastern part. <b>( 33.3 metres by 6 metres according to the plan. The division of the fireplaces identifies this as plan 371)</b> Three cooking pits and twenty five smaller holes were found around the fireplaces - they were 200 to 400 millimetres across and of the same depth. There were no holes outside the dwelling. Three upright mammoth flakes of long-bones were found on the western part 600 millimetres away from the edge of the dwelling, and they obviously were used to strengthen the clay wall around it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>Kostenki 8</h2><p><a href="images24/kostenki1937.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/kostenki1937sm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki 1937 dig" width="388" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />As a result   of research in the thirties,   interesting ancient structures began to be discovered. <br /><br />In this photo from 1937, the excavation of the dwelling at the Kostenki 8 archeological site is visible. <br /><br />In this photograph we can also clearly see the houses close by, and the locally sourced materials used for fencing and housing at that time. <br /><br />Photo: Vladimir Gorodnjanski 2011<br />Source: Kostenki Museum</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images24/kostenki8map.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/kostenki8mapsm.jpg" alt = "Kostenki 8 map" width="429" height="600" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Map of the Kostenki 8 site. <br /><br />The site was first excavated by AN Rogachev in 1936.

The <sup><small>14</small></sup>C date of 27&nbsp;700&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;750 is considered the upper limit of the age sets of the group, associated with higher levels of organic matter in the soil (32&nbsp;000 - 28&nbsp;000 BP).<br /><br />* It is the industry of the Telmanskaya  II layer which allows us to describe a Gravettian of Mediterranean type which has strong similarities to that of the grotte Paglicci.  This resemblance is now confirmed by the layer having a similar age (layer 23A: 28&nbsp;100&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;400 BP, layer 22F: 28&nbsp;300&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;400 BP).<br /><br />* The occupancy  level  of the Telmanskaya  II  layer  is characterised by the remains of five small settlement structures with a central hearth.<br /><br />* The lithic assemblage comprises  nearly 23&nbsp;000 objects. The technology is characterised by maximum economy of material. Given the very small size of the cores found, it is likely they were used until the end. The technique is largely the knapping of blades. The use of burins  seems particularly important here.<br /><br />* More than 2000 retouched tools   comprise 9% of the total number of worked objects. The cluster composition of the lithic industry is characterised by the preponderance  of burins (24%) over scrapers (2.5%),  by the strong dominance of backed bladelets and points  over  retouched blades  (43%). * With points very common, there are a number of specific, varied forms. This typological variety of tips, in combination with a high degree of standardisation, reflects the changed nature of the industry or at least a relative importance of the microlithic component. Tools of the sparse group of scrapers, in contrast, are characterised by the lack of standardisation.

The special character of this group is the existence of a series of objects similar to   Federmesser (<i>Federmesser means 'pen-knife' in German, and the term refers to the distinctive pointy projectile points of the culture. These points are found across lowland northwestern Europe, from France to eastern Germany</i> ) or Azilian points, associated with various points of the Gravettian. The problem of distinguishing  Federmesser and Gravettian points  was debated in the 1970s. It is important, since this variety of backed points is one of the landmarks of the lithic industry, for Kostienki 11 (II), but also for the lithic assemblies of  Kostienki 21 (III).<br /><br />Photo and text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Sinitsyn (2007)</span></a>, and extra text in italics from: http://archaeology.about.com/od/fterms/g/federmesser.htm </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images31/img_3596vlad3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_3596vlad3sm.jpg" alt = " Kostienki Display" width="425" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Kostenki 11, 22&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP<br /><br />Animal figurines, cultural layer II<br /><br />(<i>some of these are the originals of the first two rows of the drawing above&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />Photo: Vladimir Gorodnjanski, 2014<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images31/img_3597vlad3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_3597vlad3sm.jpg" alt = " Kostienki Display" width="376" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images31/img_3598vlad3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_3598vlad3sm.jpg" alt = " Kostienki Display" width="444" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Kostenki 11, 22&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP<br /><br />Animal figurines, cultural layer II<br /><br />Photo: Vladimir Gorodnjanski, 2014<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images31/img_3603vlad3text.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_3603vlad3textsm.jpg" alt = " Kostienki Display" width="318" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Geological stratigraphy of the Kostenki 11 site. <br /><br />In order: <br /><br />Modern soil<br />Stony  loam<br />"Gmelinskaya" soil<br />Ancient humus stratum<br />Volcanic ash<br />Cultural layers<br /><br />Photo: Vladimir Gorodnjanski, 2014<br />English text on photo: Don Hitchcock<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images24/kostenki11points.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/kostenki11pointssm.jpg" alt = "Gagarino Kostienki Display" width="258" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />ПЛАСТИНЫ<br />меловой  кремень <br />Костенки 11, II  слой<br />(22 тыс. лет)<br />Призматические кремневые пластины с тонкими краями служили прекрасными режущими орудиями.

Unlike reversals however, an excursion does not change the large scale orientation of the field, but rather represents a dramatic, typically short-lived decrease in field intensity. These events, which typically last a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years, often involve declines in field strength to between 0-20% of normal.</i><br /><br />At least two types of assemblages are foundbelow the CI tephra. At Kostenki 14, thelowermost occupation level (Layer IVb) containsprismatic blade cores, bladelets, end-scrapers,burins, pièces ésquillées, and small bifaces.<br /><br />Nonstone artifacts include bone points, antlermattocks, worked ivory, and perforated shellornaments. One carved piece of ivoryappears to represent the head of an (unfinished)human figurine. At Kostenki 17,Layer II yielded large prismatic blades, numerousburins, end-scrapers, and some pièces ésquillées.Ornaments of stone were perforated with a hand-operatedrotary drill. Nonstone items includebone points and awls and some worked ivory.These assemblages are associated with large numbersof small and medium mammal remains—especially hare (<i>Lepus tanaiticus</i>), arctic fox(<i>Alopex lagopus</i>), and wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>)—andsome bird remains.

No burial goods were present, but the associated cultural layer contained Early Upper Paleolithic (Aurignacian) tools – blades, scrapers, burins, etc. – as well as animal bones (mainly those of wild horses).<br /><br /><p><a href="images11/kostenki14dig.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images11/kostenki14digsm.jpg" alt = "kostenki 14" width="173" height="267" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br /><br /> <br /><br />M.M. Gerasimov with his colleagues in archeology during the excavations at Kostenki XIV (Markina Gora) in the 1950s.  </p><br /><br clear = "all"><br />The Markina Gora skeleton was examined by G.F. Debetz, who estimated the individual’s age at 20-25. The man was rather low-statured (about 160 cm). The morphology of his skeleton is generally quite modern. Certain cranial features, including very narrow braincase, low and narrow face, marked prognathism (anterior protrusion of the midface), and very wide nose, are typical of tropical populations. The trait combination links the cranium with those of Papuans and Melanesians.<br /><br />Certain other Upper Paleolithic crania from Europe, too, display “tropical” features. Bodily proportions of Early Upper Paleolithic people reveal southern characteristics as well. This also concerns the arm proportions of the Markina Gora individual, whose forearm was relatively long compared to the shoulder.<br /><br />The meaning of those facts is yet unclear. Modern geographic human groups (so called “races”) had not completely formed by the Upper Paleolithic, and some of their characteristics may have incidentally appeared in various parts of the world. On the other hand, tropical features may indicate that anatomically modern humans had migrated to Europe from the south, specifically from Africa. Genetic data favor such possibility.<br /><br />The situation is further complicated by the fact that the supposedly Upper Paleolithic age of the burial has not been proven by absolute (radiocarbon) dating methods. The burial may actually be rather recent and unrelated to the enclosing cultural layer. If so, the appearance of the Markina Gora individual is even more difficult to explain.<br /><br />M.M. Gerasimov, like G.F. Debetz, believed that people of such appearance or their direct ancestors had actually migrated to Europe in the early Upper Paleolithic from areas lying far south. Therefore he endowed the reconstructed individual with tropical characteristics including curly hair. The future will hopefully show whether or not this “artistic liberty” of the scientist and sculptor was warranted. <br /><br /></blockquote> <p><a href="images8/kostenkilecture.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/kostenkilecturesm.jpg" alt = "archaeology lecture" width="267" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>  <a href="images8/kostenkidig3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/kostenkidig3sm.jpg" alt = "archaeology lecture" width="267" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>  </p><br /><br clear = "all"> <p> <a href="images8/kostenkidig4.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/kostenkidig4sm.jpg" alt = "archaeology lecture" width="150" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <a href="images8/kostenki6.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/kostenki6sm.jpg" alt = "archaeology lecture" width="267" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /> Well known archaeologist Andrey Alekseevich Velichko gives a lecture on the actual site of Kostenki 14.<br /><br />The holes in the walls of the excavation have been made to take samples for analysis. <br /><br />Photos: http://www.trinitas.ru/rus/doc/0211/008a/02111056.htm</p><br /><br clear = "all"> <p><a href="images8/kostenkidig2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/kostenkidig2sm.jpg" alt = "kostenki dig" width="267" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>  <br /><br /><br /> There is a lot of hard work, with little result, when working on an archaeological site.

The Kostenki site has been known for quite a while (it is best known for the recovery of Venus figurines from its Gravettian levels), and its uniqueness has not gone unnoticed. <br /><br />The occupations at Kostenki include several Late Early Upper Paleolithic levels, dated ca 40&nbsp;000 to 30&nbsp;000 calibrated years ago. Below these levels is a layer of volcanic ash, associated with the volcanic eruptions of the Phlegrean Fields of Italy (aka Campanian Ignimbrite), which are thought to have erupted between about 38&nbsp;000 and 40&nbsp;000 years ago. Within and below the ash level (called the CI Tephra) is what archaeologists are calling "Aurignacian Dufour," containing numerous small bladelets and related to similar sites in western Europe. <br /><br />Typically, the Aurignacian is the oldest component associated with modern humans at archaeological sites in Europe, underlain by Mousterian-like deposits representing Neanderthals. At Kostenki, a previously unidentified assemblage, exhibiting a sophisticated tool kit of prismatic blades, burins, bone antler, and ivory artifacts, and small perforated shell ornaments underlies the CI Tephra and Aurignacian Dufour assemblage. That the location includesthe use of traps to catch small mammals such as hares, reinforces the view that stone age humans used technology and innovation to expand into new areas.<br /><br />Photo and text: http://archaeology.about.com/od/earlymansites/a/kostenki.htm<br />Science &copy; 2007</p><br clear = "all"><b>Humans or Neanderthals?</b><br /><br /><p><img src="images8/kostenki14excavation2.jpg" alt = "kostenki excavations" width="450" height="375" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"><br />Kostenki 14 excavations in 2002.<br /><br />No skeletal remains have been found to date in these levels at Kostenki, except for isolated teeth, which appear to be modern human.

Boriskovskii discovered two archaeological layers: the stratigraphically higher Layer I, positioned in the UHB; and the underlying and archaeologically richer Layer II, found in the top of the LHB, ~6 m below the modern-day surface. <br /><br /> Layer II was stratigraphically separated from Layer I by ~3 m of archaeologically sterile deposits. Within these sterile deposits, roughly halfway between Layers I and II, was a layer containing lenses of volcanic ash. Boriskovskii excavated Layer II over an area of 60 m2. Small areas of the archaeological layer or contemporary deposits have been excavated since then, most recently in 2017e2018 by one of us. However, Boriskovskii's collection still constitutes ~90% of the archaeological material excavated from this layer. <br /><br /> Finds in Layer II were generally limited to a gently sloping 20-30 cm thick horizon. Boriskovskii  and Velichko  both considered the layer's contents to be mostly in situ, and subject to only minor downslope redeposition. The layer's lithic assemblage appeared unrolled and unweathered, and contained very small chips as well as larger pieces. In some places the layer was stained with red ochre, and concentrations of charcoal and ash in the NE and SW corners were interpreted as remnants of two hearths >1 m in diameter, around which lay concentrations of archaeological material. <br /><br /> In the central part of the trench were horse vertebrae and limb bones in anatomical position. Boriskovskii recovered a large lithic assemblage of ~10&nbsp;000 pieces, as well as a modest osseous tool assemblage of two awls made from arctic fox (or hare) ulnae and several fragmentary bone/ivory objects. The abundance of archaeological material within a relatively small excavated area led Boriskovskii   to interpret the layer as evidence for a long-term settlement.<br /><br /> Given the assemblage's size it may well represent a palimpsest of multiple phases of activity. Boriskovskii also found pendants made from fossil shells, carved stone and belemnites, along with a group of 37 fox canines perforated by rotary biconical drilling. The faunal assemblage comprised wolf, mammoth, horse, reindeer, bison and wolverine, with arctic fox represented by 37 pendants. A single human molar found in the layer was tentatively attributed to Homo sapiens, but it has never been the subject of complete study and for some researchers it is undiagnostic. <br /><br /> </blockquote>Text above: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Dinnis et al.

There is a clear mutual exclusion between the types of backed points found in the northern and southern groups (Anosovka points only in the former, small shouldered points only in the latter) which has been previously noted and is confirmed by our work. The faunal assemblage from Kostënki 21/III provides some surprising insights into the behaviour of late MUP hunter–gatherer groups in Eastern Europe. <br /><br />The remains from the southern complexes provide evidence for the systematic exploitation of hares and for hunting of mammoth, with a particular focus on juvenile mammoth. Canids were likely used for their skins. In the northern complexes, there seems to have been more emphasis on the hunting of adult mammoths, while the canid remains provide evidence for both skinning and consumption. Hare was absent or near-absent in the assemblage from the northern complexes.<br />Overall, however, a wider range of species is represented in the northern complexes than the southern. At both the northern and southern complexes, there is evidence for preferential transport of mammoth head and foot parts to the site. The canid remains at the site vary in size: one of those found in the southern complexes is “dog-like in size”. The range of ages of juvenile mammoths represented at the southern complexes suggests that activity took place at this part of the site during both spring/early summer and autumn/ early winter. In the northern complexes, a more restricted period of human presence is attested: spring/early summer only.</blockquote>Text above: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Reynolds et al.

The twentieth centuryexcavations extended for circa 160 m along the river bank, and more than 510 m<sup><small>2</small></sup> was excavated in total by the early 1980s.  Due to active erosion by the Don, the excavations were carried out as rescue excavations. Further limited rescue excavations were carried out in 2013–2016, led by A. A. Bessudnov. The richest and most extensive archaeological layer is the lowermost layer, now known as layer III, which was the first to be recognised. Around 35&nbsp;000&nbsp;–&nbsp;36&nbsp;000 lithic artefacts were attributed to this layer during the twentieth-century excavations of the site.  <br /><br />Photo and text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Reynolds et al.

The deposits that collect at the foot of a steep slope or cliff are also known by the same name. Colluvium often interfingers with alluvium (deposits transported downslope by water). Coarse deposits due to rockfall at a cliff base are called talus (scree) and if lithified are talus breccias. Avalanches, mudslides and landslides are processes that deposit colluvium. This build-up process is called colluviation.<br /><br />Colluvium normally forms humps at the base of mountains or fan-shaped deposits similar in shape to alluvial fans that cover former ground surfaces. This process is an important phenomenon in the fields of archaeology and soil science.<br /><br />Many colluvial soils tend to have a fragipan associated with them that are a brittle subsoil layer typically high in clay. One theory of fragipan formation is the smearing of soil during the colluvial process causing the clays to seal the surface between the moving portion of soil and the stationary soil on which it slides. Ancient sites can be preserved beneath colluvium if later changes in the landscape such as deforestation encourage a downward movement of material.<br /><br /><center><img src="images8/kostenkixsectiondon.gif" alt = "Kostenki map" width="1068" height="541" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></center><center><img src="images8/crosssectionkostenkitext.gif" alt = "Kostenki map text" width="1120" height="129" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></center><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p>This is an imaginary cross section through the various Kostenki - Borshevo sites to illustrate the typical positions of the sites in relation to the topography and geology. <br /><br /><ol type="1" start="1">	<li>low and high flood-lands; alluvial - dealluvial <i>(?colluvial?)</i> sediments on the  valley wall </li><li>the first terrace above the flood plain</li> 	<li>the second terrace above the flood plain</li> 	<li>the third terrace above the flood plain, on the right bank of the Don River</li> 	<li>the third terrace above the flood plain, on the left bank of the Don River, blocked (?) wind blown sand</li> 	<li>frozen subsidence saucers and hollows</li> 	<li>the fourth terrace (alluvial and fluvioglacial sediments)</li> 	<li>glacial edge of the Don  (moraine)</li> 	<li>sediment base before quaternary sediments</li> 	<li>modern eroded gullies</li> 	<li>hillside adjournment (?)</li> 	<li>wind deposits</li> 	<li>late palaeolithic deposits</li> 	<li>volcanic ash deposits</li> 		</ol><br />Photo: Archaeology of the USSR - The Palaeolithic of the USSR.<br /><br />My thanks to Vladimir Gorodnjanski for access to this resource. <br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images24/campanianignimbrite.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/campanianignimbritesm.jpg" alt = "Map of Campanian Ignimbrite" width="881" height="500" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Map of Campanian Ignimbrite. <br /><br />Key sites with hominin remains around the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition, and sites associated with the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) marker horizon.

Recent work in the north-eastern Aegean and in south-western Russia confirms that a considerable portion of the Y5 ash was dispersed towards the North and East during this eruption, with fine-grained tephra deposited more than 2500 km from the known source region. In the Don River region of south-west Russia, deposits that are correlated with Y5 on the basis of detailed chemical analysis are found both in well-characterised archaeological contexts (the Paleolithic sites of Kostenki-Borschevo), and in undisturbed geological contexts nearby.

Chabai in his paper entitled "The chronological and industrial variability of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in eastern Europe" which may be found at www.ipa.min-cultura.pt/pubs/TA/folder/33/070-087.pdfStreletskaya cultureThe Streletskaya assemblages (Fig. 4) belong to the Kostenki Ancient ChronologicalGroup, which is dated to between 36 000 and 32 000 BP, and to the Kostenki MiddleChronological Group, which is dated to between 32 000 and 27 000 BP (Sinitsyn et al., 1997).There is some evidence for a stratigraphic correlation of Streletskaya and other Kostenki EUPassemblages. Streletskaya assemblages always underlie Gorodtsovskaya and Aurignacianassemblages. At Kostenki 12, the Streletskaya assemblages were found in layers III and Ia,while the Gorodtsovskaya industry was identified in the uppermost layer I (Rogachev andAnikovich, 1982c). At Kostenki 1, the Streletskaya assemblage was found in the lowermostlayer V, while an Aurignacian assemblage was found in layer III (Rogachev et al., 1982).The technology of the Streletskaya industry was based on the production of thinbifaces, biconvex in cross-section, and on cores with discoidal and parallel, non-volumetricflaking surfaces (Rogachev and Anikovich, 1984; Bradley et al., 1995). The tool-kit consistsof bifacial triangular points with concave bases (Fig. 4, no. 17-21), bifacial triangular micro-points with concave bases (Fig. 4, no. 16), bifacial leaf-shaped points, bifacial knives witha single retouched edge made on flint plaquettes (Fig. 4, no. 20), as well as endscrapers onflakes with expanding retouched edges and thinned bases (Fig. 4, no. 18-19, 22-23). Thenumbers of bifaces and endscrapers are approximately equal. Together, bifacial tools andendscrapers account for about 60% of tools. Other tool-types, especially burins, are rare.Also, there is a small Middle Paleolithic component: Mousterian points and sidescrapers(Rogachev and Anikovich, 1982a, 1982b, 1982c). At the same time, according to E. Giria,the so-called Middle Paleolithic bifacial tools are, in fact, unfinished thin triangular and foliatebifaces. That is, in this view, there was no Middle Paleolithic and/or transitional technologyin the Streletskaya culture assemblages (Giria, 1999).There are some parallels between the technology of bifacial tool production in theStreletskaya culture assemblages and the Buran-Kaya III, level C, assemblage (Marksand Monigal, 2000). Also, the technology of the Buran-Kaya trapezoids (Fig. 4, no. 8-15)resembles to some extent the Streletskaya micropoints (Fig. 4, no. 16) (Chabai, 2000b).There are no bone tools in Streletskaya culture assemblages, and no human remainshave been found in association with this culture.Spitsynskaya cultureThe Spitsynskaya assemblage occurs in the Kostenki Ancient Chronological Group,36 000 to 32 000 BP (Sinitsyn et al., 1997). This assemblage was found at Kostenki 17, LayerII (Boriskovski et al., 1982). The typological definition of Kostenki 12, Layer II, is not clear(Rogachev and Anikovich, 1982c). If it is really associated with the Spitsynskaya culture,it might be the only evidence of a stratigraphic correlation with the Streletskaya culture:Kostenki 12, Layer II, is situated stratigraphically between the Streletskaya assemblagesfound in Layers III and Ia.The only technology recognized for the Spitsynskaya culture is the production ofblades based on the exploitation of parallel-prismatic single (Fig. 5, no. 13) and double platformcores with volumetric flaking surfaces.The endscrapers (3-7% of the total tool number) are represented by ovoid pieces, madeon flakes with retouched edges (Fig. 5, no. 3-4), and by simple endscrapers on blades (Fig. 5,no. 1-2). Burins are the main class of tools (about 48% of the tool-kit). There are burins onoblique truncations (Fig. 5, no. 6, 8-9, 12), double opposed burins on oblique truncations orparallelograms (Fig. 5, no. 5, 7), according to P. Boriskovski, dihedral burins (Fig. 5, no. 10)and angle burins. The majority of burins were made on oblique truncations (Boriskovski etal., 1982). There are some scaled pieces (about 5%) as well as a few non-geometric microliths(four, about 1.2% of the tools, three of them backed microblades and/or bladelets). The restof the tools are represented by a few pointed blades and simple retouch flakes and blades.Bone and ivory tools are characterized by awls made on hare or arctic fox humeri (Fig.5, no. 21). Also, there are fragments of bone points and fragments of worked mammoth tusk(Fig. 5, no. 22).Personal adornments are represented by pendants made on arctic fox teeth, stone,belemnite, shells, and fossil corals (Fig. 5, no. 14-19). According to S. A. Semenov, theholes in the teeth and stone were made by drilling, but without any indication of a bow drill(Boriskovski et al., 1982, p. 186).The only human remain is a third left molar which is anatomically modern(Boriskovski et al., 1982, p. 186).77Gorodtsovskaya cultureThe assemblages of the Gorodtsovskaya culture fall into the Kostenki Middle ChronologicalGroup, which is dated to between about 32 000 and 27 000 BP (Fig. 6) (Sinitsyn etal., 1997).Primary flaking technology of both flakes and blades was based on unsystematic andparallel cores. The latter usually exhibit a volumetric flaking surface. Bifacial tools are rareand not standardized (Rogachev and Sinitsyn, 1982a, 1982b; Sinitsyn, 1996).Endscrapers are the dominant class of tools (about 45%). The shapes of endscrapersand their methods of elaboration vary considerably. In general, endscrapers have been subdividedinto those with parallel edges (Fig. 6, no. 7-9), and those with expanding edges (Fig.6, no. 2-6, 10), The endscrapers with expanding edges tend to be fan-shaped. The endscraperswith parallel edges were made on blades and elongated flakes, while the endscraperswith expanded edges were made on flakes. The most common type of endscraperswith parallel edges is a thick endscraper with edges modified by abrupt scalar retouch(Fig. 6, no. 7-8). The most specific type is the fan-shaped endscraper, often with a pointedbase (Fig. 6, no. 2-4, 6) and different kinds of ventral thinning. Also, double endscraperswith retouched lateral edges are common. According to A. N. Rogachev and A. A. Sinitsyn,these are morphologically close to limaces (Fig. 6, no. 1), which are also present in theGorodtsovskaya assemblages. Scaled pieces are common (about 28%) and represented bya relatively wide variety of shapes (Fig. 6, no. 12-19). Burins are rare (Rogachev and Sinitsyn,1982a, 1982b; Sinitsyn, 1996).Middle Paleolithic type tools (about 20%) include sidescrapers, transversal scrapers,canted and double canted scrapers (Fig. 6, no. 21), convergent scrapers (Fig. 6, no. 11), points(Fig. 6, no. 20, 25) and limaces (Fig. 6, no. 1). Convergent scrapers and points often exhibitdifferent kinds of ventral thinning (Fig. 6, no. 20). Bifacial tools are rare (Fig. 6, no. 22). Atthe same time, A. Sinitsyn noted that Mousterian tools have the same kind of retouch andwere made in the same way as other unquestionably Upper Paleolithic types of tools (Sinitsyn,1996, p. 283).The bone and ivory tool assemblage is characterized by a striking variety of shapes:shovels with nail-like heads made on mammoth long bones (Fig. 7, no. 7, 21-22); pointsof different types, including needle-like ones (Fig. 7, no. 8-15). The shafts of the shovels (Fig.7, no. 7), the bone points (Fig. 7, no. 12) and the bone tube fragments (Fig. 7, no. 17-19) weredecorated with complex bands of geometric incisions. Also, there are some bone retouchers(Fig. 7, no. 16) and polishers (Fig. 7, no. 20) (Rogachev and Sinitsyn, 1982a, 1982b;Sinitsyn, 1996). Three types of pendants are known: decorated bird bones (Fig. 7, no. 6),as well as stone and bone items (Fig. 7, no. 1-5) with drilled holes.Two burials and one dwelling structure were found in association with theGorodtsovskaya culture: the burial at Kostenki 15 and, probably, that at Kostenki 14. AtKostenki 15, the burial was in a dwelling area: a 6-7 year old boy was buried in a sitting position.Some bone and stone artifacts were associated with this burial (Rogachev and Sinitsyn,1982). The burial at Kostenki 14 was found below layer III, but its association with thelayer III living floor is not clear. The burial contained a 25 year old male buried in awrithing position. Probably, he was tied. In spite of a number of speculations about itsracial type, both are clearly modern humans (Gerasimova, 1982).79THE CHRONOLOGICAL AND INDUSTRIAL VARIABILITY OF THE MIDDLE TO UPPER PALEOLITHIC TRANSITION IN EASTERN EUROPEThe Aurignacian in the middle Don Valley at Kostienki 1, layer III, is dated to about25 000 BP (Fig. 8). Placing it into the Kostenki Middle Chronological Group (Sinitsyn et al.,1997) is more a reflection of traditional views on the regional chronology at Kostenki-Borschevo than a reflection of its genuine age. In the Kostienki 1 stratigraphic sequence, theAurignacian assemblage is situated above the Streletskaya (layer V) industry.The Aurignacian assemblage at Kostienki 1, layer III, is based on a microblade technology.The cores for these microblades account for about 50% of all cores. The most commontool-types are Dufour (Fig. 8, no. 29-32) and pseudo-Dufour microblades (Fig. 8, no. 27):about 50% of the tool-kit. Also, a number of Krems points (Fig. 8, no. 24, 26-28) are knownfrom this assemblage. The endscrapers represent about 20% of the tool assemblage. Onethird of them are thick, including carinated (Fig. 8, no. 34) and shouldered (Fig. 8, no. 37)examples. Burins exceed 10% of all tools. The most common types of burins are on angleand on truncation. Carinated burins (Fig. 8, no. 33, 36) are not numerous. There are a fewpoints on blades and a number of retouched flakes and blades, including one with Aurignacianretouch (Fig. 8, no. 38) (Hahn, 1977; Rogachev et al., 1982).The bone and ivory tools include bone awls, points (Fig. 8, no. 35) and rods made onmammoth tusk fragments. Fragments of bone points decorated with parallel scratcheswere also found. Personal ornaments consist of perforated shells and fox teeth, as well asrods decorated with transversal parallel incisions.No human remains have been found in association with the Kostienki 1, layer III, Aurignacian.--><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />From:  N.D.&nbsp;Praslov et al, 'The Steppes in the Late Palaeolithic'<br /><br />Although a location close to a source of drinking water seems to have been a desideratum in each case, the strategy for positioning the settlement site seems to have been different. Mammoth hunters arranged their permanent settlements in low areas of dissected relief on the first and second terraces within river valleys, near brooks and ravines, e.g. Kostenki, Mezin; on the other hand specialist bison-hunters and the hunters of other gregarious animals preferred to settle in elevated areas with a good view, shown by the plateau sites of Amvrosievka, Zolotovka and Anetovka. <br /><br /> Late Palaeolithic sites excavated over the past decades provide good examples of cultural adaptations both in terms of general traits and in detail. Mammoth-hunters often used large mammoth bones for building purposes. There were many cases when mammoth long bones were used to stabilize the bases of dwellings (see photo below)  in contact with the earth, in preference to wood which rots quickly (particularly in conditions of variable humidity). Cleaved transversally and dug into the ground, sometimes fixed in place with chips of bones or stones, they served as sockets into which wooden poles were inserted, at Kostenki 4, Kostenki 19, etc.<i> <br /><br />(Note: this is a method of ensuring that wooden poles for houses or other structures have a much longer life. Normally wood rots quickly in moist ground. The builders cut across the mammoth bones, which exposed the hollow centre of the bone. The bone was then dug into the ground and locked into position with rammed  stones and bone chips around it, but the pole was inserted into the hollow centre of the bone, above ground level. It was thus not exposed to the fungi and wood rotting organisms such as  insects and other invertebrates which otherwise destroy organic material such as wood in a few years. A similar method is used today to preserve vertical wooden supports for such things as carports, but steel stirrups are used to raise the wooden posts above the (usually concreted) ground level.  - Don)</i><br /><br />Tusks were used in the construction of roofs above subterranean dwellings at Kostenki I. Understandably, no such examples are found in the southern zone, as there are no mammoth remains in that area and bones of bison or horses are unsuited for such purposes. <br /><br /><center><img src="clickphotos/kostenkibones.jpg" alt = "kostenkibones.jpg" width="298" height="450"></center><br /><center>Excavation of mammoth long bones at Kostenki I</center><br /><center>Photo: N.D. Praslov</center><br /><br />The structure of settlements and the 'regular' planning of dwellings in view of the relief shows how well adapted Late Palaeolithic hunters were. For instance, at Kostenki 4 long dwellings were arranged on a slope in such a position as to allow for water run-off along the long walls during the snow melt. <br /><br />Of particular interest are the stone pavements found at sites of totally different cultures, situated in different landscape zones far from one another. Kostenki 21 is situated in the area of the Middle Don, whereas Muralovka lies on the right bank of the Mius liman (a brackish salt-water lagoon)  not far from Taganrog. Both these settlements were situated near water sources, Kostenki 21 near a brook mouth, Muralovka on a bank of a liman (<i>shallow lake - Don </i>).<br /><br />Text above from:  N.D.&nbsp;Praslov et al, 'The Steppes in the Late Palaeolithic'<br /><br /><p><a href="images25/borschevo5.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images25/borschevo5sm.jpg" alt = "Borschevo 5 tools" width="504" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This tool industry of the Gravettian Borschevo - Kostienki region is characterised by high proportions of backed bladelets  sometimes truncated at both ends (forming rectangles).

They prepared berries, grains of wild cereals, young wild plants, dug up edible roots, and even supplemented the diet with fresh-water molluscs.<br /><br />Found at the sites are  many  stone implements used for cutting up and grinding of vegetable food. They are found especially at  Kostenki 1.<br /><br />At the very end of the paleolithic people increasingly began using fishing even though they did not yet use hooks or nets. <br /><br />Catching of a fish was conducted by the most elementary ways during the periods spawning when fish, becoming careless, gathered in shallow water, where they could be speared or harpooned.  <br /><br />Fish bones have been found at Kostenki 8. <br /><br />Despite the increasing importance of collecting, hunting at this time was still the basis of the economy of palaeolithic communities, it defined their development, social system and spiritual life. <br /><br />Only on the Don River are so many different types of buildings represented. <br /><br />At Kostenki 1, huge dwellings up to 31 metres long and 8 metres wide, with many hearths and with many dug pantries were found, and at Kostenki 4 the top layer had a long dwelling with a living area of 187 square metres. <br /><br />As well as these longitudinal plan dwellings, there were a  number of round dwellings (constructed of bone and earth) as well, especially at Kostenki 2 and 11. <br /><br /> On a number of other sites,  the dwellings were of an elementary type resembling tepees or wigwams, but surprisingly for such portable dwellings, there was a great accumulation at these sites of cultural artefacts, as though they were used for long periods of time in this one place.  <br /><br />On the  bottom cultural layer of Kostenki 4 are found round dwellings with a diameter of 6 metres, slightly dug into the ground, with one fireplace in the centre and with an extension providing a type of inner porch. <br /><br />In the construction of these larger semi subterranean dwellings, mammoth bones were widely used, and preference was given to tusks, skulls and shoulders of the animals. They were driven into the ground or stacked like a woodpile to provide the basis for the walls of the dwellings. As well, skins, wood and earth were used for building.   <br /><br />  It is difficult to imagine in such a remote northern area, but the people of Kostenki had a gregarious way of life, where severe conditions demanded adaptation to the environment, sustained  by hunting for animals which themselves were gregarious. <br /><br /> Cooperation was needed for both hunting these large animals, and in building these large shelters. It predetermined a settled way of life for human societies. Collecting was limited by the foods available within a limited territory, and a division of labour was probably necessary, possibly based on age and sex, as well as the size of the particular group. Adult men were probably engaged in hunting, the manufacture of stone and bone implements, and the construction of dwellings as well as the processing of large animals, those occupations which demanded greater physical strength.  <br /><br />  <!--Group of settlements (from above 20) late on right I protect Don, to from Voronezh, in territory of two next villages - Kostenkis and Borshovo . Are opened{open} by I.S.Poljakovym in 1879. The basic excavation were spent in 20-30- 20 century Items Efimenko, in 40-60- - by A.N.Rogatchyov. Researches K.B.s. have played the important role in development of a modern technique of excavation of paleolithic settlements, in development of problems of paleolithic dwellings, female images, a periodization of a late paleolith, in allocation late palaeolithic cultures and an establishment of their mutual relations. The part of sites contained on some cultural layers concerning different stages and cultures of a late paleolith. The major site and finds: Kostenkis I (site Poljakov), contained 5 cultural layers. In top the rests of ground dwelling (the area 35  15 with the centers located on a longitudinal axis, numerous dugouts and economic holes were kept. Finds: Silicon tips, mattocks from a tusk of the mammoth, bone spade, a staff from cervine horns, about 40 female figurines from a tusk of the mammoth and from marl, figures of a bear, a cave lion and antroph-amorphous heads from marl. Triangular silicon tips are found In the lowermost layer with the concave basis, carefully processed by a squeezing retouch. On site Kostenkis II (site Zamjatin) are opened the rests of the mammoth of dwelling built from large bones (7  8 m) with the fireplace in the center; the dwelling was adjoined with the funeral chamber from bones of the mammoth with a burial place (in a sitting position) Cro-Magnon man On parking Kostenkis IV (Aleksandrovka) in top of two cultural layers were kept the rests of two round dwellings about 6 m in a diameter with the fireplace in the center of everyone; among finds - grinded, the drilled disks from slate. In the bottom layer the rests of two extended dwellings (by length 34 and 23 m, width 5,5) with the on a long axis are opened{open}. Kostenkis VIII (Telmanskaja site) contained 4 cultural layers. In top the rests of the round dwelling profound in the ground about 5,5 m in a diameter with the fireplace in the center are opened{open}; among finds - silicon leaf-like the tips processed by a squeezing retouch. The fragments of human bones partially burnt, silicon stock are found in 2-nd layer - tiny a plate and needle-shaped edges. Kostenkis XI (Anosovka II) contained not less than 5 cultural layers. In top the rests of the mammoth of the rounded dwelling built from large bones about 9 m in a diameter are found out. In the bottom layers finds of the triangular silicon tips similar found in bottom layer Kostenki I are interesting. Kostenkis XIV (Markin the mountain) contained 4 cultural layers. In 3-rd - openly writhed painted burial of the man with the some people Negroid attributes. On Kostenkis XV (Gorodcovskaja site) the painted burial of the child (about 6 years), reminding Czechoslovakia Cro-Magnon man is revealed; At him there were silicon and bone instruments, over 150 drilled teeth of Arctic fox. Site Borshovo II contained 3 cultural layers describing the end of a late paleolith and transition to mesolite. In top (the rests of a temporary settlement of hunters on horses) already were absent bones of the mammoth though there were bones of a reindeer.

The latter source produces magnificent chocolate-coloured flint. All these sites have deep extraction shafts and shallower pits. In the Polish Late Palaeolithic (Swiderian) the flint extracted was initially worked near by, e.g. at the site of GoJac. Then pre-cores, initial cores and blank blades were exported. There is a vast distribution of chocolate flint, presumably coming from the Radom mines, along the River Vistula. Away from the source sites there is a greater concentration of artifacts and less flintworking debris than in the workshops near the mines. Kozlowski has studied the distribution of flint types in eastern Europe <i>(as in the accompanying diagram)</i> In the western part of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Upper Palaeolithic peoples used a majority of Upper Silesian flint (76-87 per cent in Moravia), with some radiolarite coming from the Carpathians or the Alps in second place. In eastern Slovakia and east Hungary, the dominant material used was the local obsidian and in the Dneister and Punt valleys local Cretaceous flint. Kozlowski has suggested intergroup ownership of source areas, or early barter, as an explanation for distribution patterns of flint and other materials. He suggests that these trade routes began in the Paudorf interstadial, i.e. from approximately 30&nbsp;000 years B.P. One route led from the Danube to the Morava to the Oder, and another from the Dniester to the east Carpathian passes, and thence to the Carpathian basins.<br /><br /></p><br /><br /><br clear = "left"><br /><br /><center><img src="clickphotos/fireplace.jpg" alt = "fireplace" width="429" height="300"></center>This is a plan of an unusual fireplace at Kostienki.

There would have been choking dust at times, from the rock flour ground out by the ice sheet and glaciers not far to the north, and carried by winds to be deposited over the whole area, forming deep beds of loess. <br /><br />Photo: Vladimir Gorodnjanski<br /><br />Source: Display, Voronezh Museum</center><hr>the quote below is from:<br />"The Russian Dig" by: Andrea Elyse Messer (Research/Penn State, Vol. 17, no. 1 (March, 1996))<br /><br /> The landscape was amazing. Miles of gently rolling fields filled with wild flowers and herbs. As we walked, the smell of dill, mint, and marjoram was strong. At the terminal moraine, the furthest reach of the glaciers, the ground stretched out a series of very thin fingers above a drop of hundreds of feet. The archaeologists keep a small section of the edge of one finger clear of vegetation so that, standing across on another finger, we could see the sediment layers clearly: The 28&nbsp;000-year-old layer, from which we would be excavating human artifacts and evidence of habitations (Americans can claim human occupation only back to 12,000 or perhaps 14,000 years ago). And two other layers beneath, the earliest dating to about 35,000 before present. <br /><br /><hr><br /><br />the quote below is from:<br />http://www.zin.ru/annrep/2000/14.html<br /><br />As a result of archaeological excavations in Late Palaeolithic sites in Kostenki village in Voronezhskaya Oblast vast paleontological material has been accumulated comprising more than 50&nbsp;000 bones of different mammal species of which more than 10&nbsp;000 belong to the mammoth. Fossil bones collected were characterized by poor state of preservation, and therefore only 497 specimens were used for measurements during the period from 1977 through 1989. .............<br /><br />Length of numerous tusks in Kostenki in Voronezhskaya Oblast varied from 18 cm to 3 m. Female tusks were 40-95 mm in diameter, on the average 81.3 mm (n=22). Their circumference varied from 130 to 300 mm, on the average 235.73 mm. Tusks ascribed to males were 97-195 mm in diameter on the average 140.2 mm (n=48) with circumference of 310-615 mm on the average 440.22 mm. <hr><br /><br />the quote below is from:<br />http://www.alekseevmanuscript.com/ChapterIV.html<br /><br />Kostenki is located in the Don River Basin near the Sea of Azov. It is a small village surrounded by hills and dry valleys, ideal for hunting. At the site of Kostenki, both stone and bone tools have been found as well as stone and bone sculptures. Alexander Marshack interprets decorations found on bone pieces as astrological calculations. Bone female figurines also have been found; these are similar to those found in Willendorf, Austria and are examples of Kostenki art. Here at Kostenki there is also evidence of houses. <br /><br />Both Kostenki II and Kostenki XIV produced burials of Upper Paleolithic man. Skeletal remains from Kostenki II are of an adult male, tall, and approximately fifty years of age. Reconstruction of the head reveals a broad face and narrow brow. The head from Kostenki XIV is the best preserved; no bones were destroyed except for the end of the nasal bone which had been crushed by the investigator. Reconstruction reflects a very strong adult individual with a combination of morphological features. The nose is very broad, similar to African or Australian. This strong development around the nose is not typical for Europoid but is similar to East African populations; however, Negroid nasal bones are flat while Kostenki XIV is strong. This find is a combination of features whose origin is different from other groups.<br /><br />Thus, at Kostenki, we have both stone and bone tools and sculptures as well as houses, female figurines similar the "Venus of Willendorf", and the remains of Upper Paleolithic man. From Kostenki II we have a broad head and narrow brow and from Kostenki XIV we have a tall adult exhibiting a combination of strong physical features which differ from typical Europoid.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />The quotes below are from: The Pictorial Encyclopedia of The Evolution of Man<br /><br />J.

Both areas belong to the loess regions which bear so many Palaeolithic  remains. The dwellings can be divided into two groups. There are round dwellings with a diameter of about 5 to 6 metres, and there are dwellings which are very large and are thought to have been inhabited by whole tribes. These dwellings usually have many fireplaces running down the middle. Today, ideas have changed and it is not clear whether the settlement was made up of separate dwellings with the fireplaces in the middle, or whether they represent a single construction.<br /><br />		The oldest Ukrainian dwelling was excavated during 1955 to 1961 and 1963 in Molodova on the banks of the river Dniester, USSR. Large mammoth bones from the Mousterian layer were found lying in a circle. The circle was 6 to 8 metres in diameter  and consisted of twelve skulls, fifteen tusks, thirty-four hip and shoulder blade bones, five lower jaws, and fifty-one mammoth long-bones. The circle was broken in two diametrically opposed places, which must have been the entrances. Inside the dwelling fifteen small fireplaces were found, their size varying from 0.4 by 1.0 metres and 0.3 by 0.4 metres. They contained burned bones and charcoal and this latter proved that the inhabitants had used wood to make their fires.<br /><br />		There is not much evidence of what this dwelling looked like inside. It is probable that the basic structure was made of wood and was covered with animal skins which were held down at the edges by bones. The large mammoth bones were obviously part of the building material. This type of construction is also found in Upper Palaeolithic settlements in  Ukraine, and seems proof that man was already able to build large dwellings in the Middle Palaeolithic and that he was no longer dependent on caves. The remains of the dwelling found at Molodova, however, could not nave been arrived at without many years of prior development because such a dwelling cannot be called primitive any more.<br /><br />		The site of Telmanskaya at Kostienki (Ukraine) was discovered by P P Yefimenko and A N Rogatchev in 1937. In the upper cultural layer a round hut-pit with a diameter of 5.2 to 5.6 metres and 500 to 700 millimetres deep was found. The walls were upright and the bottom flat. A 2 metre wide passage led out of the hut in a westerly direction. The only bowl-shaped fireplace lay right in the centre of' the hut. It measured 750 to 800 millimetres in diameter, was 150 to 200 millimetres deep, and contained ash and burned bones. Opposite the entrance three depressions in the ground were noticed. These were probably used as storage places. Rogatchev continued the research here in 1949 and 1950 and found further pits. If they had all been built simultaneously the dwelling could not have been habitable. It can be assumed that several layers representing continuous periods must have contributed to the positions of the various pits and holes. This settlement is similar in size and in the shape of the small pits to the settlement of Alexandrovka which lies only a little further away.<br /><br />		Rogatchev discovered second, third, and fourth occupation layers. The second layer revealed a complete settlement and part of a round dwelling six to seven metres in diameter which stood out as being different from the surroundings by kind and number of tools. Several quartz flakes were found here, but hardly, any mammoth tusks, bones, and bone flakes, although these were found in abundance outside the hut, while no quartz flakes were found outside at all. A fireplace was in the centre of the round hut, and it contained charcoal and burned bones. It is not a rare occurrence at Kostienki to find more than one occupation level, which must mean that this was a very favourable place, situated as it is along the banks of the river Don on clay ground.<br /><br />		The site of Alexandrovka is known as Kostienki IV and was excavated in 1937 and 1938 by A N Rogatchev. He discovered two kinds of settlement which he later attributed to two different cultures. He uncovered two round huts in the upper layer which were overlapping on one side with huts of the lower layer, and which presented a number of fireplaces. A loess deposit, completely sterile, separated the two layers: this loess deposit was found opposite the two round huts of the upper layer. The lower deposits also showed outlines of round huts and contained large dwellings. Rogatchev felt that the two occupation layers must have intermingled at a later date, as there were different types of dwellings as well as differences in other objects. The upper layer contained several quartz, slate, and mammoth ivory flakes, and typical burins and bifacial stone tools which were all totally absent in the lower layer.<br /><br />		The outlines of the two round huts of the upper layer were only 100 to 400 millimetres deep, and each had a bowl-shaped fireplace in the centre of the floor. Many more implements were discovered inside the hut than outside. On the northern edge of the dwelling situated to the west the thinner cultural layer did not reach far beyond the hollowed-out space of each hut. This did not happen on the southern edge where the two round huts were connected by an ochre-coloured substance. The area was sloping slightly at this particular point, and it can be assumed that the upper deposit had slipped down at a later date.<br /><br />		The hut on the western side was more interesting.  It was 400 millimetres deep towards its northern edge but only 100 millimetres on its eastern side. There the floor of the hut was on a level with the ground outside. Six enormous tusks were found inside, the larger part of a humerus bone, a lower jaw, part of a shoulder blade, and parts of the spines and ribs of mammoths At the edge of this deposit twenty large sandstone stabs and pieces of sandstone were found. They lay at the very top of this deposit. and may be considered to be building material.<br /><br /><b>Particularly interesting was the discovery of a lion's skull, found in the upper levels of the layer. Rogatchev thought that the skull might have been kept on top of the roof as a kind of decoration or that it might have had some ritual significance. Yefimenko made an interesting discovery of the skull of an aurochs in dwelling 'A' at the site of Kostienki 1, which might be a parallel.</b><br /><br />		The fireplace which was in the centre of the settlement was surrounded by about twenty holes, about 200 millimetres deep. They were probably used to store or prepare food, because pots or similar containers were unknown at this period. The tusks and bones of mammoths in the eastern dwelling were found at the bottom of the layer, not at the top. It can be assumed that they were not part of the construction (with the exception of the two tusks which were found in a somewhat higher level). The fireplace which was almost round, measured I metre in diameter, was approximately 100 millimetres deep, and slightly tilted in a westerly direction. It had a flat base and was bordered by a very small rim, only slightly protruding above the normal surface of the hut, Five medium-sized holes were found nearby, and from their position it would appear that they were of different periods. On the southern edge of the settlement a clay wall in good condition was found, it was 50 to 90 millimetres high and 400 to 500 millimetres wide. The clay was obviously deposited there when the living area was dug out and was then used either to stabilise the huts or to form a retaining border. The flat stones found at the western side must also have been used in the same way.<br /><br />		The lower layer of this site revealed two large, long dwellings. The one on the southern side was 33.5 metres by 5.5 metres and was distinguishable by the reddish colouring of its cultural layer. The other one was situated between 17 and 20 metres further north and measured 5.5 by 2.3 metres. <b>(this length and width appear to be typographical errors)</b>  The first dwelling had more than ten <b>(11 fireplaces are shown)</b> centrally placed fireplaces in it and the plan shows that there must have been three different parts which are separated from one another by steps about 100 millimetres high. The first part, to the west, was 14 metres long, the centre part was 9 metres long, and the eastern section was 10.5 metres long, and also contained the richest finds. <b>(28.6 metres by 6 metres according to the plan. This could easily be the description for 371 instead of 370)</b> The dwelling was constructed along the slope obviously to protect its shortest side against the rain and water from melting snow. All fireplaces were built along the longitudinal axis of the dwelling, and it can be assumed that the structure must have had a roof which was highest in the middle.<b>( no mention is made here of the add-on semicircular section)</b>  The roof was obviously anchored to the ground and cross-beams were connected to the ridge.<br /><br />This is also substantiated by the way in which it was found. The middle of the dwelling produced more material probably because all activities were carried out there. On the north end of the western section was a kind of passage which was obviously the only entrance and faced the valley of the Don. Most of the stone and bone flakes were found around the fireplaces which means that meals were prepared here, and tools made. All activities were obviously carried out inside the dwelling. Most of the bones found here belonged to hares; other animals are rarely found. On the north, and south-east side of the dwelling two smaller areas were found; they were not dug out, but were covered with flaked stones and bones. In the warm season people obviously used to sit outside and work.<br /><br />		The outlines of the second dwelling were clearly marked by the tool-finds. This dwelling, too, was divided into three parts and had altogether nine bowl-shaped fireplaces. There were two fireplaces in the western part, four in the central section, and three in the south-eastern part. <b>( 33.3 metres by 6 metres according to the plan. The division of the fireplaces identifies this as plan 371)</b> Three cooking pits and twenty five smaller holes were found around the fireplaces - they were 200 to 400 millimetres across and of the same depth. There were no holes outside the dwelling. Three upright mammoth flakes of long-bones were found on the western part 600 millimetres away from the edge of the dwelling, and they obviously were used to strengthen the clay wall around it.<br /><br />		Kostienki I is sometimes also called Polyakovo. P P Yefimenko did some research there during 1931 to 1936, and A N Rogatchev researched during 1938. Yefimenko uncovered an oval-shaped settlement measuring 14 to 15 metres by 36 metres, where numerous tools were found in the deposits inside the dwelling, although only a few implements occurred outside. It is possible that the living room was surrounded by some kind of walls. At the edge of this settlement Yefimenko found four large pits filled with deposits, and he called them the winter hut-pits. He also found twelve smaller ones which were used to keep bones in. If the building covered the whole area, as Yefimenko assumes, the pits at the edge could then be remains of the construction. It is more likely, however, that only part of the area was covered, a fact indicated by the finds. Semi-subterranean hut-pit 'A' could be described as one of the larger dwellings. It is about 2 metres by 3.5 metres and has a small terraced passage leading to the outside. A mammoth tusk and two shoulder-blades were found here with which the entrance could be covered up. Mammoth shoulder-blades were also used in the Upper Palaeolithic to cover graves, so that it is not surprising that they were also used to build huts. A similar entrance at the back of the hut was also found; it was shorter and steeper. But this could have been some kind of light shaft.<br /><br />		The floor of the hut-pit was more or less flat and showed outlines of two circles. One of them was larger and had a fireplace in the centre. The smaller circle had two layers of bones. The upper layer consisted mainly of shoulder-blades, hip-bones, and tusks of the mammoth. The lower layer, which was level with the floor of the hut, consisted mainly of tusks which were laid with the points turned inwards towards the centre of the room. They were fairly regularly spaced. This was presumably the supporting framework of the dome shaped roof which collapsed once the hut-pit was empty. The floor of the hut was approximately I metre below the ground and the top of the hut rose 0.8 to 1.0 metres.<br /><br />		These facts led Polykarpovitch to believe that these pit-huts must have been used for sleeping and somehow were kept warm: otherwise they would not have been sufficient protection against the cold. They showed no traces of typical fireplaces; one layer of coal and ash could be found and there was only a little space left around the remains of embers. It could be that the main fire was kept somewhere else and that the inhabitants collected the hot ash and bone 'coal' in rolled up animal skins and took them back to their huts and slept on them. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that no traces of stone nor large bones could be found inside the huts. Rogatchev also assumed that sick people could have been cured there. But an answer to this suggestion can only be given after further research has been carried out.<br /><br />		Along the middle of the large settlement eleven fireplaces were found. two of them a little further away, towards the edge of it. Several irregular, bowl-shaped depressions and small holes were found inside the dwelling which might have been used as storage places. Beside some of the depressions large mammoth bones had been stuck vertically into the ground. According to Yefimenko they were used as working tables or anvils, and the pits which contained numerous implements could be thought of as the working places. Rogatchev also discovered well-preserved remains of hut constructions in Kostienki-Anosovskaya with several deep store pits, where large bones were used in their construction.<br /><br /><center><img src="clickphotos/needle.jpg" alt = "needle.jpg" width="429" height="300"></center> Bone needles were found at Kostienki.<br /><br />How to make a bone needle: A small bone splinter is removed by making two grooves (or sometimes three if a short one is made at the blunt end of the needle) using a flint burin. The splinter is then perforated, shaped and polished on a piece of sandstone.<br />It should be noted that the flint for the tools found at Kostienki came from at least 90 miles away. This would be a powerful incentive for getting the most blades possible from each nodule of flint. <br /><center>Photo: B &amp; G Delluc, 'Prehistoric Hunters'</center><br /><br /><p><a href="images/seaurchinkostenki.jpg"><img src="images/seaurchinkostenkism.jpg" alt = "Sea Urchin Pendant" width="51" height="108" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Drilled bead of fossilised sea-urchin spine, 36&nbsp;000 years BP.<br /><br />Photo: Time Magazine 13th Feb 1995</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images5/headmae3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images5/headmae3sm.jpg" alt = "head" width="98" height="150" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>T&ecirc;te zoomorphe sculpt&eacute;e de S(K?)ostienski 1 - Collection MAE - Photo L.

This has the look of a younger figure which has not yet gone through childbirth. The waist is slim, the hips and thighs are well formed, as are the breasts, unchanged by child-rearing. It has quite a different emphasis and seems from a different tradition when compared with most other Kostenki venuses, nor for that matter with most of the other Gravettian venuses from France, for example.

More than 25 sites are located on the territory of about 20 sq. km, along the right bank of the Don. Taking into account that more than 10 sites are multi-layer, remains of more than 50 settlements of palaeolithic times are represented here. <br /><br />The stratigraphy of the second terrace above the floodplain of the Don and of the large ravines was the basis for relative chronology which was established by A.N.Rogachev in the middle sixties in cooperation with the geologists M.N.&nbsp;Grishchenko, G.I.&nbsp;Lazukov, A.A.&nbsp;Velichko. The sequence of deposits from the top up to bottom is represented by the following succession: chernozem, followed by loess-like loams, and two humic beds, separated by non-humic loams with lenses of volcanic ash.<br /><br />At the first stage the chronological scheme consists of four, later - of three chronological groups. The first (ancient) group included sites with cultural layers in the lower humic bed; the second consisted of sites in the upper humic bed; and the third included sites in the overlaying loess loams which constitute a colluvial deposit on the first and second terraces above the floodplain.<br /><br />The background for the division of lower and upper humic beds is the horizon of the sterile loam containing lenses of volcanic ash. According to analytical investigations, the age of the volcanic ash can be regarded as 35-32 kyr, (i.e. 35&nbsp;000 to 32&nbsp;000 years ago) and can be attributed to one of the eruptions of <A HREF ="lioncamp.html#campi">Campi Flegrei</A> in Italy. These dates appear to be an upper limit of the first chronological group, which framework is define at 33-36 kyr with the very probable more ancient lower limit back to 40 kyr. Among the series of 17 <sup>14</sup>C dates for 6 site of this group the most important are dates of 34-37 kyr for Kostenki 1 (V), 36 kyr for Kostenki 12 (III) and Kostenki 17 (II), and 33 kyr for Kostenki 14 (IVa). Pollen records indicate an evolution of the vegetation from pine forest conditions to forest with the dominant of spruce (Picea) of tiaga type and to the meadow-steppe associations. The climate change from cold to temperate, relatively warm and humid correspond to the interglacial environment in the lower part and to the beginning of glaciation in the upper part of the deposits of the lower humic bed. Paleomagnetic digression correlated with Lashamp excursus (41-43 kyr) was identified inside this deposits. Times and conditions of the accumulation of lower humic bed are comparable with the Hengelo interglaciation of Western Europe.<br /><br />Remains of 14 settlements, 10 of which have a radiocarbon dates, compose the second chronological group which cultural layers lie in the deposits of the upper humic bed above the horizon of volcanic ash. According to series of <sup>14</sup>C dates for Kostenki 1 (III), Kostenki 12 (Ia), Kostenki 14 (II) the age of the sites and the times of the accumulation of upper humic bed are defined in the frameworks of 32-27 kyr. Pollen records are the evidence for the very complicated processes of climate fluctuation during this period. From 7 up to 4 vegetation cycles are identified on Kostenki 1, 14, 17. In general the climate and environment indicate the replacement of the warm humid interglacial conditions by cold and dry environment of the glaciation. The most probable equivalent seems to be Arcy-Denecamp - Kesselt period of Western scheme.<br /><br /><hr><A NAME="campi"></A><br /><br /><p><a href="images/campivolcano.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images/campivolcanosm.jpg" alt = "Campi Flegrei" width="200" height="80" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />40.827 N, 14.139 E; summit elev. 458 m<br />The volcano of Campi Flegrei (Phlegrean Fields, Greek for "burning fields") lies immediately to the west of Napoli, and its deposits form much of the hills on which the higher areas of that city have been constructed. Less conspicuous as a volcano than neighboring Vesuvio, the Campi Flegrei must be considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in Italy, mostly because of continuing unrest and dense population within the caldera and in its immediate vicinity.Volcanism has occurred in the Campi Flegrei area during the past 50 thousand years, including two extremely violent explosive eruptions, the one that erupted the Campanian ignombrite (35 thousand years ago) and another one only 12 thousand years ago which produced the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff. The erupted volumes show a general decrease with time, and the most recent eruptions were characterized by moderate to small volumes.<br />Photo: http://www.geo.mtu.edu/~boris/CAMPIFLEGREI.html</p><br /><br clear = "left">From Wikipedia:<br /><br />Campi Flegrei, also known as the Phlegrean Fields (Greek for "burning fields"), is a large Caldera area situated in the west area of Napoli, Italy. Today most of the crater lies underwater, but includes the town of Pozzuoli and the Solfatara crater, home of the Roman god of fire, Vulcan. It is thought that the caldera was created in 2 major events, the first (Campanian Ignimbrite) occurred in the area about 40,000 years ago. At approximately 12,000 years ago another major eruption occurred forming a smaller caldera inside the main one (centered on the town of Pozzuoli), this event is known as the Neopolitan Yellow Tuff (referring to the characteristic yellow rocks there).<br /><br />In 1538, an 8-day eruption in the area deposited enough material to create a new hill, Monte Nuovo ("new mountain").<br /><br /><p><a href="images24/campanianignimbrite.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images24/campanianignimbritesm.jpg" alt = "Map of Campanian Ignimbrite" width="881" height="500" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Map of Campanian Ignimbrite. <br /><br />Key sites with hominin remains around the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition, and sites associated with the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) marker horizon.

It is in a small village of the same name (which means site of bones in Russian) situated on the bank of the famous Don River about 500 kilometres southeast of Moscow. Kostenki is not actually a single site but really an area of a lot of site locations (21 known to date) all dating to the Upper Paleolithic. We mostly studied the large blade (struck blades not bifaces) technology that was present in many of the younger localities (25&nbsp;000 - 15&nbsp;000 years old). This was of course interesting and it was fun to get back into some Old World knapping. Zhenya supplied the flint that he collected from the lower Don area (the closest known source) almost 500 kilometres south of Kostenki. Those ancient folks sure did haul flint! <br /><br /><hr><br /><br />From:<br />http://www.kostenski.narod.ru/kostenski_eng.htm <br /><br /><center><img src="clickphotos/kostenskimap.gif" alt = "kostenki map" width="130" height="150"></center><br /><br /><center>Location map for Kostenki and the Kostenski Ski centre</center><br /><br />In 1986 a group of hobby-skiers started a search for suitable places for skiing near their native town. The places had to be interesting and near. But it was not easy to find descents in the middle of the Russian lowland. That is why they have chosen the ravines near the village Kostyonki, district Khokholsky. Limestones here come up to the surface and form relatively large altitude differences - up to 70 m. Since then this area has become attractive not only for archaeologists but also for skiers. <br /><br />However it was not pleasant to stay in this naked place without any comfort, especially in the winter. So the skiers started to fit out the descents themselves. Skilifts and caravans appeared, later a solid house for 30 persons was built, in which you can stay quite comfortably for a couple of days. The ski club is growing and developing thanks to the efforts of enthusiasts. <br /><br />At the moment we have 5 runs up to 400 m long and 4 ski lifts, which serve all descents, beginning with the learning run and ending with the sports run, where sports events are organised regularly. We have instructors for beginners who will teach you not only to 'stand' on skis but also to use a ski lift. Already after two-three months you will be able to cut a good figure in the Caucasus, in the Alps or wherever else. The club has a ski lending if you do not have your own skis. Apres-ski you will get as everywhere mulledwine, supper and billiard. <br /><br />Archaeological Museum and Nature Reserve Kostyonki.<br /><br />The museum includes the areas of palaeontological settlements from the late (high) Palaeolithic. There are 21 historical sites near the village Kostyonki, other 5 similar sites are situated approximately 15 km to the south, near the village Borshtshyovo. Besides there are archaeological monuments from the early Middle Ages (8-9 c. AD) there. According to its ethnic belonging it is Slavic culture, may be it is the furthest Eastern point of the Slavic spread in Europe.  <br /><br />The museum itself is a pavilion above a settlement from the high Palaeolithic which was excavated in 1957-1963. The site is called Kostyonki 11 and is 21&nbsp;000 years old. <br /><br />At the moment the museum is closed for visitors because of the bad condition of the pavilion. Owing to lack of financing the restoration of the building is constantly postponed. <br /><br />Yearly archaeological excavations are carried out here by the Institute of the History of Material Culture of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg in July - August. <br /><br /><br /><br /><a name="reference"> </a> <!-- <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Glory (1961)</span></a> --><h3><span class="reference">References</span></h3><ol compact type="1" start="1"> <li><span class="reference"><b>Abramova Z.</b>, 1995:   <i>L'Art paléolithique d'Europe orientale et de Sibérie</i>,   Grenoble: Jérôme Millon.</span></li>  <li><span class="reference"><b>Boriskovskij P.</b>, 1953: <i>Palaeolithic of the Ukraine</i>, Academy of Sciences, USSR, Moscow-Leningrad (1953).</span></li>   <li><span class="reference"><b>Cohen C.</b>, 2003: <i>La femme des origines.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 42 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/lioncamp.html responseCode 3 200

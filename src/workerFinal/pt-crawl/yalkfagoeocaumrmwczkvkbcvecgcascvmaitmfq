/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: Printed in the January 1894 issue of 
        <u>Contemporary Review</u>. Original pagination indicated within double 
        brackets. To link directly to this page connect with: http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S491.htm</i></center>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 114]]</font> Mr. Labouchere 
        has introduced a Bill into the House of Commons declaring that, after 
        January 1, 1895, the House of Lords shall cease to exist. But it is hardly 
        possible that such a Bill can become law, either in this Parliament or 
        in any of its successors for the next half century, since it would require 
        that the Peers should commit political suicide, and this they would hardly 
        do unless an almost unanimous public opinion compelled such a course as 
        more dignified than submitting to actual expulsion. There is, also, as 
        Mr. Labouchere himself acknowledges, a preliminary difficulty, in the 
        very general impression, even among Liberals, that a second chamber is 
        necessary, combined with an extreme diversity of opinion as to how the 
        second chamber should be constituted. It is evident, therefore, that the 
        abolition of the House of Lords would by no means solve the problem, but 
        would only lead to interminable discussions on the more difficult part 
        of the question--what kind of chamber to substitute for it. The stoppage 
        of all useful reforms by any attempt to remodel our constitution in such 
        a revolutionary spirit would be exceedingly unpopular; and would probably 
        involve a longer struggle and more expenditure of parliamentary energy 
        than the effort we are now making to give Ireland permission to manage 
        her own affairs. It may, therefore, be worth while to consider whether 
        there is not a method by which a House of Lords may be retained in such 
        a form as to render it a truly representative Upper Chamber, thus making 
        it acceptable to most Liberals, and even to many Radicals; while, by preserving 
        its ancient name and prestige, and by giving it both greater dignity and 
        a more important part in legislation than it now possesses, the proposed 
        reform might be upheld as truly conservative, and receive the support 
        of the majority of the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 115]]</font> It is 
        clear that any such fundamental reform of the British Constitution as 
        is now advocated by advanced Liberals should proceed on the lines of evolution 
        rather than on those of revolution. Instead of abolishing the House of 
        Lords we must modify, reform, and elevate it; and we must do this in such 
        a manner as, on the one hand, to bring it into general and permanent harmony 
        with the House of Commons; while, on the other hand, it is rendered so 
        select, so dignified, so representative of all that is best in the British 
        Peerage, past, present, and to come, that a seat in the Upper Chamber 
        will become a more coveted honour than the insignia of the Garter, a higher 
        dignity than a ducal coronet. It is, I think, essential to the successful 
        carrying out of any such great reform that it should be initiated in the 
        House of Lords itself, and simply accepted or rejected by the House of 
        Commons. The discussion of its principles and methods should take place 
        in the country at large, rather than in Parliament. The peers must be 
        well informed as to the character and amount of change that will satisfy 
        the people and bring about that substantial harmony between the two branches 
        of the Legislature that is essential to good government; and it is with 
        the hope of contributing towards the peaceful settlement of this great 
        question that I now propose to set forth what appear to me to be the main 
        principles on which such an important reform should be founded.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great anomalies of the present House 
        of Lords are, first, its hereditary character; and, secondly, the presence 
        in it of the bishops of the Church of England, who thus have a voice, 
        and often a very important influence, in making or rejecting laws which 
        affect the whole population. Both hereditary and ecclesiastical legislators 
        are now felt to be wholly out of place in the parliament of a people which 
        claims to possess both political and religious freedom. They have, during 
        the last half century, been tolerated rather from the difficulty of getting 
        rid of them than from any belief in the value of their services; and it 
        has long been seen, by all but the most bigoted Conservatives, that something 
        must soon be done to bring the Upper House into harmony with modern ideals. 
        In these concluding years of the nineteenth century our hereditary House 
        of Lords is an anachronism. It may be said that our hereditary Sovereign 
        is also an anachronism; but there is this great difference--that the peers 
        systematically use their power to prevent or delay popular legislation, 
        which the sovereign, at the present day, never attempts to do.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, then, that any real and effective 
        reform of the House of Lords must, in the first place, abolish the hereditary 
        right to legislate, and must also exclude the bishops, as such, from any 
        share in law-making. This, of course, does not affect the hereditary succession 
        to the peerage, which may continue, at all events, for the present; but 
        would be most advisable to discontinue the creation of new <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        116]]</font> hereditary peerages. Instead of these, life-peers should 
        be created, but always as a mode of indicating distinguished merit, whether 
        exhibited by services to the country at large, by philanthropic labours, 
        or by exceptional achievements in the fields of science, art, or literature. 
        The object of creating these life-peers should be, to raise the character 
        and dignity of the peerage, and thus to afford material for the selection 
        of a new House of Lords, which should be worthy of its historic fame and 
        be in every way fitted to take a leading part in legislating for a free 
        and civilised people.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all Liberals, and many Conservatives, 
        will agree that the mere fact of succession to a peerage does not afford 
        any sufficient guarantee of the possession of those qualities which should 
        characterise the legislator, yet most of them will admit that the peerage 
        as a whole does afford some good material from which to choose legislators, 
        and this material may be indefinitely increased, both in quantity and 
        quality, by the creation of life-peerages as above suggested. A peer is, 
        at all events, an English gentleman. Many peers belong to families whose 
        names are household words in our history, and these may well be supposed 
        to have the real interests of their country at heart, and to be influenced 
        more or less profoundly by the good old aristocratic maxim, <em>Noblesse 
        oblige</em>. Most of them have had the best education our universities 
        can afford, and have added thereto that wider education derived from foreign 
        travel and from association with men of eminence at home and abroad. They 
        have the means and the leisure to make themselves personally acquainted 
        with the results of various forms of government, and especially with those 
        of our Colonies, where free institutions are working out the solution 
        of many political and social problems; and if the duty of legislation 
        was conferred upon them, not as an accident of birth but by the free choice 
        of their countrymen, and as an indication of popular confidence in their 
        integrity and their special acquirements, they would probably devote themselves 
        with ardour to the work. We know already that they do not lack either 
        intellectual power or the special faculties of statesmen, and we could 
        ill spare men of such attainments as the Marquises of Ripon and Salisbury, 
        the Duke of Argyll or the Earl of Rosebery, from the great council of 
        the nation. Let us, then, briefly consider on what principles the new 
        House of Lords should be constituted, what should be the qualification 
        of its members, and how they should be chosen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point to be considered is--what should 
        be the constitution of the new House of Lords. And here it seems to me 
        to be important that this House should be distinguished from the House 
        of Commons, not only by the preliminary qualification of its members as 
        peers, but by representing local areas considered as separate units, and 
        therefore without regard to the population of the areas; just as <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        117]]</font> the Senate of the United States represents the component 
        States of the Union as units, each State returning two senators, irrespective 
        of population. In our counties or shires we possess a series of such areas 
        which in many respects correspond to these component States. Each of them 
        has a very ancient individuality; many of them were British, Celtic, or 
        Saxon kingdoms; and most of them preserve to this day distinctive peculiarities 
        of speech or of customs. And the feeling of county unity or clanship survives, 
        as seen in the friendly rivalry of county cricket and football clubs and 
        of the volunteer forces; while birth or residence in the same county often 
        constitutes a bond of sympathy between strangers who meet abroad. And 
        this individuality of our counties is likely to be increased rather than 
        diminished by the further extension of local self-government, offering 
        fields for social experiment and for healthy rivalry in all matters involving 
        the interests and well-being of their populations. It must always be remembered 
        that our counties are not modern arbitrary divisions, but extremely ancient 
        territories, often differing greatly in physical features, and, to a corresponding 
        degree, in the character, interests, and occupations of their inhabitants. 
        There is, therefore, ample reason for treating them as equal units, and 
        giving to each an equality in choosing members of the Upper House.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counties of the United Kingdom, reckoning 
        the three ridings of Yorkshire as separate counties, are almost exactly 
        a hundred in number; and, giving to each two representative peers, we 
        should have a house of about two hundred members--amply sufficient for 
        all purposes of legislation, but almost too large to be chosen from the 
        limited number of existing peers, who are a little over six hundred. This 
        difficulty, however, might be easily obviated by making all knights and 
        baronets of the United Kingdom eligible for election to the House of Lords, 
        those elected to be thereupon created life-barons, thus preserving the 
        titular character of the House, while offering a more ample field for 
        the selection of men of real eminence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision might also be made for the admission 
        of two representatives of each of our self-governing Colonies, those chosen 
        also receiving titular honours. The presence of such Colonial lords would 
        be of immense advantage, both as initiating a legislative union of the 
        Empire, and in bringing to bear Colonial experience on our home legislation. 
        There would probably be less objection to Colonial representation in the 
        Lords than in the Commons; and when the time comes (if it ever comes) 
        for a complete federation of the British Empire, the process would be 
        greatly facilitated by this preliminary step towards a closer union. This, 
        however, is not essential to the constitution of a new Upper House, although 
        it presents advantages which should ensure for the proposal a full and 
        careful consideration.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point to be considered is the preliminary 
        qualification <font color="#990000">[[p. 118]]</font> for membership, 
        and, on this point, I hold very strong opinions. It has always seemed 
        to me that the adoption of the minimum legal age which qualifies a person 
        to hold property and to occupy the simplest public offices, as sufficient 
        also to qualify for choosing the national representatives or for being 
        chosen as a legislator, is a very great political blunder. With us, most 
        men of twenty-one have only just finished, and many have not yet finished, 
        their education, whether intellectual or industrial; while few persons 
        at that age have given any serious thought to politics, have made any 
        study of the duties and rights of citizens, or have had any real experience 
        to guide them in forming an independent judgment on the various political 
        and social questions of the day. In this respect, most savage and barbarous 
        nations set us a good example: with them, it is the elders who rule; and 
        the very name of chief is often synonymous with &quot;old man.&quot; The most suitable 
        age to be fixed as that of political maturity should certainly not be 
        below thirty, while I myself consider forty to be preferable.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of members of the Upper House, 
        who are to represent the mature wisdom and experience of the nation, there 
        can, I think, be no doubt that forty should be the minimum qualifying 
        age. Some such limitation is especially necessary in order that the conduct, 
        the character, and the attainments of the candidates may have become known 
        to the electors, and this can hardly be the case at a much lower age than 
        forty. By that time it will be seen whether a man has made any effort 
        to qualify himself for so high a position, either by historical or legal 
        study, or by having devoted himself to a practical enquiry into the results 
        of the various political, economic, or social systems of other civilised 
        communities. No one would wish to have such a House of Lords as is here 
        suggested degraded by the presence of men who make use of the great opportunities 
        they have inherited for mere selfish purposes, and whose highest pleasures 
        are luxury or sport; or of such as are imbued with the prejudices and 
        vices, rather than with the virtues and true nobility, of their ancestors. 
        Instead of these we should seek for men who are able to show a good record 
        of knowledge acquired or work done, and whose ability and character are 
        known to be above the average.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking, then, the actual peerage, together with 
        all knights and baronets of the United Kingdom who shall have attained 
        the age of forty, as constituting the body from which the new House of 
        Lords is to be chosen, the next point to be considered is the mode of 
        selection. We may first set aside the method of election by their fellow 
        peers (as in the case of the present representative peers of Scotland 
        and Ireland) as being quite inadmissible, since it would perpetuate many 
        of the evils to obviate which reform or abolition is demanded. The election 
        must be a popular one, and the most obvious suggestion is <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        119]]</font> that the existing constituencies of each county should choose 
        its representative peers. There are, however, many objections to this. 
        It would, in the first place, involve much of the expense and excitement 
        of another general election; and, secondly, it is doubtful whether the 
        average elector would be in a position to judge of the qualities and comparative 
        merits of the several candidates. It would, therefore, be advisable to 
        limit the voters to a body better able to make a wise and deliberate choice, 
        and such a body will be found in the members of the several Town and County 
        Councils, together with those of the District and Parish Councils to be 
        created by the Local Government Bill now before Parliament. The members 
        of these four classes of councils will constitute in each county an electoral 
        body which will be truly representative of the people, since it will have 
        been chosen on the widest and most liberal franchise to which we have 
        yet attained. It will be sufficiently numerous and independent to avoid 
        all suspicion of cliquism or wire-pulling, and it will be sufficiently 
        intelligent and sufficiently interested in public affairs to make a sound 
        and wise choice of members to sit in the Upper Chamber of the Legislature. 
        Of course, as a rule, the representative peers for each county would be 
        chosen from among candidates owning property in the county and residing 
        in it, since these would be best known to the voters. But as, in some 
        few cases, none of the residents qualified to be candidates might come 
        up to the required standard of eminence and ability, it would probably 
        be advisable to leave the choice of the electors entirely free.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great advantage of such a mode of election 
        as is here proposed would be, that it could be carried out with the minimum 
        of trouble and expense, and without any of the publicity and excitement 
        of an ordinary election. The clerks to the several councils would send 
        the names and addresses of the councillors to a central office; each of 
        them would receive by post a voting paper, which they would return in 
        the same manner. No canvassing would be permitted, since the acts and 
        general conduct, rather than the verbal promises, of the candidates would 
        decide the elector's choice. Such elections would offer an excellent opportunity 
        for a trial of the method of proportional representation advocated by 
        John Stuart Mill, and in a modified form by Mr. Courtney and Sir John 
        Lubbock. This system would ensure that, where the two political parties 
        are not very unequally divided, the minority would obtain a representative. 
        Each party in the county would, therefore, feel itself to be fairly treated, 
        and the House of Lords would thereby acquire an amount of stability which 
        would invest it with that character of a regulating power which an Upper 
        House ought to possess.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some persons may object to each county, however 
        small, electing the same number of representative peers, and may urge 
        that <font color="#990000">[[p. 120]]</font> proportionate population 
        should be the basis of representation as in the case of the House of Commons. 
        But this is rather to mistake the purport of the mode of election here 
        suggested--which is, not that the elected peers should be held to represent 
        the counties in their local interests, but as a means of selecting the 
        best possible Upper House, by the vote of an intelligent and popularly 
        chosen electorate spread over the whole country, and likely to be personally 
        acquainted with the merits or defects of those local residents who are 
        qualified to be chosen as representative peers. For this purpose, the 
        councillors in a small or thinly populated county would be at no disadvantage; 
        on the contrary, it is quite possible that they might make a wiser choice 
        than those of the most densely populated counties.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme now very briefly set forth claims 
        to be, not only a good scheme in itself, but probably the best compromise 
        which, under existing conditions, is possible. The more thoughtful and 
        more influential among the peerage must see that the people of the United 
        Kingdom will not much longer submit to a body of hereditary lawgivers 
        which not only has the power to defeat legislation earnestly desired by 
        the majority of the voters, but which often exercises that power. They 
        must also feel that the position of the present House of Lords is not 
        a dignified one, while its record of service to the country will make 
        but a sorry show in the pages of history. Almost every great reform which 
        has been effected in this century, whether in ameliorating the severity 
        of the criminal laws, in removing disabilities attendant on religious 
        belief, in opening the universities to the people, or in the abolition 
        of protective duties on the necessaries of life, has been at first strenuously 
        opposed by the Lords, and ultimately adopted under pressure of public 
        opinion, or for the purpose of forestalling political opponents. In very 
        few cases, on the other hand, has the Upper Chamber initiated beneficent 
        legislation or far-sighted policy, which has been ultimately approved 
        by the people and accepted by the House of Commons. Yet in an Upper House 
        which really deserved the name we should naturally look for guidance in 
        the matter of those more important reforms which are essential to real 
        progress, especially such as would tend to bring about a more equable 
        distribution of the constantly increasing wealth of the nation among the 
        masses of the people, thus diminishing and ultimately destroying that 
        seething mass of misery and starvation which still persists among us, 
        and which is the condemnation of our boasted civilisation. An assembly 
        which truly answered to its title of &quot;noble&quot; should be above the personal 
        interests and petty prejudices which influence those who, in various ways, 
        are engaged in the struggle for wealth or for mere existence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords, as it now exists in this 
        last decade of the nineteenth century, is not only an anomaly but an utterly 
        indefensible <font color="#990000">[[p. 121]]</font> anomaly, and one 
        wholly opposed to the spirit of the age. In the proposal now submitted 
        to public consideration, a means is indicated of bringing it into harmony 
        with modern ideas while preserving its historical continuity and constituting 
        it so that it may be an aid, instead of a clog, to the wheels of progress. 
        Will the Lords recognise the critical nature of their position, accept 
        reform as inevitable and as the only alternative to destruction, and themselves 
        initiate that reform? If they do so, in no hesitating or niggardly spirit, 
        but fully recognising that a body claiming power to legislate for Englishmen 
        <em>must</em> be representative, and <em>must</em> be elected either directly 
        or indirectly by the people, then it is probable that even the ever-growing 
        Radical party would willingly accept such a reform. They would be wise 
        to do so; because they would thus obtain a legislative chamber probably 
        as good as any that could be obtained after a lengthy and profitless struggle; 
        and, further, because a chamber such as is here suggested is of a nature 
        to admit of continual improvement, and would necessarily develop as the 
        nation developed, always keeping, as it should do, in the van of advancing 
        civilisation. When titles are given only for life, and are bestowed exclusively 
        as recognitions of merit or of exceptional ability and integrity, there 
        will grow up among us a true aristocracy characterised by the highest 
        intellectual and moral qualities, while the old aristocracy of birth will 
        be less and less esteemed, except in so far as it possesses similar characteristics. 
        Educated public opinion will, from time to time, indicate the men who 
        should be made eligible for election to the Upper Chamber, and no Ministry 
        will then dare to advise the Sovereign to bestow this honour on the unworthy, 
        or as a reward for mere political support, thus lowering the standard 
        of those who are eligible for election by the peoples' local representatives. 
        If, further, it was the rule that each of the great political parties 
        should give titular honours to not more than a fixed number in each year, 
        the balance would be kept even, and at successive elections each party 
        would have an equal range of choice.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many matters of detail which it is 
        not necessary to discuss at present. Among these are--the term for which 
        the Lords should be elected; whether they should change with a change 
        of Ministry, or by a portion retiring at intervals; whether the judges, 
        when they leave the bench, should be <em>ex-officio</em> members or should 
        be eligible for election. These are matters of minor importance, which 
        will be easily settled when the main principles of the scheme of reform 
        are decided on. These more fundamental points may be summarised as follows: 
        (1) The limitation of the number of members in the new House of Lords 
        to about two hundred; (2) The extension of the range of choice to knights 
        and baronets; (3) All titular honours in future to be granted for life 
        and only in recognition of distinguished merit; (4) An age-qualification 
        of about forty years; (5) <font color="#990000">[[p. 122]]</font> Representation 
        of counties as units, by two members of each; (6) The constituency to 
        consist of all the members of the County, District, Town, and Parish Councils 
        in each county.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now submit this scheme of reform, first, to 
        the leaders among the existing peers, to whom it offers an honourable 
        mode of escape from a difficult position, not by an ignominious surrender 
        to popular demands after a long struggle which they know must terminate 
        in defeat, but by voluntarily recognising their anomalous character as 
        hereditary legislators in an otherwise representative government, and 
        by themselves initiating the reconstruction of the Constitution which 
        at no distant date is inevitable. By so doing they may preserve the continuity 
        of the aristocratic Upper Chamber, add greatly to its dignity and power, 
        and give to the world the too rare example of a privileged class voluntarily 
        resigning such of its privileges as are inconsistent with modern civilisation. 
        This I conceive to be true conservatism.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Liberal and Radical parties--and I am 
        myself an extreme Radical--I submit my scheme as one that will remove 
        all the evils and anomalies of the present House of Lords, transforming 
        it into a representative chamber of the very highest character, which 
        must always be in harmony with advanced public opinion as expressed by 
        the whole body of its freely elected local representatives. Such a House 
        of Lords would be really capable of fulfilling what is supposed to be 
        the special function of an Upper Chamber--that of calm and judicial consideration 
        of such measures as were the result of sudden waves of prejudice or passion, 
        either in the population at large or in the House of Commons. It would 
        thus appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober, and would give expression 
        to deliberate and permanent, rather than to hasty and temporary, public 
        opinion. To secure a body capable of doing this--and I cannot see how 
        it could be more effectually done than by some such method as I have here 
        suggested--would be, in my opinion, a measure of radical, yet safe and 
        judicious, reform.</p>

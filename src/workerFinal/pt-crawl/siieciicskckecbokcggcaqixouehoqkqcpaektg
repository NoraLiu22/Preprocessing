												<p><span class="ds20">May 7, 2014</span></p>
												<p><span class="ds23">In my July 15 2009 blog I speculated on how several engraved ochre pieces from Blombos Cave Middle Stone Age (Henshilwood, d'Errico and Watts 2009) appeared, at least to me, as having more than just a bunch of scrape marks.  Rather they appeared to have overall shapes and then intentional markings that were zoomorphic, with closest zoomorphic matches being 'lion', 'elephant' and 'wildebeest'.   Now I'd like to point out another zoomorph in red ochre from a different MSA site, Klasies River Cave 1 (d'Errico, Moreno and Rifkin 2012).  The authors found one piece of red ochre unlike the dozen or more other ochre fragments that showed grinding and use-wear.  Their analysis showed the ochre material was selected for being distinctive compared to the other fragments, confirmed the incised lines are anthropogenic; and observed that the piece's surface was first scraped or rubbed and then a &quot;robust rounded lithic point was used to incise a sequence of a dozen or so straight and curvilinear sub-parallel lines on the object&quot; (948).  After their examination the authors conclude that &quot;the purpose of marking this object remains uncertain&quot; and they offer no hypotheses (949).</span></p>
												<p><span class="ds23"> Their 'uncertainty' appears to me to reflect the authors' failure to consider that the artifact might be a 'figure stone', which at least in France, since the time the archaeological establishment condemned Boucher de Perthes one of the founders of French archaeology, for identifying 'figure stones',  has been a taboo topic for archaeology and prehistorians.  For non-French archaeologists it is perhaps not a taboo, but apparently it is a rarity in the Anglo-American world for any archaeologist to venture out of the 'tool-realm', which industrious and highly empirical Anglo-Americans accept as the most (if not only) important thing in the world of 'culture', while they are paranoid when it comes to anything but the most obvious examples of realistic art or the most literal and pseudo-cognitive concepts of spirituality.  </span></p>
												<p><span class="ds23">In the following image I have annotated d'Errico, Moreno and Rifkin (2012: fig. 4) to indicate faunal matches for possible Klasies zoomorphic figuration on the red ochre engraving piece.   I suggest that the use of natural and artificial zoomorphic shapes and method of incising ochre are similar at both Klasies River Mouth and Blombos.  That this similarity occurs at two different sites during the mid-MSA I take to be supportive evidence for my interpretation.</span></p>

												<p><span class="ds6">This month saw publication in the journal </span><span class="ds13">Science</span><span class="ds6"> of two articles that fully support our position that the major wave of migration out-of-Africa of </span><span class="ds13">Homo sapiens sapiens</span><span class="ds6"> was one carrying a Middle Paleolithic tool-and-art kit and it occurred during the last Interglacial, OIS 5e 120,000 years ago give or take 10,000 years.  With these two articles I suggest that we consider the so-called ROM (Recent</span><span class="ds6"> Out-of-Africa Model -- </span><span class="ds13">H. s. s. </span><span class="ds6">leave Africa with an Upper Paleolithic tool-and-art kit 45-60,000 years ago) proven false. </span></p>
												<p><span class="ds6">In the January 7 issue of </span><span class="ds13">Science</span><span class="ds6">, the science writer, Michael Balter, in an article 'Was North Africa the Launch Pad for Modern Human Migrations?' reviews new datings, discoveries of symbolic behavior and new hominid fossils for the North African Aterian culture which show its affinities to Skhul and Qafzeh.   </span></p>
												<p><span class="ds6">If this review were not convincing enough, the January 28 issue of </span><span class="ds13">Science</span><span class="ds6"> published Armitage, Jasim et al 'The Southern Route &quot;out of Africa&quot;: Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia'.   This study reports finding Middle Paleolithic tools at Jebel Faya, Sharjah, U.A.E., dated by OSL -- 3 dates at 95,000, 123,000 and 127,000 years ago.  Called 'Assemblage C', the tools are characterized by small handaxes and foliates.  The tool assemblage has affinities to NE Africa, but none to Neanderthals.  Further, stone assemblages above this level, Assemblage B, dating between 90 and 40,000 years ago, has no parallels in Africa; and the same goes for Assemblage A, dated 39-40,000 years ago.  This indicates at least at this site that the Late Middle Paleolithic and Early Upper Paleolithic industries are local developments; they didn't come out-of-Africa as the ROM model hypothesizes.  </span></p>
												<p><span class="ds6">I note that Jebel Faya Assemblage C can be compared to the Middle Paleolithic with handaxes assemblage at Abdur Reef, Buri Peninsula, Eritrea, dated by TIMS U-series to 125&plusmn;7 kya.  </span></p>
												<p><span class="ds6">With respect to the January 7 Balter article it suggests that the Aterian did not make it into the Levant.  This view is incorrect.   On one of Emmanuel Anati's expeditions to Har Karkom, central Negev, Israel, with its hundreds of hutfloors in a massive hammada of flint, there are definitely both Aterian sites and Middle Paleolithic with handaxe sites.  I have documented this with an extensive series of images right here on OriginsNet http://www.originsnet.org/gallerymp.html <br>
														This even includes our illustration of the Aterian hutfloor and the artifacts within it, including a series of stone sculptures as well as the remarkable triangular-'female' sculptures from MP-with-handaxe sites.  </span></p>
												<p><span class="ds6">Now that the Interglacial migration date seems acceptable to a science writer like Balter, we may be assured that the bandwagon is moving on, the old ROM paradigm is over, and we welcome the short chronology proponents, including Richard Klein, Paul Mellars, and Steven Mithen to jump on board.  </span></p>

												<p align="left"><span class="ds6">Re: March 24 </span><span class="ds13">Nature</span><span class="ds6"> article,  'The complete mitochondrial DNA genome of an unknown hominin from southern Siberia,' Krause, Fu </span><span class="ds13">et al</span><span class="ds6">, http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/index.html.  The analyzed bone comes from Denisova Cave, Altai, Siberia, from Layer 11.2, dating roughly 35-50 ka, a layer having tools of the Siberian Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP), with a transitional mix of MP and UP types of tools.</span></p>
												<p align="left"><span class="ds6">Point #1. In our perspective, a most useful inference in this study is that if the mtDNA dating of the 'common ancestor' is accurate, then it supports the view that a major out-of-Africa movement occurred with Middle Acheulian </span><span class="ds13">Homo erectus</span><span class="ds6">, beginning around 1 MYA to 600 ka (the handaxe/cleaver industries).  </span></p>
												<p align="left"><span class="ds6">As noted in the previous post, this is precisely the position I have advocated for in '<a href="kdstrwman.pdf">Knocking Down the Straw Man Once Again'</a>.  There are three major periods of cultural globalization in the Paleolithic: Classic Oldowan (</span><span class="ds13">Homo habils/rudolfensis</span><span class="ds6">) Middle Acheulian (</span><span class="ds13">Homo erectus)</span><span class="ds6"> and mid-Middle Paleolithic (</span><span class="ds13">Homo sapiens sapiens)</span><span class="ds6">. </span></p>
												<p align="left"><span class="ds6">The archaeological evidence shows a clear West to East gradient from Africa into China for the Middle Acheulian handaxe/cleaver industries.  In contrast, Early Acheulian and Later Acheulian technological innovations do not appear to to reach East Asia.  Instead these areas appear to evolve their own comparable, and in some ways more advanced, tool industries, during the time periods either side of the Middle Acheulian.  So I am happy to see that Krause </span><span class="ds13">et al</span><span class="ds6"> have shown via mtDNA analysis that a major human subclade apparently dispersed and subsequently evolved on its own from that 1 MYA out-of-Africa migration.</span></p>
												<p align="left"><span class="ds6">Point #2.  It is easy to take issue with the authors' Recent-Out-of-Africa hypothesis (50 ka).  The very sites in Siberia/Altai mentioned in the article argue against such a short chronology.  One of the earliest IUP (EUP) sites is Baigara, Irtysh, Western Siberia  [Kuzmin et al, 2009, </span><span class="ds13">Journal of Human Evolution</span><span class="ds6"> 57:91-95]. See our online database for Central Asia/Siberia <a href="publications.html">http://www.originsnet.org/publications.html. </a> At this site they found a 'most probably' </span><span class="ds13">Homo sapiens sapiens talus bone</span><span class="ds6">, dated 40-48 ka, which THEY COMPARED TO SKHUL IV!  This means if we accept that </span><span class="ds13">JHE</span><span class="ds6"> study that, as I have argued all along, MP Skhul-like </span><span class="ds13">H.s.s.</span><span class="ds6"> left SW Asia circa 125 ka (OIS5e), and they or their genes arrived in Altai, with MP technology, not IUP, at for example Kara Bom, ESR 62,200 ka.  At that site an MP technology also included &quot;subprismatic blades, crested blades and bladelets&quot;; in other words, it was already by 62 ka innovating on the way to UP.   At 43 ka Kara-Bom's technology (alluded to by the authors) -- is described by its excavators as 'Bohunician', or East European IUP.  At Mamontovaya Kurya, Komi, near the Arctic Sea, IUP arrives 35,000 ka, with inscribed mammoth tusks.  As Marcel Otte and others -- IMHO -- have convincingly argued, the next technological innovation, 'Proto-Aurignacian' (38-32 ka), which appears at Ust'-Karakol, Altai at 35 ka, is either westernmost, or perhaps the origin area, of the Aurignacian appears to be Iran, Uzbekistan, or Afghanistan.  And as we see at Kara Bom 62 ka, Middle Paleolithic Skhul-like hominins are already innovating towards that Aurignacian style. In no way does it come 'out-of-Africa' 50 or 40 ka, as argued by Paul Mellars et al, from their myopic Eurocentric perspective.

Basically, this paper shows how the short chronology model for 'recent out-of-Africa' (ROM) 50 to 80,000 years ago fails to fit what we know about archaeology from Africa to Australia.  People had to leave earlier, likely during the last interglacial, 125,000 years ago, and did so carrying a Middle Paleolithic technology.  To my mind its the only model that makes sense.

												<p align="left"><span class="ds9">The latest issue of </span><span class="ds15">Journal of Human Evolution </span><span class="ds9">contains an article describing and analyzing 13 fragments of incised ochre from Blombos Cave, South Africa, from Middle Stone Age levels, dating between 73,000 and 100,000 years ago [Christopher S. Henshilwood, Francesco d&rsquo;Errico, Ian Watts (July 2009). Engraved ochres from the Middle Stone Age levels at Blombos Cave, South Africa. </span><span class="ds15">Journal of Human Evolution</span><span class="ds9"> 57(1): 27-47].  &quot;These finds, taken together with other engraved objects reported from other southern African sites, suggest that symbolic intent and tradition were present in this region at an earlier date than previously thought.&quot;  They argue that the evidence indicates that many of the striations are intentional engravings inconsistent with power production.  Patterns of markings include: sets of parallel lines; fan-shape; cross-hatch/lattice; (previously published) row of X's framed in triple-parallel-lines; right-angle superimposed crossing lines; and 'dendritic' or convergent-lines.  M3-9 appears to me to represent a verticle series of nested/overlapping chevrons.  This study is </span><span class="ds9">a major breakthrough and the dating and descriptions of the artifacts and incisions is meticulous. <br>
														<br>
													</span><span class="ds9">For me this study is especially important as it shows that there are parallels to the 30,000 BP UP European geometric signs, for which I have proposed a decoding as ideograms, already in use 70-100,000 years ago, including 'X's, 'tri-line', 'chevron', 'Y' and a variety of arrangements of repeated 'stroke' mark motifs.  The article describes a 'dendritic' motif, constituted by a fan-like set of convergent lines, which if taken as a 'convergent-line' motif, can be considered a survival from Early Paleolithic 'convergent/divergent lines' and 'fan' motifs. <br>
														<br>
														The authors infer that the Blombos Cave engravings &quot;may fall within two fields of abstraction; first, that described as non-representational or non-objective as the designs do not derive from recognizable subjects and second, they are abstract patterns that 'reframe nature for expressive effect' (Ettinger, 2005: 211).  The first type of abstraction is difficult to identify archaeologically.  The second can be demonstrated if the subject of the motifs is identified (d'Errico 1991).  In the case of the Blombos engravingts, none of these can be identified as clearly representing elements of the natural world&quot; (45).<br>
														<br>
														I will now show a way in which this inference--</span><span class="ds9">'no representations of natural things in the world' can be falsified.  I admit that my suggestions for figuration of (a) the shapes of the ochre pieces and (b) at least one metaphorical overlap--the marking termed 'dendritic' and what can be taken as 'skin folds' of a zoomorphic representation--are at this point hypothetical.  However, unless archaeologists come up with a justifiable procedure for determining whether a figurative 'likeness' is pure projection or  'intentional' I would suggest that my hypothesis is at least as valid as their conclusion.<br>
														<br>
														Below I present three interpretations of Blombos Middle Paleolithic artifacts as sculptural representations.  In one of these, I point out a possible representation of 'lion-head' and associated 'tri-line' geometric sign motif.  If you scroll down to a prior blog on the Pavlov VI 'lion-head' you will find that that 'lion-head' also has a geometric sign inscribed on it, which also appears to be a 'tri-line'!   If so, that's a long and widespread semiotic tradition.<br>
														<br>
													</span></p>
												<p align="left"><img src="blomboslion%20JBH.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="640" border="0"></p>
												<p align="left"><span class="ds9">To my eye the clearest figuration on this piece is the possible 'lion-head'; if you rotate it 180 degrees there is a 2nd possible figuration, admittedly more vague, of a forest elephant.  If so, this is a depiction, at least in part, of their predator/prey relationship.  I do not wager the semiotic denotation of the 'tri-line' and associated marks since the current examples of MSA markings is so limited; I would not go so far as to suggest a denotation similar to that which I have proposed for the European Upper Paleolithic ideogram-system.<br>
														<br>
														In any event, you might compare the full possibly iconographic array to that one the figurine from Pavlov VI: 'lion-head + tri-line + (more vague) proboscid'.   Don't be so quick to call it my pareidolia; as a scientist you would be required to refute the imagery with some sort of evidence against it.<br>
														<br>
														Next, I suggest 'resting wildebeest', and here the 'dentritic' or 'convergent-lines-form' would be placed so as to also represent 'the folded neck skin' of the wildebeest, as in the photo from nature.  If it intentionally represents both the pure meaning of the geometric sign and the natural animals skin, then we would have a very interesting metaphor.  Perhaps someday someone will find a way to decipher the metaphor.<br>

												<p><br>
													<span class="ds9">Now, just for fun, in the next artifact, it appears the engravor has made a polymorphic sculpture combining both the lion and wildebeest themes in one piece of red ochre.  The structure of a polymorph, using the R - L opposed sides of the object for opposed semantic themes, sometimes employing a rotation of the stone itself, is already evident in Early Paleolithic palaeoart sculptures, and the lion/prey theme is not uncommon.<br>

The discovery itself, the datings and the microscopic analysis indicating intentional markings on the figurine is a valuable contribution to documenting Upper Paleolithic female figurines. Regrettably, the author's and Paul Mellars' accompanying comments infering the figurine represented something 'almost pornographic', 'possibly girl's toy' or 'object of a fertility cult' would appear to be fantasy projections of male archaeologists steeped in contemporary society's flood of pornographic, abusive objectifications of the female other. The </span><span class="ds15">Nature</span><span class="ds9"> video of the figurine, without embarrassment, is titled: &quot;Prehistoric Pin-up&quot; and similar insulting language then reappeared in media across the globe, including </span><span class="ds15">London Times, New York Times and Los Angeles Times</span><span class="ds9">.

														<br>
														From my point of view the importance of this find is, as I describe in the statement below, that it displays a remarkable set of Upper Paleolithic ideograms, especially, 'bi-lines' and 'tri-lines' which (a) provide support for my proposed decoding of the Upper Paleolithic European ideogram system (protolanguage) and (b) indicate that the figurine is a ritual artifact to be associated with one of the Upper Paleolithic female spiritual transformation processes, namely the transformation which might be title: The Double Goddess, whose ideograms signify 'bifurcate/double and flow'.   It is the same transformation which some other so-called 'Venus' figurines express and, of course, it doesn't represent the UP female transformation that actually has its survival in the ancient Greco-Mediterranean cult of Aphrodite; that transformation would be indicated by ideograms, such as circle or triangle plus meander or chevron, signifying 'center and flow'.  (Other so-called 'Venus' figurines from G&ouml;nnersdorf, Germany, represent a third transformation, the Self-Seeding Goddess.)<br>

												<p align="center"><b><span class="ds7">Hohle Fels Figurine: A Semiotic Perspective</span></b></p>
												<p><span class="ds11">Nicholas Conard&rsquo;s report<sup>1</sup> of the discovery of a female figurine from Hohle Fels is remarkable for its early Aurignacian dating, but the author&rsquo;s speculation that the figurine is an &ldquo;expression of fertility&rdquo; and Paul Mellars&rsquo; comments<sup>2</sup> interpreting it as &ldquo;bordering on the pornographic&rdquo; or &ldquo;girls&rsquo; toys&rdquo; appear to be contradicted by the markings on the figurine itself.&nbsp; They have failed to take into account extensive research on the decoding of geometric signs of the European Upper Palaeolithic and the subsequent amplification of these signs into a sophisticated iconography and script during the Danube Mesolithic and Neolithic<sup>3,4</sup>.</span></p>
												<p><span class="ds11">From a semiotic perspective these markings represent typical geometric signs of European Upper Palaeolithic iconography<sup>5</sup>. &nbsp;The markings across the top of the breasts appear to consist of three parallel lines.&nbsp; This appears to be a typical &lsquo;tri-line&rsquo; ideogram, which as, I have proposed, denotes &lsquo;to flow, flow in three worlds&rsquo;.&nbsp; Two groups of three short lines incised over each shoulder appear to be two more &lsquo;tri-lines&rsquo;.&nbsp; On the figurine&rsquo;s right upper arm are two short strokes, a &lsquo;bi-line&rsquo;, which signifies &lsquo;bifurcate, double&rsquo;.&nbsp; Below it are two parallel &lsquo;chevrons&rsquo;, which would signify &lsquo;to flow, flow through a channel&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The syntactic pairing of &lsquo;bifurcate&rsquo; and &lsquo;flow&rsquo; signs represents one of the major European Upper Palaeolithic female spiritual transformation processes, namely, the Double Goddess<sup>6,8</sup>.</span></p>
												<p><span class="ds11">Similar geometric signs occur on female figurines in the Danube Neolithic<sup>4 </sup>and these figurines appear to represent a variant of the Upper Palaeolithic Double Goddess.&nbsp; The multiple horizontal lines on the figurine&rsquo;s abdomen may represent a skirt but may also represent scarification marks.&nbsp; Comparison of European Neolithic figurine markings to African Luba scarification practices, which have associated female figurines representing ancestor beings<sup>7</sup> suggests that the user of the Hohle Fels figurine most likely belonged to such a matrilineal society and that the figurine played a role in female initiation or empowerment ritual and symbolized the flow of power and prerogative down through the female lineage.&nbsp;</span></p>
												<p><span class="ds11">If this figurine is indeed engraved with such stereotypical geometric signs, the opinions of Mellars and Conard with respect to function and meaning are not supported and the semiotic theory I first proposed over twenty years ago gains strong confirming evidence. &nbsp;What seems most remarkable about this figurine is its degree of semiotic complexity, which I would not have expected until the Magdalenian 20,000 years later.</span></p>

													<br>
													OriginsNet circulated a photo of the 'lion head' and the net result, I suggest, is that this sculpture is most likely a polymorphic sculpture, which can be compared to polymorphs from Middle and Early Paleolithic sites.  In the attached I have arranged a collage to suggest that the 'lion' may be identified as either a 'lion with open mouth' (comparison to lions of Chauvet) or 'homotherium', with its 'sabertooth' depicted by a flake removal.   Jan van Es discovered that by rotating the image the artist has also depicted a 'mammoth'.  Thus, the sculpture depicts the predator/prey relationship.  I have attached an Early Paleolithic polymorphic sculpture discovered by Richard Wilson at his Hertfordshire site that apparently depicts the same theme.  <br>

												</span><span class="ds6">If so this tradition may extend for 400,000 years or more.  Jan van Es also suggests the Pavlov VI sculpture may have one or two additional  figurations.

												</span><span class="ds6">Announcement.  I've posted a <a href="koonaldagallery/index.htm">gallery for Koonalda Cave, Australia</a>, to indicate the rich array of art dating between 16,000 to 27,000 years ago at this site.  These dates are contemporaneous with European Ice Age cave art of the Gravettian and Solutrian, and points to much older traditions of palaeoart.  Koonalda Cave art has multiple petroglyph motifs (digital fluting, lattices, fans, concentric circles), stelae and zoomorphic/anthropomorphic standing stone sculptures.  Koonalda was a site for both 'flint' mining and religious rituals.  <br>
													<br>
													I placed the gallery in the Middle Paleolithic section of OriginsNet because Australian stone tools of the time continue a Middle Paleolithic technology and because of the remarkable similarities between Koonalda and Har Karkom -- including flint quarrying at each site and  stelae and zoomorphic/anthropomorphic standing stone sculptures.  This suggests the existence of a shared Middle Paleolithic artistic and spiritual tradition across the Southern Route from Africa to Australia.<br>

													<br>
													Calico is now dated by both OSL and U-Series, making it one of the better dated sites in North America.  The two dates suggest the primary occupation occurred in the Sangamon/Eemian OIS 5, with earlier occupations.  Bison, mammoth and horse are known fauna during this period, and a mammoth bone was excavated at the site.  <br>
													<br>
														Contrary to those would seek to discredit the site as only 'nature-facts' (even Wikipedia suggests this), I have presented text giving the contrary position, which to me is the most valid interpretation. I mention the discovery of an apparent hearth in the early excavation report, one of many facts ignored by the 'Clovis police'. To me the stone assemblage presented at the calicodig.org website appears to reflect not-atypical flake and blade technologies of Final Acheulian Period/Early Middle Paleolithic technology of Eurasia. The gallery images include some of these tools.</span><span class="ds5"><br>

													The themes are interesting. Primarily aurochs and birds. There are several female figures. I note that they are in the style of G&ouml;nnersdorf, Lalinde and Fontales. Marija Gimbutas interpreted figures in this style as representations of a Bird Goddess, which continues from UP to the Neolithic. She noticed that sometimes the large buttocks has an egg depicted in it. There is at least one European image, I think its from Fontales, where the egg is depicted in the buttocks. Marija put this image in her Language of the Goddess. Marshack has also done a very good microscopic analysis of the way these images were constructed.<br>
													<br>
														The dating by comparison of faunal remains to local UP site seems plausible.<br>

The G&ouml;nnersdorf type should be designated 'The Self-Seeding Goddess' and contrasted by the falsely-labeled 'Venus' type , which is actually a form of </font><font color="blue">t<a href="publications.html#doublegoddess">he 'Double Goddess'</a></font><font color="black">.<br>
														<br>
														Fiedorczuk et al should become aware that the classic type site of the Self-Seeding Goddess at G&ouml;nnersdorf occurs in a site context of religious ritual (two huts connected by the pathway of engraved broken plaquettes, with the figurines found in pits protected by fox pelts, in groups of 3, and so on). G&ouml;nnersdorf along with El Juyo, Cantabria represent the two best examples of religious ritual sites in the Magdalenian setting aside the parietal rock art.<br>

														A team of archaeologists led by Drs. Sheila Coulson and Nick Walker, University of Oslo, have discovered &quot;evidence of humankind's oldest ritual&quot; at Rhino Cave in the remote Tsodilo Hills of Botswana. Finds include: cupules and abraded grooves on a rock surface that is interpreted as having shape of a python, a creator being in San mythology, and in the excavation just below it beautifully made Middle Paleolithic points, with those of red color intentionally burnt and destroyed, and also engraving tools that appear to associate to the petroglyphs. By tool comparison the dating would be similar to the nearby site of &Mac173;Gi, which has TL dating at 77,000 years ago.<br>

															This is an extremely important find that supports the view that there was a common and global artistic/religious symbolism that blossomed from Africa to Australia during the Mid-Middle Paleolithic (associated with early Homo sapiens sapiens).<br>

Serendipitously, my partner, Patricia Reis, had just returned from a rafting trip on the Sheenjek River, Alaska, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and brought back photos of a musk ox. We received additional musk ox photos from a trip participant, Peggy Braun, and my vote is that the Pampau figurine is a stunningly good representation of a musk ox.</span><br>

                    <p><span><span><span>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will release a complete monthly measure of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by late 2025, as part of its transformative program called <i>Big Data, Timely Insights: Phase 2</i> (BDTI).</span></span></span></p>

<p>Stakeholders were invited to provide input on key aspects of the CPI publication design during a public consultation held from 16 November to 15 December 2023. &#160;The public consultation sought formal submissions on this proposed design covering key areas such as release timing, data requirements, publication specifics, and methodologies.</p>

<p><span><span><span>The public consultation was informed by a preliminary <i>Discovery Stage </i>in October 2023, where the ABS engaged directly with a selection of stakeholders to gain insights into their priorities and to lay the groundwork for the initial CPI design.</span></span></span></p>

                    <p><span><span><span>Feedback on the design of the complete monthly CPI aligned closely with stakeholder insights gathered during the initial <i>Discovery Stage</i>. The primary requests voiced by stakeholders included:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><b>Prioritise accuracy and data coverage</b> of the complete monthly CPI over improved timeliness of the publication&#8217;s release after the end of the reference period, with backing for the ABS&#8217;s proposal that the CPI publication continue to be released around four-weeks after the reference period.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Support for maintaining the <b>same level of detailed commentary and analysis</b> as published in the quarterly CPI with requests for further expansion of the CPI analytical series where feasible.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><b>Monthly data content consistent with the current quarterly CPI data series</b> incorporating capital city and expenditure class (EC) level data.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><b>Continue a quarterly data series</b> for continuity of timeseries analysis and legislated indexation requirements. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Further insights provided by stakeholders included: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Support for publishing data with more decimal places for increased precision.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Request for a monthly analytical series such as trimmed mean, weighted median, and goods and services categories.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Support for transparency regarding data collection frequency, coverage, and updates to the CPI Concepts, Sources, and Methods (CSM).</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Feedback was also received that is beyond the scope of the BDTI transformation program. This feedback will be evaluated for potential integration in future, <span>including considerations such as expanded product classifications for further international comparability<span>,</span></span> expanding the Selected Living Costs Index (SLCI) groups, and compiling Regional CPI data.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>complete summary of the public consultation feedback is provided in the <strong>Results</strong> section below.</span></span></span></p>

                    <p><span><span><span>This public consultation generated 31 submissions from a range of individuals and organisations. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Most of the items in the preliminary scope were broadly supported for inclusion in the review. The topics in the preliminary scope that attracted the most submissions were the identification of new 4-digit languages, the inaccurate representation of existing languages or identification of languages missing from the classification, and issues with how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages are represented in the ASCL.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In addition to the issues outlined in the scope, a number of other concerns were raised, including:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Feedback highlighted a lack of transparency and consistency across the framing of all language Broad groups. Many respondents asked for clarification on the labelling and naming conventions used in the ASCL, along with queries related to alternate titles, language variations or dialects.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Concerns were also raised regarding the current coding structure and lack of stated advice that clearly explains why some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are included in the ASCL at the 4-digit level while others are not. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Feedback also suggested that the ABS should engage with experts on the topic of sign and signed languages, especially those that relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages. </span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>&#160;Other suggestions included:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>The need to provide further explanatory information to users regarding the classification principles applied at the 4-digit level of the classification. Some users would also benefit from further advice around the criteria that has been applied to the nec/nfd categories.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Feedback indicated that users would like more coverage of language groups and community recognized language titles.</span></span></span></li>

                <div class="col-md-9">
                    <p><span><span><span>This public consultation generated a small number of submissions from a variety of stakeholders, including government, business, and the public. This was in line with expectations, given this is a new measurement space where there aren&#8217;t many longstanding experts. We specifically sought feedback on the measurement approach the ABS was taking and the conceptual framework that had been developed. The feedback received is summarised below.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Conceptual framework: </span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span>There was strong support for the framework the ABS developed, to better communicate and understand digital platform workers and work. The distinction the ABS made between labour services and other forms of digital platform work was considered appropriate, along with distinguishing between different types of tasks (e.g. personal transport and food delivery).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Measurement Approach:</span></span></span><br>
There was broad support for the current&#160;<span><span><span>experimental measurement approach the ABS is using. The submissions noted that the priority information is being captured and also identified a range of additional data items that could be collected to broaden and enhance the data collected for the 2023/24 survey cycle. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The feedback provided has been summarised below:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Reference period - expand the timeframe beyond the last four weeks, to ensure people who undertake digital platform work infrequently are included. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Task type &#8211; include further specificity in task types (e.g. type of caring tasks).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Industry &#8211; present an industry distribution of digital platform work.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Digital platform hours worked &#8211; a variety of options were suggested for collecting information on digital platform work hours worked and whether more paid hours were preferred by workers.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Reason for undertaking digital platform work &#8211; ability to select more than one reason.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Working conditions and security - level of control or influence the respondent has over digital platform work arrangements.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Platform use &#8211; Whether multiple platforms are used and how this is managed by the worker. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Safety and risk &#8211; perception of safety at work, understanding of work health and safety obligations, measures available to reduce risk. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Earnings - allowing respondents to report earnings in smaller increments (e.g. less than 10% of earnings, etc).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Other data sources - exploration of other mechanisms for collecting data, such as administrative data.</span></span></span></li>

                    <p><span><span><span>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) commenced public consultation &#8216;Help Shape the Future of Classification on Industries&#8217; on 26 September 2022. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The consultation&#8217;s purpose was to collect information on how the industry classification is currently used by businesses or organisations, understand the issues with the current Australia and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) and whether the revised International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) could meet these needs. The consultation also sought to understand any barriers to implementing a revised ANZSIC or alternate industry classification. This information is to be used in the development of a roadmap to review Australia&#8217;s Standard industrial classification.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Public consultation ran for 9 weeks, 26 September 2022 till 25 November 2022, and specifically sought feedback on:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>The use of industry classifications and the purpose of that use.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The business characteristics of most importance when classifying a business. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The revised ISIC and if it would be a suitable alternative for ANZSIC 2006.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The current issues with ANZSIC 2006 and what users would like to see covered in a future industrial classification.</span></span></span></span></li>

                    <p><span><span><span>The public consultation generated 62 submissions from a wide range of federal government, state government and private industry stakeholders. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The majority of submissions we received highlighted the use of industry classifications for industry specific research, analysis of the Australian economy or for policy development. Users identified that goods and services produced by a business are key characteristics of importance when classifying a business to an industry classification, along with the type of customer a business sells to and how a business produces its output. Other topics of interest were innovation and environmental impact.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Stakeholders were asked to give feedback on the suitability of ISIC as an alternative to ANZSIC. Respondents felt that while ISIC is likely to meet Australia&#8217;s classification requirements at a higher level, it doesn&#8217;t meet more detailed industry classification requirements and that ISIC would need to be expanded to suit Australia&#8217;s classificatory needs. Feedback identified that ISIC focuses heavily on the international economy, with a broad range of industries grouped together and in some circumstances does not have enough detail to reflect Australian industrial activity. &#160;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We received comprehensive feedback on issues associated with ANZSIC 2006 and what stakeholders would like to see included in a future industrial classification. There was widespread acknowledgement from respondents that ANZSIC 2006 hasn&#8217;t kept pace with Australia&#8217;s changing industry structure over the last 15 years and improvements need to be made to the classification. Feedback recommended improvements to classification structure and industry coverage. It also highlighted that users have a diverse range of topics that they would like the industry classification to cover. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Also, feedback was received on issues not directly related to the industry classification, rather information on different business characteristics that users would find valuable and how this information could be linked to industry information to better meet policy objectives.&#160; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Feedback indicated that the benefit of having an updated classification outweighed the initial barriers to implementing a new classification, however, the ABS acknowledges that implementation concerns raised by some respondents will require further exploration and consultation.&#160; We also recognise that not all users&#8217; requirements may be met with an updated classification and that alternate views of that classification may be required. &#160;</span></span></span></p>

                    <p><span><span><span>Based on the feedback provided, the ABS is considering the choice between updating ANZSIC and adopting a localised version of ISIC. A localised version of ISIC could share the structure at a high level, but have further lower level detail to better meet Australian needs. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The ABS needs to do further work to understand the development and implementation costs for the ABS and other stakeholders of an updated industrial classification. </span></span></span></p>

                    <p><span><span><span>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) commenced public consultation on 29 August 2022. The consultation requested feedback on the Australian Standard Classification of Religious Groups (ASCRG) and the Religious Affiliation Standard (RAS), the way the religion question is asked in the Census of Population and Housing. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The aim of the review is to update the ASCRG to reflect the modern Australian community; and ensure the RAS is inclusive. These updates will ensure collection and production of high quality data, improving data analysis and decision making. The public consultation was to confirm the scope of the review and invite feedback to identify any other high priority considerations for the review.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Public consultation ran for 12 weeks, 29 August 2022 till 18 November 2022. The ABS sought feedback on the preliminary scope of the review (below) and requested other issues also be identified.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>2022 Review of ASCRG and RAS, preliminary scope:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Investigation of the RAS &#8211; question wording and pick list<br>
	a. Can the response options be changed to be more inclusive?</span></span></span></span><br>
	<span><span><span><span>b. Consistency between the question wording (refers to a person&#8217;s religion) and the pick list options (a combination of religions and Christian denominations).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Investigation into Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism; and whether it is possible to identify additional religious groups.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Investigation into how Christian Orthodox groups appear in the ASCRG and the RAS. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Investigation into a possible restructure of the classification codes.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Investigation into the structure of Broad Group 7, Secular Beliefs and Other Spiritual Beliefs and No Religious Affiliation. Should secular beliefs continue to be included in a classification of religious groups?</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>Most of the items in the preliminary scope were broadly supported for inclusion in the review. The topics in the preliminary scope that attracted the most submissions were the pick list (content and order of the list) and question wording (scope items 1a and 1b).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In addition to the issues outlined in the scope, a number of other concerns were raised, including:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Concerns around data quality, due to the limited number of options in the pick list.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Concerns about potential bias in the question wording because it assumes a person is affiliated with a religion.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The importance of including the concepts underpinning the classification (e.g. &#8216;affiliation&#8217;) in the review.</span></span></span></li>

                    <p><span><span><span><span><span>This public consultation generated 105 submissions from a wide range of stakeholder groups and sectors of the user community.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span class="Heading3Char"><span><span><span><span>Skills in ANZSCO</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The ABS published a &#8216;Skills Options Paper&#8217; in late June in response to feedback received from the skills problem statement. The paper outlined six proposals that address the key areas of concern identified by users and stakeholders. The ABS received 63 submissions through public consultation. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Feedback in the submissions indicated support for most of the proposals with a very strong preference for proposals one and two. These proposals were flagged as the highest priority and, if implemented, would ensure ANZSCO is better aligned with the current labour market. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The ABS also asked for suggestions on how to include micro-credentials in ANZSCO. A variety of suggestions were received and are now being considered. As responses were varied, further discussions with users and stakeholders are required to determine how best to reflect micro-credentials in the classification. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span class="Heading3Char"><span><span><span><span>Maintaining ANZSCO</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The ABS received 42 submissions from users on the ANZSCO Maintenance Strategy. There was unanimous agreement that the classification no longer accurately reflects the labour market and that major updates are urgently required.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We specifically sought feedback on the timing, frequency and process for reviewing areas of the classification. While our proposed solution of a targeted, annual maintenance model received widespread support, several concerns were raised. These include: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>the gap of 5 years between major updates may be too large to capture important changes in the labour market</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>without an immediate comprehensive update, maintenance will be ineffective</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>proposed prioritisation factors miss important considerations around the economic impacts and specific impacts on affected sectors (especially where they are small)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>users do not have a way to raise issues outside of the consultation rounds</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>level of engagement by ABS will be insufficient if not consulting with industry, and education and training authorities. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We also asked users whether there would be any negative impacts that could arise from the implementation of the model, especially around the timing of updates. No issues were identified, and there was strong support for the timing of the releases. There were additional comments around the importance of aligning implementation around broader government measures to address skills shortages.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We also received a number of considerable change requests for specific areas of the classification, ranging from paramedics to professional organisers. These will be addressed separately as part of the comprehensive review and update by December 2024 in time for the 2026 Census.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The ABS is currently reviewing these submissions and working closely with stakeholders to develop a Skills Position Paper, for release in November 2022.

<p class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Based on the feedback provided through this consultation process, the ABS has reviewed elements of the ANZSCO Maintenance Strategy.

<p class="AAA"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Other concerns raised will require further exploration, for example, the need for updates outside the outlined consultation periods.

<p><strong>2022 targeted update</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Continuing the review work that commenced in 2021, the </span></span></span></span><span><span>ABS sought feedback on <span><span>a</span></span><span><span> proposed list </span></span><span>of 24 construction-related trades occupations to be a focus for 2022.</span><br>
<br>
<span>The list was developed in consultation with the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE), based on the following criteria:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>occupations in ANZSCO Major Group 3 Technicians and Trades Workers at skill level 3,</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>occupations with significant Australian Apprenticeships commencements,</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>occupations traditionally associated with an apprenticeship pathway, that were not included in the 2021 update, and</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>the number of persons employed in the occupation in the 2016 Census of Population and Housing are significant.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Also included were a small number of occupations that were engineering-related rather than construction, but which also satisfied the above criteria.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The ABS received nine submissions from users on these 24 </span>construction-related trades occupations<span>. A common theme across feedback indicated that civil (infrastructure) construction occupations described in ANZSCO no longer accurately reflect the modern workforce and in some instances lack visibility within the classification.&#160;Changes to skill in the modern labour market has meant that some of these occupations described in ANZSCO appear to lack sufficient detail, and no longer reflect the range of skills and competencies required to undertake these occupations.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>However, feedback reflected broad support for the current definition of residential and commercial occupations in ANZSCO, with some suggested additional occupation categories and minor definitional changes to reflect contemporary practice.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Skills&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>he ABS recognises that there is demand for a review of how skills are reflected in the classification. An initial set of k</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>ey issues were defined with our partners and a skills problem statement drafted for consideration by users.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The ABS received thirteen submissions from users supportive of work to improve how skills are reflected in the classification. These submissions provided feedback on the five key issues that were highlighted in the skills problem statement and provided some further suggestions based on other international frameworks for ABS to consider.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Other areas of ANZSCO </strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The ABS received a further 115 submissions identifying areas of the classification users would like updated to </span></span></span><span><span><span>reflect the occupations of a contemporary Australian workforce. Feedback was received from a wide range of industries including health and community services, professional services, manufacturing, technology, and the arts. <span>Feedback will be assessed to assist with planning future updates.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

                    <p><span><span><span>In October 2021, the ABS consulted with users of international trade statistics on priorities for enhancing the quality and breadth of data on &#160;international services statistics, and on changes to content and timing of the monthly international trade publication.&#8217;<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/research/enhancing-quality-australias-international-trade-statistics">Enhancing the quality of Australia&#8217;s international trade statistics</a>&#8217;, outlined the planned and proposed changes to the international merchandise trade publication and the planned and proposed enhancements to services statistics. &#160;</span></span></span></p>

                    <p><span><span><span>10 submissions were received, these came from across federal government, state government and industry. A summary of the feedback can be seen below.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Monthly merchandise trade publication options</b></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Respondents were asked to comment on two publication options. See consultation papers&#160;for more information on the options.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Option 2 was the preferred publication, with over 80% of respondents choosing this preference. The main reason cited for option 2 as the preference was the inclusion of seasonally adjusted data. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Services enhancement projects</b></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Respondents were asked to prioritise the projects (1 through to 4) which were aimed at enhancing the quality and breadth of international trade in services statistics. Those projects were: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>More frequent detailed services statistics;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Statistics on characteristics of service traders;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Monthly indicator statistics; and</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Other (to be specified).</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>More frequent detailed services statistics were rated as the highest priority. Respondents also noted a strong interest in more detailed multi-dimensional cross classified data. The second highest priority was statistics on characteristics of service traders, closely followed by monthly indicator statistics. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Additional feedback</b></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In addition, while respondents recognised the need to change and create opportunities for enhancing the international trade in services statistics, they acknowledged that with the imminent reopening of international borders, access to the full suite of monthly international trade data was critical in the short term for informing policy and insights around the COVID-19 recovery. </span></span></span></p>

                <div class="col-md-9">
                    <p><span><span><span>Given the additional feedback on changes to the monthly trade publication, The ABS has decided, that in the short term, we will continue to produce the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/international-trade-goods-and-services-australia/latest-release">International Trade in Goods and Services, Australia</a> publication in its current form, with no changes to timing or content. The ABS will look to revisit discussions with users on the original options proposed as part of this consultation through 2022.&#160;The feedback received on the publication options and services enhancement projects will be used to help inform these discussions. &#160;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Of the services enhancements, the immediate focus will be to enhance the quarterly Survey of International Trade in Services, with a particular focus on moving the survey collection timing in line with the reference period. The priority and timing of other services enhancement projects (as outlined in the paper), is still being discussed, noting further enhancements may not be possible in the short term while the extended set of international trade data continue to be produced. More information on the service enhancement projects will be made available in 2022.</span></span></span></p>

                    <p>In preparation for the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) the ABS has been consulting with stakeholders to ensure this framework is still meeting user needs. Between May and July 2019, we invited all stakeholders to contribute their views and provide feedback on the ASGS.</p>

                    <p>A total of 75 submissions were received with major representations from Commonwealth Government Departments (22%), State Government Departments (18%) and Businesses (18%).</p>

<p>A summary of feedback is presented below:</p>

<p><b>Urban Centres and Localities </b></p>

<ul>
	<li>67% of respondents were positive about using Mesh Blocks as the building blocks of Urban Centres and Localities. They noted that urban areas would be more accurately defined using Mesh Blocks, especially on the fringe of urban centres. 5% of respondents were negative about the proposed changes, with the main concerns being: less data available at the Mesh Block level and less stability over time.</li>
	<li>Regarding allowing non-contiguous Urban Centres, 37% of respondents did not foresee any issues, noting that it would provide a more accurate definition of urban and rural areas. However, 19% of respondents did raise issues such as; difficulties in spatial analysis, difficulties in mapping Urban Centres, and non-contiguous Urban Centres crossing other boundaries (such as Local Government Areas).</li>
	<li>76% of submissions supported the inclusion of a Rural Residential category, with no oppositions to the inclusion. Respondents commented on the increasing need for a definition of this type of settlement to enable consistent statistical analysis.</li>
	<li>The density criteria proposed for identifying Rural Residential Mesh Blocks received a wide range of responses. 47% or respondents supported the proposed criteria and 5% did not. Supportive respondents agreed that the proposed density criteria of &gt;25 psns per sqkm would accurately reflect areas of rural residential character. However, there was concern from other respondents that this density threshold would be too low and capture some rural areas as a result.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Commonwealth and State Electoral Divisions </b></p>

<p>63% of respondents were positive and 5% were negative about building CEDs and SEDs from Mesh Blocks rather than SA1s. Respondents who were positive said that this change will result in more accurate electoral boundary approximations and allow for more precise data analysis. However, there was also concern around having less data available at the Mesh Block level.</p>

<p><b>Environmental Boundaries </b></p>

<p>65% of respondents said that they do not use Natural Resource Management Regions (NRMRs) and Australian Drainage Divisions, and only 9% of respondents find them to be useful.</p>

<p>A number of other environmental boundaries were suggested for inclusion in the ASGS, these included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Flood maps</li>
	<li>Water and sewerage distribution areas</li>
	<li>Climate classifications</li>
	<li>Weather districts</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Coding Structure </b></p>

<p>On the removal of short codes for SA1s and SA2s, 43% were positive and 12% were negative. Many see the use of two different codes confusing, and consider that long codes are preferable as they are clear and hierarchical. The main reasons why respondents were not supportive of this change were that; short codes are easier to display, they are easier to reference, and it is difficult to change systems that have already integrated short codes.</p>

<p><b>Improving the ASGS and Design Principles </b></p>

<p>Overall, respondents were supportive of the ASGS design principles and thought they were comprehensive. Coherence was commonly recognised as being the most important principle, especially as it contributes to stability and consistency across the statistical boundaries. Consistency around growth areas was identified as an issue, along with ASGS boundaries needing to be consistently named across ABS products. Additionally, several comments were made in relation to the Interpretability principle, particularly that more effort should be placed on the alignment of boundaries to significant and stable boundaries.</p>

<p>A total of 49 specific boundary change requests were received, ranging from SA4 down to SA1 level. Each of these detailed boundary suggestions will be considered in 2021 design.</p>

                impressions on bedding surfaces of fine to medium-grained sedimentary 
                rocks. Ostensibly, these organisms were very thin, lacked any

                and had a quilt-like outer surface. Some uncertainty exists as 
                to what groups of animals these fossils might represent, and, 
                in fact, if they were ancestral to the multicellular organisms

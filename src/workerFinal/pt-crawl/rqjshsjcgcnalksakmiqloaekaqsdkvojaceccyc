I don't make a dime writing for Bleacher Report, but I do it anyway, because I love this sport and want a platform where I can express my thoughts to a group that shares my passion.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">While you're putting in early mornings and late nights, I'm doing the same thing for less return. I too put in early mornings and late nights, sandwiching writing and involvement in this community around a full-time job and a family. And I'm finding the time to conduct interviews too, because I'm dedicated to not only improving myself as a writer but improving the overall quality of material here at Bleacher Report.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-53735041" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_02" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">And I'm not alone in that fight.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">While some here may only have a passing interest, there are others like myself who certainly do not, and to label the entire writing community here as a "bunch of terrible writers" is ridiculous. Because among the "army of amateurs" you describe, there are some damn fine writers.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">In truth, sites like Bleacher Report are essential in helping improve the overall quality of coverage available in the media. Bloody Elbow sure isn't going to give someone an opportunity to try their hand at writing about the sport, so being able to write for a knowledgeable community like this is a great tool for aspiring writers. Everyone has to start somewhere.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">I have zero training as a writer, and I only turned my focus to mixed martial arts nine months ago. Bleacher Report was one of my first stops. Since then, I'd like to think my work has improved by leaps and bounds, and it's because the great writers and community members here have helped me, as well as the opportunities Bleacher Report has given me.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">I'm always amused that the admission of "sour grapes" comes well after the string of insults. We get one little offering wrapped between minutes of biased bashing of an entire group.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The funny thing, to me, about your  argument against Bleacher Report is that the exact opposite effect is true. I was once told B/R wants to be the "college football" of sports sites—a feeder system where no one gets paid, but they gain exposure and the truly talented members move on to something bigger and better.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-117563927" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The fact that you acknowledged Derek Bolander is a perfect illustration of what Bleacher Report wants to do, and it shows that it happens.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Yes, for every Derek there are a number of people who certainly aren't able to "go pro," but that isn't the point. The point is to give guys like me a chance to develop and see if I can take the jump to the next level at some point.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">You said in the interview that you scout writers; well, you should be paying closer attention to Bleacher Report. They want to be your feeder system, but you're too busy labeling what we do here as "toothless amateur coverage" to realize there is some serious talent here.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Is the UFC playing it fast-and-loose with the term "real media" in your estimation when they credential Bleacher Report? Absolutely, but that doesn't mean the one time you've interacted with a writer from B/R is a fair assessment of the talent and ability of the group as a whole or me personally.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">According to you, I'm one of the "terrible writers" who is "lowering the quality of the work" in the MMA media.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Well, I'm standing at the front doors of "the Walmart of journalism" offering you a challenge.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Let me know what you want to do.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Hope to hear from you soon,</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">E.

<h1>Celebrating the life of a Legend: <br>
David Kiyaga-Mulindwa</h1>

<h2>By Phillip Segadika [<a href="#endnote">*</a>]</h2>

<p>Botswana Teachers day, June 5th was an appropriate day to commemorate the 
life and mourn the death of Dr. David Kiyaga-Mulindwa who died on the 
16th of May in Uganda at age 63. He was known to thousands of University 
of Botswana students as he taught history and later archaeology at the 
University of Botswana between 1976 and 1993.</p> 

<p>A portion of his obituary says a lot about a man who has been described 
as an authority on the history and archaeology of west, southern and east 
Africa and apparently the first native Ugandan graduate of archaeology:</p>

<blockquote> Prof DKM as he was affectionately called by colleagues and former 
 students had a varied academic career. From 1970-1972, he was a 
 curator of History and Archeology at the Uganda National Museum 
 in Kampala, Uganda. From 1974-1976 he was a Research Assistant in 
 the Department of Archeology at the University of Legon in Ghana. 
 Between 1976 and 1993 Prof DKM worked and held a number of positions 
 at the University of Botswana, where he was Lecturer and was promoted 
 to Senior lecturer. He was a Founder and Coordinator of the 
 Archeology Unit of the University of Botswana from 1985-1993. 
 Between 1993 and 1996 he was a Consultant and Research Affiliate 
 at the Centre for Basic Research in Kampala, Uganda. Between 1996 
 and 1997 he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Fort Hare. 
 Until his untimely death, DKM was an Associate Professor and Chairman 
 of the Programme Committee, History Department, Kyambogo University- Kampala.</blockquote>

<p>Speaking at the memorial service organized by the Department of history 
and archaeology, speakers hailed Kiyaga-Mulindwa as a legend whose 
academic sharpness, infectious laughter, continuous humour and 
tolerance will be missed by many.  Professor Parsons almost 
confused the mourners by saying Dr. Kiyaga Mulindwa must rest 
"not in peace, but in activity". He explained that the soul of 
Mulindwa - the archaeologist and searcher of knowledge should 
continue to ask 'those in heaven' to explain to him the many things 
he had spent his entire life searching for. He credited Dr. Mulindwa's 
passion in archaeology for the birth of the archaeology division of the 
University of Botswana, which grew out of the history department. For 
her part Dr Alinah Segobye, a senior lecturer at UB, and herself a 
former student of Mulindwa quoted several messages that she received 
from several world renowned archaeologists including Professor 
Thomas Tlou, Professor Posnansky and Dr. Jeanette Deacon who 
described David as "an intellectual giant', 'humane' and a "fine man". 
Dr Kiyaga-Mulindwas's daugher in law, Balladiah Chingapane who relayed 
the family appreciation to UB for hosting the memorial explained that 
David died, of a rare heart condition,  after three weeks of 
hospitalization, during which time diagnosis did not 
reveal the cause of illness.</p>

<h2>Personal memories</h2>
<p>After the memorial service I still felt a bit unhealed of the 
loss of my teacher and mentor. If I had an opportunity to share of my 
experience with Dr Kiyaga-Mulindwa I would mention four things that 
stand out:  first, being the fact that he influenced (in fact, instructed!) 
me to take up the archaeology career. And I am ever so grateful he did.</p>

<p>In 1992, as a second year history student I was fortunate enough to 
be introduced to his 8 weeks fieldwork at Lose and Mookotso sites 
(in Eastern Botswana)) and Mmakodu site (at the foot of the Tswapong 
hills near Majwaneng village in East Central Botswana). Walking 
around Mookotso hillock was my first experience of archaeological 
site location by foot survey. After several kilometers of walking 
in lines at regular intervals of about 40 metres, one of the six 
students shouted that he had discovered something that looked like 
a burnt brick on a little mound. We all came together and did more 
search around the 50 cm high mound of about a meter wide. Dr. Mulindwa 
explained that we would be doing excavations there the following week, 
explaining that the little sun burnt brick on a mound was possibly the 
"tip" of a fallen house. That was a great lesson with lasting 
impression for me because after several days of meticulous excavation, 
screening, brushing and water floating techniques we then came to an 
exciting layer: At 45 centimeters we discovered clay cattle 
figurines, the remains of a hearth with charcoal and some pottery. 
All these were buried under some rubble that consisted of pole 
impressions on clay soil suggesting that the house was built in 
what I later knew to be 'wattle and daub' technique. We further 
discovered some potsherds, bones and more charcoal which he was 
quick to point out would be used to date the site.  I was so excited 
that before switching off my torch in the tent that evening I had 
written down the first verse of a poem:</p>


<blockquote class="ps-poem">Now with a trowel I dig<br />
hoping to exhume something big<br />
anything those of old did use or own<br />
from pottery to beads and bone</blockquote>


<p>My other experience of excavation under the tutelage of Mulindwa 
was at 'Makodu site' which was declared a National monument in 
September 2006. At Mmakodu site Mulindwa introduced us to a site, 
which demonstrated active mining for iron ore and subsequent 
smelting of the same by the inhabitants about 1000 years ago. 
Up the Majwaneng hill are several massive borrow pits (some of 
them 3 metres deep and up to twelve meters wide) where, apparently, 
the Mmakodu inhabitants mined the ore before ferrying it down to 
smelt it near the mighty Majwaneng baobabs. Together with a team 
from Sweden led by Mats Widgren, a human geographer, we helped map 
the site using an Electronic Distance Measurer to produce 3D 
image of the Mmakodu mines. This site and that of Lose were 
later to inform Kiyaga-Mulindwa and Segobye's arguments on 'urban origins' 
in southern Africa and particularly Botswana.</p> 

<p>There was the funny side too. In the field excursions at Mookotso site 
Mulindwa argued that he could speak fluent Setswana. So we started conversing 
with him in Setswana, until one-day, when he probably thought he should 
demonstrate his grasp of the vernacular. One of the students, then Amayo 
Khudu, asked him in Setswana where the sharp ended trowel was - to rescue 
a badly corroded spearhead. To this Mulindwa responded slowly and with 
confidence "ga ke na le nayo" instead of "ga ke na yone/nayo" We 
could not hold the giggles as we noted his very "fluent" Setswana.</p>

<p>As I was struggling with the loss of Dr. Mulindwa I peeped through the 
internet pages and noted that he took away Botswana with him wherever 
he went, continuing to publish about aspects of what he garnered while 
in Botswana and other parts of Africa. In one of his latest articles 
he repeated something that he was passionate about:  that Kalahari 
Desert environs were wrongfully thought to be devoid of archaeological 
relics, especially by the Apartheid white racist regime and academics 
that were biased on showcasing the brevity of black occupation 
of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>I do hope that, in the after-life, Dr. Mulindwa is in the company 
of the Transcendent Archaeologist who will do the ultimate excavation 
when the 'dead shall be resurrected' to account, not on oral 
traditions or archaeological evidence, but a candid story on 
the gamut of how we responded while contained in the physical. 
May his soul rest in peace.</p>

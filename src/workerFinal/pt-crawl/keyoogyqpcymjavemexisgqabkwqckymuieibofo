    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#99CCCC"><p>When confronted by the challenge of treating this new disease, physicians turned to the theory of four humors.&nbsp; Too much phlegm was most often blamed for the pox.&nbsp; To reduce the excess phlegm physicians recommended a variety of treatments to  promote spitting and/or sweating. </p>
      <p>But syphilis arrived in the Old World at a time when the unerring authority of Greek knowledge was under scrutiny.&nbsp; In Lecture 6 we introduced Paracelsus (1493-1541), the enigmatic German practitioner who questioned the idea that health and disease was a matter of a one-size-fits-all humoral balancing act.&nbsp; He wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If the physician is to understand the correct meaning of health, he must know that there are more than a hundred, indeed more than a thousand, kinds of stomach; consequently, if you gather a thousand persons, each of them will have a different kind of digestion, each unlike the others.&nbsp; One digests more, the other less, and yet each stomach is suitable to the man it belongs to....&nbsp; Therefore the various dietary prescriptions should be observed not only for the sake of recovery from illness but also for the sake of prescribing one's health.&nbsp; There are a hundred forms of health in the liver; each man has a different one.&nbsp; It follows that no one drinks the same amount as another, that no one has the same thirst as another; this is explained by the diverse kinds of health, which must not be described as illnesses. </p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p>Paracelsus listed  five principles or influences that can act alone or in complex combinations to cause disease:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the stars</li>
        <li>poisons</li>
        <li>disintegration of the natural constitution</li>
        <li>spiritual causes</li>
        <li>divine causes  </li>
      </ul>      
      <p> To find an effective remedy for a patient's illness,  Paracelsus told physicians to look beyond the obvious symptoms to the disease itself:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>For there is no sickness against which some remedy has not been created and established, to drive it out and cure it.&nbsp; There is always some remedy a herb against one disease, a root against another, a water against one, a stone against another, a mineral against one, a poison against another, a metal against one, something else against another.</p>
        <p>The nature and force of a disease must be discovered by their cause and not by their symptoms ... for we must not merely extinguish the smoke of the fire but the fire itself.&nbsp; If we want the earth to produce better grass, we must plow it, and not merely tear out the bad grass.&nbsp; Similarly the physician ... should direct his thought to the origin of the disease, and not only to that which his eyes see.&nbsp; For in this he would see but the symptoms and not the origin....</p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p>In Paracelsus's view, reducing a patient's excess phlegm would do little to cure the disease.&nbsp; &quot;A good remedy was worth as much a thousand years ago as it is now,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and a bad remedy was then as worthless as it is now....&nbsp; The tares among the corn are as old as the corn, nevertheless, they cannot be used instead of the corn.&nbsp; In my opinion, the world should awaken to this fact, and because the good surpasses the bad in worth, we should abandon the bad....&quot; </p>
      <p>A key element in Paracelsus's approach to health and disease was his belief that man is a microcosmic reflection of the macrocosm at large:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The mysteries of the Great and the Little World [macrocosm/microcosm; universe/man] are distinguished only by the form in which they manifest themselves; for they are only <em>one</em> thing, <em>one</em> being.&nbsp; Heaven and earth have been created out of nothingness, but they are composed of three things -- mercury, sulfur, and salt ....&nbsp; Of these same three things the planets and the stars consist; and not only the stars but all bodies that grow and are born from them.&nbsp; And just as the Great World is thus built upon the three primordial substances, so man -- the Little World -- was composed of the same substances.&nbsp; Thus man, too, is nothing but mercury, sulfur, and salt. </p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p>For this reason, remedies for what ails the world within us are to be found in the world around us:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Everything external in nature points to something internal; for nature is both inside man and outside man....&nbsp; [T]here is in the world a natural order of apothecary's shops, for all the fields and meadows, all the mountains and hills are such shops.&nbsp; Nature has given us all of them, from which to fill our own shops.&nbsp; All nature is like one single apothecary's shop, covered only with the roof of heaven; and only One Being works the pestle as far as the world extends.&nbsp; But man has such a shop only in part, not wholly; he possesses something, not everything.&nbsp; For nature's apothecary's shop is greater than man's. </p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p>To prescribe well, a physician must learn &quot;where nature has her pharmacies, where her virtues have been written down, and in what boxes they are stored.&quot;&nbsp; Thus Paracelsus found nature's remedy for syphilis: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Quicksilver manifests itself in three forms.&nbsp; In the first it is still unborn; in the second it is as it is in itself; in the third it appears such as it has been prepared by the alchemist's art....&nbsp; Upon these three forms of manifestation of <em>mercurius</em>, or quicksilver, is based the cure of the French disease. </p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p>Paracelsus was not the only one advocating the use of mercury as a remedy for syphilis.&nbsp; It had served as the basis of medicines long used by Arab physicians to treat skin disorders and rashes.&nbsp; Mercury's use appealed to Galenists as well since it induces copious salivation (a classic sign of mercury poisoning) thus helping the patient to expel excess phlegm.</p>	  </td>

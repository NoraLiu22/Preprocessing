<title>Le Chevalier de Saint-George, Afro-French Composer, Violinist & Conductor</title>
<meta name="description" content="Joseph de Bologne, the Chevalier de Saint-George (also called Joseph Boulogne, the Chevalier de Saint-Georges) was an Afro-French composer, violinist and conductor who was born in the French colony of Guadeloupe on December 25, 1745. First known as an athlete and France's finest fencer, Saint-George quickly developed an impressive musical reputation as a composer, violinist and conductor of two of France's finest orchestras. He played music with Queen Marie-Antoniette regularly, but joined the French Revolution and soon became Colonel of 1,000 volunteers of color. He served heroically but was imprisoned for political reasons. Upon release he traveled to Haiti, then returned to conduct his final orchestra, the Circle of Harmony. Saint-George died in Paris on June 10, 1799. His life and music were ignored for nearly two centuries until their rediscovery by musicians and historians in the  late 20th century. A DVD of his life is &quot;Le Mozart Noir&quot;, based on a television documentary seen on television in many countries.">

				Joseph de Bologne's father was George de Bologne de 
				Saint-Georges, a member of a wealthy family which had lived 
				in the French West Indies colony of Guadeloupe since 1645.&nbsp; He 
				married Élisabeth Merican on September 8, 1739.&nbsp; By January, 1740 
				he had moved to a 250-acre plantation with 60 slaves.&nbsp; One of the 
				slaves was an attractive young woman about 17 who was named Anne 
				but was called Nanon.&nbsp; She was of African descent and was born on 
				the island.&nbsp; George and Nanon began an intimate relationship 
				shortly after his arrival.&nbsp; Their son Joseph de Bologne came into 
				the world on Christmas Day, 1745.&nbsp; His African heritage made him 
				ineligible for the nobility and its titles under French law. <br>
				<br>
				</font><font style="font-size: 11pt"><b><a name="6"></a>6 Fugitive</b></font><font size="2"><br>
				George de Bologne soon found himself a fugitive.&nbsp; On December 
				17, 1747 he fatally wounded a man in a fencing duel caused by a 
				drunken quarrel.&nbsp; He fled Guadeloupe secretly the following month 
				to avoid a charge of homicide.&nbsp; In spite of his absence he was 
				sentenced to death on March 31, 1748 and his goods were ordered 
				confiscated.&nbsp; Surprisingly, his wife Élisabeth was given 
				permission on September 1, 1748 to leave the island with Joseph 
				and Nanon.&nbsp; Joseph turned 3 at sea and arrived in France on 
				January 4, 1749.&nbsp; The Bologne family used its influence with the 
				royal court to secure a pardon for George from King Louis XV.&nbsp; Joseph and his parents sailed from Bordeaux, France on September 
				2, 1749.&nbsp; The ship's manifest said George was 38, Nanon was 26 
				and Joseph was 3 years old. <br>

				</font></font><font SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Young Joseph lived a 
				privileged life on the plantation.&nbsp; He had ample time to play, 
				and his father gave him lessons in music and fencing.&nbsp; When he 
				was 8 years old, Joseph sailed for Bordeaux with Élisabeth to 
				start school, arriving on August 12, 1753.&nbsp; Nanon landed at the 
				same port on September 10, 1754 and visited Joseph for several 
				weeks.&nbsp; Nanon and George arrived back in France on September 10, 
				1755.&nbsp; They took Joseph to live with them in the fashionable 
				Saint-Germain quarter of Paris.&nbsp; On April 1, 1757, Pierre Bardin 
				tells us, George obtained the position of Gentleman of the 
				King's Chamber, which meant he was a personal assistant to King 
				Louis XV.<br>

				Joseph's life changed radically the following year.&nbsp; In October, 
				1756 the 13-year-old entered the fencing academy of Nicolas 
				Texier de La Böessière, an elite boarding school for the sons of 
				the aristocracy.&nbsp; Mornings at the academy consisted of classes in 
				mathematics, history, foreign languages, music, drawing and 
				dance.&nbsp; Afternoons were devoted to the most important subject, 
				fencing.&nbsp; Joseph trained alongside the son of La Böessière and 
				became a friend of the family.&nbsp; The younger La Böessière later 
				wrote that Saint-Georges was the most extraordinary man of arms 
				ever seen.&nbsp; Training in horsemanship took place at the Tuileries 
				under expert guidance.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

				Saint-Georges' trips to England introduced him to the country's 
				anti-slavery movement.&nbsp; He helped found a French group called the Société des amis des noirs [Society of the Friends of Black 
				People].&nbsp; He also produced a children's musical,&nbsp; <i>Aline et Dupré 
				ou Le Marchand des marrons [Aline and Dupré or The Chestnut 
				Seller].</i>&nbsp; It was staged on August 9, 1788.&nbsp; As a violinist, 
				Saint-Georges gave concerts in England as well as France.&nbsp; One 
				dark evening in January 1790 on which he was scheduled to 
				perform in England he was walking alone, carrying his violin, 
				when a man with a pistol and a stick tried to rob him.&nbsp; He fought 
				off the robber, only to be attacked by 4 more men.&nbsp; He 
				overpowered them as well.&nbsp; Gabriel Banat argues that 
				Saint-Georges' support for the liberation of slaves was known in 
				England, ...and no doubt sufficiently irritating to Britain's 
				slave cartel to make them try to eliminate him.<br>

				Saint-Georges was living in Lille when the French Revolution 
				broke out in July, 1789.&nbsp; He joined the National Guard in Lille 
				later that year.&nbsp; He obtained the rank of Captain in 1790.&nbsp; Saint-Georges the soldier was still a musician and a fencer, so 
				he organized concerts and fencing demonstrations in Lille while 
				stationed in the city.&nbsp; He even wrote an opera, 
				<i>Guillaume-Tout-Coeur ou les Amis de village [William-All-Heart 
				or The Village Friends].</i>&nbsp; An actor from Lille wrote the lyrics 
				for the work, which was performed September 8, 1790.&nbsp; Saint-Georges' connections with the Ancien Régime now made him 
				the object of great suspicion, so he began signing his name as 
				either Saint-George or simply George.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font style="font-size: 11pt"><b><a name="35"></a>35 Saint-George Legion</b></font><font size="2"><br>
				Members of the National Guard were asked to volunteer for active 
				duty, so Saint-Georges enlisted on June 21, 1791 as an 
				aide-de-camp to two generals.&nbsp; He soon received another call to 
				duty.&nbsp; On September 1, 1791 a delegation of men of color, led by Julien Raimond of Saint-Domingue, asked the National Assembly to 
				allow them to fight in defense of the Revolution and its 
				egalitarian ideals.&nbsp; The next day, the Assembly approved a corps 
				comprised mainly of men of color, with 800 infantry and 200 
				cavalry personnel.&nbsp; Saint-Georges was appointed to be its Colonel.&nbsp; Its official name was légion franche de cavalerie des 
				Américains, but it soon became known to all as the légion 
				Saint-George [Saint-George Legion]. The Colonel chose his friend 
				and protege Alexandre Dumas as Lieutenant-Colonel.&nbsp; Like his 
				Colonel, he was the son of a French aristocrat and an African 
				slave.&nbsp; He later had a son, also named Alexandre Dumas, who won 
				fame as author of <i>The Three Musketeers.</i><br>

				led his own troops and others, fighting on the front lines even 
				though his rank did not require it.&nbsp; The Austrians were 
				ultimately repulsed and Saint-Georges proudly informed the 
				Convention of the victory.&nbsp; Soon, however, the authorities began 
				removing men of color from the Legion.&nbsp; They renamed it the 13e Régiment de chasseurs [13th Combat Regiment].&nbsp; Many men of color 
				in the infantry were sent to the colonies to put down slave 
				rebellions.&nbsp; Critics, including Alexandre Dumas, tried to 
				undermine Saint-Georges' position.&nbsp; They blamed him for chronic

				Neerwinden, Belgium in March and had subsequently made a secret 
				armistice with Austria.&nbsp; He intended to capture Lille, crown the 
				son of the dead King as Louis XVII, and use the city as a base 
				for regaining control of France for the monarchy.&nbsp; Dumouriez sent 
				General Miaczinski to a town near Lille with 4,000 troops.&nbsp; Miaczinski told Saint-Georges and Alexandre Dumas of the plan in 
				person.&nbsp; They let him believe they would allow his soldiers to 
				seize Lille.&nbsp; When the time came for him to take control of 
				Lille, Miaczinski brought only a small escort.&nbsp; Saint-Georges and 
				Dumas arrested him and sent him to Paris, where he was executed.&nbsp; His troops did not try to take the city; Dumouriez took refuge 
				outside France; and the young French Republic was saved.</font></font></p>

				<a name="41"></a>41 Nanon Found Again</b></font><font size="2"><br>
				</font></font><font SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">
On 12 February 2015, Pierre Bardin, eminent biographer of Le Chevalier de Saint Georges, announced a sensational discovery on the website :<br><br>

Généologie et Histoire de la Caraïbe  <a href="http://www.ghcaraibe.org/articles/2015-art01.pdf">www.ghcaraibe.org/articles/2015-art01.pdf</a><br><br>

Here is a summary of his discovery.  However, we recommend that you consult the above-mentioned website for more ample information about the documents on Anne Nanon, the mother of Le Chevalier de Saint-Georges, unearthed by Pierre Bardin from notary and registry office archives of the period.<br><br>

<i>Among all the people who lived by Saint-Georges side, just one person, yet so important, had escaped me:  Anne Nanon, his mother, born on the island of Guadeloupe.  Yet, it was not for want of looking.  Today the blanks can finally be filled in.</i><br><br>

It is in this preamble that Pierre Bardin relates the progress of his fascinating research.  He found the last trace of the mother of Saint-Georges.<br><br>

Anne Nanon died during a difficult period in the life of Saint-Georges.  Arrested on 26 October 1793, then imprisoned in the Castle of Hondainville, close to Clermont sur Oise, Saint-Georges will only be released on 23 October 1794 and vainly try to regain the command of his battalion.<br><br>

<i>No doubt weary of all these changes of fortune, tired by his illness (an ulcer or cancer of the bladder), at the very least disappointed if not bitter, he resumed playing the violin.  Very soon those who knew him said he had never played as well,</i> Pierre Bardin writes.<br><br>

It is in these circumstances that Nanon died on 16 December 1795.  When Saint-Georges went to the notary on 29 March 1796 to close his mothers succession, Nanon had passed away four months before.  The testament mentions that he was the sole and unique heir of his late mother, which is no surprise.  But what is disconcerting is that his mother had changed names.  It is no longer a question of Anne Nanon but of Citizen Anne Danneveau.<br><br>

We also learn that Nicolas Benjamin La Boëssière, who was his fencing master and spiritual father, had received mandate to settle the succession.<br><br>

Long before she died, Nanon had recorded a testamentary deed dated 18 June 1778, signed Anne Danneveau, by which <i>she gives and bequeaths to Mr. De Boulogne St-George, living rue Saint Pierre, all her belongings, pieces of furniture  and properties belonging to her on the day of her death.</i><br><br>

According to Pierre Bardin, this testament shows Nanons deliberate desire, out of motherly love, to deprive herself of her real identity to conceal the African origins of Saint-Georges.<br><br>

After her death, Nanons neighbours restored her identity, the death certificate of 16 December 1795 found by Pierre Bardin giving proof of this change of names.<br>
One of her neighbours, Citizen Jean Dieudonné Descoings, testified to the justice of peace that <i>today at 11.00 AM Citizen Nannon died, being about 60 years of age, living in her house on the fourth floor in front the (above-mentioned) deceased was alone with no heir present</i><br><br>

The justice of peace immediately went to the address mentioned, climbed to the fourth floor and entered <i>a room lit by two windows above the rue des Boucheries</i> where he can see <i>the dead body of a black woman lying on a straw mattress on a wooden bed which the so-called Descoings and those mentioned below declared to be the body of the above-mentioned Citizen Nannon.</i><br><br>

The witnesses were Descoings, the owner, a neighbor named Legendre, present when she died, and a neighbor who took care of Nanon during her illness and who had closed her eyes.
Pierre Bardin was stupefied when discovering the name of this woman:  Claire BARDIN!!!<br><br>

It was not possible to discover the place where Nanon was buried.  Why not in the churchyard of Sainte-Marguerite where Saint-Georges was laid to rest four years later?<br><br>

Pierre Bardin ends his communication with a remark of his wifes, whose constant support he  was able to count on.  Seeing how puzzled he was when discovering this name, she said, <i>Its your name that closed her eyes and your name that brought her back to light again.</i>

				disfavor. Napoleon Bonaparte sent troops to Guadeloupe and 
				Saint-Domingue in 1802 with orders to reinstitute slavery.&nbsp; People of color on Guadeloupe fought valiantly under Louis Delgrès, but on May 28, 1802 their defenses fell to General 
				Antoine Richepance. Rather than live as slaves again, hundreds 
				of people blew themselves up in a gunpowder warehouse.&nbsp; Emancipation would not return until 1848. The assault on Saint-Domingue 
				killed people of color by the thousands and still France could 
				not regain control. The former colony declared its independence 
				in 1804, becoming the first Black republic in the world. People 
				of color in France suffered setbacks as well. On May 29, 1802 a

				and variety used to structure the speech and express passions 
				must be added the influence of French cultural trends such as 
				choreographic art, sentimental style and romance or love

lyrics written by Brian Hageman<P>
<HR>
<P>A delicious turn.  Things have taken a turn for the delicious.  
Like you'd baked a cake with frosting and cough drops.  Uncle Tasty, it's his day today.  Everything's so tasty.  
I wish Mother were here.  She'd like this so much.  The stage coach is like her.  In happiness and she's so famous.  
My mother is stuck together from it.  Like syrup in a tree and a tap on it.  And it's so happy.  
Mother Delicious and Uncle Tasty.  They could move their feet in circles over something like this.  
They could swing the dog in a blanket like Goliath the monster, the fat man who tasted too much.  
I am round, too, from the tasting, just like Mother Delicious and Uncle Tasty.<BR>

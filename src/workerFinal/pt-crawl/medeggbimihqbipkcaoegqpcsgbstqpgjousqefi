<h3>I.  Introduction</h3> 
<P>
Throughout Washington, companies and associations are gearing
up for a legislative battle over specialized or <I>sui generis</i> intellectual
property protection for databases. The outcome of this battle
could have a significant impact on the market for information,
which in turn could affect activities dependent on that information,
such as research for academic and commercial purposes. The article
provides an overview of the roots of the current debate and the
arguments for and against some of the recent proposals.
<p>
<h3>II.  History of Database Protection</h3> 
<P>
The present debate regarding database protection can be viewed
simply as an extension of the historical clash between two conflicting
models of copyright protection for compilations. The first model
advocates that databases and factual compilations receive protection
per se, i.e., without any showing of creativity or original authorship.
Proponents of this theory, better known as the &quot;sweat of
the brow&quot; or &quot;industrious collection&quot; doctrine,
justify their position by arguing that protection should be extended
to databases as a reward for the hard work and investment required
to compile the facts and information contained in the database.
Such a reward provides compilers with the incentive to develop
new databases. Under this doctrine, protection extends to the
otherwise unprotected facts contained in the compilation.
<P>
The second model of intellectual property rejects the notion that
databases without any originality or creativity should be protected.
Instead, advocates of the second model would only extend copyright
protection to the &quot;expression&quot; contained in the database,
which is limited to the original selection, coordination, or arrangement
of facts in the database -- but not the facts themselves.
<P>
Prior to 1991, the extension of copyright protection for databases
and other factual compilations remained an unsettled issue in
U.S. courts. Most courts refused to grant copyright protection
for databases that did not contain any &quot;originality&quot;
in the selection or arrangement of facts,[<A HREF = "#note1">1</a>] and Congress adopted
this view in the 1976 Copyright Act. There, Congress explicitly
stated that a copyright in a compilation extended only to the
original selection, coordination in arrangement of material in
the compilation. 
<P>
Nonetheless, a minority of courts before and after the 1976 Act
adopted the &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; doctrine and protected
databases that lacked any element of creativity or original expression.[<A 
HREF = "#note2">2</a>]  
In the 1991 case of <I>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone
Service Co., Inc.</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court resolved the issue that
had divided the lower courts and unanimously rejected the &quot;sweat
of the brow&quot; or &quot;industrious collection&quot; doctrine.[<A
HREF = "#note3">3</a>] 
Moreover, even though the Court recognized that the selection
and arrangement of facts could create the requisite &quot;originality&quot;
for copyright protection, it emphasized that the copyright in
the compilation would be &quot;thin,&quot; i.e., it would extend
to the particular selection or arrangement of facts but not to
the facts themselves. Thus, by rejecting the notion that databases
could be copyrighted without demonstrating originality and emphasizing
that facts and ideas are not copyrightable, the Court appeared
to settle the long-standing clash between the two conflicting
models of compilation protection.
<p>
<h3>III. Recent Developments</h3>
<p>
<b>A.  The European Database Directive 
</b>

<P>
Soon after the issuance of the <I>Feist</i>  decision, the European Commission
began consideration of a directive intended to harmonize the disparate
intellectual property treatment of databases throughout the member
states of the European Union. Ultimately, in the Spring of 1996,
it adopted the Database Directive which included a two tier approach.
The top tier provided <I>Feist</i> -like protection-that is, copyright
protection for original selection and arrangement of facts in
the database. A second tier provided <I>sui generis</I> protection, prohibiting
the unfair extraction of a substantial part of a database reflecting
significant investment. A database could simultaneously receive
both types of protection: copyright protection for the expression
-the selection and arrangement of the data; and <I>sui generis</i> protection
against the extraction of a qualitatively substantial part of
the data itself. The <I>sui generis</i> protection lasts 15&nbsp;years,
while the copyright protection lasts for the life of the author
plus 70 years. The Directive requires implementation in the member
states of the European Union by the beginning of 1998.
<p>
<b>B.  H.R. 3531 
</b>

<P>
Shortly after the adoption of the Database Directive in Europe,
Congressman Carlos Moorehead, then Chairman of the House Subcommittee
on Courts and Intellectual Property, introduced H.R. 3531, &quot;The
Database Investment and Intellectual Antipiracy Act of 1996.&quot;
Modeled on the European Database Directive, H.R. 3531 would also
have prohibited the unfair extraction of a substantial part of
a database. H.R. 3531, however, had fewer exceptions than the
Database Directive and a significantly longer term of protection
-- 25&nbsp;years. Chairman Moorhead held no hearings on H.R. 3531,
and it died with the close of the 104th Congress.
<p>
<b>C.  The Database Treaty 
</b>
<P>
On the same day that Chairman Moorhead introduced H.R. 3531 in
Congress, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Bruce Lehman,
proposed a virtually identical text to the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) meeting in Geneva. The WIPO had for five
years been considering a variety of proposals for inclusion in
intellectual property treaties, and the European Union placed
<I>sui generis</i> database protection on the WIPO agenda as soon as
it adopted the Database Directive. With Commissioner Lehman's
endorsement of a <I>sui generis</i> database proposal, the notion of
a standalone database treaty gathered momentum, and in September
of 1996, Jukka Liedes, the Chairman of the WIPO Committee of Experts,
formally proposed a database treaty as one of three treaties to
be considered at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference scheduled to occur
in December 1996. (Chairman Liedes also included in the proposed
Copyright Treaty a provision requiring copyright protection for
databases. This provision generated no controversy.)
<P>
As the December Diplomatic Conference approached, numerous parties
began to raise serious questions about the Database Treaty. Developing
countries objected to the insertion of this new topic so late
in the consultative process. They also questioned the need for
a new form of intellectual property protection.
<P>
Similarly, the scientific community in the United States reacted
with alarm to the proposed treaty, arguing that it would stifle
research (this argument will be discussed below in greater detail).
The science agencies within the U.S. government (e.g., the Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration) took the lead in persuading the National Economic
Council within the White House to oppose adoption of a database
treaty.
<P>
Thus, Commissioner Lehman arrived in Geneva in early December
1996 with instructions to stop the very database treaty that he
had helped set in motion. In the face of the opposition from the
developing countries and the United States, the WIPO governing
body decided at the outset of the Diplomatic Conference to defer
further consideration of the database treaty. The Diplomatic Conference,
accordingly, adopted two other intellectual property treaties-one
dealing with copyright and the other dealing with performance
rights-but not the database treaty. (It should be noted, however,
that the Copyright Treaty's provision for copyright protection
for databases was adopted without question.)
<P>
The WIPO has already hosted several meetings this year at which
the database treaty has been mentioned. Both the U.S. government
and the developing counties remain opposed to a database treaty
at this time, so it is unlikely to emerge in the near future.
<p>
<b>D.  Next Steps 
</b>

<P>
Although H.R. 3531 made no progress in the 104th Congress, and
the WIPO is unlikely to adopt a database treaty any time soon,
the 105th Congress is considering database legislation once again.
Senator Hatch has requested the Copyright Office to study the
issue, and the Copyright Office has begun to meet with affected
parties to gather information. It anticipates issuing its report
during the summer of 1997. On the House side, Congressman Coble,
the new Chairman of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, has
suggested that he might introduce a database bill for discussion
purposes.
<p>
<h3>IV.  Arguments in Favor of <I>Sui Generis</I> Protection</h3>


<P>
Continued Congressional interest in <I>sui generis</i> database protection
means that organizations and individuals should determine whether
it would help or harm them. A review of the arguments for and
against <I>sui generis</i> protection will assist this analysis.
<p>
<b>A.  Arguments in Favor of <I>Sui Generis</i> Protection 
</b>

<P>
The major proponents of <I>sui generis</i> protection include the Information
Industry Association, McGraw Hill, Reed-Elsevier (Lexis-Nexis),
and Thomson (West). They have three basic arguments. First, they
contend that the large investment in compiling and maintaining
databases needs additional protection from the digital, on-line
world which makes copying databases as easy as logging on to the
worldwide web. Second, the proponents argue that existing copyright
law -- particularly the decisions implementing <I>Feist</I> -- provides
no protection for large comprehensive on-line databases which
are used by means of a search engine. The compiler has exercised
no selection because the databases are comprehensive. Further,
arrangement only occurs when the user conducts a search. In the
absence of selection and arrangement, no copyright protection
is available. The proponents also claim that the utility of contract
law is uncertain because contracts prohibiting the copyrighting
of uncopyrightable material might be preempted by the Copyright
Act.
<P>
Third, they argue that the EU Database Directive, which requires
each member nation to implement <I>sui generis</i> database protection
by the beginning of 1998, will provide European companies an advantage
in the database market. Because the Directive extends <I>sui generis</I>
protection to non-EU entities on a reciprocity rather than national
treatment basis, the Directive will deny non-European companies
the new legal protection afforded databases unless their home
countries offer comparable protection. Without comparable legislation
in the U.S., <I>sui generis</i> proponents claim there will be an &quot;open
season&quot; on U.S. databases throughout the EU. 
<p>
<b>B.  Arguments Against <I>Sui Generis</i> Protection 
</b>

<P>
Opponents of <I>sui generis</i> database protection have marshaled many
arguments against the adoption of a new regime. First, the opponents
contend that despite the outcry from some database companies that
<I>sui generis</i> protection is necessary to protect their investments
in compiling databases, adequate protection currently exists within
the present intellectual property law framework. For instance,
only a small amount of selection or arrangement is necessary to
bring a database within the protection of the copyright laws.
Despite the &quot;thinness&quot; of this protection, it is sufficient
to protect against wholesale copying.
<P>
Moreover, contract, trade secret and unfair competition laws provide
an additional layer of protection for databases irrespective of
whether the compilation is copyrightable. While each of these
doctrines has limitations, recent decisions have affirmed them
and together they weave a strong web. Even when the intellectual
property laws do not extend any protection to a particular database,
the compiler can still protect its investment from copiers through
technological measures that prevent copying of the database. These
technological measures will only grow more powerful in the future.
Finally, for dynamic on-line databases, where the information is
updated on an ongoing basis, the compiler has an even simpler
remedy -- it can deny the copier access to the database. Dynamic
databases derive their value primarily from being current. If
a compiler discovers that a customer is redistributing the database
without authorization, the compiler can simply discontinue service
to the customer. By the next day, the database has changed, and
the old database in the customer's possession is worthless. 
<P>
Second, opponents of <I>sui generis</i> protection reject the argument
that harmonization is necessary to prevent European predation
of American databases. Although the EU Directive requires implementation
by the beginning of 1998, no member country has yet implemented
the Directive. In fact, many countries are concerned over how
they will implement the Directive since it is directly contradictory
to their current law. More importantly, even though the Directive
denies <I>sui generis</i> protection for American companies without a
similar law in the U.S., it is questionable whether this will
lead to an &quot;open season&quot; on U.S. databases. Since U.S.
companies will still be able to assert their copyright and contractual
rights in the member states, the level of protection for U.S.
databases that now exists will continue to exist even after the
Directive is implemented. Additionally, U.S. companies may be
able to secure <I>sui generis</i> protection if they establish European
subsidiaries. (Ironically, one of the leading proponents of <I>sui
generis</I> protection in the U.S. is Reed-Elsevier, a Dutch company.)
<P>
Third, opponents have asked for concrete examples of market failure-of
examples where a database publisher decided not to develop a product
out of fear that the product would receive insufficient intellectual
property protection. To date, the proponents have provided not
even anecdotal evidence. The opponents contend that no evidence
has been produced because none exists. 
<P>
Besides these general objections to <I>sui generis</i> protection for
databases, the opponents had a list of specific concerns with
H.R. 3531. It is, of course, too early to tell if these same areas
of concern will remain with respect to new legislation, if and
when it is introduced. Nonetheless, these concerns continue to
animate opposition to the concept of <I>sui generis</i> protection. 
<P>
One of the most pronounced concerns was the broad scope of protection
it provided. H.R. 3531 defined a database to include a collection
of &quot;work, data or other materials&quot; in any form, i.e.,
both electronic and non-electronic. Protection was available for
any database which was the &quot;result of qualitatively or quantitatively
substantial investment of human technical, financial, or other
resources in the collection, assembly, verification, organization,
or presentation of the database contents.&quot; Although it is
unclear what level of investment would have triggered protection,
this all-inclusive definition of protectable works would go beyond
what is commonly thought of as a database and include the full
range of copyrighted works such as novels and films. Because the
bill permitted cumulation of copyright and <I>sui generis</i> protection,
works that would normally be protected under the copyright laws
would have been able to receive additional protection under H.R.
3531.
<P>
The protection provided for these works under the bill was equally
sweeping in nature. For example, the bill prohibited any person
without authorization to &quot;extract, use or reuse all or a
substantial part. qualitatively or quantitatively, of the contents
of the database&quot; or &quot;engage . . . in the systematic
extraction, use or reuse of insubstantial parts, qualitatively
or quantitatively, of the contents of the database&quot; that
conflicts with the owner's normal exploitation of the database
or adversely affects the actual or potential market for the database.
The legislation did not define &quot;substantial part&quot;; arguably,
any amount of data with a small measure of consumer demand is
&quot;substantial&quot; enough for protection. Further, if a database
is small enough, one fact could constitute a substantial part.
The practical effect of these provisions was that in many instances
facts themselves would have received de facto intellectual property
protection. 
<P>
Another problem identified in H.R. 3531 was the term of protection.
Although protected databases would technically have been protected
for only 25 years from the time they were first made available,
many databases, especially those in electronic form, would be
able to receive perpetual protection because any significant change
or updating of the database would result in the creation of a
new database with a new 25 year term of protection. This perpetual
protection, when combined with the possibility of the protection
applying to works now covered by copyright, may have permitted
database publishers to circumvent the term limits in the Copyright
Act, leading to a drastic diminution of the public domain.
<P>
The extensive protection given to databases by H.R. 3531 was made
worse, in the eyes of its opponents, by the paucity of exceptions
to the restrictions. Unlike works protected under copyright law,
databases under H.R. 3531 were not subject to a fair use defense.
Proponents of the legislation claimed that the fair use exception
was not necessary because the legislation contained an exception
for extracting, using or reusing &quot;insubstantial&quot; parts
of the database. The opponents responded that the &quot;insubstantial&quot;
defense did not offer nearly the same level of protection as that
provided under the fair use exception. Furthermore, given the
seemingly broad definition of &quot;substantial,&quot; it was
doubtful that any information worth using would ever be considered
&quot;insubstantial.&quot; 
<P>
Databases made by a governmental entity remained in the public
domain and were not protected under the bill, but databases prepared
by private firms that used information generated or collected
by government agencies were not excluded from protection. Since
many government organizations already rely on private industry
to create government databases, a substantial amount of government
information would not have been freely available to the general
public. Moreover, as the U.S. government continues to downsize,
the outsourcing of the data gathering function would continue,
thereby leading to the continual removal of more information from
the public domain. 
<p>
<b>C.  Concerns of Specific Communities 
</b>

<P>
Support for <I>sui generis</i> protection appears limited to the Information
Industry Association and some of its larger members, including
Thomson (West) and Reed-Elsevier. In contrast, many diverse communities
have registered concern with <I>sui generis</i> protection, at least
in the form of H.R 3531 and the proposed database treaty. 
<p>
<b><I>1. Scientists and Researchers</i></b> 
<P>
Most forms of research require the use of large amounts of data.
Some forms of research, such as that concerning global warming,
require systematic use of entire databases. If databases which
are now freely available fall under <I>sui generis</i> protection, the
cost of research will inevitably increase. Moreover, the culture
of science, which involves the sharing of data among institutions,
will change as institutions come to treat their own databases
as profit centers. Significantly, <I>sui generis</i> protection will
raise the cost of research not just for academic institutions,
but also for businesses and government agencies which conduct
research. For this reason, many professional societies of scientists,
engineers and educators (e.g., the National Research Council,
the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine
and the National Academy of Engineering) strongly oppose sui generis
protection. Likewise, most library associations objected to H.R.
3531 and the database treaty.
<p>
<b><I>2.  Interoperable Software Developers</b></I> 
<P>
Although H.R. 3531 specifically stated that computer programs
would not be subject to the Act, it provided that databases contained
within computer programs would receive protection. Thus, look-up
tables and command sets necessary for interoperability -- precisely
the elements found unprotectable in recent software copyright
decisions -- could receive protection as a database. Because such
protection would hamper software interoperability, the American
Committee for Interoperable Systems (including companies such
as NCR, 3Com and Sun Microsystems) have objected to sui generis
protection. 
<p>
<b><I>3.  Internet Companies</b></I> 
<P>
Routing tables and directories necessary to the functioning of
the Internet fall within the definition of a database in H.R.
3531. <I>sui generis</i> database protection, therefore, could lead to
the concentration of market power in the Internet. Additionally,
the unauthorized transmission of a database could lead to vicarious
liability for the on-line service company which unknowingly provided
the hardware and software facilities by which the transmission
occurred. Several telecommunications companies providing online
services, including both RBOCs and long distance carriers, have
expressed concern with <I>sui generis</i> protection for these reasons.
<p>
<b><i>4.  Value Added Database Publishers</i></b>
<P>
There are many legitimate firms which take data from existing
databases and add value to them by inserting new information or
arranging the information in a different way. <I>Sui generis</i> protection
could put this entire industry out of business. The degree of
a publisher's concern often turns on where in the data &quot;food
chain&quot; the publisher appears. If it is at the top -- if it
generates the data itself (e.g., a sport league) or it has an
exclusive license to the data from a government agency (e.g.,
West) -- then the publisher is more likely to support sui generis
protection. If, however, the publisher is further down the food
chain, and it must rely on databases compiled by other companies,
it is more likely to oppose <I>sui generis</i> protection because its
input prices will increase. Groups with members down the food
chain, who have opposed <I>sui generis</i> protection, include the Association
of Legal Publishers, the Association of Directory Publishers,
Donnelly Marketing, Bloomberg, and Fantasy Football Index. 
<p>
<b><i>5.  Businesses Which Rely on Customer Lists and Other
Data</i> 
</b>

<P>
In the Information Age, companies have become increasingly more
reliant on information obtained from other sources for the conduct
of their own business. This information is as diverse as customer
lists, financial data, or gene sequences. Much of this information
is already propriety, and businesses pay for it willingly. <I>Sui
generis</I> protection will impose an additional layer of protection
on this information, and over time will increase its cost. But
while the additional protection will increase the cost of the
information, it is not clear that there will be any off-setting
benefit in the form of additional information generated. Groups
which have opposed <I>sui generis</i> or sweat-of-the-brow protection
on this basis include the Direct Marketing Association, Haines,
the Online Banking Association, and the Biotechnology Industry
Association.
<p>
<h3>IV.  Conclusion</h3> 
<P>
No business or organization can afford to ignore the issue of
<I>sui generis</i> database protection. Depending on where a company
falls in the data food chain -- and almost every business is somewhere
in the food chain -- <I>sui generis</i> protection will either add to
the bottom line or take away from it. Accordingly, companies would
be well advised to study last year's H.R. 3531, and new legislation
if introduced, so that they can determine their position on this
controversial issue and act to support or oppose it.

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<font color="#990000">[[p. 3]]</font> <font size="+1"><b>Part 
          I. Small-pox Mortality and Vaccination.</b></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been led to enquire for myself as to 
          the effects of Vaccination in preventing or diminishing Small-pox, I 
          have arrived at results as unexpected as they appear to me to be conclusive. 
          The question is one which affects our personal liberty as well as the 
          health and even the lives of thousands; it therefore becomes a duty 
          to endeavour to make the truth known to all, and especially to those 
          who, on the faith of false or misleading statements, have enforced the 
          practice of vaccination by penal laws.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose now to establish the following four 
          statements of fact, by means of the only official statistics which are 
          available; and I shall <font color="#990000">[[p. 4]]</font> adopt a 
          mode of presenting those statistics as a whole, which will render them 
          intelligible to all. These statements are:--</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)--That during the forty-five years of the 
          Registration of deaths and their causes, Small-pox mortality has very 
          slightly diminished, while an exceedingly severe Small-pox epidemic 
          occurred within the last twelve years of the period.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.)--That there is no evidence to show that 
          the slight decrease of Small-pox mortality is due to vaccination.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3.)--That the severity of Small-pox as a 
          disease has not been mitigated by vaccination.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4.)--That several inoculable diseases have 
          increased to an alarming extent coincidently with enforced vaccination.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, second, and fourth propositions 
          will be proved from the Registrar-General's Reports from 1838 to 1882; 
          and I shall make the results clear and indisputable, by presenting the 
          figures for the whole period in the form of diagrammatic curves, so 
          that no manipulation of them, by taking certain years for comparison, 
          or by dividing the period in special ways, will be possible.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diagrams show, in each case, not the absolute 
          mortality but the deaths per million <font color="#990000">[[p. 5]]</font> 
          living, a method which eliminates the increase of population and gives 
          true comparative results.</p>
        <p><strong>Vaccination Has Not Diminished Small-pox.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diagram I. exhibits the deaths from Small-pox, 
          in London, for every year from 1838 to 1882, while an upper line exhibits 
          the deaths from the other principal zymotic diseases given in the Registrar-General's 
          Annual Summary for 1882, (except Cholera, which is only an occasional 
          epidemic,) namely,--Scarlet fever and Diphtheria, Measles, Whooping 
          Cough, Typhoid and other fevers, and Diarrh&#156;a. A dotted line between 
          these shows the mortality from fevers of the Typhoid class.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
 
        <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S374a.jpg" width="99%" height="auto" /></p>

      <p>The first thing clearly apparent in this diagram, is the very small diminution 
        of Small-pox corresponding with the epochs of penal and compulsory vaccination; 
        while the epidemic of 1871 was the most destructive in the whole period. 
        The average diminution of Small-pox mortality from the first to the second 
        half of the period, is 57 deaths per million per annum. Looking now at 
        the upper curve, we see that <font color="#990000">[[p. 6]]</font> the 
        mortality from the chief zymotic diseases has also decreased, more especially 
        during the last 35 years; but the decrease of these diseases is not, proportionally, 
        so great, owing to the fact that deaths from Diarrh&#156;a have considerably 
        increased in the latter half of the period. On the other hand, Typhus 
        and Typhoid fevers have diminished to a much greater extent than Small-pox, 
        as shown by the dotted line on the diagram, the reduced mortality from 
        this cause alone being 382 per million, or more than six times as much 
        as that from Small-pox. Every one will admit that this remarkable decrease 
        of Typhus, &amp;c., is due to more efficient sanitation, greater personal 
        attention to the laws of health, and probably also to more rational methods 
        of treatment. But all these causes of amelioration have certainly had 
        their effect on Small-pox; and as the mortality from that disease has 
        not equally diminished, there is probably some counteracting cause at 
        work. So far, therefore, from there being any proof that vaccination has 
        diminished Small-pox in London, the tendency of the Registrar-General's 
        facts, (and there are no other facts which are trustworthy) is to show 
        that some counteracting cause has <font color="#990000">[[p. 7]]</font> 
        prevented general sanitation from acting on this disease as it has acted 
        on Typhus, and that cause may, possibly, be vaccination itself.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now turn to Diagram II., which gives 
        a representation of similar statistics for England and Wales,<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
        except that unfortunately there is a blank in the record for 1843-46, 
        in which years the Registrar-General informs us, &quot;the causes of death 
        were not distinguished.&quot; Here too we perceive a similar decrease in Small-pox 
        mortality, broken by the tremendous epidemic of 1871-2, while the other 
        chief zymotic diseases represented by the higher line, show more irregularity, 
        but a considerable recent decrease. For all England, as for London, the 
        tables show us that Typhoid fevers have decreased far more than Small-pox, 
        (but for clearness the curve of Typhus is omitted,) and we have, therefore, 
        again, no reason for imputing the decrease in Small-pox to vaccination. 
        But we may go further than this negative statement, for we have, fortunately, 
        a means of directly testing the alleged efficacy of vaccination. The eleventh 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 8]]</font> Annual Report of the Local Government 
        Board gives a table of the number of successful vaccinations, at the expense 
        of the Poor Rate, in England and Wales, from 1852 to 1881. From the figures 
        of this table I have calculated the numbers in proportion to the population 
        of each year, and have exhibited the result in the dotted line on my Diagram 
        II.; and to this I beg to direct the reader's attention, since it at once 
        dispels some oft-repeated erroneous statements.</p>
    <a name="diagram2" id="diagram2"></a><p align="center"><img src="../pics/S374b.jpg" width="99%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p>In the first place we see that, instead of vaccination having increased 
        since the enforcement of penal laws, it has actually diminished; so that 
        the statement so often made by official apologists for vaccination, and 
        repeated by Sir Lyon Playfair in his speech to the House of Commons last 
        year,--that the progressive efficiency of legal vaccination has diminished 
        Small-pox, <i>is absolutely untrue, since there has been a decrease rather 
        than an increase of &quot;efficient vaccination.&quot;</i><sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>

        vaccinations always takes place during an epidemic of Small-pox, or when 
        an epidemic is feared; but an examination of the curve of vaccination 
        does not support the statement that it checks the epidemic. On careful 
        inspection it will be seen that on three separate occasions a considerable 
        <i>increase</i> in vaccinations was followed by an <i>increase</i> of 
        Small-pox. Let the reader look at the Diagram, and note that in 1863 there 
        was a very great number of vaccinations, followed in 1864 by an <i>increase</i> 
        in Small-pox mortality. Again, the number of vaccinations steadily rose 
        from 1866 to 1869, yet in 1870-71 Small-pox mortality increased; and yet 
        again, in 1876 an <i>increase</i> in vaccinations was followed by an <i>increase</i> 
        of Small-pox deaths. In fact, if the dotted line showed <i>inoculation</i> 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 10]]</font> instead of <i>vaccination</i>, 
        it might be used to prove that inoculation caused an increase of Small-pox. 
        I only maintain, however, that it does <i>not</i> prove that vaccination 
        diminishes the mortality from the disease. During the panic caused by 
        the great epidemic of 1871-2, vaccinations rose enormously, and declined 
        as rapidly the moment the epidemic passed away, but there is nothing whatever 
        to show that the increased vaccinations had any effect on the disease, 
        which ran its course and then died out like other epidemics.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now been proved from the only complete 
        series of official records that exist:--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)--That Small-pox has not decreased so much 
        or so steadily as Typhus and allied fevers.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.)--That the diminution of Small-pox mortality 
        coincides with a <i>diminished</i>, instead of an increased efficiency 
        of official vaccination.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3.)--That one of the most severe epidemics 
        of Small-pox on record, within the period of accurate statistics, occurred 
        after 33 years of official, compulsory, and penal vaccination.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three groups of facts give no support 
        to the assertion that vaccination has diminished Small-pox mortality; 
        and it must always be remembered that we have actually no other extensive 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 11]]</font> body of statistics on which to 
        found our judgment. The utility or otherwise of vaccination is purely 
        a question of statistics. It remains for us to decide, whether we will 
        be guided by the only trustworthy statistics we possess, or continue blindly 
        to accept the dogmas of an interested and certainly not infallible body 
        of professional men, who once upheld inoculation as strongly as they now 
        uphold vaccination.</p>
      <p><strong>Small-pox Has Not Been Mitigated by Vaccination.</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often asserted that, although vaccination 
        is not a complete protection against Small-pox, yet it diminishes the 
        severity of the disease, and renders it less dangerous to those who take 
        it. This assertion is sufficiently answered by the proof above given, 
        that it has <i>not</i> diminished Small-pox mortality; but more direct 
        evidence can be adduced.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best available records show that, the proportion 
        of deaths to Small-pox cases is the same <i>now, although a large majority 
        of the population are vaccinated</i>, as it was a century ago before vaccination 
        was discovered. Dr. Jurin, <font color="#990000">[[p. 12]]</font> in 1723; 
        the London Small-pox Hospital Reports, 1746-63; Dr. Lambert, 1763; and 
        Rees' Cyclop&aelig;dia, 1779; give numbers varying from 16.5 to 25.3 as 
        the per-centage of mortality among Small-pox patients in hospitals;--<i>the 
        average of the whole being 18.8 per cent.</i></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the epoch of vaccination. Mr. Marson, 
        1836-51, and the Reports of the London, Homerton, Deptford, Fulham, and 
        Dublin Small-pox Hospitals, between 1870 and 1880, give numbers varying 
        from 14.26 to 21.7 as the deaths per cent. of Small-pox patients, <i>the 
        average being</i> 18.5. And this, be it remembered, under the improved 
        treatment and hygiene of the nineteenth as compared with the eighteenth 
        century.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures not only demonstrate the falsehood 
        of the oft-repeated assertion that vaccination mitigates Small-pox, but 
        they go far to prove the very opposite--that the disease has been rendered 
        more intractable by it; or how can we account for the mortality among 
        Small-pox patients being almost exactly the same now as a century ago, 
        notwithstanding the great advance of medical science and the improvements 
        in hospitals and hospital treatment?<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 13]]</font> <strong>Small-pox in the Army 
        and Navy.</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a crucial test of the efficacy or 
        uselessness of vaccination. Our Soldiers and Sailors are vaccinated and 
        re-vaccinated in accordance with the most stringent official <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        14]]</font> regulations. They are exceptionally strong and healthy men, 
        in the prime of life, and if vaccination is of any use, Small-pox should 
        be almost unknown among them, and <i>no soldier or sailor should ever 
        die of it</i>. They are in fact often spoken of as a &quot;perfectly protected 
        population.&quot; Now let us see what are the facts.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Return has just been issued to the House of 
        Commons, &quot;Small-pox (Army and Navy),&quot; dated &quot;August, 1884,&quot; giving the 
        mean strength, the number of deaths from Small-pox, and the ratio per 
        thousand in each service for the twenty-three years 1860-82. An examination 
        of this Return shows us that there has not been a single year without 
        two or more deaths in the Army, and only two years without deaths in the 
        Navy. Comparing the Return on &quot;Vaccination, Mortality,&quot; No. 433, issued 
        by the House of Commons in 1877, we find that, in the twenty-three years 
        1850-72, (the latest there given,) there were many years in which no adult 
        Small-pox deaths were recorded for a number of large towns of from 100,000 
        to 270,000 inhabitants. Liverpool had none in 3 of the years, Birmingham 
        and Sunderland in 7, Bradford and Sheffield in 8, Halifax in 9, Dudley 
        in 10, while Blackburn and <font color="#990000">[[p. 15]]</font> Wolverhampton 
        were each totally without adult Small-pox mortality for 11 out of the 
        23 years!</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the cases are not strictly comparable, 
        because for these towns we have only deaths of persons aged 20 and upwards 
        given separately, whereas the ages of the Army and Navy range chiefly 
        from about 17 to 45. But, considering the extremely unsanitary state of 
        many of these towns, and their great preponderance in freedom from Small-pox, 
        there is clearly no room left for the alleged effect of <i>re-vaccination</i> 
        in securing to our soldiers and sailors immunity from the disease.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us now look at the averages for the 
        whole series of years, as affording the best and only reliable test. On 
        working these out carefully, I find the mean Small-pox mortality for the 
        23 years to be, in the Army 82.96, which we may call 83 per million, and 
        in the Navy 157 per million. Unfortunately no materials exist for an <i>exact</i> 
        comparison of these rates with those of the civil population; but with 
        much labour I have made the best comparison I can arrive at. From the 
        Census General Report, 1881, and the Reports of the Registrar-General 
        for the same 23 years as are included in the Army and Navy Return, I have 
        been able to ascertain the Small-pox <font color="#990000">[[p. 16]]</font> 
        mortality of males in England and Wales between the years 15 and 55, taken 
        as best representing those of the two services; and the result is a mean 
        Small-pox death rate of 176 per million.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed that this is but little 
        more than the Navy mortality, though more than double that of the Army, 
        and the question arises, to what is the difference due. And first, why 
        is the Small-pox mortality in the Navy nearly double that of the Army? 
        The regulations as to re-vaccination are the same in both, and are in 
        both rigidly enforced, and the men are pretty equal in stamina and general 
        health. The cause must therefore be in the <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        17]]</font> different conditions of life of the two services; and it seems 
        to me a probable supposition, that the difference arises chiefly from 
        the less efficient ventilation and isolation which are possible on board 
        ship as compared with Army Hospitals.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general mortality of the Navy from disease 
        appears (from the Registrar-General's Report, 1882, Tables 59 and 65,) 
        to be considerably less than that of the Army, so that the greater mortality 
        from Small-pox must be due to some special conditions. But whatever these 
        are, the conditions of the civil population are certainly much worse. 
        Two-thirds of the families inhabiting Glasgow live in houses of one or 
        two rooms only, and many other towns, including London, are probably not 
        much better. Under such conditions, and with the low vitality induced 
        by insufficient food, overwork, and bad air, we should expect the Small-pox 
        mortality of our civil population to be very much greater than that of 
        the picked class of sailors <font color="#990000">[[p. 18]]</font> who 
        enjoy ample food, fresh air, and medical attendance. Where then is the 
        alleged &quot;full security&quot; afforded by re-vaccination, and how are we to 
        characterise the statements circulated at the expense of the public, that 
        &quot;Small-pox is almost unknown in the Army and Navy.&quot;<sup><a href="#7">7</a> 
        </sup>If we are to draw a legitimate conclusion from the facts, it is, 
        that the re-vaccination to which our soldiers and sailors are subjected, 
        renders Small-pox more fatal when it attacks them, for thus only can we 
        explain the large mortality among picked healthy men under constant medical 
        supervision, and living under far better sanitary conditions than the 
        mass of the civil population.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 19]]</font> One other 
        mode of comparison can be made, showing that even the Army Small-pox death-rate 
        is but little better than that of some large towns, during the same period. 
        The rate per million for the adult population, between the ages 15 and 
        55, on an average of the years 1860-82 for five very large towns was as 
        follows:--<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there are many other towns which have 
        a much higher mortality, but very few are much worse than the Navy. The 
        very worst large town which I can find in the Reports is Newcastle-on-Tyne, 
        which for the same period <font color="#990000">[[p. 20]]</font> had an 
        adult Small-pox mortality of 349 per million. But the fact that five of 
        our most populous towns have considerably less adult Small-pox mortality 
        than the Navy, and one of them but little more than the Army, amounts 
        to a demonstration of the uselessness of the most complete re-vaccination.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general mortality of our adult population 
        is much greater than that of the Army and Navy. From the official sources 
        of information already quoted, I find that the average mortality of the 
        adult population of England, of the ages 15-55, for the years 1860-82, 
        was about <u>20,000</u> per million. <i><font color="990000">[[Editor's 
        Note: Wallace here neglects to take into account that he is only dealing 
        with the adult <u>male</u> population of England; this mistake was corrected 
        in the 1889 edition to reduce the per million rate to 11,300.]]</font></i></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That of the Navy, for the same period, was <u>11,000</u> 
        per million from all causes, and only <u>7,150</u> from disease.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That of the Army, at home, was <u>10,300</u> 
        per million. Abroad it was nearly double (19,400), but this included all 
        the deaths from casualties, exposure, &amp;c., in the Abyssinian, Afghan, 
        Zulu, Transvaal, and other petty wars.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the superior physique of our soldiers and 
        sailors, together with the sanitary conditions under which they live, 
        are fully manifested in a mortality from disease only about half that 
        of the adult civil population of comparable ages. If <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        21]]</font> we make the same allowance for the influence of these causes 
        in the case of Small-pox, there remains absolutely nothing for the alleged 
        protective influence of re-vaccination.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely we shall now hear no more of the re-vaccinated 
        nurses in Small-pox hospitals, (as to whom we have no statistics, but 
        only vague and usually inaccurate assertions,) when we have a great, officially 
        recorded experiment to refer to, extending over 23 years and applied to 
        more than 200,000 men, the results of which directly contradict every 
        professional and official statement as to the safeguard of re-vaccination.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
      <p><strong>Vaccination Itself A Cause of Disease and Death.</strong></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been now shown, vaccination is quite 
        powerless either to prevent or to mitigate <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        22]]</font> Small-pox. But this is not all, for there are good grounds 
        for believing that it is itself the cause of much disease and serious 
        mortality.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was long denied by medical men that syphilis 
        can be communicated by vaccination; but this is now universally admitted, 
        and no less than 478 cases of vaccine-syphilis have already been recorded.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> 
        But there is also good reason to believe that many other blood-diseases 
        are transmitted and increased by the same means, since there has been 
        for many years a steady increase of mortality from such diseases which 
        is terrible to contemplate. The following table gives the increase of 
        five of these diseases from the Registrar-General's Annual Report for 
        1880, (page lxxix., Table 34,) and it is very noteworthy that, in the 
        long list of maladies there tabulated, no others, (except Bronchitis, 
        which often follows vaccination though not, probably, transmitted by it,) 
        show any such striking and continuous increase, while the great majority 
        are either stationary or decreasing.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S374c.jpg" width="55%" height="auto" /> 
      </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We here see a constant increase in the mortality 
        from each of these diseases, an increase which in the sum of them is steady 
        and continuous. It is true, we have not, and cannot have, direct proof 
        that vaccination is the sole cause of this increase, but we have good 
        reason to believe that it is the chief cause. In the first place it is 
        a <i>vera causa</i>, since it directly inoculates infants and adults, 
        on an enormous scale, with whatever blood-disease may exist unsuspected 
        in the system <font color="#990000">[[p. 24]]</font> of the infants from 
        whom the vaccine pus is taken. In the next place, no other adequate cause 
        has been adduced for the remarkably continuous increase of these special 
        diseases, which the spread of sanitation, of cleanliness, and of advanced 
        medical knowledge, should have rendered both less frequent and less fatal.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>increased deaths from these five causes, 
        from</i> 1855 <i>to</i> 1880,<i> exceed the total deaths from Small-pox 
        during the same period!</i> So that even if the latter disease had been 
        totally abolished by vaccination, the general mortality would have been 
        increased, and there is much reason to believe that the increase may have 
        been caused by vaccination itself.</p>
<p align="center"><br /><font color="#990000">[[p. 25]]</font> <font size="+1"><strong>Part 
        II. Comparative Mortality of the<br />
        Vaccinated and the Unvaccinated.</strong></font></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech in the House of Commons, June 
        19th, 1883, Sir Lyon Playfair made the following statement:--&quot;An analysis 
        of 10,000 cases in the Metropolitan Hospitals shows that 45 per cent. 
        of the Unvaccinated patients die, and only 15 per cent. of Vaccinated 
        patients;&quot; and he further showed that statistics of a similar character 
        had been published in other countries. It will no doubt be objected by 
        my readers that these statistics, if correct, are a complete proof of 
        the value of vaccination; and I shall be expected to show that they are 
        incorrect or give up the whole case. This I am prepared to do; and I now 
        undertake to prove--firstly, that the figures here given are unreliable; 
        and, secondly, that such statistics <i>necessarily</i> give false results 
        unless they are classified according to the age-periods of the patients.</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 26]]</font> <strong>The Per-centages of Vaccinated 
        and Unvaccinated Unreliable.</strong></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple fact of death from Small-pox is easily 
        ascertained, and has been for many years accurately recorded.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, whether the deceased person had been vaccinated 
        or not, is a fact by no means easily ascertained, because confluent Small-pox 
        (which alone is ordinarily fatal) obliterates the vaccination marks in 
        most cases, and the death is then usually recorded among the unvaccinated 
        or the doubtful. For this reason alone the official record--<i>vaccinated</i> 
        or <i>unvaccinated</i>--is altogether untrustworthy, and cannot be made 
        the subject of accurate statistical enquiry.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other reasons why the comparison 
        of the deaths of these two classes is worthless. Deaths registered as 
        <i>unvaccinated</i> include--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)--Infants dying under vaccination age, and 
        who, therefore, have no corresponding class among the vaccinated, but 
        among whom the Small-pox mortality is greatest.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.)--Children too weakly or diseased to be 
        vaccinated, and whose low vitality renders any severe disease fatal.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 27]]</font> (3.)--A 
        large but unknown number of the criminal and nomad population who escape 
        the vaccination officers. These are often badly fed and live under the 
        most unsanitary conditions; they are, therefore, especially liable to 
        suffer in epidemics of Small-pox or other zymotic diseases.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by the indiscriminate union of these three 
        classes, together with those erroneously classed as unvaccinated owing 
        to the obliteration of marks or other defect of evidence, that the number 
        of deaths registered &quot;<i>unvaccinated</i>&quot; is swollen far beyond its true 
        proportions, and the comparison with those registered &quot;<i>vaccinated</i>&quot; 
        rendered altogether untrustworthy and misleading.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mere inference, for there is much 
        direct evidence that the records &quot;unvaccinated&quot; and &quot;no statement&quot; in 
        the Reports of the Registrar-General are often erroneous. As the chief 
        argument for vaccination rests upon this class of facts, a few examples 
        of the evidence referred to must be here given.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)--Mr. A. Feltrup, of Ipswich, gives a case 
        of a boy aged 9, who died of Small-pox, and was recorded in the certificate 
        as &quot;unvaccinated.&quot; By a search in the register of successful vaccinations 
        it was found that the boy, Thomas <font color="#990000">[[p. 28]]</font> 
        Taylor, had been successfully vaccinated on the 20th May, 1868, by W. 
        Adams. (<i>Suffolk Chronicle</i>, May 5, 1877.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.)--In &quot;Notes on the Small-pox Epidemic at 
        Birkenhead, 1877.&quot; By Fras. Vacher, M.D., (p. 9.,) we find the following:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As regards the patients admitted to the fever 
        hospital or treated at home, those entered as vaccinated displayed undoubted 
        cicatrices, as attested by competent medical witnesses, and those entered 
        as not vaccinated were admitted unvaccinated or without the faintest mark. 
        <i>The mere assertions of patients or their friends that they were vaccinated 
        counted for nothing, as about 80 per cent. of the patients entered in 
        the third column of the table</i> ('unknown') <i>were reported as having 
        been vaccinated in infancy</i>.&quot; (The italics are my own.)</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3.)--Bearing upon this important admission, 
        we have the following statement in Dr. Russell's Glasgow Report, 1871-2 
        (p. 25):--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sometimes persons were said to be vaccinated, 
        but no marks could be seen, very frequently because of the abundance of 
        the eruption. In some cases of those which recovered, an inspection before 
        dismissal discovered vaccine marks, sometimes 'very good.'&quot;</p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 29]]</font> (4.)--In 
      the Registrar-General's Return of Births and Deaths for London, for the 
      week ending Oct. 13th, 1883, three Small-pox deaths are recorded from the 
      Metropolitan Asylums Hospital at Homerton, and they are stated to be of 
      three unvaccinated children--one, four, and nine years respectively--all 
      from 3, Medland Street, Stepney. Thereupon the mother of two of the children 
      made a declaration that the return was <i>not true</i>. She states:--&quot;All 
      my five children were beautifully vaccinated. My three sons were attacked 
      with Small-pox; the two youngest are dead, the eldest is better.&quot; (Signed) 
      Ann Elizabeth Snook, 3, Medland Street, Stepney, October 23rd, 1883. A full 
      account of this case was published in the <i>Bedfordshire Express</i> by 
      Mr. A. Stapley, and also in the <i>Vaccination Enquirer</i> of December, 
      1883. 
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5.)--In 1872, Mr. John Pickering, of Leeds, 
        carefully investigated a number of cases entered as &quot;not vaccinated&quot; by 
        the medical officers of the Leeds Small-pox Hospital, tracing out the 
        parents, examining the patients if alive, or obtaining the certificate 
        of vaccination if they were dead. The result was, that 6 patients, entered 
        as &quot;not vaccinated,&quot; and still living, were found to have good vaccination 
        marks; while 9 others who had died, and whose deaths <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        30]]</font> had been registered as &quot;not vaccinated,&quot; were proved to have 
        been successfully vaccinated. In addition to these, 8 cases were proved 
        to have been vaccinated, some of them three or four times, but unsuccessfully, 
        and 4 others were certified &quot;unfit to be vaccinated,&quot; yet all were alike 
        entered as &quot;unvaccinated.&quot; The full particulars of this investigation 
        are to be found in a pamphlet by Mr. Pickering, published by F. Pitman, 
        20, Paternoster Row, London.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6.)--As further corroborative evidence of the 
        untrustworthiness of all records on the subject emanating from medical 
        men, the following quotation from an article on &quot;Certificates of Death,&quot; 
        in the <i>Birmingham Medical Review</i> for January, 1874, is important; 
        the italics are my own:--&quot;In certificates given by us voluntarily, and 
        to which the public have access, it is scarcely to be expected that a 
        medical man will give opinions which may tell against or reflect upon 
        himself in any way. In such cases he will most likely tell the truth, 
        <i>but not the whole truth</i>, and assign some prominent symptom of the 
        disease as the cause of death. As instances of cases which may tell against 
        the medical man himself, I will mention <i>erysipelas from vaccination</i>, 
        and puerperal fever. A death from the first cause <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        31]]</font> occurred not long ago in my practice, and although I had not 
        vaccinated the child, yet <i>in my desire to preserve vaccination from 
        reproach, I omitted all mention of it from my certificate of death</i>.&quot;</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustrative facts now given cannot be supposed 
        to be exceptional, especially when we consider the great amount of time 
        and labour required to bring them to light; and taken in connection with 
        the astounding admissions of medical men, of which examples have been 
        just given, they prove that <i>no dependence can be placed on the official 
        records of the proportions of vaccinated and unvaccinated among Small-pox 
        patients</i>; while, if Mr. Vacher's method of registration is usually 
        followed, about 80 per cent. of those classed by the Registrar-General 
        under the heading &quot;no statement&quot; have been really stated, by their parents 
        or friends, to have been vaccinated.</p>
      <p><strong>Our Hospital Statistics Necessarily Give False Results.</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a still more serious matter remains to be 
        considered, and it is a striking proof of the crude and imperfect evidence 
        on which the <font color="#990000">[[p. 32]]</font> important question 
        of the value of vaccination has been decided, that the point in question 
        has been entirely overlooked by every English advocate of vaccination, 
        although it involves an elementary principle of statistical science.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point is, that even if the records in our 
        hospitals, &quot;vaccinated&quot; and &quot;unvaccinated,&quot; were strictly correct, it 
        can be demonstrated that true results cannot be deduced from them without 
        a comparison of <i>the mortality of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated 
        at corresponding ages</i>, and this information our official returns do 
        not give.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requisite comparison has, however, been 
        made on a population of about 60,000, consisting of the officials and 
        workmen employed on the Imperial Austrian State Railways, by the Head 
        Physician, Dr. Leander Joseph Keller; and his results during the years 
        1872-3 are so important that it is necessary to give a brief abstract 
        of them.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)--It is shown that the death-rate of Small-pox 
        patients is greatest in the first year of life, <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        33]]</font> then diminishes gradually to between the 15th and 20th year, 
        and then rises again to old age; <i>thus following exactly the same law 
        as the general mortality</i>.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.)--The Small-pox death-rate, among over 2,000 
        cases, was 17.85 per cent. of the cases, closely agreeing with the general 
        average. That of the unvaccinated was <u>23.20</u> per cent., while that 
        of the vaccinated was only <u>15.61</u> per cent.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3.)--This result, apparently so favourable 
        to vaccination, is shown to be wholly due to the excess of the unvaccinated 
        in the first two years of life,<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> and to 
        be <i>a purely numerical fact entirely unconnected with vaccination</i>. 
        This is proved as follows:--Taking, first, all the ages above 2 years, 
        the death-rates of the vaccinated is <u>13.76</u>, and of the unvaccinated 
        <u>13.15</u>,--almost exactly the same, but with a slight advantage to 
        the unvaccinated.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking now the first two years, the death-rate 
        is found to be as follows:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccinated. 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Unvaccinated.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First year of life . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.46 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45.24<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second year of life . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54.05 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38.10</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 34]]</font> Thus 
        the Small-pox death-rate is actually <i>less</i> for the unvaccinated 
        than for the vaccinated in infants, and <i>equal</i> for all the higher 
        ages; yet the average of the whole is higher for the unvaccinated, <i>simply 
        on account of the greater proportion of the unvaccinated at those ages 
        at which the mortality is universally greatest</i>.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus made clear that any comparison of 
        the Small-pox mortality of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, <i>except 
        at strictly corresponding ages</i>, leads to entirely false conclusions.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This curious and important fact may perhaps 
        be rendered more easily intelligible by an illustration. Let us take the 
        whole population up to 20 years of age, and divide it into two groups--those 
        who go to school, and those who do not. If the Small-pox mortality of 
        these were separately registered, it would be found to be very much greater 
        among the non-school goers,--composed chiefly of infants, and of children 
        too weakly to be sent to school, amongst whom the mortality is always 
        very <font color="#990000">[[p. 35]]</font> great, so much so that a doctor 
        of wide experience--Dr. Vernon, of Southport--has stated that, he had 
        never known an infant under one year of age recover from Small-pox. But 
        we should surely think a person either silly or mad who argued from such 
        statistics that school-going was a protection against the disease, and 
        that school children formed a &quot;protected population.&quot; Yet this is exactly 
        comparable with the reasoning of those who adduce the greater mortality 
        among unvaccinated Small-pox patients of all ages, as the very strongest 
        argument in favour of vaccination!<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good statistics and good arguments cannot be 
        upset, or even weakened, by those which are bad. I have now shown that 
        the main argument relied on by our adversaries, rests on thoroughly unsound 
        statistics, inaccurate to begin with, and <font color="#990000">[[p. 36]]</font> 
        wrongly interpreted afterwards. Those which I have used, on the other 
        hand, if not absolutely perfect, are yet the best and most trustworthy 
        that exist. I ask statisticians and men of unbiassed judgment to decide 
        between them.</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion from the Evidence.</strong></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this brief enquiry may be thus 
        summarized:--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)--Vaccination does not diminish Small-pox 
        mortality, as shown by the 45 years of the Registrar-General's statistics, 
        and by the deaths from Small-pox of our &quot;re-vaccinated&quot; soldiers and sailors 
        being as numerous as those of the male population of the same ages of 
        several of our large towns, although the former are picked, healthy men, 
        while the latter include many thousands living under the most unsanitary 
        conditions.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.)--While thus utterly powerless for good, 
        vaccination is a certain cause of disease and death in many cases, and 
        is the probable cause of about 10,000 deaths annually by five inoculable 
        diseases of the most terrible and disgusting character, which have increased 
        to this extent, <font color="#990000">[[p. 37]]</font> steadily, year 
        by year, since vaccination has been enforced by penal laws!</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3.)--The hospital statistics, showing a greater 
        mortality of the unvaccinated than of the vaccinated, have been proved 
        to be untrustworthy; while the conclusions drawn from them are shown to 
        be necessarily false.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these facts are true, or anything near the 
        truth, the enforcement of vaccination by fine and imprisonment of unwilling 
        parents, is a cruel and criminal despotism, which it behoves all true 
        friends of humanity to denounce and oppose at every opportunity.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such legislation, involving as it does, our 
        health, our liberty, and our very lives, is too serious a matter to be 
        allowed to depend on the misstatements of interested officials or the 
        dogmas of a professional clique. Some of the misstatements and some of 
        the ignorance on which you have relied, have been here exposed. The statistical 
        evidence on which alone a true judgment can be founded, is as open to 
        you as to any doctor in the land. We, therefore, demand that you, our 
        representatives, shall fulfil your solemn duty to us in this matter, by 
        devoting to it <font color="#990000">[[p. 38]]</font> some personal investigation 
        and painstaking research; and if you find that the main facts as here 
        stated are substantially correct, we call upon you to undo without delay 
        the evil you have done.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE, THEREFORE, SOLEMNLY URGE UPON YOU THE IMMEDIATE 
        REPEAL OF THE INIQUITOUS PENAL LAWS BY WHICH YOU HAVE FORCED UPON US A 
        DANGEROUS AND USELESS OPERATION--AN OPERATION WHICH HAS ADMITTEDLY CAUSED 
        MANY DEATHS, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF GREATER MORTALITY THAN SMALL-POX 
        ITSELF, BUT WHICH CANNOT BE PROVED TO HAVE EVER SAVED A SINGLE HUMAN LIFE.</p>

        <sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="3" id="3"></a>3</sup>It is curious that 
        even the Registrar-General appears to be ignorant of the fact that, official 
        vaccination has not increased in efficiency since the penal laws came 
        into force. In his Report for 1880, p. xxii., he says--&quot;These figures 
        show conclusively that, <font color="990000">[[p. 9]]</font> <i>coincidently 
        with the gradual extension of the practice of vaccination</i>, there has 
        been a gradual and notable decline in the mortality from Small-pox at 
        all ages.&quot; As, however, there has not been shown to have been any such 
        &quot;gradual extension of the practice of vaccination,&quot; but, so far as official 
        records go, just the reverse, the whole argument falls to the ground! 
        It is true that this curve does not exhibit the numbers of the vaccinated 
        population, which there is no means of arriving at. Dr. Seaton, in his 
        evidence before the Parliamentary Committee in 1871, stated that, before 
        1853 the average vaccinations were 31.8 per cent. of the births<font size="-1">, 
        and in the ten years 1861-70, 49.46 per cent. These are public vaccinations, 
        but they probably include the bulk of the whole; and the figures seem 
        to show that the proportion of the population vaccinated is much less 
        than is usually supposed. <font color="#990000">[[originally placed at

        <sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="5" id="5"></a>&nbsp;5</sup>The following are 
        the data on which this calculation is founded:--<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the General Report of the last Census, Table 
        14, p. 89, the numbers of males at successive ages are given for the three 
        last Censuses--1861, 1871, and 1881. By a simple calculation it is found 
        that the number of males of all ages is to that of males aged 15-55 in 
        the proportion of 1 to .528.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 4. p. 78, of the same Census Report, gives 
        the male population for the middle of each of the 23 years included in 
        the Army and Navy Return. The mean of these numbers is 11,167,500; and 
        this sum, multiplied by the factor .528, gives 5,896,500 for the average 
        male population of the ages 15-55 for those years.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tables of &quot;Causes of Death at different 
        Periods of Life&quot; in the twenty-three successive Reports of the Registrar-General, 
        1860-1882, I have extracted the deaths from Small-pox of males aged 15-55, 
        the mean annual value of which is 1,041; and this number, divided by the 
        number of millions in the corresponding population (5.8965), gives the 
        death-rate per million = 176.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit of age, 15-55, has been taken because 
        the General Report of the Census of 1881, Table 40, gives, for the Army 
        and Navy, 7,530 men over 45, and 28,834 under 20 years of age. <font color="#990000">[[originally

        Royal Marine Artillery, of great experience, confirms this view. He assures 
        me that isolation is absolutely impossible on board a ship of war. But 
        if this is the explanation of the phenomenon, it is itself a proof of 
        the complete inefficacy of re-vaccination, which not only does not protect 
        men from <i>catching</i> Small-pox, but allows them to <i>die</i> of it 
        quite as much as--and, allowing something for the superiority of sanitation, 
        even more than--the adult civil population, only partially vaccinated 
        and hardly ever re-vaccinated! <font color="#990000">[[originally placed

        <sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="7" id="7"></a>&nbsp;7</sup>The following are 
        a few of these assertions. The italics are to call attention to the essential 
        words of each statement.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Lancet,&quot; of March 1st, 1879, says:--&quot;Vaccination 
        needs to be repeated well once in a lifetime, <i>and then the immunity 
        is almost absolute</i>.&quot;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Officer of the General Post Office 
        says, in a circular dated June, 1884--&quot;The <i>only means</i> of securing 
        protection against Small-pox is by re-vaccination . . . . it is desirable,<i> 
        in order to obtain full security</i>, that the operation should be repeated 
        at a later period of life.&quot;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tract on &quot;Small-pox and Vaccination&quot; issued 
        by the National Health Society, and now being widely circulated at the 
        expense of the ratepayers, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, 
        we find this statement:--&quot;Every Soldier and Sailor is re-vaccinated; the 
        result is that <i>Small-pox is almost unknown in the Army and Navy</i>, 
        even amid surrounding epidemics.&quot;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above statements are proved by the Official 
        Returns now issued to be absolutely untrue, and must have been ignorantly 
        and recklessly made without any adequate basis of fact. <font color="#990000">[[originally 
        placed at the bottom of page 18]]</font><br />
        <sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="8" id="8"></a>8</sup>These figures have 
        been thus obtained:--the Registrar-General's Summary, 1882, (Table 7, 
        p. xv.) gives the Small-pox deaths per 1,000, for twenty great Towns, 
        for the years 1872-82. The Parliamentary Return, &quot;Vaccination, Mortality,&quot; 
        1877, gives the Small-pox mortality and population of a considerable number 
        of towns for the years 1847-72. From these two official papers the Small-pox 
        mortality per million of the whole male population from 1860 to 1882, 
        for such towns as occur in both the tables, is easily obtained. The average 
        Small-pox death-rate for all England is found to be 211.7, while that 
        of the ages 15-55 is 176. These numbers are in the proportion of 1 to 
        .83; hence the total Small-pox mortality of any town multiplied by the 
        factor .83 will give, approximately, the mortality at ages 15-45. The 
        proportion has been obtained from males only, but that of the two sexes 
        combined will not be materially different. <font color="#990000">[[originally 
        placed at the bottom of page 19]]</font><br />
        <sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="9" id="9"></a>&nbsp;9</sup>It will, perhaps, 
        be objected that the Army and Navy are in great part stationed abroad 
        and even in the tropics. But this renders our case all the stronger, because 
        Small-pox is <i>less prevalent</i> in the tropics. In the Blue Book on 
        Vaccination, prepared by the General Board of Health in 1857, it is stated, 
        as the mean result of many years records, that, &quot;the deaths have been 
        four times as numerous among troops in the United Kingdom as in temperate 
        colonies, and eight times as numerous as in tropical colonies,&quot; (p. 11.) 
        It follows, that had the home force alone been given in the Return, the 
        Small-pox mortality of the revaccinated and &quot;completely protected&quot; troops 
        would probably have been <i>greater</i> than that of the civil population 
        of corresponding ages! <font color="#990000">[[originally placed at the

        a pamphlet entitled &quot;<i>Plain Facts on Vaccination</i>,&quot; by G. Oliver, 
        about 1872, it was stated that in the Small-pox Hospital, Hampstead,--&quot;The 
        number of the unvaccinated patients, up to the age of <font color="990000">[[p. 
        34]]</font> ten years, greatly preponderates over the vaccinated of corresponding 
        ages.&quot; In the Homerton Small-pox Hospital in the eight years 1871-77, 
        there were 147 unvaccinated patients under 2 years old, to 20 vaccinated, 
        including among these the doubtful cases. <font color="#990000">[[originally

        <sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="14" id="14"></a>&nbsp;14</sup>It seems incredible, 
        but is nevertheless a fact, that in the whole body of official statistics 
        and reports relating to Vaccination, from the elaborate &quot;History and Practice 
        in Vaccination&quot; in 1857, containing Mr. Marson's celebrated paper on the 
        Statistics of the London Small-pox Hospitals, down to the latest Hospital 
        Statistics quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair, there is no recognition whatever 
        of the necessity of comparing <i>corresponding ages</i> in order to obtain 
        <i>true results</i> as to the <i>comparative mortality of the vaccinated 
        and unvaccinated</i>. Yet it was largely owing to these very Hospital 
        Statistics that the Penal Vaccination Laws were passed, and have been

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        159]]</font> Sir,--While thanking my friend Mr. Alex. Wheeler for his 
        too complimentary references to the little I have done for the cause of 
        freedom as regards the tyranny of the Vaccination laws, I wish to make 
        a remark as to one portion of his article which conveys an erroneous impression. 
        Mr. Wheeler says that he could not agree with my conclusion that &quot;Vaccination 
        may have caused more deaths than smallpox itself.&quot; This I am not surprised 
        at, because I do not myself accept such a statement, which is certainly 
        not mine. My words, carefully chosen, are--&quot;an operation <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        160]]</font> which has admittedly caused many deaths, which is probably 
        the cause of greater mortality than smallpox itself&quot;--and I call attention 
        to the change from the past tense in the first part of the passage to 
        the present tense--&quot;is probably the cause&quot;--in the latter part. This clearly 
        means, not that &quot;Vaccination may have caused more deaths than smallpox&quot;--as 
        Mr. Wheeler states it, without any limitation of time, which would of 
        course be an absurdity--but that, at the <i>present time</i>, as the result 
        of general Vaccination for about fifty years, it may <i>now</i> be the 
        cause of more deaths than smallpox. This conclusion is drawn from the 
        table of the steadily-increasing mortality from certain inoculable diseases 
        (page 24 of my pamphlet), which <i>increase</i>, in thirty years (1850-1880), 
        was 357 per million (an increase which has continued since), while the 
        deaths from smallpox have not, for many years, averaged more than <i>one-fifth</i> 
        of this amount. If, therefore, only <i>one-fourth part</i> of the large 
        and steady increase of these diseases is due to Vaccination, then my belief 
        that Vaccination <i>is now</i> the cause of greater mortality than smallpox 
        itself is fully justified; and in the contention that this is &quot;probably&quot; 
        the case I do not think that I shall find myself in the minority among 
        the readers of the <i>Inquirer</i>. This indirect effect of Vaccination 
        is further increased by its direct effects, which are now known to be 
        far more terrible, and to produce far greater mortality than was formerly 
        suspected or admitted.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take the opportunity of requesting 
        such of your readers as may have copies of my pamphlet to erase from line 
        11 on page 21, to line 9 on page 22, 2nd edition (or, in the first edition, 
        from line 8 on page 20 to line 4 on page 21--Ed. V. I.), as the figures 
        and conclusions therein are erroneous.</p>

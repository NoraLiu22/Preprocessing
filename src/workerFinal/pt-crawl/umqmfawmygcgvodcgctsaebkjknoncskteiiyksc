Services and Collections</a></h3>

<p>
The Ockham Initiative is building a framework for creating 
component-based digital library services and collections. The framework 
is essentially organized into two parts: a registry and a set of 
internet-available services. The registry is an application residing
on a peer-to-peer network. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the 
discovery of digital library services and collections on the Internet. 
The set of internet-available services implements common digital library 
functions such as annotating, collecting, creating, deleting, editing,
finding, organizing, reviewing, etc. They provide these functions
through lightweight protocols such as the OAI-PMH or SRU/SRW&#151;
as well as through web services.
</p>

<p>
In accord with Ockham's Razor, the goal of the initiative is to create
systems that are useful, while at the same time lack unnecessary
complexity. The example services are intended to be well defined,
straightforward, and easily usable components, that fit clearly into
a larger environment. They are designed to use existing protocols
and intended to build on current best practices. As new protocols
and better practices are developed, the framework should accommodate
change easily. For example, the registry service will use OAI to
harvest metadata from service providers and to afford a Z30.50 and/or
an SRW interface to the harvested data. The proposed alerting service
also harvests OAI data from selected repositories plus the recent
acquisitions from traditional library catalogs to form sets of "new"
information. Access to these sets will be provided via an SRU
Interface, and each resulting SRU URL will be used to embody a
user's information profile. Other example services include: a
cataloging service, a pathfinding service, and a "find more like
this one" service.
</p>

<p>
The initial focus of the Ockham Initiative is the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) funded National Science Digital Library (NSDL).
It is desired to make NSDL content more accessible,
especially to the millions served by the libraries of the nation's
colleges and universities, which are expected to expand their
collaborations by setting up peer-to-peer networks according to
diverse principles in accord with a wide range of economic,
educational, political, scholarly, and social needs / opportunities.
Further, the Ockham framework and the example services also are
designed to accommodate the needs of just about any digital library.
</p>

<p>
The main current project development is sponsored by the NSF. It
is led by four co-PI's: Martin Halbert (Emory University), Ed Fox
(Virginia Tech), Jeremy Frumkin (Oregon State), and Eric Lease
Morgan (University of Notre Dame). For more information about

</p>

<p>
The Association of College &amp; Research Libraries' (ACRL) Effective
Practices Committee is accepting submissions for its web-based
clearinghouse for effective practices in academic libraries.  The
Effective Practices web site can be found at
www.acrl.org/effectivepractices.
</p>

<p>
The clearinghouse will document practices from all areas of academic
libraries; we're looking for examples of procedures or tools that have
been developed to (for example) streamline workflow, solve problems or
improve services.
</p>

<p>
An effective practice is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>aligned with the library's and parent organization's mission</li>
	<li>sustainable, cost-effective and has the potential for long-term impact on the library and its constituents</li>
</ul>

<p>
An effective practice has:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>outcomes that are measurable</li>
	<li>some degree of transferability</li>
</ul>


<p>
Effective practices can be submitted at &lt;<a href="http://www.acrl.org/effectivepractices">http://www.acrl.org/effectivepractices</a>&gt;.
Practices are then reviewed to see if they meet the criteria listed above.
Once accepted, ACRL will post the practice on the web site and send the
submitting library a letter acknowledging its contribution to the
Effective Practices clearinghouse.
</p>

<p>
As more effective practices are submitted and the clearinghouse grows,
academic librarians looking for ideas to improve specific practices in
their own libraries or just shopping for good ideas will be able to browse
by category and search by keyword.
</p>

<p>
Please take a look at the effective practices already on the page and
consider submitting your own effective practice.  If you have questions,
feel free to contact Priscilla Finley, Chair of the Effective Practices
Committee at priscillafinley&#064;ccmail.nevada.edu or 702-895-2132.

</p>

<p>
Within the framework of the SEPIA (Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access) project, the Working Group on Descriptive Models developed a model and set of recommendations for cataloguing photographic collections. This model, called SEPIADES, consists of a wide range of suggested elements to describe digitally born as well as analogue photographic materials. It allows cataloguing on item as well as grouping or collection level.
</p>


<p>
On the basis of these recommendations, in close cooperation with the Working Group, an open-source software tool has been built to implement the SEPIADES model.  The main features of the SEPIADES software tool are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>multi-level description, allowing users to create their own hierarchy</li>
	<li>flexible and easy customizing to specific demands of users, providing extensive control over interface and contents</li>
	<li>cross-platform, running on Microsoft Windows 98 (1st or 2nd edition), NT 4.0 (with Service Pack 5 or later), ME, XP, and 2000 (with Service Pack 2 or later), OS X and Linux kernel v 2.2.12 and glibc v2.1.2-11 or later</li>
	<li>storage of records in human-readable XML format</li>
	<li>export function to Dublin Core according to recommended Dublin Core mapping by SEPIA Working Group on Descriptive Models</li>
	<li>search-and-retrieval function, based on Jakarta Lucene</li>
	<li>implementation of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), enabling users to share their data with others with minimal effort</li>
	<li>programmed in Java, allowing flexible integration with existing descriptive software packages</li>
	<li>GNU LGPL license, open source release</li>
	<li>UTF-8 compliant</li>
</ul>


<p>
Version 1.1. of the software tool can now be freely downloaded (as zip file)  from &lt;<a href="http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa/sepia/workinggroups/wp5/cataloguing.html">http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa/sepia/workinggroups/wp5/cataloguing.html</a>&gt;. On this webpage you will find more background information, a user manual and technical documentation on the software tool. 
</p>

<p>
Members of the Working Group on Descriptive Models who greatly encourage everyone to have a look at the tool and hope it will contribute to improve accessibility to our shared visual memory include: Kristin Aasb&#248;, 
Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority/National Library of Norway; Isabel Ortega Garc&#237;a, National Library of Spain; Anne Isomursu, Finnish Museum of Photography; Torsten Johansson, Stockholm City Museum/The Royal Library-National Library of Sweden; and Edwin Klijn, European Commission on Preservation and Access (ECPA).</p>

<H4>Elsevier's ScienceDirect spearheads authentication initiative</H4>

<p>October 27, 2004, announcement from Allison Szeliga, Ketchum for Elsevier - &quot;Elsevier's ScienceDirect (http://www.sciencedirect.com/), the world's largest online library for scientific, technological, medical and social science research with 1,900 titles and over 6 million full-text articles available, announces support for Shibboleth authentication. Elsevier shows its commitment to making access easier by support new authentication schemes in addition to the more 'traditional' ones, such as IP access.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At ScienceDirect, we are aware of the limitations that can be caused by IP access and/or access by username and password. Shibboleth overcomes these limitations by permitting users to authenticate themselves to a campus single sign-on system, and through the release of user-controlled information about him or herself, access remote resources anytime, anywhere. Furthermore, Shibboleth helps reduce the administrative burdens for both libraries and vendors.&quot;</p>

<H4>JISC Announces &pound;1million Digital Preservation Programme</H4>

<p>October 27, 2004 - &quot;The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) announced today that it is making grants totalling more than &pound;1million to nine UK educational institutions and their partners to support digital preservation and asset management in UK Higher and Further Education institutions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All UK universities and colleges face issues related to long-term management and preservation of information in digital format. Institutions increasingly invest heavily in digital materials but policies and procedures for long-term management of digital assets remain underdeveloped. JISC is funding projects in this programme to raise awareness of digital preservation issues and encourage and set in motion a process of integrating digital preservation and asset management into institutional strategies and operations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With the issue of scientific publishing and the role of institutional repositories currently under scrutiny through the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology, one strand of the programme will develop preservation services for these repositories. Other projects that will receive funding include work on assessment tools, training initiatives, and a range of exemplars such as the preservation of private papers in digital form.  The grants are the next step in a process initiated as part of the JISC strategy to help resolve the complex challenges involved in collecting, preserving and making available digital content over many decades.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information, please see the full press release at &lt;<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=digital_pres_pr_271004">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=digital_pres_pr_271004</a>&gt;.</p>

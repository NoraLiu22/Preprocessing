<h2><img src = "./gif/pendraw.gif"><font

Try your hand at a witty (or not so witty) "limerick."  You know, those
bouncy little poems that rhyme.  Here are a few examples:<p>
<center>
<table bgcolor="#ffffcc" border=2 cellpadding=25><tr><td>
The brain uses neurons to think,<BR>
To know, to remember, to drink,<BR> 
Without them you'll find,<BR> 
You'll be in a bind,<BR> 
Your body will fail and sink.</td>
<td> 
A neuron was once in the rain,<BR> 
It said "This is really a pain",<BR> 
It said to its friend,<BR> 
"This must really end",<BR> 
So a message was sent to the brain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The thalamus is a grand station,<BR>
It gives and receives information, <BR>
Gets messages here,<BR>
Sends messages there,<BR>
It's quite an important location.<p></td>
<td>
The brain is important, that's true,<BR>
For all things a person will do, <BR>
From reading to writing,<BR>
To skiing to biting,<BR>
It makes up the person who's you.<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2 align=center>It's a fortunate person whose brain<BR>
Is trained early, again and again,<BR>
And who continues to use it<BR>
To be sure not to lose it,<BR>
So the brain, in old age, may not wane.<p>

<td>Here is poem sent in by 7th grader, Taylor R.:<p>

A stimulus occurs when the environment starts changing,<BR>
for example when the sun comes out, either that or when it's raining.<BR>
A reaction is when you respond,<BR>
the choice is from your brain,<BR>
Such as turning from the sun,<BR>
to hide your eyes from pain.<BR>
It's different from a reflex,<BR>
impulses notify the brain,<BR>
just like putting up an umbrella, before it starts to rain.<BR>
You're conscious of your actions<BR>
you have the final choice.<BR>
Unlike a reflex reaction,<BR>
your brain has the voice.<p>

A fly goes by my eye and I automatically blink.<BR>
This is a reflex reaction because I didn't have time to think.<BR>
I didn't tell my brain, so it wasn't notified,<BR>
that I was being harassed by a pesky little fly.<BR>
See, that's what a reflex does,<BR>
the impulse does not go to the brain.<BR>
It goes straight to the part of the body,<BR>
that was touched or that felt pain.<BR>
The impulse hits the muscle<BR>
causing it to contract.<BR>
That part of the body moves a little,<BR>
then it moves on back.<p></td></tr></table>

<h2><img src = "./gif/pendraw.gif"><font color="#0000cc"> Create Your Own
Mnemonic Device</font></h2>

A mnemonic device is one way to help you remember.  One type of mnemonic
is called an "acrostic."  An acrostic is a phrase that uses the first
letters of words to remember the entire phrase. For example, the
phrase:<p> <center> My Very Early Morning Jam Sandwich Usually Nauseates
People<p> OR<p> My Very Excellent Mom Just Served Us Nine
Pizzas</center><p>

These two phrases represent the order of planets from the Sun:  Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.  This is
because the first letters in each of the words of the phrase are the
first letters of the nine planets in order.<P>

Another memory trick is by constructing a catchy phrase from the first
letters of a phrase.  For example:<p>
<center><font size="+2">Roy G. Biv</font></center><p>

Who is Roy G. Biv?  Actually, Roy G. Biv is not a person.  The letters, "r
o y g b i v" stand for the first letters of the colors of the visible
spectrum (also the colors of the rainbow):  red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo and violet.<p>

<font color=red>Create your own memory device</font> for the following:
<ul>
<li>The classification scheme of living organisms - Kingdom, Phylum,
Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species
<li>Colors of the visible spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo and violet
<li>Order of the planets in the solar system:  Mercury, Venus, Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto</ul>

<p>The goal of this reorganization is to improve the capacity of the Government to strengthen the export performance of United States industry and to assure fair <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="30" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> practices, taking into account the interests of all elements of our economy.</p>
<p>Recent developments, which have raised concern about the vitality of our <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="31" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> performance, have focused much attention on the way our trade machinery is organized. These developments include our negative trade balance, increasing dependence upon foreign oil, and international pressures on the dollar. New challenges, such as implementation of the Multilateral Trade Negotiation (MTN) agreements and trade with non-market economies, will further test our Government trade organization.</p>
<p>We must be prepared to apply domestically the MTN codes on procurement, subsidies, standards, and customs valuation. We also must monitor major implementation measures abroad, reporting back to American business on important developments and, where necessary, raising questions internationally about foreign implementation. MTN will work—will open new markets for U.S. labor, farmers, and business—only if we have adequate procedures for aggressively monitoring and enforcing it. We intend to meet our obligations, and we expect others to do the same.</p>
<p>The trade machinery we now have cannot do this job effectively. Although the Special Trade Representative (STR) takes the lead role in administering the trade agreements program, many issues are handled elsewhere and no agency has across-the-board leadership in trade. Aside from the Trade Representative and the Export-Import Bank, trade is not the primary concern of any Executive branch agency where trade functions are located. The current arrangements lack a central authority capable of planning a coherent trade strategy and assuring its vigorous implementation.</p>
<p>This reorganization is designed to correct such deficiencies and to prepare us for strong enforcement of the MTN codes. It aims to improve our export promotion activities so that United States exporters can take full advantage of trade opportunities in foreign markets. It provides for the timely and efficient administration of our unfair trade laws. It also establishes an efficient mechanism for shaping an effective, comprehensive United States trade policy.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, I propose to place policy coordination and negotiation—those <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="32" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> functions that most require comprehensiveness, influence, and Government-wide perspective—in the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/executive_office_of_the_president" occur="3" src="named_federal_agencies">Executive Office of the President</span>. I propose to place operational and implementation responsibilities, which are staff-intensive, in line departments that have the requisite resources and knowledge of the major sectors of our economy to handle them. I have concluded that building our trade structure on STR and<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce," class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce,</a> respectively, best satisfies these considerations.</p>
<p>I propose to enhance STR, to be renamed the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/eop_office_of_the_united_states_trade_representative" occur="6" src="named_federal_agencies">Office of the United States Trade Representative</span>, by centralizing in it <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="33" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> policy development, coordination and negotiation functions. The<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce </a>Department will become the focus of non-agricultural operational trade responsibilities by adding to its<a aria-label="Definitions -  existing " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-2122697333-1611362680&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> existing </a>duties those for commercial representation abroad, antidumping and countervailing<a aria-label="Definitions -  duty " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-3095254-1611362686&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> duty </a>cases, the non-agricultural aspects of MTN implementation, national security investigations, and embargoes.</p>
</div>
<div class="note" topic="miscellaneous"><span class="heading centered smallCaps">the united states trade representative</span>
<p>The Trade Representative, with the advice of the Trade Policy Committee, will be responsible for developing and coordinating our <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="34" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> and direct investment policy, including the following areas:</p>
<p stripi="True">Import remedies.—The Trade Representative will exercise policy oversight of the application of import remedies, analyze long-term trends in import remedy cases and recommend any necessary legislative changes. For antidumping and countervailing <a aria-label="Definitions - duty" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-3095254-1611362686&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">duty</a> matters, such coordination, to the extent legally permissible, will be directed toward the establishment of new precedents, negotiation of assurances, and coordination with other trade matters, rather than case-by-case fact finding and determinations.</p>
<p stripi="True">East-West trade policy.—The Trade Representative will have lead responsibility for East-West <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/itc_trade_negotiations" occur="24" src="named_federal_agencies">trade negotiations</span> and will coordinate East-West trade policy. The Trade Policy Committee will assume the responsibilities of the East-West Foreign Trade Board.</p>
<p stripi="True">International investment policy.—The Trade Representative will have the policy lead regarding issues of direct foreign investment in the United States, direct investment by Americans abroad, operations of multinational enterprises, and multilateral agreements on international investment, insofar as such issues relate to <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="35" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span>.</p>
<p stripi="True">International commodity policy.—The Trade Representative will assume responsibility for commodity negotiations and also will coordinate commodity policy.</p>
<p stripi="True">Energy trade.—While the Departments of Energy and State will continue to share responsibility for international energy issues, the Trade Representative will coordinate energy trade matters. The <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_energy" occur="1" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Energy</span> will become a member of the TPC.</p>
<p stripi="True">Export-expansion policy.—To ensure a vigorous and coordinated Government-wide export expansion effort, policy oversight of our export expansion activities will be the responsibility of the Trade Representative.</p>
<p>The Trade Representative will have the lead role in bilateral and multilateral trade, commodity, and direct investment negotiations. The Trade Representative will represent the United States in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) matters. Since the GATT will be the principal international forum for implementing and interpreting the MTN agreements and since GATT meetings, including committee and working group meetings, occur almost continuously, the Trade Representative will have a limited number of permanent staff in Geneva. In some cases, it may be necessary to assign a small number of USTR staff abroad to assist in oversight of MTN enforcement. In this event, appropriate positions will be authorized. In recognition of the responsibility of the Secretary of State regarding our foreign policy, the activities of overseas personnel of the Trade Representative and the <a aria-label="Definitions - Commerce" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">Commerce</a> Department will be fully coordinated with other elements of our diplomatic missions.</p>
<p>In addition to his role with regard to GATT matters, the Trade Representative will have the lead responsibility for trade and commodity matters considered in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/united_nations" occur="3" src="named_federal_agencies">United Nations</span> Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) when such matters are the primary issues under negotiation. Because of the Secretary of State’s foreign policy responsibilities, and the responsibilities of the Director of the International Development Cooperation Agency as the President’s principal advisor on development, the Trade Representative will exercise his OECD and UNCTAD responsibilities in close cooperation with these officials.</p>
<p>To ensure that all <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/itc_trade_negotiations" occur="25" src="named_federal_agencies">trade negotiations</span> are handled consistently and that our negotiating leverage is employed to the maximum, the Trade Representative will manage the negotiation of particular issues. Where appropriate, the Trade Representative may delegate responsibility for negotiations to other agencies with expertise on the issues under consideration. He will coordinate the operational aspects of negotiations through a Trade Negotiating Committee, chaired by the Trade Representative and including the Departments of<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce," class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce,</a> State, Treasury, Agriculture and Labor.</p>
<p>The Trade Representative will be concerned not only with ongoing negotiations and coordination of specific, immediate issues, but also—very importantly—with the development of long-term United States trade strategies and policies. He will oversee implementation of the MTN agreements, and will advise the President on the effects of other Government policies (e.g., antitrust, taxation) on U.S. trade. In order to participate more fully in oversight of international investment and export financing activities, the Trade Representative will become a member of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies and the Boards of the Export-Import Bank and the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/overseas_private_investment_corporation" occur="4" src="named_federal_agencies">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</span> [now the United States International Development Finance Corporation].</p>
<p>In performing these functions, the Trade Representative will act as the principal trade spokesman of the President. To assure that our trade policies take into account the broadest range of perspectives, the Trade Representative will consult with the Trade Policy Committee, whose mandate and membership will be expanded. The Trade Representative will, as appropriate, invite agencies such as the Export-Import Bank and the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/overseas_private_investment_corporation" occur="5" src="named_federal_agencies">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</span> to participate in TPC meetings in addition to the permanent TPC members. When different departmental views on trade matters exist within the TPC as will be the case from time to time in this complex policy area, I will expect the Trade Representative to resolve policy disagreements in his best judgment, subject to appeal to the President.</p>

<p>The <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="7" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span>, under this proposal, will become the focal point of operational responsibilities in the non-agricultural trade area. My reorganization plan will transfer to the<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce </a>Department important responsibilities for administration of countervailing and antidumping matters, foreign commercial representation, and MTN implementation support. Consolidating these trade functions in the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="8" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> builds upon an agency with extensive trade experience. The Department will retain its operational responsibilities in such areas as export controls, East-West trade, trade adjustment assistance to firms and communities, trade policy analysis, and monitoring foreign compliance with trade agreements. The Department will be substantially reorganized to consolidate and reshape its trade functions under an Under Secretary for <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="36" src="named_federal_agencies">International Trade</span>.</p>
<p>With this reorganization, trade functions will be strengthened within the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="9" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span>, and such related efforts in the Department as improvement of industrial innovation and the productivity, encouraging local and regional economic development, and sectoral analysis, will be closely linked to an aggressive trade program. Fostering the international competitiveness of American industry will become the principal mission of the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="10" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span>.</p>
<p stripi="True">Import remedies</p>
<p>I propose to transfer to the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="11" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> responsibility for administration of the countervailing<a aria-label="Definitions -  duty " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-3095254-1611362686&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> duty </a>and antidumping statutes. This function will be performed efficiently and effectively in an organizational setting where trade is the primary mission. This activity will be directed by a new Assistant Secretary for Trade Administration, subject to <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/cong_senate" occur="22" src="named_federal_agencies">Senate</span> confirmation. Although the plan permits its provisions to take effect as late as <span class="date" date="1980-10-01">October 1, 1980</span>, I intend to make this transfer effective by <span class="date" date="1980-01-01">January 1, 1980</span>, so that it will occur as the new MTN codes take effect.<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce </a>will continue its supportive role in the staffing of other<a aria-label="Definitions -  unfair trade practice " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-1293363782-727436724&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> unfair trade practice </a>issues, such as cases arising under section 301 of the <a href="/topn/trade_act_of_1974">Trade Act of 1974</a> [<a aria-label="19 U.S.C. 2411" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu//uscode/text/19/2411">19 U.S.C. 2411</a>].</p>
<p stripi="True">Commercial representation</p>
<p>This reorganization plan will transfer to the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="12" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> responsibility for commercial representation abroad. This transfer would place both domestic and overseas export promotion activities under a single organization, directed by an Assistant Secretary for Export Development, charged with aggressively expanding U.S. export opportunities. Placing this Foreign Commercial Service in the<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce </a>Department will allow commercial officers to concentrate on the promotion of U.S. exports as their principal activity.</p>
<p>Initially, the transfer of commercial representation from State to <a aria-label="Definitions - Commerce" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">Commerce</a> will involve all full-time overseas trade promotion and commercial positions (approximately 162), responsibility for this function in the countries (approximately 60) to which these individuals are assigned, and the associated foreign national employees in those countries. Over time, the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="13" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> undoubtedly will review the deployment of commercial officers in light of changing trade circumstances and propose extensions or alterations of coverage of the Foreign Commercial Service.</p>
<p stripi="True">MTN implementation</p>
<p>I am dedicated to the aggressive implementation of the Multilateral Trade Agreements. The United States must seize the opportunities and enforce the obligations created by these agreements. Under this proposal, the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="14" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> will assign high priority to this task. The <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="15" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of non-agricultural aspects of the MTN agreements. Management of this function will be a principal assignment of an Assistant Secretary for Trade Policy and Programs. Implementation activities will include:</p>
<p>monitoring agreements and targeting problems for consultation and negotiation;</p>
<p>operating a Trade Complaint Center where the private sector can receive advice as to the recourse and remedies available;</p>
<p>aiding in the settlement of disputes, including staffing of formal complaint cases;</p>
<p>identifying problem areas for consideration by the Trade Representative and the Trade Policy Committee;</p>
<p>educational and promotion programs regarding the provisions of the agreements and the processes for dealing with problems that arise;</p>
<p>providing American business with basic information on foreign laws, regulations and procedures;</p>
<p>consultations with private sector advisory committees; and</p>
<p>general analytical support.</p>
<p>These responsibilities will be handled by a unit built around the staff from <a aria-label="Definitions - Commerce" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">Commerce</a> that provided essential analytical support to STR throughout the MTN negotiation process. Building implementation of MTN around this core group will assure that the government’s institutional memory and expertise on MTN is most effectively devoted to the challenge ahead. When American business needs information or encounters problems in the MTN area, it can turn to the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="16" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> for knowledgeable assistance.</p>
<p>Matching the increased importance of trade in the Department’s mission will be a much strengthened trade organization within the Department. By creating a number of new senior level positions in the Department, we will ensure that trade policy implementation receives the kind of day-to-day top management attention that it both demands and requires.</p>
<p>With its new responsibilities and resources, the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="17" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span> will become a key participant in the formulation of our trade policies. Much of the analysis in support of trade policy formulation will be conducted by the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="18" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span>, which will be close to the operational aspects of the problems that raise policy issues.</p>
<p>To succeed in global competition, we must have a better understanding of the problems and prospects of U.S. industry, particularly in relation to the growing strength of industries abroad. This is the key reason why we will upgrade sectoral analysis capabilities throughout the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="19" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span>, including the creation of a new Bureau of Industrial Analysis.<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce," class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce,</a> with its ability to link trade to policies affecting industry, is uniquely suited to serve as the principal technical expert within the Government on special industry sector problems requiring international consultation, as well as to provide industry-specific information on how tax, regulatory and other Government policies affect the international competitiveness of the U.S. industries.</p>
<p>Commerce will also expand its traditional trade policy focus on industrial issues to deal with the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="37" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> and investment problems of our growing services sector. Under the proposal, there will be comprehensive service industry representation in our industry advisory process, as well as a continuing effort to bring services under international discipline. I expect the<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce </a>Department to play a major role in developing new service sector initiatives for consideration within the Government.</p>
<p>After an investigation lasting over a year, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to carry out the policy set forth in <a href="/uscode/text/5/901#a">section 901(a) of title 5</a> of the United States Code. As described above, this reorganization will increase significantly our ability to implement the MTN agreements efficiently and effectively and will improve greatly the services of the government with regard to export development. These improvements will be achieved with no increase in personnel or expenditures, except for an annual expense of about $300,000 for the salaries and clerical support of the three additional senior<a aria-label="Definitions -  Commerce " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=19-USC-602412325-1587364334&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> Commerce </a>Department officials and a non-recurring expense of approximately $600,000 in connection with the transfers of functions provided in the plan. I find that the reorganization made by this plan makes necessary the provisions for the appointment and pay of a Deputy Secretary, an Under Secretary for <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="38" src="named_federal_agencies">International Trade</span>, and two additional Assistant Secretaries of the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_commerce" occur="20" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Commerce</span>, and additional members of the Boards of Directors of the Export-Import Bank and the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/overseas_private_investment_corporation" occur="6" src="named_federal_agencies">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</span> [now the United States International Development Finance Corporation].</p>
<p>It is indeed appropriate that this proposal follows so soon after the overwhelming approval by the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/congress" occur="16" src="named_federal_agencies">Congress</span> of the <a href="/topn/trade_agreements_act_of_1979">Trade Agreements Act of 1979</a> [<a aria-label="19 U.S.C. 2501" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu//uscode/text/19/2501">19 U.S.C. 2501</a> et seq.], for it will sharpen and unify trade policy direction, improve the efficiency of trade law enforcement, and enable us to negotiate abroad from a position of strength. The extensive discussions between Administration officials and the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/congress" occur="17" src="named_federal_agencies">Congress</span> on this plan have been a model of the kind of cooperation that can exist between the two branches. I look forward to our further cooperation in successfully implementing both this reorganization proposal and the MTN agreements.</p>

<span class="heading centered smallCaps">Reforming Developing-Country Status in the World Trade Organization</span>
<p>Memorandum of President of the United States, <span class="date" date="2019-07-26">July 26, 2019</span>, <a aria-label="84 F.R. 37555" href="/rio/citation/84_FR_37555">84 F.R. 37555</a>, provided:</p>
<p>Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative</p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby directed as follows:</p>
<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Section</span> 1. Policy. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was created to spur economic growth and raise standards of living by establishing <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="50" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> rules premised on principles of transparency, openness, and predictability. Although economic tides have risen worldwide since the WTO’s inception in 1995, the WTO continues to rest on an outdated dichotomy between developed and developing countries that has allowed some WTO Members to gain unfair advantages in the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/sba_international_trade" occur="51" src="named_federal_agencies">international trade</span> arena. Nearly two-thirds of WTO Members have been able to avail themselves of special treatment and to take on weaker commitments under the WTO framework by designating themselves as developing countries. While some developing-country designations are proper, many are patently unsupportable in light of current economic circumstances. For example, 7 out of the 10 wealthiest economies in the world as measured by Gross Domestic Product per capita on a purchasing-power parity basis—Brunei, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Macao, Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates—currently claim developing-country status. Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey—members of both the G20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)—also claim this status.</p>
<p>When the wealthiest economies claim developing-country status, they harm not only other developed economies but also economies that truly require special and differential treatment. Such disregard for adherence to WTO rules, including the likely disregard of any future rules, cannot continue to go unchecked.</p>
<p>China most dramatically illustrates the point. Since joining the WTO in 2001, China has continued to insist that it is a developing country and thus has the right to avail itself of flexibilities under any new WTO rules. The United States has never accepted China’s claim to developing-country status, and virtually every current economic indicator belies China’s claim. After years of explosive growth, China has the second largest Gross Domestic Product in the world, behind only the United States. China accounts for nearly 13 percent of total global exports of goods, while its global share of such exports jumped five-fold between 1995 and 2017. It has been the largest global exporter of goods each year since 2009. Further, China’s preeminent status in exports is not limited to goods from low-wage manufacturing sectors. China currently ranks first in the world for exports of high-technology products, with such exports alone increasing by 3,800 percent between 1995 and 2016.</p>
<p>Other economic figures tell a similar story. Valued at nearly $1.5 trillion, China’s outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) exceeds that of 32 of 36 OECD countries, while its inbound FDI of nearly $2.9 trillion exceeds all but one OECD country. China is home to 120 of the world’s 500 largest companies, and its defense expenditures and total number of satellites in space are second only to those of the United States.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these facts and other evidence of economic vibrancy, China and too many other countries have continued to style themselves as developing countries, allowing them to enjoy the benefits that come with that status and seek weaker commitments than those made by other WTO Members. These countries claim entitlement to longer timeframes for the imposition of safeguards, generous transition periods, softer tariff cuts, procedural advantages for WTO disputes, and the ability to avail themselves of certain export subsidies—all at the expense of other WTO Members. These countries have also consistently sought weaker commitments than other WTO Members in ongoing negotiations, which has significantly stymied progress. Moreover, many of the world’s most advanced economies have used developing-country status as an excuse not to comply with the most basic notification requirements under WTO rules, depriving United States traders of vital trade data. The status quo cannot continue.</p>
<p>The WTO is in desperate need of reform, without which the WTO will be unable to address the needs of workers and businesses or the challenges posed by the modern global economy. The United States is also pressing for critical reforms in other multilateral international organizations to help ensure that those organizations recognize the economic development of their members and can work within their mandates to address important challenges. The need to reform international economic institutions is not just a challenge for the United States but for all countries that participate in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>With respect to the WTO, there is no hope of progress in resolving this challenge until the world’s most advanced economies are prepared to take on the full commitments associated with WTO membership. To help ensure that those countries live up to their commitments, it shall be the policy of the United States to make trade more free, fair, and reciprocal by devoting all necessary resources toward changing the WTO approach to developing-country status such that advanced economies can no longer avail themselves of unwarranted benefits despite abundant evidence of economic strength.</p>
<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Sec</span>. 2. Changing the WTO Approach to Flexibilities Associated with Developing-Country Status. (a) To advance the policy set forth in section 1 of this memorandum, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, use all available means to secure changes at the WTO that would prevent self-declared developing countries from availing themselves of flexibilities in WTO rules and negotiations that are not justified by appropriate economic and other indicators. Where appropriate and consistent with law, the USTR shall pursue this action in cooperation with other like-minded WTO Members.</p>
<p>(b) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum [<span class="date" date="2019-07-26">July 26, 2019</span>], the USTR shall update the President on his progress under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Sec</span>. 3. Ending Unfair Trade Benefits. (a) If, within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the USTR determines that substantial progress has not been made toward achieving the changes described in section 2 of this memorandum, the USTR shall, as appropriate and to the extent consistent with law:</p>
<p>(i) no longer treat as a developing country for the purposes of the WTO any WTO Member that in the USTR’s judgment is improperly declaring itself a developing country and inappropriately seeking the benefit of flexibilities in WTO rules and negotiations; and</p>
<p>(ii) where relevant, not support any such country’s membership in the OECD.</p>
<p>(b) Before taking any action under subsection (a) of this section, the USTR shall:</p>
<p>(i) consult with the Trade Policy Committee established under section 242 of the <a href="/topn/trade_expansion_act_of_1962">Trade Expansion Act of 1962</a> (<a aria-label="19 U.S.C. 1872" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu//uscode/text/19/1872">19 U.S.C. 1872</a>);</p>
<p>(ii) consult with the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/eop_national_security_council" occur="1" src="named_federal_agencies">National Security Council</span> and the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/eop_oopd_national_economic_council" occur="1" src="named_federal_agencies">National Economic Council</span> as to the advisability of interagency coordination through the process described in National Security Presidential Memorandum–4 of <span class="date" date="2017-04-04">April 4, 2017</span> (Organization of the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/eop_national_security_council" occur="2" src="named_federal_agencies">National Security Council</span>, the Homeland Security Council, and Subcommittees) [<a aria-label="50 U.S.C. 3021" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu//uscode/text/50/3021">50 U.S.C. 3021</a> note], or any successor document; and</p>
<p>(iii) consider the WTO Member’s involvement in global trade, membership in key economic decision-making groups, placement within relative economic and other indicators, and any other factors the USTR deems appropriate.</p>
<p>(c) The USTR shall publish on its website a list of all self-declared developing countries that the USTR believes are inappropriately seeking the benefit of developing-country flexibilities in WTO rules and negotiations.</p>
<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Sec</span>. 4. Publication. The USTR is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

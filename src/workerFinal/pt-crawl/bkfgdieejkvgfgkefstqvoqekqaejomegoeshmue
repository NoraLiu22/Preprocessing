<h2>What is PCP?</h2> <i>"Angel Dust," "Hog," "Rocket Fuel," "DOA," "Peace
Pill"</i> - these are other names for the illegal drug <font
color=red>phencyclidine (PCP)</font>.  PCP was developed in the 1950s as
an anesthetic.  However, the use of PCP as an anesthetic was stopped after
some people experienced psychotic reactions after using the drug.  
PCP is now made illegally and has found its way onto the street, often
contaminating other street drugs.  In fact, PCP is often sold in place of
drugs such as LSD and mescaline. According to the <a href =
"http://www.monitoringthefuture.org">Monitoring the Future</A> survey of
drug trends, 2.3% of 12th graders in the United States used PCP sometime
during the year 2000.<p>

PCP is classified as a dissociative anesthetic because users appear to be
"disconnected" from their environment:  they know where they are,
but they do not feel as if they are part of it. The drug has different
effects on different people.  It can act as a stimulant, a depressant, an
analgesic (decreasing pain) or a hallucinogen depending on the dose and
route of administration.  The effects produced by PCP are different from
those caused by hallucinogens such as <a href = "lsd.html">LSD</A>.  
Rather than producing visual hallucinations, PCP causes changes in body
image. In addition to these distortions of reality, PCP can cause
frightening side effects such as feelings of terror and confusion.</td>

<h2>Behavioral Effects of PCP</h2> PCP can be eaten, snorted, injected or
smoked.  Depending on how a person takes the drug, the effects are felt
within a few minutes (2-5 minutes when smoked) to an hour.  PCP can stay
in a person's body for a long time;  the half-life of PCP ranges from 11
to 51 hours.  Furthermore, because PCP is made illegally under
uncontrolled conditions, users have no way of knowing how much PCP they
are taking.  This makes PCP especially dangerous.<P>

PCP users are often characterized as violent or suicidal.  However, this
portrait of a PCP user may not be accurate.  Dr. Jaime Diaz, a professor
in the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington, reviewed
many of the published reports of PCP use in his book, <i>How Drugs
Influence Behavior.  A Neuro-Behavioral Approach</i> <font 
size="-1">(Upper Saddle River (NJ): Prentice Hall, 1997)</font>. He states 
that PCP use rarely results in violence and concludes that:<p>
<center>
"Phencyclidine does not <i>cause</i> aggression or criminal 
behavior."</center><P>

Dr. Diaz believes that the reported violent behavior is not due to the
pharmacological effect of PCP, but rather is the result of the way people
under the influence of PCP perceive things and are subsequently treated by
law enforcement personnel.  People under the influence of PCP may not feel
pain and their perception of sensory stimuli may be altered, possibly
causing police officers to use stronger methods to control such
individuals.</td>

<h2>Effects of PCP on the Brain</h2> 

PCP affects multiple neurotransmitter systems in the brain.  For example,
PCP inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin 
and also inhibits the action of glutamate by blocking NMDA
receptors.  Some types of opioid receptors in the brain are also affected
by PCP.   These complex effects on multiple chemical systems in the brain 
most likely underlie the behavioral effects of PCP.

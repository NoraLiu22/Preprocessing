/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 57]]</font> Mr. Common's 
          reply to his critics, while containing much with which most of us will 
          agree, is yet full of obscurities, unfounded assumptions, or positive 
          errors, some of which need to be pointed out, since they are fundamental 
          to the question at issue. 
        
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is little to object to in the first four principles 
        he lays down, except that they imply, as clearly shown in (4) <i><font color="990000">[[i.e., 
        the fourth principle --Ed.]]</font></i>, an exclusive application to &quot;physically 
        and mentally superior individuals&quot; instead of to all. This would lead, 
        logically and practically, to a restricted and perhaps hereditary oligarchy 
        of the stronger and less moral individuals, with the slavery or destruction 
        of all who opposed them. This is more plainly indicated in (5) where &quot;greater 
        advantages&quot; are claimed for the &quot;better class of individuals,&quot; which really 
        means the stronger, more cunning and more self-seeking, who, believing 
        themselves to be the best, will enforce that belief, as to a considerable 
        extent they always have done and do now. Mr. Common nowhere suggests that 
        these &quot;superior individuals&quot; are likely to be restrained by any moral 
        considerations in their efforts to obtain those &quot;greater advantages&quot; which 
        he declares are their due. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under such an oligarchy, once established, what 
          chance would there be for the inventors, the thinkers, the artists, 
          the moralists--the real aristocracy of the human race--except so far 
          as they helped to increase the wealth and luxury and power of the &quot;superior 
          individuals.&quot; The slavery and tyranny, the assassinations and poisonings, 
          of Greece and Venice, would inevitably be reproduced in any society 
          whose fundamental principle was, that social and economic inequality 
          was right, and that the stronger--physically or mentally--were justified 
          in using their alleged inferiors for their own ends. Such a system would 
          bring back the old bad days of--&quot;Truth for ever on the scaffold, Wrong 
          for ever on the throne&quot;--and I challenge Mr. Common to prove that it 
          could lead to anything else.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One would think that the evils of class-privilege 
          and every other form of aristocracy had been sufficiently demonstrated 
          in the past, to render it certain that this is <i>not</i> the road by 
          which the future welfare of humanity is to be attained. True social 
          excellence, to use Mr. Common's own term, can only be reached by utilising 
          all the powers and capacities of the whole community, under the conditions 
          best adapted to develope them; and no other means of doing this has 
          been suggested but that &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; and of economic status 
          which Mr. Common declares to be absurd. But his statement on this point, 
          in his principle (5), shows that he entirely misunderstands the grounds 
          upon which it is advocated. His argument as to agriculturists not giving 
          the same chance to inferior plants and to weeds as to the crops they 
          are raising, is a false analogy, and is entirely beside the question. 
          The true analogy of men wishing to improve men, or rather of communities 
          seeking their own highest well-being, is not that of the farmer and 
          his crops, but of the plant-world seeking to improve itself, and having 
          some power, though limited, of doing so. In that case it is quite certain 
          that many of the best, in our opinion, that is the most beautiful and 
          highly developed in flower and foliage would be exterminated, while 
          the quickest growing trees and the coarsest and most vigorous weeds 
          and climbers would alone survive. They would claim to possess the highest 
          plant-excellence; they would therefore claim greater advantages of situation, 
          soil, etc., and would only permit the existence of what they would term 
          inferior types so far as not to interfere with their own well-being.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, when he says that semi-idiots should not 
          have a university education, he equally misunderstands the principle 
          of equality of opportunity. This does not mean the <i>same</i> education 
          for all--that is the present absurd plan--but equal facilities for developing 
          all that is best in their natures, so as to enable them to spend happy 
          and useful lives; for there is probably no human being that could not 
          attain to this condition by proper nurture and training. The greatest 
          scientific worker and thinker of the century, Faraday, and the greatest 
          artistic genius, Tinworth, were both rescued by a mere chance from a 
          life of mean drudgery, to which hundreds and perhaps thousands <font color="990000">[[p. 
          58]]</font> of similar bright spirits are condemned. We claim, that 
          complete equality of opportunity, including economic independence, is 
          essential for the development and utilization of <i>all</i> the good 
          and useful qualities of <i>every</i> human being and therefore for the 
          true advancement of the race. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But perhaps the most erroneous and most vicious 
          of Nietzsche's principles, according to Mr. Common, is that enunciated 
          in the last sentence of (5)--&quot;And it is still more absurd to advocate, 
          . . . that the inferior class should be allowed to breed like vermin, 
          and that their spawn should be supported at the cost of the better classes.&quot; 
          In order to understand what this really means we want a tolerably accurate 
          definition of the terms &quot;inferior&quot; and &quot;better.&quot; We may take either 
          of two extreme definitions--that the inferior are the criminal classes 
          only, or that they are the working as opposed to the professional and 
          propertied classes. If we take the latter and more popular definition 
          we have to remark first that the facts as to who supports who, are the 
          exact opposite of Mr. Common's statement, since the workers undoubtedly 
          support the non-workers, and the children of the non-workers as well 
          as their own. Secondly, it is generally admitted that the &quot;better classes,&quot; 
          as above defined, would either remain stationary in numbers or would 
          even decrease if they were not recruited from the &quot;inferior&quot; class. 
          The more rapid increase of these latter is therefore a benefit to the 
          nation.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now considering the alternative view, that the criminals 
          are to be considered as the inferior class (compared by Mr. Common with 
          vermin), who are not to be allowed to breed, we shall at once see that 
          this is not only impracticable, but would be probably hurtful to society. 
          It is a mistake to assume that those whom we now punish as criminals 
          are essentially bad in nature, or are even, on the average, at all inferior 
          to the majority of those who lead ordinarily respectable lives. Many 
          highwaymen of the last century and some burglars of to-day, are men 
          of exceptional ability who, under favourable conditions of education 
          and nurture would become esteemed and useful members of society. A considerable 
          proportion of the population of New South Wales, before the gold discoveries, 
          consisted of released convicts and their descendants, and these were 
          in no way inferior to the average of honest emigrants. So, the waifs 
          and strays from the gutters of the East End of London, when rescued 
          and trained by Dr. Barnardo, are found to be quite up to the average 
          of respectable citizens. These examples support the view so strongly 
          urged by Herbert Spencer, that what are termed the lower, the middle, 
          and the upper classes are fundamentally alike, morally and intellectually. 
          Their differences depend wholly on their environment and early education, 
          and there is no reason to believe that the average of inherent vice 
          or passion is greater in one class than in the other. But owing to the 
          great differences in the environment and economic condition of the three 
          classes their vices are exhibited in widely different ways, and those 
          of the upper and middle classes, though equally great, do not so often 
          bring them within the meshes of the law. The aristocratic bankrupts 
          or gamblers, and the middle-class promoters or directors of bubble companies, 
          are often worse morally than the bulk of our criminals, but they are 
          not so often found out.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea that society can be improved by forcible 
          interference with the increase of the various classes is one of the 
          most wildly impracticable as well as one of the most dangerous and unnecessary 
          of all the panaceas for remedying some of the evils of our social system 
          while leaving the real causes of those evils absolutely untouched. The 
          dread of too rapid increase of the population, always brought forward 
          by the opponents of real social reform, is a mere figment of the imagination, 
          which will altogether vanish under a rational organisation of society. 
          The actual facts at the present day all point to such a result. Those 
          who marry earliest and breed fastest, are those who are economically 
          worst off--the casual and unskilled labourers; the higher class, of 
          skilled labourers, marry later; the mercantile and professional middle 
          classes later still; while the landed and capitalist aristocracy marry 
          latest, and increase slowest or not at all. Yet, in face of these palpable 
          facts, the objection is continually made, that if <i>all</i> are well-off 
          and free from anxiety as to a comfortable living, population will increase 
          so rapidly that <i>all</i> will soon sink to starvation-point. No reason 
          whatever, founded on actual facts, is given for this statement, and 
          some of the most important of the factors that would come into play 
          and which would lead to an opposite result, are left wholly unnoticed. 
          These factors I have set forth in an article on &quot;Human Selection&quot; in 
          the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> (Sept. 1890). I can here only enumerate 
          them. The first is the great principle established by Herbert Spencer 
          from a survey of the whole animal kingdom, that individuation and reproduction 
          are antagonistic, the fuller development of the brain and nervous system 
          leading inevitably to a diminished rate of increase. Hence, when<i> 
          all</i> are well educated and the mental and moral side of their nature 
          fully satisfied, the animal passions and appetites will be less predominant 
          than they are now. The surest way, therefore, to check the too rapid 
          increase of population is, the full development and training of the 
          intellectual and moral faculties, along with a corresponding training 
          and useful exercise of the bodily organs.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 59]]</font> The next important 
          point is the fact pointed out by Galton, that every year's delay of 
          the marriage period acts in a threefold manner in diminishing the rate 
          of increase--by reducing the number of offspring, by lengthening the 
          time between successive generations, and by reducing the number of generations 
          alive at the same time. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third and most important of all the factors 
          is, that if women were better educated, more fully occupied, and absolutely 
          secure of an independent life, a happy home, and congenial society, 
          the forces which impel many of them to early marriages would be withdrawn, 
          and the period of marriage would, on the average, be considerably delayed. 
          Taking all these factors into consideration we see that the supposed 
          difficulty of the population question vanishes altogether.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But another and still more important effect would 
          result from the action of the same causes. There would arise a form 
          of selection by which the best would tend to increase and the worst 
          to be weeded out--a true &quot;natural selection&quot; by which the race would 
          be continuously improved. This would result from the free action of 
          woman's choice in marriage, so soon as she was economically independent. 
          It is certain that the majority of women admire the healthy in body 
          and mind, and the good rather than the bad. Failing to secure their 
          ideal husband many women of independent means even now do not marry. 
          When all were independent these would no doubt increase. Hence, there 
          would be a greater range of choice for the women who wished to marry, 
          and the result would be that those men who were deformed or diseased 
          in body or in mind would not find wives and would leave no offspring. 
          Hence would arise a continuous improvement of the race, far more certain 
          and more beneficial than could be brought about by the compulsory or 
          inhuman means so often advocated by neo-malthusians, and apparently 
          suggested by Mr. Common as one of Nietzsche's principles.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many other points call for notice, but I need here 
          only mention that Mr. Common is in error when he refers to myself as 
          having shown that &quot;falsehood, imposture, and hypocrisy&quot; play a large 
          part in nature. He quite misunderstands the facts of mimicry and protective 
          resemblances, which are wholly involuntary, and cannot therefore imply 
          falsehood, etc. But this, and all other arguments drawn from the animal 
          or vegetable kingdoms are valueless, because in social and civilised 
          man the mental and moral nature rules over the physical; and as I have 
          just shown, a new and higher kind of selection will come into action 
          as soon as he learns how to subordinate the latter to the former, and 
          how to so organise his social state as to satisfy the economic requirements 
          of all. His power over the forces and products of nature is now so great, 
          that, not only necessaries and comforts, but all beneficial luxuries 
          could be enjoyed by every human being, with an amount of labour less 
          than half of that now expended in giving hurtful luxury and idleness 
          to some, while millions remain subject to a degree of want and misery 
          greater probably than has ever been seen at any previous era in the 
          world's history. The method of bringing about social excellence here 
          suggested, works with nature, not against her. It depends upon the natural 
          play of the higher qualities of human nature, and will therefore be 
          both self-acting and efficient; while any forcible intervention of authority 
          will be as certain to produce evil as it must be powerless for good.</p>

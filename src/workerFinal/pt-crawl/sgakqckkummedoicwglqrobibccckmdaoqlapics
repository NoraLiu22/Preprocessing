<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> James Leon Holsted. **** ******** *****, North Little Rock.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> What is your business or occupation, Mr.
Holsted?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Independent businessman in North Little Rock, real estate business
and other investments.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Mr. Holsted, are you currently a member of the Arkansas Senate?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That's correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Can you tell me for how long you have been a member?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I'm concluding my first term. It was a four year term.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> This last session, then, would have been your second session?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Are you familiar with the piece of legislation that became
Act 590 of 1981?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes, sir.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><font face="Times New Roman">380</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Who introduced that bill in the Senate of Arkansas?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I did.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Can you tell me what your first contact was with the legislation
that became Act 590?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I received a copy of a model piece of legislation in the mail
from a constituent.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And was that constituent Carl Hunt?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes, sir.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> What did you do with it when you received it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Looked it over. I'd been contacted by him to see if I'd be
interested in introducing that piece of legislation. I didn't know anything
about it, so I asked him to send me some background information. And I
think he sent me a copy of the bill. I'm not certain if he sent one or
Larry Fisher sent me one. It was between those two that I believe I got
a copy of the bill.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Your Honor, defendants would object to this line
of inquiry. I think that we have already essentially agreed to stipulations
as to legislative history, as such, that is relevant, when it was introduced,
how many votes it had, the hearing. And anything else Senator Holsted might
have to say as to intent, personal motivation, that this is irrelevant
to the question of determining legislative intent as we've argued in our
brief, that the testimony of a legislator
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">381</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: (Continuing) given, particularly after enactment of the
bill, are not probative, certainly of what a legislator might have thought,
and clearly not as to what the legislature intended. We are dealing with
one hundred thirty-five members and not one member in determining legislative
intent.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We have an act which is quite clear on its face as to what the intent
is, and it is not ambiguous as to its intent. Therefore, we would object
on the grounds of relevance.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Since the Arkansas Legislature does not make a record
of its legislative process such as Congress does so we can find out what
the legislators thought about it and what the arguments were on the floor
and that sort of thing, I think it's appropriate that he testify about
the process the bill went through as it was passed. Very frankly, I'm not
so sure about what his personal intentions were and that sort of thing,
but if I use any of that evidence as part of the decision, I'll make a
note of that and note your objection so the objection will be preserved.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. KAPLAN: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you also receive, prior to the enactment of the bill, some
materials from various creation science organizations and groups?
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">382</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Prior to the enactment, I received some materials; not prior
to the introduction.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> So between the time that you first introduced it in the Senate
and the time it was finally passed, can you tell me the groups from which
you received such materials?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No. I received some preliminary materials from Mr. Hunt. And
then I was inundated through the mails as more publicity came out about
the legislation. I stuck it aside. I didn't have time to read everything
that came in. I didn't really pay any attention to most of it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> You did have some communications from the Institute for Creation
Research, did you not?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That was one of them that sent some material, yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And particularly, did you receive letters from Mr. Gish and
communications from Mr. Gish?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And from Mr. Morris?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And from Mr.
Wysong?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. I believe I did from him, also.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And from Mr. Bliss?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. I recall those names. I'm not sure what kind of materials
I received from them other than some preliminary letters.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And did you receive information from Creation</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Science Research Center in San Diego, also, the Segraves
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">383</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> (Continuing) institution?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> All those before the bill was actually enacted?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you recall how long before the introduction of the bill
you did actually receive the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Approximately two to three weeks, the best of my recollection.
I looked at it a couple of weeks, I think, before I introduced it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> What did you do with it when you received it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Looked at it. I read some of the materials that Mr. Hunt gave
me, thumbed through it, and looked at that material.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Read the legislation to see if I could introduce that bill and stand
up before the Senate and try to pass it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you give it to any Arkansas body in the legislature or
associate with a legislator in an attempt to put it into final form?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I gave it to the Legislative Council to draft it when I did
decide to introduce it, yes. It had to be drafted in the form we introduce
them in Arkansas.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Senator, I'm going to show you a document which has been marked
for purposes of identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit Number 33 and ask
you if that is the bill you received from your constituent, Mr. Hunt, and
which you transmitted to the Legislative Council?
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">384</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. This appears to be, but those marks on it were- This is
not, exactly the same one, but a close facsimile to the one I received
from him.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> You mean, it's a photocopy of the one?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. And I think- Let me see if all the sections- Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. KAPLAN:</u> Your Honor, we would offer number 33.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> It will be received.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. KAPLAN: (Continuing.)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Can you tell me whether, when the Legislative Council concluded
its work on the model bill which had been transmitted to you, whether there
were any changes?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I seem to recall that they took out the short title provision
in it. And I think that was basically the only change.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> In other words, by the time it got to be introduced in the
Arkansas Senate, except for some very, very minor changes, particularly
with regard to the title, it was identical?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And can you tell me if you learned, either then or subsequently,
who the author of that bill was?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I learned after the passage of the bill and signing of the
Act where the legislation came from or who the author was.
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">385</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And did it come from Paul
Ellwanger?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That is, to the best of my knowledge, correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And do you know how you learned that it came from Mr.
Ellwanger?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I don't have any idea who told me. I can't remember. You know,
I talked with so many people about it, so many people said that, I don't
recall the first one who said it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> You learned at least from sufficient numbers of persons to
satisfy yourself that it did come from Mr. Ellwanger?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That's correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Now, we have entered into some stipulations with regard to
the actual dates and the mechanism by which the bill went from Senate Bill
42 to Act 590. But I would like briefly to discuss with you something about
the hearing process. Were there any hearings before the Senate?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> We had what you might consider a hearing when we discussed
it on the Senate floor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> There were no committee hearings at any rate in the Senate?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And can you tell us approximately how long the debate before
the full Senate was?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Probably fifteen to thirty minutes.
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">386</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> You told us in your deposition that Senators Hendren and Howell
spoke in favor of the bill. Were there any other Senators who spoke in
favor of the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I don't recall anyone else speaking in favor of the bill.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Was there anyone in opposition to the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I was trying to remember. I think some people spoke in opposition
in the manner of asking questions when someone was speaking for the bill.
Do you understand? That's the way you try to oppose a piece of legislation.
Many times you ask questions about it from the floor, but don't actually
come down to the podium and speak about it. And there were quite a few
questions asked, but I don't remember anyone taking the floor and actively
speaking against the bill.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you recall how many votes there were against the bill in
the Senate?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No, sir, I have forgotten. It's a matter of record that we
can find out. It passed, though.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you recall how long the actual debate was?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Fifteen to thirty minutes, to the best of my recollection.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I'm sorry. I had forgotten that I'd asked you that. Was there
a prior announcement other than the morning
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">387</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> (Continuing) calendar that indicated that Senate Bill 482 was
going to be debated that day?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No more than we do on any other piece of legislation. In fact,
sometimes the authors don't even know when their legislation is going to
come up for a vote. Now, we discussed it in the quiet room that day. And
I remember quite a few of the Senators meeting in there, and I told them
I was going to try to get it up for a vote. But I didn't know if I was
even going to be able to get it up for a vote, or not.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Prior to your own introduction of Senate Bill 482, had you
conducted a review of the biology texts then currently in use in any of
the school districts in Arkansas?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I looked at the text used in North Little Rock and visited
with the gentleman that bought text books for the North Little Rock school
system to get his ideas of what was being used around the state. He's pretty
familiar with what was being taught around the state.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And had you had some previous acquaintance with him?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. He's a friend of mine.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> A parent of your legislative assistant, is that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Now, what did you discover upon your review of those biology
texts?
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">388</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> The only theory being presented in the school systems for the
origin of life was the evolutionary theory.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That's the only theory you found present in those texts?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That's correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you discuss with this gentleman- Mr. Dyer, I think, his
name was?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> -whether any other alternatives or any other theories were
under discussion in the North Little Rock public schools?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. I asked him if he knew of anything being taught anywhere
in the state, as well as in North Little Rock.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And did he respond negatively to that?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> He responded that he didn't know of anything else being taught.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Was this lack of anything other than evolution theory being
under discussion or being taught one of the primary motivations for your
introduction of this piece of legislation?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Well, I felt like, that was the only way the legislation could
pass. If anything else was being taught, there was no need for the legislation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> The bill passed the Senate and went to the House, is
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">389</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> (Continuing) that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> There was a committee meeting before which this bill was discussed
in the House, is that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And that discussion took place one morning, and you yourself
were present?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That's correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And do you recall that the committee met for approximately
thirty minutes, fifteen minutes on this bill and approximately fifteen
on another bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I think they limited the debate to ten minutes a side on this.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And do you recall the individuals who spoke on behalf of the
legislation in the House?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Myself and Cliff
Hoofman.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Cliff Hoofman is a member of the Arkansas House?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> He was the one that was handling it in the House for me. And
I believe Larry Fisher spoke for the bill.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And do you recall the individuals who spoke against the legislation
in the House committee?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Mike Wilson, who is a member of the House, and a representative
of the Arkansas Education Association. I don't recall if there was a third
one. I thought there was a third one, but I don't recall who spoke against
it.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">390</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And then the bill was enacted in July and signed by the governor
and became Act 590?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> It went to the House floor first.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Right. I'm sorry.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Then was debated on the House floor, and then it went to the
governor's office.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you recall the length of time it was debated on the House
floor?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Seemed like all afternoon. They would pass it, and they would
try to repeal the vote, rescind the vote, do something else with it and
table it. It was quite a bit of parliamentary movement going on at that
time.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you witness part of it, or was it reported to you?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> It was reported to me. I was back in the Senate.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Prior to your putting the bill up in the Senate, or, indeed,
at any time during the entire legislative process, did you have any discussions
with the Department of Education regarding this matter, the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you have any discussion with any teacher organizations?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you have any discussion with individual science teachers
or curriculum coordinators regarding the bill, other than Mr. Fisher?
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">391</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No, not really.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> You did have some material, though, that had been submitted
to you during this process where it was going through the legislative mill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And you have supplied some of those or, at least, copies of
virtually everything that you had to us, is that right?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I think I did. A big box of stuff.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you ever ask the Attorney General for an opinion regarding
the constitutionality of the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No. We were in the closing days of the session. Had a week,
maybe a week and a half when I started the process. There would have never
been time to get an opinion out of his office on the constitutionality
of that issue.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Was one of the materials that you had received in our packet
an indication that Attorneys General in other states had indicated some
considerable doubts about the constitutionality of the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Probably I did, but that's not unusual. I think everybody,
when they want to try to defeat a bill on the floor of the Senate, will
get up and say it's unconstitutional. The only way you can determine whether
it's

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> (Continuing) unconstitutional or not is through this process;
not any other way.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you recall that there was a letter from a number of creation
science proponents to the Attorney General of South Carolina questioning
the Attorney General's opinion which said that the bill was unconstitutional?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I may have had one. I didn't think that was very relevant.
You get letters like that all day long that say all kinds of different
things.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I just want to show you the materials that you submitted to
us and ask you do you recall that this letter from John Whitehead, Randall
Byrd, and a Chief Judge Braswell Dean to the Honorable Richard Riddon,
R-i-d-d-o-n, deals with the Attorney General's opinion in South Carolina?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I remember seeing that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> This did not prompt you to make further inquiry about the constitutionality
of the legislation, however, is that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No sir. As I've' stated before- Maybe I didn't state this.
But the Attorney' General's opinion is just an opinion.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And while it's a well researched opinion and he tries to give the best
opinion he feels like will be held up in a court of law, it's just an opinion.</font>

until it became 590?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> We've talked about your feeling regarding the lack of anything
but evolution being taught as a motivator in the introduction of the bill.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Were there other motivations for you in the introduction of the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Not really.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Were your own individual deep religious convictions part of
the motivation in introducing the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Your Honor, I want to again object on the grounds
of relevance, particularly on this point. I think the cases are quite clear
that the motive even Epperson itself- Epperson says-</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> I'll make that same ruling. I'll let that evidence
go in. If I use that evidence. If I use that evidence in the decision,
I will make a note of it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> For purposes of efficiency, I would like the record
to reflect my objection as continuing to this line of inquiry.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Yes, sir.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. KAPLAN: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Were your own individual deeply held religious convictions
a significant motivation in your introduction of this legislation?
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">394</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Certainly it would have to be compatible with what I believe
in. I'm not going to introduce legislation that I can't stand before the
Senate and present as something I can't believe in.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Well, even in addition to it being compatible, is it not true
that you said contemporaneous with the introduction of the legislation
that you introduced the legislation because of your deeply held religious
convictions?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did I say that? Are you stating I said that?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I'm asking you is it not true that you said that contemporaneous
with, at the same time, that you introduced the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We are talking about that same time span while the bill is going through
the legislative process and immediately after its enactment.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Did you not say that the motivating or, at least, a significant motivating
factor in the introduction of the legislation was your own deeply held
religious conviction?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I probably said that at one time or another during the course
of the legislation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Indeed, as late as yesterday, did you not say that God had
spoken to you at the time and told you to sponsor the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No. I can't believe somebody said I said that. I

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> (Continuing) didn't say that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No. I've been misquoted so many times, and I definitely remember
yesterday. A week ago would be difficult, but I definitely remember yesterday.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you yourself hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible?</font>

that the bill favors the views of Biblical literalists?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. I was asked did this favor some particular view over another.
And I said perhaps it does.</font>

literalists, is that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you not also say contemporaneous with the enactment of
the bill that the strongest supporters of Act 590 would be those holding
to a fundamentalist view of Christianity?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. KAPLAN:</u> I am not certain where we are now. Let me just ask
a new question.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. KAPLAN: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Is it your view that this bill, which presupposes a divine
creator complies with the First Amendment of the Constitution because it
doesn't teach one particular view of religion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Right.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That is, Methodist over Baptist or Catholic over Jew?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Right. It doesn't mention any particular god.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And is it your view that it is not religion because there is
a specific prohibition against using religious writings? Indeed, one could
not bring Genesis into the classroom under this particular legislation?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And that is your view of why this is not in conflict with the
First Amendment?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Correct. My layman's view, you have to understand.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Let me briefly discuss with you some of the specific portions
of the bill. There is in the introduction to the bill an injunction or
a rationale for the enactment with regard to and states as follows, "To
prohibit religious instruction concerning origins."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Prior to the enactment, were you aware of any instruction, religious
instruction regarding origins in
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">398</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> (Continuing) the public schools?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No, I wasn't.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Let, me ask you, as far as you are concerned, what that phrase
means, to prohibit religious instruction concerning origins?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> To not allow anybody to use Genesis in the classroom.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Isn't that what you are concerned about here?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And any other religious writings, no matter if it would be
Genesis or whatever, of any other religion. If you're planning on going
down through every one of those parts of the bill, I can save you some
time on that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No, I'm not going to do every one. The Judge wouldn't let me
anyway. I want to ask you just about a few more.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Okay.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I want to ask you about balance and what balance means to you?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Balance to me means equal emphasis. I don't think you measure
balance by the amount of time, but it does mean equal emphasis from one
subject matter to another.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Does it also, within your constellation of balance and how
you view balance, mean that a teacher could not say, "Okay,' we're going
to spend our ten minutes here or however much is necessary to balance,"
and then say, "But I disclaim any view of creation science; I don't like
it?"</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">399
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> A teacher could do that and there would be no way of getting
around it. But I believe in the professionalism of the teachers we have
in Arkansas, and I believe that professional ethics would not allow him
to do that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you believe if a district- Is it your view that if a district
said, "Now, look, we want balanced treatment and we don't want any comment,"
that a teacher could be terminated because of the teachers failure and
refusal to avoid these disclaimers?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I think if a school district, wanted to do that and school
board, that's completely under their right to do that. If a teacher doesn't
teach English and she's supposed to be teaching English, they can terminate
her for that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you know, whether there was any inquiry other than what
already existed in the bill with regard, to the legislative findings as
they appear in the bill?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> No, sir.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That's there was no inquiry other than what was already written
down here?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> That's correct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> And indeed, there was no legislative discussion about that
isn't that correct?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> About what?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> About findings other-

<P><font face="Times New Roman">400</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>We just discussed the bill in general. I assumed everybody
had read it. They'd had it in their books for quite a while.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Do you recall that there were a number of materials that you
gave us including some material from a man named Luther Sunderland in Apalachin,
New York?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>No.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Well, I will show it to you and perhaps that will refresh your
recollection. These are a series of documents you gave us. Here is one,
"Introducing the Model Teaching of Origins in Public Schools, An Approach
that Works" by Luther D. Sunderland, 5 Griffin Drive, Apalachin, New York.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>If I gave it to you I am sure I received it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Did you note the organizations from whom he suggested that
one could obtain creationist materials?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>No.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Could you take a look at that first letter, the one that I
have marked for you there, and tell me the names of the organizations from
whom he suggests that a public school district looking to institute such
a model might obtain material?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>You want me to read these off?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Yes. Would you, please?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>I don't see anything else.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> In all of the materials that were submitted to you, Senator
Holsted, did you ever discover any organization other than those which
you have just read which were indicated as organizations from which you
might be able to obtain creationist material?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>That was not my problem.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> I understand that. I am merely inquiring as to whether you
were ever able to ascertain the names of any organizations other than those
which you have just read which might be able to furnish such information?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Your Honor, the question assumes a fact not in
evidence. It calls for speculation on the witness' part. There is no showing
that Senator Holsted ever tried—</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> All he has to do is say no, as I understand it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS:</u> No.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> For the record, I want to interpose an objection
on the grounds that I think this does, perhaps, go to the question of legislative
privilege and the immunity that a legislator has to consider whatever he
wants to in passing on a bill.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">402</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> I think if there is anybody can invoke that, that's
Senator Holsted if he wants to. I am not sure that privilege goes that
far, but if he wants to invoke that—</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS:</u> What do I get to invoke it?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> But in any event, not Mr. Williams.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS:</u> It will be up to the Department of Education to
determine what materials will be used and to obtain materials I received
stuff— You wouldn't believe how much stuff I received. Most of it I didn't
even look at. I just stuck it in a box.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. KAPLAN: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Let me ask you to just take a look at this. Here is the second
page of Mr. Sunderland's book—I am sorry, Mr. Sunderland's communication.
At the bottom of that first page he describes how somebody might go about
reaching a community and convincing folks that they ought to enact a scientific
creation approach. Can you tell me the names of the two books that he suggested
one obtain and look at in order to do that convincing? Just read that sentence.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>He obtained a number of copies of <u>The Creation-Evolution
Controversy</u> by Wysong, and <u>Evolution: The Fossils Say No</u>, Public
School Edition by Gish.
<br>&nbsp;</font><P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">403</font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
By the way, Mr. Sunderland was also selling something for fifty
dollars, too.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Oh, is that right? I am sure it is. You would be surprised
how many people have got stuff to sell.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Another one of his points, and I think this will be the last
one I will ask you about, are these two over here. Will you just read those?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>Points on Reaching the Community. Always document your main
points with good references. Never use references from creationist books,
religious literature or the Bible. Any aspect of the creation model which
requires reference to or interpretation of a religious doctrine should
be avoided other than the fact, of course, that a Creator did the creating.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Then just one more thing I want you to look at. This is also
in your materials, and this is a list of, from your materials, dated September,
1980, Creation Evolution Material. It says, "The following books, periodicals,
pamphlets and tapes offer invaluable aid to those interested in learning
more about evolution versus creation." Can you tell me the names of those
sources?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS:</u> Your Honor, I object to that. I think the characterization
is, this is the witness' writing, that the document is his own. I don't
think that is correct. I don't know where that came from.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">404</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS:</u> I never used these in—</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> Mr. Kaplan, the witness never saw them, never used
them. I have a hard time seeing how it is admissible through him.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. KAPLAN:</u> Fine, your Honor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. KAPLAN: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Let me ask you as a final matter, Senator Holsted, whether
in your experience the Senate has ever considered a bill, for example,
to allow Christian Scientists to be released from health classes or discussion
of various matters that might conflict with their religious views?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>No. I think the only thing we did last session that I can remember
concerning Christian Scientists is, we released, certain designators in
the Christian Science faith from jury duty because they were a minister
under their designation. We exempt ministers from jury duty. That was the
only thing I can think of that was done like that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. KAPLAN:</u> That's all I have. Thank you.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT:</u> We will take about a ten minute recess.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">BY MR. WILLIAMS:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Senator Holsted, how long does the Arkansas Legislature meet
and how often does it meet?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>It meets once every two years, constitutionally sixty days.
We generally run sometimes eighty, ninety days.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> In that period of time, meeting sixty to eighty days every
two years, are all bills given a long deliberative and investigative process
by the Legislature?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b>In the past session we considered over sixteen hundred pieces
of legislation that came through the Senate, to either vote on or for our
consideration to vote for, and there's no way possible to have hearings
on every piece of legislation that comes through. We'd still be going on
on last year's bills.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> Is it unusual to have a bill to be considered in committee
only for a matter of minutes?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A </b>Not at all. This last special session a lot of bills didn't
even go to committee. The only thing the committee process does is try
to speed up the flow of legislation, because you have different committees
meeting all the time to consider many different bills.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The best hearing, of course, that's possible is to get

the extent of your knowledge as a layman in science, did you feel that
there was and is scientific evidence to support creation science?</font>

		<p><p>I wanted to share a brief update about Metalunderground.com. We just moved to a new server with updated software (database, application server, etc.), so apologies if you noticed the short downtime on Friday or encountered any bugs in the near term. If you do, please feel free to report them in the comments on this post.</p><p>
With this server move, I've decided to officially retire the forum/message boards. Social media was the first nail in the coffin for the message boards. Spam was the last. I have all of the data backed up in case I ever change my mind and decide to relaunch the forum.</p><p>
Spam is always a problem and I turned off account creation years ago because I did not have the time and bandwidth to win this fight. User accounts were never required for commenting on our posts though, so I didn't feel the urgency to get this fixed. I have some new ideas and hope to re-open that aspect of the site, however.</p><p>
On another note, advertising long ago stopped providing any meaningful income towards expenses on this site (which I now pay out of pocket to keep it running). I've disabled most of the ad networks already, but there are a few lingering ads being shown on the site. Some of them are intended to be small and unobtrusive, but Google's poor quality control lets them inject overlays all over the page. I plan to completely remove third-party ads (and social media widgets) from Metalunderground.com. Ads have become a plague on the web, creating a horrible user experience - especially on mobile devices where space is already at a premium - as well as privacy concerns. I'd rather serve up a clean site than sacrifice user experience for fractions of pennies.</p><p>
We may still run some banners and background takeovers, such as the sponsored <a href="https://70000tons.com/">70,000 Tons of Metal</a> ads, but these will always be served as static images and preferably directly from my server to prevent abuse and third party disclosure.</p><p>
I have so much more planned, including a full redesign, but limited time so I won't go into details. Hopefully, you'll see some modernization and more frequent site updates here in the future.</p><p>
I want to thank our writers who continue to post news, reviews, interviews, and show reports and photo galleries and keep the site going day after day. And thanks to our readers who have come back often over the years for their metal news fix.</p></p>

		<p><p>Diamond Oz and Greekbastard posted a few April Fools stories this year, and we hope you enjoyed them. All three were well played, in my opinion, from "Metallica Officially Removed From The Big Four" to "Black Metal and Antifa Sign Peace Treaty" and "Slayer Cancels Retirement Plans."</p><p>

		<p><p>With two of our main writers abroad on travel and April Fools falling on Easter Sunday this year, we only posted a few April Fools this year, but we hope you enjoyed them.</p><p>
Personally, I enjoyed Diamond Oz's "<a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=139713">KISS Bassist Gene Simmons Announces Presidential Candidacy</a>" and "Running as an independent candidate under the slogan, 'I was made for running you,' the sixty eight year old musician is pledging greater focus on trade, the arts and a 'unique' fiscal system, known as 'Rockanomics.'"</p><p>

		<p><p>Falling on a Saturday this year we didn't have quite the same level of contribution for April Fools 2017 as normal, but we still had fun and hopefully got a few of you - happy April Fools metal fans!</p><p>
Sadly, we didn't send any PR folks into a <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122332">lawsuit-threatening tizzy like last year</a>, but if the comments on Facebook are any indication, we got a couple of folks believing Steel Panther's surprise feminist album is a reality!</p><p>
Between <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=133904">Mayhem using a Euronymous hologram on stage</a>, Brexit <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=133903">screwing up Paradise Lost's tour schedule</a>, Darkthrone <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=133905">needing a whole lot more cowbell</a>, and Winger finally <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=133908">changing a questionable song title</a>, it's clear the rock and metal world won't be low on April Fools gag material any time soon. What's been your favorite Metalunderground April Fools prank throughout the years?</p><p>

		<p><p>The most glorious day of the year has sadly passed, so we're back to real news today (although based on some of the comments still going here and at Facebook, it would seem the date-challenged haven't realized that yet).</p><p>
We had a ton of fun putting our gags together for 2016, and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did in our fourteenth (!!) year running of writing all joke articles on April 1st.</p><p>
We can't get most of you anymore, but there's always a few new folks we manage to pull in with tales of <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122333">Trump and Clinton duking it out on Twitter</a> over Phil Anselmo or a <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122330">classic Helloween lineup reunion</a>. Likewise, some of our Facebook readers weren't too happy about the news of a sold-out Wacken being <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122329">Iron Maiden's last performance</a>.</p><p>
Keep an eye out for the real news in the coming months, because we're developing a track record for some of our April Fools pranks getting perilously close to coming true... The full list of 2016 articles can be <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/index.cfm?startdate=4-1-2016">found here</a> if you missed any.</p><p>
What was your favorite this year? Maybe the <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122328">Axl / Vince Neil swap</a>, Danzing doing <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122331">even more awful covers</a>, or the silly ones like <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122334">Bernie Sanders appearing in a NYHC doc</a> or poor Phil Anselmo getting picked as <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=122338">Trump's running mate</a>? <a href="/news/details.cfm?newsid=122344" class="readmore">More...</a></p></p>

This year we had an issue with a malware warning from Google. The issue was addressed promptly on March 31st, but the warning persisted into April 1 and surely lessened the number of people who clicked through and read and commented on our April fools stories.</p><p>
Still, we got folks with some great ones like a <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90546">plausible sounding Metallica story</a>, an <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90553">Immortal-Beyonce collaboration</a> with a fantastic image supporting it, <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90552">Dave Mustaine releasing a country album</a> in light of his <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90482">recent meeting with Willie Nelson</a>, as well as the obligatory <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90541">Slayer</a> <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90547">stories</a>, a faux <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90538">Unearthing The Metal Underground column</a> featuring some truly horrid screamo bands, and <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/index.cfm?startdate=4-1-2013">much more</a>.</p><p>

I had fun reading all of them, as well as the comments, but here are a couple particular stories I want to talk about briefly:</p><p>
Thanks to Alestorm for playing along and spreading the word of our April Fools that they were <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=79097">kicked off of Paganfest</a>. With their help, the story spread so quickly that our server could not handle the load for a while.</p><p>
Our <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=79092">Behemoth story</a> seemed a little too believable despite the talk of "Spiritual Conflict" and Nergal's previous statements following his recovery, and we apologize for any confusion this story may have created. Behemoth has <em>not</em> dropped off the Decibel tour and we're very much looking forward to seeing Nergal back in action on this tour ourselves..</p><p>
To those who got all worked up about it, we've been doing this for a LONG time now. The bands that get spoofed are mostly ones that we like and the others are just easy targets. And sometimes the stories practically write themselves! It's all in good fun, and no harm is intended.</p><p>

				<span class="posted-month">Apr</span>
				<span class="posted-day">14</span><span class="posted-text">,</span>
				<span class="posted-year">2011</span> at

		<p><p>A year ago we <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=54988">lost one of heavy metal’s iconic voices</a> with the untimely death of Type O Negative’s Peter Steele. Twelve bands hailing from Europe and both North and South America have lent their talents to pay tribute to the gothic metal giant and ensure his music continues to be played by fans all across the world.</p><p>
In collaboration with Beneath the Woods studios and a dozen of the finest underground bands, Metalunderground.com is very proud to announce that “All For None, None For All: A Tribute To Peter Steele” is now officially available. All twelve tracks from the album and a PDF booklet containing words from the bands are available for $3, which covers the costs of the mechanical license and the transaction fees. Metalunderground.com will be donating any leftover profits to charity.</p><p>
You can <b><a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/store/products/Peter_Steele_tribute.cfm">buy your copy of the album</a></b> as an immediate digital download starting today.</p><p>
We would like to personally thank all of the bands involved for their fantastic contributions, and to all our readers who have stuck by us throughout the years. There's a little something for everyone in this tribute album, and we hope you'll love it just as much as we do.</p><p>
Dan Mitchell of Beneath The Woods Studios also added, "My original idea was to find bands that were only interested in paying tribute to Peter, and not getting caught up in the politics of it all. No talks of money, labels, suits, or anyone trying to suck the life out of it. Just a straight up tribute. While we had people from Dave Ellefson to Anathema showing interest, their schedules are too busy from prior commitments.</p><p>
“If you look back at Type O Negative's catalogue, they covered various songs by artists that were much different from the original. There were most definitely fans of Neil Young who hated their rendition of 'Cinnamon Girl,' and Seals and Crofts fans who hated 'Summer Breeze.' There were even fans of Sabbath who hated Type O's rendition of a Sabbath song.</p><p>
“However, Johnny Kelly put it best when he said ‘These are what those songs would have sounded like if WE wrote them, its our interpretation of the material.’ That was actually his response to me commenting on how ‘different’ the music on this tribute is.”</p><p>
To hear what the bands have to offer with their cover songs, two teaser trailers are available below. The groups involved in the tribute have also conducted a series of interviews with Metalunderground to talk about Peter Steele’s legacy and the future of metal icons. You can read about how <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=67072">Autumns Eyes</a>, <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=67121">Dark Hound</a>, and <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=67135">Fairytale Abuse</a> approached their cover songs and how Peter Steele influenced them. <a href="/news/details.cfm?newsid=67202" class="readmore">More...</a></p></p>

		<p><p>We hope you enjoyed our <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/index.cfm?startdate=4-1-2011">April fools stories yesterday</a> as much as we did! In our long-standing tradition, we devoted the entire day to fake news and spoofs. We had fun writing them despite the fact that we can't really fool most of you in our ninth year of the tradition, even when we start off with some very plausible (yet fake) stories. Many thanks to those of you resisted blurting out “April Fools!” In case you missed them, you can <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/index.cfm?startdate=4-1-2011">read yesterday's April Fools stories here</a>.</p><p>
There are a couple particular stories I want to talk about briefly:</p><p>
It was quite hilarious to see <a href="http://www.facebook.com/metalunderground#!/pages/Dream-Theater/7677942180">Dream Theater's facebook wall</a> spattered with questions from fans about them <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=66817">using a drum machine</a>! I had this story prepared ahead of time and was fully expecting the band to ruin it for me by announcing a new drummer before April 1st. There was just too much drama around the drummer position (ever since Mike Portnoy's departure) to pass it up.</p><p>
Making things a little tricky, some people saw <a href="http://www.metalinsider.net/splits/slayer-disband-following-hanneman%e2%80%99s-departure">Metal Insider's story about Slayer disbanding</a> and took it - along with <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=66813">our story</a> - as corroborating evidence that the news was true (despite their April Fools link on the end of it). This was totally unplanned and unintentional, and we're sorry if we worried anyone for real. We love Slayer, and wish Jeff the best and dread the day that Slayer calls it quits.</p><p>
To those who got all worked up about it, we've been doing this for a LONG time now. The bands that get spoofed are either easy targets or ones that we like. And sometimes the stories practically write themselves! It's all in good fun, and no harm is intended.</p><p>
If you'd like to check out our past years' April Fools stories, you can do so at the links below:</p><p>

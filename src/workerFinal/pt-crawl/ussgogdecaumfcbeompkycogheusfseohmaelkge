I am a junior student at the University of Rochester, double majoring in Political Science and Business Analytics, minoring in Legal Studies. Aside from school and career development, I enjoy making coffee(I am a strong coffee lover!) I like yoga, and fitness as well. I enjoy making milk tea. Right now, I am a part-time tea maker at Taichi Bubble tea. I’m here today because I want to apply those skills and strategies that I cultivated so far to the industry I’m truly passionate about, I think it’s not about how you know those strategies and knowledge well, more importantly, it’s about how you collaborate those strategies together and apply them to the real world and real market. I know how to corporate with people, supervisors, and teammates. In project management, I like to collaborate and share information with everyone, listen to them, and Come out with the best plan, everything is about collaboration. There are three steps for me to accomplish, learn and study, learn from the project and tasks, learn from other peers, and be aware of my weaknesses, and strengthen as a self-reflection. participating in the team, communicating with supervisors, and teammates, collaborating with the learning process, and learning from other people. contribute yourself, your power, your knowledge, and your skillsets. During my previous background, I joined telecom Americas as a marketing intern, where I learned how to conduct market research and analysis to figure out the best marketing strategy for the solutions, General business development research identifying opportunities for telecommunication operations, and partnerships with the assistance of technical data implementation. and customer service. I gained abundant resources and close circumstances relating to clients and customers.\nI initially developed my interest in the Computational Social Science because I took a predictive analytics class at U of R, and I was really into the data visualization and applied machine learning we faced and the improvement we can do in the future, I studied and realized more about the sustainability pros for the development. Also, I joined IBM as a consulting intern, I worked in a range of areas from environmental sustainability, to energy and water conservation, green building projects, to sustainable transportation. Not only figure out the future trends of smart cities for clients. Help the client figure out the partnership solutions in the smart communities project by doing evaluations, while also investigating the collaboration with the government. Smart energy Crime prevention Smart traffic management, Smart Community Technology: Sea Level Rise Monitoring and Mitigation.\nThe field of computational social science presents an opportunity to do work that is aligned with my interests and priorities. Computational social science is important and has only become more so in recent years. With the resources above, students will gain a deeper understanding of these two related topics and recognize the measures they can take to contribute to a more visualiztional future. The real-world opportunity can give me an inside look at the functions and the process in order for me to learn and contribute, which will navigate me to establish real-world connections, that will be practical for me in the future. Social research helps to acquire knowledge of human society. The dynamic nature of society makes it challenging to understand to move towards progress and welfare. Social research enables us to analyze social behavior, understand its causes, and accelerate its evolution. Social research expands our knowledge to drive discovery and innovation. It contributes to the growth and development of a nation or the entire human society.\nIt also provides me the opportunity by researching and identifying business needs and solutions to problems. I have exposure here to participate in the program with amazing mentors and peers closely to gain hands-on experience across all key solution areas, work on client engagements, leverage my communication and research skills to create tools and resources; perform analysis and internal business processes/strategies in support of projects.\nMy personal goals are for growth and learning in this program. I hope to learn from the company and develop myself as a good asset to the the company, use my skills in a role and contribute myself identifying solutions to clients for measurement and attribution solutions to deliver impactful results for sustainable results across a variety of resources and benefits. In the long run, I hope to develop my expertise in the sustainability field and eventually take on a leadership role here where I am able to manage large projects and work directly with clients to meet their needs. as well as advanced audiences and attribution insights that help quantity campaign strategies. I want to bring my analytical skills to the program since I have developed my analytical skills that cultivated my analysis and quantitative data collection skills I’m good at time management when multiple things going on (how to manage time and tasks) I know how to Prioritization (what is the most important). I’m good at learning from mistakes and concluding those mistakes together to make a better myself, learn from the mistakes, listen to others, adopt others' strengths, and always be humble.","photo":"","organization":"University or Rochester","position":"Undergraduate Student","discipline":"Political Science, Law, data science and computational science ","site":"Rochester","research_interests":"Machine Learning, social science, Computational Science, data visualization, political Science, Law","category":"participant","twitter":"https://twitter.com/siyiy919","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/siyi-yin-9638b21ab/","google_scholar":""},{"id":"4/28/2023 19:42:52-Zhihong","name":"Zhihong Zhang","image":"./assets/images/17ix2IkrX9Oufn3TW1TyhIv07wQiB1qK2.png","year":"2023","timestamp":"4/28/2023 19:42:52","first_name":"Zhihong","last_name":"Zhang","bio":"Zhihong Zhang is a doctoral student in Nursing and a master student in Data Science at the University of Rochester.","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=17ix2IkrX9Oufn3TW1TyhIv07wQiB1qK2","organization":"University of Rochester School of Nursing","position":"PhD Student","discipline":"Health science","site":"Rochester","research_interests":"machine learning; healthcare; social behavior","category":"participant","twitter":"","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhihong-zhang-670a8b26b/","google_scholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XRlnT-wAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2"},{"id":"4/29/2023 2:45:22-Yue","name":"Yue Zhong","image":"./assets/images/1iYhVvEbYu-NM04v5JznJACcw7wO4QjQ4.jpeg","year":"2023","timestamp":"4/29/2023 2:45:22","first_name":"Yue","last_name":"Zhong","bio":"Yue Zhong is a Ph.D. candidate at Graduate School of Commerce, Waseda University.

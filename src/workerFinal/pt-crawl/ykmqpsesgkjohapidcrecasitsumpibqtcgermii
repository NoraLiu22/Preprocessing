<B>Abstract:</B> Spatial analysis and mapping of georeferenced 
individual-level data can help identify important geographical patterns or lead to 
significant knowledge for dealing with specific social issues in a particular area. 
However, given the need to protect personal privacy when using geospatial data, the 
possibility for undertaking geographical analysis on certain types of individual-level 
data is becoming increasingly circumscribed. This paper addresses the need to protect 
geoprivacy while making individual-level georeferenced data available in such a way that 
analytical results are not significantly affected. Using a data set of lung cancer 
deaths in Franklin County, Ohio in 1999, the effectiveness of three geographical masks 
with different perturbation radii (r) is examined. The findings reveal a rather consistent 
tradeoff between data confidentiality and accuracy of analytical results. There seems to 
be a threshold r value at which the results of analyses on masked data become substantially 
different from the original results. An r that produces an area about the average size of 
the census block groups of the study area achieves a desirable optimum trade-off between 
privacy protection and accuracy of results. The study shows that implementing appropriate 
geographical masks may help data managers or researchers establish the desirable level of 
trade-off between privacy protection and accuracy of geographic information in a particular 
context.</P></font>

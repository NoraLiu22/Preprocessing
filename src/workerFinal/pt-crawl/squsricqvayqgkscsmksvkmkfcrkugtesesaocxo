<h2>Chapter VI<br>Japanese Aggression Against the U.S.S.R.</h2>
</center>

<center>
<h3>Manchuria, The "Lifeline" of Japan</h3>
</center>

Throughout the period covered by the
evidence tendered to the Tribunal, the intention
to undertake a war against the U.S.S.R.	has been
shown to have been one of the basic elements of
Japan's military policy. the military party was
determined to establish Japan in occupation of the
Far Eastern territories of the U.S.S.R., as well
as in other parts of the Continent of Asia.
Although the seizure of Manchuria (the three North-Eastern
provinces of China) was attractive for its
natural resources and for expansion and colonization,
it was desirable also as a point of approach in the
intended war against the U.S.S.R. Manchuria came
to be referred to as a "lifeline" of Japan, but it
is quite clear that by this was meant a line of
advance rather than a line of defence.
<p>
The purpose of invading and possession
itself of the Far Eastern territories of the
U.S.S.R. seems to have been a constant goad to
the military ambitions of Japan. As early as 1924,
Okawa, a vigorous advocate of Japanese expansion
abroad, was pointing to the occupation of Siberia
as one of Japan's objectives. This same
attitude was taken also by the military, with 
whom Okawa was in close accord. Army officers
began to promote the idea that Manchuria was
Japan's "lifeline" and should be developed
as a "defence" against the U.S.S.R. ITAGAKI in

1930, when a Staff Officer of the Kwantung
Army, advocated the use of force in the creation
of a new state in Manchuria. Following the lead
of Okawa, he claimed that this would be a development
of the "Kingly Way" and would lead to the
liberation of the Asiatic peoples. HIROTA in
1931, while Ambassador in Moscow, suggested for
the information of the general staff that there
was need to take a strong policy vis-a-vis the Soviet
Union, with the resolve to fight the U.S.S.R.
at any time when necessary. The objectives, however,
were not defence against communism, but, rather,
the occupation of Far Eastern Siberia.
<p>
On the formation of the Saito Cabinet
in May 1932, a degree of compromise was reached
upon the conflict which had developed between
military and civilian members of the Cabinet in
respect of the Manchurian adventure. In consequence,
the Cabinet acceded to the Army policy in Manchuria
and decided upon the development of that region
under Japanese domination. The Army, now freed
from opposition within the Cabinet, went forward
with its advocacy fo war with the U.S.S.R. in the
North, as well as with preparations for such a war.
In July of 1932, Kawabe, the Japanese Military
Attach&eacute; in Moscow, urged the importance of preparations
for war with the Soviet Union, which he said
was inevitable. He regarded war with China and the
U.S.S.R. as a foregone conclusion. In 1932, the
accused MINAMI advocated making the Sea of Japan
into a lake, by which he obviously meant

the seizure of the Soviet Far East where it
bordered the Sea of Japan. In April 1933,
SUZUKI, then in the Military Affairs Bureau,
referred to the U.S.S.R. as the absolute enemy
because, as he said, she aimed to destroy the
national structure of Japan.

<center>
<h3>"National Defence"</h3>
</center>

It is interesting to notice at this
time ARAKI's discussion of the term "national
defence". This, he pointed out, was not confined
to the physical defence of Japan, but included
the defence of <i>Kodo,</i> or the Imperial Way. This
was another way of saying that the conquest of
neighbouring countries by force of arms was
justifiable as "national defence". At about
this time, 1933, ARAKI, then War Minister, forsook
euphemism about "national defence" and told a
conference of Prefectural Governors exactly what
he meant, at least in respect of the Soviet Union.
He said "Japan was to inevitably clash with the
Soviet Union, therefore it was necessary for
Japan to secure for herself through military
methods the territories of the Maritime Province,
Zabaikalye and Siberia". ARAKI's definition
of "national defence" was adopted by the Saito
Cabinet as a basis of its policy in Manchuria.
As has been shown already, Japan's leaders always
sought to justify their aggressive military adventures
by claiming they were defensive. It was
in this sense that Manchuria was developed as
the "lifeline" of Japan.

<h3>Diplomatic Exchanges</h3>
</center>

That Japan's policy towards the U.S.S.R.
was offensive or aggressive and not defensive, is
indicated by diplomatic exchanges in the period
1931-1933. During this period, the Soviet Government
twice made formal proposals to the Japanese
Government to conclude a non-aggression and
neutrality pact. In a Soviet statement made in
1931 to the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Yoshizawa, and to Ambassador HIROTA, it was
pointed out that the conclusion of a non-aggression
pact would "express the peaceful policy and
intentions of the Government, and it will be
well-timed especially now when the future of the
Japanese-Russian relations is the subject of
speculations in Western Europe and America.
The conclusion of this pact would put an end
to these speculations". The Japanese Government
did not give a reply to this proposal for a year.
it was only on 13 September 1932, that the Soviet
Ambassador to Japan received a reply from
Minster of Foreign Affairs Uchida in which he
declined the offer on the ground that ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
formal beginning of the negotiations on the
subject between the two governments in this
case seems to be untimely".

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--779--</i></center><hr><a name=page780></a><p>
<blockquote>

The Soviet Government on 4 January 1933, again
repeated its proposal for the conclusion of a pact,
emphasising that the previous proposal "was not called
forth by the considerations of the moment, but resulted
from its peaceful policy, and therefore continues in
force for the future." The Japanese Government in May
1933, once more rejected the proposal of the Soviet
Union. It should be noted that Japan rejected the proposal
in spite of the fact that the Japanese Government
had assurance at that time that it was a sincere expression 
of peaceful policy of thr Soviet Union in the
Far East. In a secret memorandum written by the accused
TOGO, DIrector of the Bureau of European-American Affairs,
in April 1933, he said, "The desire of the Soviet Union
for a non-aggression pact with Japan is motivated by
its desire to secure the safety of its Far Eastern
territory form the increasing threat which it feels
since the Japanese advance into Manchuria." By December
1933, the Kwantung Army was making plans and preparations
for the day when Japan would use Manchuria as a base for
attack upon the U.S.S.R.

<center>
<h3>Continuation of Designs Upon U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

In 1935, the Okada Cabinet, which had taken
office the previous year, gave its support to the
Army's economic planning in Manchukuo, although
HIROTA denied that Japan's intention was aggressive.
In November 1935, SHIRATORI, then Minister in Scandinavian
countries, wrote to Arita, the Ambassador to Belgium,
pointing out that "Looking at the present-day power of
Soviet Russia as from the standpoint of figures, it does
seem to be most imposing, but, as the days are
still shallow wince the revolution and the dissatisfied
elements still infest the countryside

<p><center><i>--780--</i></center><hr><a name=page781></a><p>
<blockquote>

and shortages are still acute in implements
and machineries, resources and materials, and
manpower, it is clear that she will immediately
sustain internal collapse once she fights against
some great power. This is the unanimous opinion
of those who are familiar with the actual situation.
What is most desirous for Soviet Russia
at present is to have peaceful and amicable
relationships with the foreign powers. Therefore,
countries which border Soviet Russia and who
have any pending affairs that need to be settled
sooner or later with her, should never idle away
this opportune time of today". He suggested
that there should be demanded form the U.S.S.R.
"with resolution" and as "minimum" concessions
to "abolish military armaments in Vladivostok",
etc., ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not stationing a single soldier in the
area of Lake Baikal". SHIRATORI suggested as
the fundamental solution of Japan's problems
with the U.S.S.R. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in order to eliminate
the menace of Russia for ever, it is necessary
to make her a powerless capitalistic republic
and to rigidly control her natural resources.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
At present the chances are good".

<h3>The February Incident</h3>
</center>

We have already discussed the downfall
of the Okada Cabinet caused by an insurrection
in the Army in Tokyo on the 25 February 1936.
The Army's criticism was the insufficiently
aggressive attitude of this Cabinet. On
27 February, the day after this incident, the
Japanese consulate in Amoy explained that the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--781--</i></center><hr><a name=page782></a><p>
<blockquote>

purpose of the insurrection was to replace the
Cabinet with a military one, and that the young
military group intended that Japan should take
the whole of China and prepare for an immediate
war against the Soviet Union to the end that Japan
might be the only power in Asia.

<center>
<h3>The 1936 Statement of National Policy</h3>
</center>

In August 1936, HIROTA, who was now
Prime Minister, in conjunction with his Foreign
Minister, War Minister, Navy Minister and Finance
Minister, formulated a statement of Japan's
national policy. This is an important and
significant document directed, <i>inter alia,</i>
towards "securing a steady footing of the
(Japanese) Empire in the Eastern Continent
as well as developing in the South Seas, under
the joint efforts of the diplomatic skill and
national defence". The invocation of "national
defence" is significant. As one of the practical
steps, Japan "should strive to eradicate the
Russian menace on the North, in order to realise
a steadfast development of Manchuria, and for
the solid defence of both Japan and Manchuria".
The statement prescribed that the measure of
military strength would be that necessary "to
counteract all the military forces that Russia
can furnish and employ in the Far East".
Especial attention was to be paid to the completion
of military strength in Korea and Manchuria
so that Japan might "strike a hit at the very
outset of the war upon the Russians". In
dealing with the extensive preparation for war
which this policy decision would involve, it was

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--782--</i></center><hr><a name=page783></a><p>
<blockquote>

decided that military expansion must go to the
extent of creating fighting machines strong
enough to inflict a crushing blow against the
strongest forces which the U.S.S.R. could deploy
along her Eastern borders. An examination of
this declaration of Japanese national policy in
conjunction with the circumstances then prevailing
reveals an intention of attacking the Soviet
Union with the object of seizing part of its
territories. Furthermore, this purpose was to
be prepared for and to be carried out under the
pretence that it was defensive.
<p>
In 1937, plans produced by the Army
consequent upon the national policy decision of
August 1936 were clearly dictated by an expected
war with the U.S.S.R. The plan for important
industries issued in May 1937 was to procure a
"long stride development ensuring the actual
power of leadership in East Asia". The programme
issued in June 1937 with the same end in view
laid down that self-sufficiency was to be
achieved by 1941 "in order to be prepared for
the epochal development" of Japan's destiny
which was to "be attained in spite of all difficulties".
The plan dealing with war materials
was to the same end, and provided that Japan's
economy "would be made to develop rationally
by unifying the handling of affairs by military
administration". Attention was to be given to
preparations for a speedy movement from a peacetime
to a wartime basis.
<p>
This planning by the army, although it
so shortly preceded the continuance of the war in

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--783--</i></center><hr><a name=page784></a><p>
<blockquote>

China at Lukouchiao, was not directed solely
to that war. Okada told this Tribunal that
these plans were complementary to the Soviet
Five-Year Plan and were for the purpose of maintaining
Japan's strength vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R.
A consideration of the plans affecting both
major industries and those dealing more directly
with the production of war materials shows on
their face that they were to secure "national
defence power". As has been mentioned earlier,
"national defence" meant to Japanese militarists
expansion on the Continent of Asia by force of
arms. The plans now under discussion revealed
the Army's intention to achieve that result.
<p>
It is clear that these plans were offensive
and not defensive plans, and were directed
against the U.S.S.R. We have already referred
to the comments of the Military Attach&eacute; in
Moscow in 1932, and to those of SUZUKI to the
same effect in 1933. The political manoeuvres
in North China were based upon the slogan of
"anti-Communism". The national policy decision
of August 1936 expressly pointed to the military
strength of the Soviet Union as the yardstick
for the development of military power by Japan,
and at the very moment of the issue of the Army
plans of 1937, came the advice of TOJO that,
having regard to the situation in China and the
state of military preparedness against the U.S.S.R.,
it was desirable to attack China to clear the
menace to the Kwantung Army's rear before undertaking
action against the U.S.S.R. It was at
this time also, namely, in July 1937, that

<p><center><i>--784--</i></center><hr><a name=page785></a><p>
<blockquote>

HASHIMOTO, in a newspaper article, advocated
development of an air force to be used not only
as the mainstay of Japan's armaments, but also
for use against the U.S.S.R.

<center>
<h3>Expectation and Advocacy of War With the U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

In 1938, at a time when, as we have
already seen, the press of Japan was effectively
controlled by the Army, ARAKI, then Minister of
Education, is reported in the press as having
said at a meeting of the Political Economic
Society at Osaka that "Japan's determination to
fight to a finish with China and the Soviet
Union is sufficient to carry it on for more
than a decade."
<p>
IN 1938, also, General Ueda, Commander
of the Kwantung Army, discussing the position of
North China, referred to "the fast-approaching
war with Soviet Russia". Finally, the urgency
with which the Army generally, and the General
Staff in particular, sought to bring th war in
China to an end was no doubt dictated by the
immanence of the war it intended against the U.S.S.R.

<center>
<h3>The Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
</center>

The relations with Germany, which from
the middle of the Nineteen-Thirties showed itself
as the main aggressive force in Europe,
were of particular importance to Japan having
regard to its purpose of undertaking a war
against the U.S.S.R.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--785--</i></center><hr><a name=page786></a><p>
<blockquote>

As early as in March 1934, when the Accused
OSHIMA, as a military attach&eacute;, was being sent to
Germany, he was instructed by the General Staff to
watch the German-Soviet relations and to find out
what Germany might do in case of war with the
Soviet Union.
<p>
In the spring of 1935, OSHIMA and Ribbentrop
entered upon discussions for a German-japanese
alliance. From the early part of December 1935,
Lieutenant Colonel Wakamatsu, specially sent for
that purpose by the Japanese General Staff, took
part in the discussions.
<p>
Inasmuch as the contemplated agreement
had a general political purpose and the signing of
it was outside the Army's jurisdiction, the matter
was submitted to the Government for consideration,
and from 1936, Mushakoji, the Japanese Ambassador
took charge of the negotiations.
<p>
ON 25 November 1936, the so-called "Anti-Comintern
Pact" was signed yb Japan and Germany.
The Pact consisted of the text of the treaty and
of a secrete agreement. Only the text of the
treaty was published to the world. It stated that
the contracting parties agreed to inform each other
of the activities of the Communist International,
to confer on necessary measures for defence, and
to take such measures in close cooperation, and
jointly invite third nations to take defensive
measures in conformity with the pact, or to
participate therein.
<p>
The secret agreement, as was provided
in the agreement itself, was to be kept a secret.
In fact, it was never published by the aggressive
nations and became known to the Allied Powers only
from captured secrete files. In a statement

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--786--</i></center><hr><a name=page787></a><p>
<blockquote>

published in the press, the Japanese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs denied the existence of any
secret articles attached to the Pact and declared
that the Pact was an expression of a special
kind of collaboration between the two counties
in their struggle against the Communist International
as such, that the Japanese Government
did not contemplate the creation of an international
bloc, that "the present agreement is
not directed against the Soviet Union or any other
special country".
<p>
The purpose of the Pact was the creation
of a limited alliance between Japan and Germany.
It was pointed out by Cordell Hull, former
United States Secretary of State, "While the
Pact was ostensibly for self-protection 
against Communism, actually it was a preparatory
move for subsequent measures of forceful expansion
by the bandit nations". Our opinion, formed
independently, is the same.
<p>
The Pact waas directed primarily against
the U.S.S.R. The secret agreement created a
limited military and political alliance of
Germany and Japan against the U.S.S.R. Both
parties engaged not to conclude without mutual
consent any political agreements with the U.S.S.R.,
incompatible with the spirit of the agreement.
<p>
A year later, on 6 November 1937,
Italy adhered to the Anti-Comintern Pact.
<p>
Formally, the arrangement provided for
mutual obligation between Germany and Japan
only in case of an unprovoked attack by the
U.S.S.R. upon one of them, and limited the
obligation to not rendering any assistance

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--787--</i></center><hr><a name=page788></a><p>
<blockquote>

is such case to the U.S.S.R. In fact, at this
time, there is no evidence of aggressive intentions
on the part of the U.S.S.R. against either Germany
or Japan. thus, the conclusion of the Pact against
the eventuality of an unprovoked attack on the
part of the U.S.S.R. would appear to have had no
justification. That the pact was not really defensive
is shown by the broad interpretation of the
commitments of the parties under the secret agreement.
Such interpretation was given to these commitments by
Germany and Japan from the very outset.
Thus, Japan's Ambassador to Germany, Mushakoji,
in his telegram sent in october 1936 with Ribbentrop's
knowledge and consent, advised FOreign
Minister Arita that he had "the firm conviction
that only the spirit of the above-mentioned secret
agreement will be decisive for Germany's future
policy towards the U.S.S.R.". Foreign Minister
Arita spoke to the same effect at the Privy
Council meeting on 25 November 1936 which, with
HIRANUMA presiding, approved the Anti-Comintern
Pact. Arita emphasized the main purport of the
Pact to be that "henceforth Soviet Russia has to
consider the fact that she has to face both Germany
and Japan.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." That the nature of the alliance
between Germany and Japan against the U.S.S.R. was
not defensive is indicated also by the fact that the
conclusion by Germany of the non-aggression pact
with the U.S.S.R. on 23 August 1939 was regarded by
Japan's leaders as a flagrant violation by
Germany of her commitments under the Anti-Comintern
Pact, In a letter to the Japanese

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--788--</i></center><hr><a name=page789></a><p>
<blockquote>

Ambassador in Berlin dated 26 August 1939, to
be conveyed to the German Foreign Minister, it
was pointed out that "The Japanese Government
regards the pact of non-aggression and consultation
recently concluded between the German
Government and the Government of the Union of
Socialist SOviet Republics as running counter
to the secrete appended agreement to the
Agreement against the Communist International".
<p>
The main purpose of the Anti-Comintern
Pact was the encirclement of the Soviet Union. This
was partly admitted by Ribbentrop, one of its
authors, when he said: "Of course, there was
also a political weight against Soviet Russia
that was more or less the background of the Pact".
<p>
When on 25 November 1941, the Anti-Comintern
Pact, which was originally stipulated
to remain in force for five years, expired and
it was prolonged, the secret agreement was not renewed.
There was now no necessity for it. The
commitments under the secret agreement had been
covered by the Tripartite Alliance concluded prior
to this extension.
<p>
The Anti-Comintern Pact served as a
basis of Japan's policy vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R.
in subsequent years. This military alliance
with Germany played an important part in Japan's
policy and preparations against the U.S.S.R.
Prime Minister HIRANUMA in his address to Hitler
on 4 May 1939 specifically pointed out that
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it is a confirmed joy to me how effective
the Anti-Comintern Agreement between our two
countries proves itself in the execution of
the task placed before them".

<h3>The Tripartite Alliance</h3>
</center>

Japan's desire to realize her acquisitive
plans on the Continent stimulated her policy of obtaining
a closer association with Germany.
<p>
The circumstances in which the Tripartite
Pact of 27th September 1940 was formed have been
discussed fully in an earlier part of this Judgment.
We do not propose to make more than a short reference
to them here. Although its application was not
limited to the U.S.S.R., Japan's especial concern
in the earlier negotiations was the U.S.S.R. These
negotiations commenced as early as the middle of
1938. They were fruitless for over a year and a half,
because Germany, involved in extensive aggressive plans
in Europe, sought a military alliance directed against
all potential enemies. Japan, on the other hand,
desired that the Alliance should be a development
of the Anti-Comintern Pact directed principally, if
not solely, against the U.S.S.R. Prince Konoye,
speaking in his memoirs of this earlier period, said
"It was a plan to convert eh Tripartite Anti-Comintern
Pact which was in force at that time into a military
alliance, the principal target being the U.S.S.R."
<p>
The accused OSHIMA, one of the most active
participants of the negotiations, testified that the
instructions received by him from the appropriate
division of the Japanese General Staff in June 1938
provided for the furtherance of German-Japanese cooperation
against the U.S.S.R.
<p>
In April 1939, Ribbentrop stated in a telegram
to the German Ambassador in Tokyo that the Japanese

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--790--</i></center><hr><a name=page791></a><p>
<blockquote>

"asked for our express approval to be able to give,
after the signing and publication of the pact, a
declaration to the English, French and American
Ambassadors with roughly the following contents:
The Pact had developed form the Anti-Comintern Pact;
the partners had looked upon Russia being the
enemy; England, France and America had no need to
feel that they were meant by it."
<p>
Although in the tripartite Pact itself the
fact that it was directed against the U.S.S.R.
is not specially mentioned, this was not in
doubt in the minds of the Japanese Army in
September 1940, when the Alliance was signed.
The reservation contained in Article 5 that
"the above-stated articles of this alliance
have no effect whatsoever to the present
existing political relations between each of
any one of the signatories with the Soviet
Union" was not candid. the Japanese Ambassador
to Berlin, Kurusu, in a telegram to Tokyo of
26 September 1490, said: "The German Government
plans to guide the German press to lay particular
emphasis on the fact that the treaty
does not mean anticipation of war with Russia.
But, on the other hand, Germany is concentrating
troops in the Eastern regions as a check
on Russia." Foreign Minister Matsuoka, too,
speaking of Article 5 of the Pact at the meeting
of the Privy Council Investigation Committee on
26 September 1940, said: "Although there exists
a non-aggression treaty, Japan will aid Germany
in the event of a Soviet-German war, and Germany
will assist Japan in the event of

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--791--</i></center><hr><a name=page792></a><p>
<blockquote>

a Russo-Japanese war. With regard to the work
'existing', if you mean to ask, if the present
status of the Soviet Union cannot be modified,
I say no; I mean that it will not be modified
by the treaty under consideration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." The
same appraisal of the Alliance was given by
its author, Ribbentrop: ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this stroke will
have a double edge. Against Russia and against America."
<p>
On 22 June 1941, <i>i.e.,</I> less than a year
after the conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance,
Germany invaded the U.S.S.R. Notwithstanding
the neutrality pact with the U.S.S.R., Japan,
as will be discussed later, did render aid to
Germany while refraining from open warfare against
the U.S.S.R.

<center>
<h3>Japanese Attacks on Borders of Manchuria</h3>
</center>

In 1938 and 1939, Japan launched offensive
operations across the borders of Manchuria in the
vicinity of Lake Khassan, in the East, and at
Nomonhan, in the West. These will be discussed more
fully later.

<center>
<h3>Neutrality Pact Between Japan and the Soviet Union</h3>
</center>

ON 13 April 1941, Japan and the U.S.S.R.
entered into a Neutrality Pact. this subject
can be more conveniently discussed later, but

<h3>Germany Attacks the U.S.S.R. in June 1941</h3>
</center>

After Germany's attack on the U.S.S.R.
in June 1941, there was persistent advocacy of
the seizure of Soviet territories in the Far
East. This attack by Germany certainly stimulated
the acquisitive policy by Japan against the Soviet
Union. The Japanese ruling circles regarded
Germany's victory over the U.S.S.R. as inevitable
and imminent and thought this a favourable opportunity
for Japan to put into operation her aggressive
plans against the U.S.S.R.
<p>
At first, in consequence of the initial
success of the Germans in their attack on the
U.S.S.R., there existed a tendency among the Japanese
militarists for the speeding up of an attack
on the U.S.S.R. The German Ambassador, Ott, in his
telegram of 22 June 1941, the day Germany attacked
the U.S.S.R., reported his conference with Matsuoka,
pointing out that "He" (Matsuoka) "was of the same
opinion as before, that in the long run , Japan
could not remain neutral in this conflict.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Towards
the end of the interview Matsuoka received another
telegram from OSHIMA wherein the reich Foreign
Minister called attention to an alleged Russian
withdrawal of troops from the Far East.
Matsuoka explained spontaneously that he would
immediately propose counter-measures."
<p>
The Japanese even had a fear that Japan
might be late in her military preparations for

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--793--</i></center><hr><a name=page794></a><p>
<blockquote>

an attack. Such a sentiment found expression
in the telegram of 31 July 1941 (No. 433) from
Foreign Minister Toyoda to the Japanese Ambassador
in Washington:
<blockquote>
Needless to say the Russo-German war has given
us an excellent opportunity to settle the
northern question, and it is a fact that we
are proceeding with our preparations to take
advantage of this occasion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the Russo-German
war proceeds too swiftly, our Empire
would inevitably not have time to take any
effective symmetrical action.
</blockquote>
<p>
A secret Imperial Conference of military
and political leaders of Japan on 2 July 1941
decided: "Though the spirit of the Tripartite
axis will form the keynote of our attitude
toward the German-Soviet war, we shall not
intervene for a while, but take voluntary
measures by secretly preparing arms against
the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, diplomatic negotiations
will be continued with detailed precautions;
and should the conditions of the
German-Soviet war progress favourably to Japan
we shall execute arms to solve the northern
problems, thereby securing stability in the
northern regions."
<p>
This decision suggests that Japan, in
spite of the Neutrality Pact with the U.S.S.R.,
either considered herself bound as a participant
in a conspiracy against the U.S.S.R., or was
seeking an opportune moment to advantage herself.
At any rate, she intended to time her attack upon
the U.S.S.R. with the most favourable moment in
the Soviet-German War.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--794--</i></center><hr><a name=page795></a><p>
<blockquote>

That preparations were intensified
after the decision of the conference is revealed
by a telegram of the German Ambassador Ott
from Tokyo to Berlin of 3 July 1941. Upon the
outbreak of the German-Soviet War, Smetanin, the
U.S.S.R. Ambassador to Japan, saw Matsuoka and
asked him the basic question concerning the attitude
of Japan towards the war. Smetanin asked him
whether Japan would remain neutral, as was the
U.S.S.R., in accordance with the neutrality pact
between the U.S.S.R. and Japan of 13 April 1941.
Matsuoka evaded a direct answer to this question
and said that his attitude to this problem had already
been expressed (on 22 April of that year) in his
statement made by im upon his return from Europe.
At the same time, he emphasized that the Tripartite
Pact was the basis of the foreign policy of
Japan and if the present war and the neutrality
pact happened to be at variance with that basis
and with the Tripartite Pact, the neutrality
pact "will not continue in force." Ott, referring
to this interview, of which he had been informed,
in his telegram of 3 July reported: "Matsuoka
said the reason for the formulation of the Japanese
statement to the Soviet Ambassador was the necessity
to deceive the Russians or at least to keep them in a
state of uncertainty, owing to the armaments
still being incomplete. At present Smetanin
was not aware of speedy preparations being
made against the Soviet Union as is hinted at
in the government resolution transmitted to us."

<p><center><i>--795--</i></center><hr><a name=page796></a><p>
<blockquote>

At this time, Germany was urging that
Japan should attack the U.S.S.R.. as early as possible.
In his telegram of 10 July 1941, addressed to the
German Ambassador in Tokyo, Ribbentrop stated:
"Besides, I request that you go on working for the
soonest possible participation of Japan in the war
against Russia, as per my message to Matsuoka,
using all the means at your disposal, for earlier
this participation in the war materializes, the
better it is. The natural goal must be, as before,
to bring about the meeting of Germany and Japan on
the Trans-Siberian railroad before winter sets in.
With the collapse of Russia the position of the
Tripartite powers in the world will be so gigantic
that the question of the collapse of England, that
is, the absolute annihilation of the British Isles,
will be only a question of time."
<p>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry, at least,
considered Japan's plans for war against the U.S.S.R.
so close to realization as to discuss the finding
of suitable means to provoke war. In his telegram
of 1 August 1941, Ott reported that, when in a conference
with the Minister, Secretary Yamamoto commissioned
with the affairs of the Vice-Foreign
Ministry, he "anticipatedly asked whether Japan intended
to start her active advance with demands on
the Soviet Government, the Vice Minister marked
this way as the best method of finding a defensive
excuse for a Russo-Japanese attack in face of the
neutrality agreement. He is personally thinking
of demands of such sharpness that the Soviet
Government could not possibly be able to

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--796--</i></center><hr><a name=page797></a><p>
<blockquote>

accept them, whereby he seemed to have territorial
cessions in mind".
<p>
The failure of the initial German campaign
against the U.S.S.R. made Japan delay
her own offensive programme. The situation of
the Soviet-German struggle called for caution.
At the beginning of August, upon the slowing
up of the advance of the German Army, OSHIMA
asked Ribbentrop the reason, Ribbentrop referred
him to Keitel, who explained that the advance
of the German army was delayed by the excessive
length of communications, so that rear units were
lagging behind, and that in consequence, the advance
was approximately three weeks behind plan.
<p>
The course of the Soviet-German war
continued to influence japan's immediate, but not
her long-range policy. Ott in a telegram to
Berlin on 4 September 1941 said: "In view of
the resistance put up by the Russian Army
against an army such as the German, the
japanese General Staff does not believe itself
capable of achieving a decisive success against
Russia before winter sets in. Moreover, it is
probably guided by the thought of Nomonhan
still vivid in the memory, notably of the
Kwantung Army". In view of that ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
Imperial Headquarters in the last days came
to the decision to postpone action against
the Soviet Union".
<p>
In a telegram of 4 October 1941, Ott
informed Ribbentrop that "Japan's waging of a
war against the Far Eastern Army, still considered
as being in fighting trim, is not feasible before

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--797--</i></center><hr><a name=page798></a><p>
<blockquote>

next spring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The tenacity displayed by the
Soviet Union against Germany indicates that not
even by a Japanese attack in August or September
could the route via Siberia be opened up this year".
<p>
Postponing immediate attack on the
U.S.S.R., Japan, however, continued to regard
this attack as one of the main objects of her
policy and did not slacken either in purpose
or in preparation for that attack. In confidential
talks with the ambassadors of Italy and
Germany on 15 August 1941, the Japanese Foreign
Minister, referring to the Japan-Soviet Neutrality
Pact and the Russian assumption that
Japan would not come into the war, said:
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in view of the military expansion the
Empire is at present affecting, I think under
present existing conditions the above-mentioned
arrangement with the Soviet is the very best
means of taking the first steps toward carrying
out future plans concerning the Soviet which
will be undertaken together with the German
Government" and that "this is merely a temporary
arrangement, in other words that it partakes
of the nature of a restraint upon the Soviet
until preparations ban be completed."
<p>
In an intercepted telegram from Tokyo
to Berlin of 30 November 1941, apparently from
the Japanese Foreign Minister to the Japanese
Ambassador, the latter was instructed to interview
Hitler and Ribbentrop. The telegram
instructed: "Say that by our present moves
southward we do not mean to relax our pressure

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--798--</i></center><hr><a name=page799></a><p>
<blockquote>

against the Soviet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. however, right now, it
is to our advantage to stress the south and
for the time being we would prefer to refrain
from any direct moves in the north".
<p>
Japan's leaders, however, did not
forsake their desires and designs. In August
1941, ARAKI is reported in the press as having
said to the Secretary-General of the Imperial
Rule Assistance Association that "Next, we
shall deal with the Siberian Expedition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Japan's present ambition to dominate the
continent may be said to have germinated in
the Siberian Expedition". The same idea was
developed by TOJO in 1942, after he had become
Prime Minister, when in conversation with the
German Ambassador Ott, he stated that Japan was
a mortal enemy of the U.S.S.R., that Vladivostok
was a permanent threat to Japan in the flank,
and that in the course of that war (<i>i.e.</i> the
war between Germany and the U.S.S.R.) there
was an opportunity of removing that danger.
He boasted that it would not be difficult as
there was an excellent Kwantung Army which
included the best troops.

<center>
<h3>Japan Delays Attack on U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

Ribbentrop, in a telegram to Tokyo on
15 May 1942, expressed his desire that Japan
"would arrive at a decision to attack Vladivostok
at the very earliest". He went on to
say "this is all based on the premise that
Japan is sufficiently strong for an operation
of this nature and will not have to free other

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--799--</i></center><hr><a name=page800></a><p>
<blockquote>

forces which would weaken her position against
England and America, as for example, in Burma.
If Japan lacks the necessary strength to
successfully undertake such an operation, then
it would naturally be better that she maintain
neutral relations with Soviet Russia. This
also eases our burden since in any event Russia
must maintain troops in East Siberia in anticipation
of a Japanese-Russian conflict."
<p>
At the end of 1942, because of the situation
on the Soviet-German front, Germany's desire
that Japan should enter into a war with the
U.S.S.R. became more insistent. In his conference
with Ribbentrop on 6 March 1943, OSHIMA
said that "The suggestion of the German Government
to attack Russia was the subject of a
mutual conference between the Japanese Government
and Imperial Headquarters, in which the
question was exhaustively discussed and minutely
probed. The results was the following:
<blockquote>
The Japanese Government thoroughly
recognises the danger which threatens from
Russia and has full understanding of the
desire of its German ally, that Japan, too,
enters in to the war against russia. It is not
possible for the Japanese Government, however,
in view of her present war situation to enter
into the war. It is rather of the conviction
that it is in the common interest, not to
start the war against Russia now. On the other
hand, the Japanese Government will never
disregard the Russian question".
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--800--</i></center><hr><a name=page801></a><p>
<blockquote>

Explaining this decision, OSHIMA said
that he knew "that for a long time Japan had
the intention of turning against Russia.
But for the time being she evidently did not
feel strong enough to do so. If one withdrew
the front in the south and abandoned several
islands to the enemy in order to shift all
forces to the North, this could be possible.
This would, however, mean a heavy defeat in
the South. Both an advance to the South,
and at the same time to the North was impossible
for Japan".

<center>
<h3>The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere<br>
Includes Part of Siberia</h3>
</center>

When the idea of the Greater East
Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was developed as a
euphemism for Japanese hegemony over East Asia,
it was inevitable that the seizure of Siberia
and the Soviet Far East should be included.
This was the natural consequence of the previous
purpose and planning.
<p>
In the "Plan for Management of Territories
in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity
Sphere" worked out by the Japanese War
Ministry and the Ministry of OVerseas Affairs,
at the end of 1941 and beginning of 1942, soon
after the outbreak of the war against the
United States of America and Great Britain,
the seizure of the territories of the Soviet
Far East was considered settled, the only question
being the portions to be seized. It was
pointed out in the part of the plan entitled

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--801--</i></center><hr><a name=page802></a><p>
<blockquote>

"Future of Soviet Territories" that "though
this problem cannot be easily decided at present
inasmuch as it is to be settled in accordance
with the Japanese-German Pact", still in any
event "the Maritime Province shall be annexed
to Japan, the district adjacent to the Manchurian
Empire shall be put into the Sphere of influence
of that country, and the Trans-Siberian Railroad
shall be placed under the complete control of
Japan and Germany with Omsk as the point of demarcation".
<p>
The Accused HASHIMOTO, in his article
of 5 January 1942, entitled the "Great East Asia
Sphere Under Imperial Influence: enumerating
the countries which were to be included in the
Greater East Asia Sphere Under Imperial Influence
mentions the Soviet Far East along with China,
French Indo-China, Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East
Indies, India, etc. He went on to say "We
cannot yet decide  whether all these countries
should be incorporated at once into the sphere
under Imperial Influence, but it is at least
absolutely necessary to include for the sake
of national defence these countries in the
sphere of our influence".

The <i>Kokusaku-Kenkyu Kai</i> Society,
of which prominent Japanese political and
military leaders were members (including TOGO,

of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere
includes", along with other component parts,
"all the Eastern region of the Soviet Union
including Lake Baikal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All of Outer Mongolia".
Similar aspirations of Japan are found in the
studies mady by the Institute of Total Warfare
which was established by the Imperial Ordinance
of 1 October 1940 and was directly responsible
to the Prime Minister. Thus, the original draft
plan of the establishment of the Great East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere worked out by the
Institute in January 1942 contemplated that
"the central area" of various countries united
by Japan would include, besides Manchuria and
North China, the Soviet Maritime Province; and
the so-called "Smaller Co-Prosperity Sphere"
would include, besides the rest of China and
Indo-China, Eastern Siberia.
<p>
The Tribunal is of the opinion that a
war of aggression against the U.S.S.R. ws contemplated
and planned throughout the period
under consideration, that it was one of the
principal elements of Japan's national policy,
and that its object was the seizure of territories
of the U.S.S.R. in the Far East.

<h3>Planning and Preparing War Against the Soviet Union<br>
Manchuria as a Base Against the U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

The warlike policy of Japan against
the U.S.S.R. was indicated in Japan's war plans.
The war plans of the Japanese General Staff, from
the commencement of the period under review,
contemplated, as a first step, the occupation
of Manchuria. In Japan's war plans, the seizure
of Manchuria was regarded not only as a stage
in the conquest of China, but also as a means
of securing a base for offensive military
operations against the Soviet Union.
<p>
Kawabe Torashiro, then a General Staff
Officer, testified that a plan of war against
the U.S.S.R. worked out in 1930 when the accused
HATA was Chief of the First Department of the
General Staff, contemplated military operations
against the U.S.S.R. on the Soviet-Manchuria
border. This was before the Japanese occupation 
of Manchuria.
<p>
The accused MINAMI and MATSUI also
confirmed before the Tribunal that Manchuria
was considered necessary for Japan as a military
base in case of war with the U.S.S.R.
<p>
On 16 March 1931, HATA instructed a
Colonel Suzuki to make a tour of inspection of
the areas of Northern Manchuria and Northern
Korea with a view to operations according to
the O<font size=-1>TSU</font> plan against the U.S.S.R. and
the H<font size=-1>EI</font> plan against China. In a secret report
presented by this Officer upon the result of
his tour, detailed information was given relative

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--804--</i></center><hr><a name=page805></a><p>
<blockquote>

to the O<font size=-1>TSU</font> plan, which aimed at the occupation
of the Soviet Maritime Province.
<p>
The seizure of Manchuria in 1931 provided
bases for an attack upon the U.S.S.R. on
a wide front for the purpose of seizing the
whole of the Soviet Far East. Kasahara Yukio,
Japanese Military Attach&eacute; in the Soviet Union,
in a secret report presented to the General Staff
in the spring of 1931 advocating war with the
U.S.S.R. and determining its objective wrote:
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we must advance at least as far as Lake
Baikal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In case we stop on the line of the
Lake Baikal, the Empire will have to be determined
and prepared to consider the Far Eastern
Province which she will have occupied as a
proper territory of the Empire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Under
cross examination, the witness Kasahara, admitting
the authenticity of the document, testified that
he proposed to the General Staff a speedy opening
of a war against the U.S.S.R. and proposed
the increase of armaments for the purpose of
being ready for a war at any moment. In the
spring of 1932, Kasahara was transferred to the
General Staff, wherein he held the post of Chief
of the Russian Section of the Second Department.
On 15 July 1932, shortly after that appointment,
Kasahara sent a message through Lieutenant
Colonel Kanda to the then Military Attach&eacute; in
Moscow, Kawabe Torashiro, regarding an important
decision of the General Staff: ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that the
(army and navy's) preparations have been completed.
In order to consolidate Manchuria, the
war against Russia is necessary for Japan."

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--805--</i></center><hr><a name=page806></a><p>
<blockquote>

In cross-examination,l the witness Kasahara
explained that in the Generl Staff "there was
an agreement among the section chiefs and the
branch chiefs that preparations would be made
for a war by 1934".
<p>
When this decision was taken, the accused
UMEZU was Chief of the General Affairs
Department and TOJO and OSHIMA were Section
Chiefs of the General Staff, while MUTO was a
member of the Second Division of the General Staff.

<center>
<h3>Agreement Between War Office and General Staff</h3>
</center>

In the summer of 1932, Section Chiefs
of the War Office reached an agreement with
Section Chiefs of the General Staff upon these
preparations. Obviously, this could not have
been done without authorization and approval
of their seniors in the War Ministry. the accused
ARAKI was then War Minister; the accused
KOISO, Vice-War Minister; and the accused SUZUKI
was a member of the Military Affairs Bureau of
the War Ministry. ARAKI and SUZUKI, as was
pointed out earlier, openly declared in 1933
the intention of seizing by force the territories
of the Maritime Province, Zabaikalye and Siberia.

<center>
<h3>Military Attach&eacute; in Moscow Advocates Attack</h3>
</center>

On 14 July 1932, Kawabe, from his
position as Military Attach&eacuute; in Moscow, sent a
report ot the General Staff in which he said,


</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--806--</i></center><hr><a name=page807></a><p>
<blockquote>

"a Russo-Japanese war in the future is unavoidable",
for which reason "emphasis must be laid
on the repletion of military armaments against
Russia". He also urged "as to the conclusion
of a non-aggression pact proposed by the
U.S.S.R., we must be non-committal and reserve
our freedom of action". This, no doubt, had
reference to Russian proposals which had been
made for a neutrality pact, as has been discussed already.

<center>
<h3>Plans for War Against the U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

As with the occupation of Manchuria in
1931, so with the invasion of the rest of China in
1937, the eventual war with the U.S.S.R. was always
in mind. The strategy was directed to preparations
for an attack on the U.S.S.R. That was pointed
out by the accused TOJO, the then Kwantung Army
Chief of Staff, in June 1937, <i>i.e.</i> immediately
prior to the beginning of an attack on China, in
a telegram to Vice-War Minister UMEZU and to the
General Staff: "Judging the present situation
in China form the point of view of military
preparations against Soviet Russia, I am convinced
that if our military power permits it,
we should deliver a blow first of all upon the
Nanking regime to get rid of the menace at our
back". Similarly, both during the seizure of
Manchuria in 1931 and the invasion of the rest of
China in 1937, the war plans of Japan against
China and the Soviet Union were coordinated by
the General Staff, the Japanese War Ministry and
the Kwantung Army Headquarters.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--807--</i></center><hr><a name=page808></a><p>
<blockquote>

The accused MUTO admitted before the
Tribunal that when he was Chief of the First
Section of the General Staff he made a study
of the 1938 plan. The war plans of the
Japanese General Staff for 1939 and 1941 were
aimed at the seizure of Soviet territories.
The war plan for 1939 was based upon a concentration
of Japan's main forces in Eastern
Manchuria to take the offensive. the Kwantung
Army was to occupy the Soviet cities of
Voroshilov, Vladivostok, Iman and then
Khararovsk, Blagoveshchensk and Kiubyshevka.
The plan for 1941, prior to Germany's attack
on the U.S.S.R., had similar aims. At the first
stage of the war, it was intended to occupy the
cities of Voroshilov, Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk,
Iman, Kuibyshevka, and at the next stage
to occupy North Sakhalin, Petropavlovsk of
Kamchatka, Nikolaevsk on the Amur, Komsomolsk
and Sovgaven.
<p>
The offensive character of these plans
and measures in indicated by the secret operations
order dated 1 November 1941 of the
Commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral
Yamamoto, wherein it was pointed out: ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if
the Empire does not attack the Soviet Union,
it is believed that the Soviet Union will not
commence hostilities". The same view was
expressed by TOJO at the meeting of the
Inquiry Committee of the Privy Council on
8 December 1941: ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Soviet Russia is now
fighting against Germany, so she will not
avail herself of the Japanese southward advance".

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--808--</i></center><hr><a name=page809></a><p>
<blockquote>

Although it was suggested that these
plans were "routine", for a "strategic defensive"
and so on, it is clear that they were offensive
and not defensive. it may be that in some
circumstances a defensive strategy would justify
and, perhaps require offensive operations. A
consideration of the nature of these plans,
and the military policy of Japan in respect of
the U.S.S.R., compels the conclusion that these
plans were aggressive and not "strategic
defensive". The were "defensive" only in
the distorted sense, already discussed, that
they defend the "Kingly Way:, <i>i.e.</i> the expansion
of Japan at the expense of its neighbours
on the Continent of Asia.

<center>
<h3>Active Preparations for War Against the U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

Immediately after the seizure of
Manchuria, Japan started stationing there her
main armed forces. The purpose of their
training was mostly a preparation for military
operations against the Soviet Union and China.
Tanaka, former Chief of the Military Service
Section and Chief of the Military Service
Bureau of the War Ministry, estimated that 
2,500,000 Japanese soldiers were trained in Manchuria.
<p>
IN 1938, TOJO, as the Kwantung Army
Chief of Staff, in plans for the stationing of
a meteorological service system in Chahar,
stated its object was to "enable more accurate
weather forecasting service in Japan and

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--809--</i></center><hr><a name=page810></a><p>
<blockquote>

Manchuria and especially to strengthen aeronautical
meteorological service system in
preparation for a war with Soviet Russia."
<p>
The accused MINAMI, former Commanding
General of the Kwantung Army, admitted during
cross-examination that the construction of
railways in Manchuria was directed towards the
Soviet border, and admitted that they could
have strategic uses, although he did claim that
"their principal objective was the opening up
of Northern Manchuria".
<p>
In January 1938, the Wantung Army
Headquarters, under TOJO, worked out the
"Outline of the policy for the establishment
of a New China". This document sent to the
War Minister refers to the task of persuading
the local population "to contribute to the
preparation for the fast approaching war with
Soviet Russia". TOJO contemplated the use of
the Mongolia-Hsingkiang area "as a base for
invading Outer Mongolia".
<p>
In a secret telegram sent to the War
Ministry in May 1938, TOJO, then Chief of Staff
of the Kwantung Army, pointed out that the
South Manchuria Railway Company ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is
receiving the Army's guidance for cooperating
in the enforcement of the national policies
of Manchukuo and also in the operational
preparations, etc. against the Soviet Union."
<p>
The Army authorities did not permit the
Neutrality Pact signed in April 1941 to abate
their preparations for war with the U.S.S.R.
Thus, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army,

in an address at a conference of formation
commanders in April 1941, discussing the
Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact said:
<p>
<blockquote>
In accordance with the present situation of the
Empire, it is a diplomatic measure planned to
maintain for the time being, peace between
Japan and the Soviet Union for the purpose of
strenghtening the Tripartite Alliance. Whether
or not this pact can be made effective depends
upon the future attitude of the two countries.
It cannot be considered that we can immediately
enter into friendly relations with the present
attitudes. Conseequently, in order to make
this pact effective, our Army absolutely
cannot permit the slacking down in its preparations
for military operations. By steadily
strenghtening and expanding these preparations
the effectiveness of the pact will be promoted.
The Army will not make any changes in its
past policies".
<p>
There are people in both Japan and
Manchukuo who often say that military preparations
against Soviet Russia may be reduced
since the neutrality pact was concluded.
However, as mentioned previously, there must
not only be no changes in our past policy of
military preparations against Soviet Russia,
but since the necessity for us to take a
precise and lofty attitude towards ideology,
counter-espionage, and other forms of strategem
is especially great, it is necessary for us
to have our subordinates thoroughly understand
this purport promptly."

obtained from a captured "Military top secret"
document. The report does not disclose the
presence of UMEZU, then the Kwantung Army
Commander. He may have been present, but a
speech of such importance, a  record of which
was made and retained, must at least have had
his approval.
<p>
At a similar conference on 5 December
1941, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army
instructed formation commanders to complete
preparations for operations vis-a-vis the
Soviet Union, and to watch all changes in the
military situation in the Soviet Far East and
Mongolia in connection with the progress of the
Soviet-German war in order to take advantage in
good time of the turning point in the military
situation. This speech was made while UMEZU was
still the Commander of the Kwantung Army.

<center>
<h3>Plans for Control of Occupied Soviet Territories</h3>
</center>

Japan's leaders considered the seizure
of Soviet territories so practicable that in
the General Staff and the Kwantung Army Headquarters,
specific plans were worked out for
the management of these territories. From
July to September 1941, a special group of
General Staff Officers made a study of occupation
regimes for the Soviet territories to be occupied
by Japanese troops.
<p>
In September 1941, the Fifth Section
of the Kwantung Army Headquarters was formed
under Major General Ikeda, a subordinate of

<p><center><i>--812--</i></center><hr><a name=page813></a><p>
<blockquote>

UMEZU, who was likewise engaged in the study
of problems pertaining to occupation regimes
for Soviet territories. Specialists from the
General Affairs Department of Manchukuo were
employed in this work.
<p>
Officially, at least, the <i>Kokusaku-Kenkyu
Kai</i> Society was claimed to be an
unofficial organization. However, for the
purpose of working out its drafts and studies,
it received top-secret documents from the War
Ministry, the Ministry of Overseas Affairs, and
other Governmental bodies. One example is the
top-secret "Plan for Management of Territories
in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"
worked out by the War Ministry and by the
Ministry of Overseas Affairs in December 1941.
According to this plan, the Maritime province
of the U.S.S.R., as well as other Soviet territories
as far as Lake Baikal, were to be incorporated
either into Japan or into Manchukuo.
The Society in its "Tentative Plan concerning
the Scope and the Structure of the Greater
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" dated
18 February 1942, planned in advance measures
to prevent "the concentration in Siberia of
the Slavs who are being driven away from
the European part of Russia".
<p>
The intensification of war preparations
involved the employment of increasing
numbers of persons. Special organizations
were developed. Among these were the Total War
Institute under the Cabinet and the National
Policy Research Association (<i>Kokusaku-Kenkyu</i>

<p><center><i>--813--</i></center><hr><a name=page814></a><p>
<blockquote>

<i>Kai</i>), The former Director of the Total War
Research Institute, Lieutenant General Murakami
Keisaku, testified that the Institute was
instructed by Prime Minister TOJO to work out
a draft plan of the system of administration
for the territories of Greater East Asia to be
occupied by Japanese forces. In all the studies
made by the Institute, the question of the
invasion of the U.S.S.R. was regarded as already
settled. "The Plans to Govern Siberia, Including
Outer Mongolia", published in the summarized
research papers of the Institute for
the year 1942, contained rules for the Japanese
Occupation authorities. Among these were:
<p>
<blockquote>
All old laws and ordinances shall be
declared void, and simple but powerful military
orders shall be enforced instead. Under the
powerful leadership of the (Japanese) Empire,
the natives shall not be allowed, in principle,
to take part in any politics. If necessary,
a low grade self-government shall be allowed.
<p>
If found necessary form the national
defence and economic point of view, Japanese,
Korean and Manchurian colonists shall be 
sent there.
<p>
If occasion demands, compulsory
emigration of the natives shall be effected.
<p>
Permeation of our might shall approach it with stringent
power, not inclining into the so-called paternalism.
</blockquote>
<p>
The work of the <i>Kokusaku-Kenkyu Kai</I>
Society developed along the same lines as that 
of the Total War Institute.

<p><center><i>--814--</i></center><hr><a name=page815></a><p>
<blockquote>

By the spring of 1942, the Kwantung
Army Headquarters had drafted a plan for the
military administration of Soviet areas to be
occupied by Japan, and with UMEZU's approval,
this plan was forwarded to the General Staff.
This plan included such sections as "administration,
maintenance of peace and order, organization
of industries, circulation of currencies,
communication and transportation".
<p>
In 1942, TOJO and UMEZU despatched Major
General Ikeda and other officers to study the
occupation regime established for the South
Seas Area with a view to using it in the further
working out of occupation regimes for the
territory of the Soviet Union.

<h3>Active Preparations for War<br>After Germany's Attack Upon the U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

After the attack of Germany upon the
Soviet Union, Japan increased overall preparations
for war against the U.S.S.R. Although at
that time, Japan was already engaged in a protracted
war with China, she hoped to take advantage
of the war in Europe to achieve her
schemes against the U.S.S.R. This involved a
secret mobilization and the increase of the
strength of the Kwantung Army. In the summer
of 1941, in accordance with the plan, a secret
mobilization was carried out and 300,000 men,
two fresh divisions and various special units,
were added to the Kwantung Army. By January 1942,
the Kwantung Army had been increased to
1,000,000 men. It received a large amount of

<p><center><i>--815--</i></center><hr><a name=page816></a><p>
<blockquote>

new equipment. There were twice as many tanks
as in 1937 and three times the number of planes.
A large concentration of troops was deployed in
Manchuria along the border of the Soviet Union.
Besides the Kwantung Army, the Korean Army, and
the Japanese Army in Inner Mongolia, troops
stationed in Japan were to be used in the intended
attack upon the U.S.S.R. In addition to men and
material, large supplies of provisions were
prepared for the Kwantung Army.

<center>
<h3>Subversion and Sabotage</h3>
</center>

As well as direct military preparations,
an elaborate programme of subversive activities
against the U.S.S.R., designed for peace and
war time, was in contemplation or in progress,
as is shown by a report submitted to the General
Staff and to the Kwantung Army Headquarters as
early as 1928 by Kanda Masatane, a Japanese
intelligence officer, who later held the post 
of Chief of the Russian Section, Second Division,
General Staff. General principles and measures
of subversive activities against the U.S.S.R.
were set forth in the report. In particular,
subversive and provocative activities were
planned and put into execution on the communication
lines of Northern Manchuria, mainly on
the Chinese-Eastern Railway. The report stated:
"The affairs included in our sabotage activities
against Russia are many and their activities
will extend throughout the whole world".
Kanda, a former Lieutenant-General, the author
of the report, when examined in Court confirmed

<p><center><i>--816--</i></center><hr><a name=page817></a><p>
<blockquote>

this document.
<p>
A conference of Japanese military
attach&eacute;s in a number of countries, which was
convened in April 1929 in Berlin by the accused
MATSUI, then Chief of the 2nd Division
of the General Staff, considered methods of
sabotage to be used from European countries
during the war which, even then, was projected
against the U.S.S.R. This conference contemplated
the use of White Russian emigrants to
foreign lands. It considered also the question
of espionage against the U.S.S.R., conducted
by Japanese military attach&eacute;s outside the
Soviet Union. The accused HASHIMOTO, who was
Military Attach&eacute; in Turkey at that time, and
who attended and spoke at that conference, when
examined in Court, named other participants of
the conference, among whom there were Military
Attach&eacute;s in Great Britain, Germany, France,
Poland, Austria, Italy and Russia, and he admitted
that subversive activities against the
U.S.S.R. were discussed at the conference by
MATSUI and others. Following this conference,
HASHIMOTO, in November 1929, submitted to the
Japanese General STaff a report upon the
"Situation in the Caucasus and its strategic
use for the purposes of sabotage activities"
in which he stressed that "the Caucasus area&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
is surely important from the standpoint of
stratagem against Russia". HASHIMOTO advised
"make all races in the Caucasus confront each
other and consequently to bring confusion in
the area".

The accused OSHIMA, while in Berlin,
secretly carried on subversive activities against
the U.S.S.R. and its leaders and discussed
this with Himmler.
<p>
In 1942, the Japanese General Staff
and the Kwantung Headquarters worked out new
offensive war plans against the U.S.S.R. which
remained valid for 1943. Under these plans,
the war against the U.S.S.R. was to be commenced
unexpectedly following the concentration
in Manchuria of about thirty divisions. As
with earlier plans, these last plans were not
put into execution.At about this time, the
military prospects of the Axis Powers, Germany-Italy-Japan,
began to deteriorate. Thereafter,
they were placed more and more upon the defensive
and such a venture as Japan's contemplated
attack upon the U.S.S.R. became less and less
possible until the final defeat of the Axis in
1945. Until 1943, at any rate, the Tribunal
finds that Japan not only planned to wage a
war of aggression against the U.S.S.R., but also
that she continued with active preparations
for such a war.

<center>
<h3>Neutrality Pact<br>Germany's Attack on the U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

As has been mentioned previously, Japan
was invited by the U.S.S.R. in 1931 and 1933 to
enter into a neutrality pact, but refused to
do so. By 1941, Japan had forfeited her friendly
relations with practically all the powers excepting
Germany and Italy. The international

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--818--</i></center><hr><a name=page819></a><p>
<blockquote>

situation had so changed that Japan was now
willing to do that which she had refused to do
ten years previously. This willingness,
however, did not indicate any change of the
Japanese attitude towards the U.S.S.R., nor
any abatement of her acquisitive designs upon
that country.
<p>
On 13 April 1941, that is, shortly
before the attack of Germany upon the U.S.S.R.,
Japan signed the Neutrality Pact with the
Soviet Union. The Pact provided:
<p>
<blockquote>
<center><u>ARTICLE I</u></center>
<p>
Both contracting parties engage to
maintain peaceful and friendly relations between
themselves and mutually respect the territorial
integrity and inviolability of the other
contracting party.
<p>
<center><u>ARTICLE II</u></center>
<p>
In case one of the contracting parties
becomes the object of military action from the
part of one or several other powers, the other
contracting party will maintain neutrality
during the whole period of the conflict.
</blockquote>
<p>
In signing the Pact, the Japanese
Government placed itself in an equivocal position,
as at this time it had commitments to
Germany under the Anti-Comintern Pact and the
Tripartite Alliance. Its conduct in signing
the Neutrality Pact was still more ambiguous
as, when it did so, it had every reason to
expect Germany's impending attack upon the U.S.S.R.
<p>
As far back as 23 February 1941,

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--819--</i></center><hr><a name=page820></a><p>
<blockquote>

Ribbentrop told OSHIMA that Hitler had created
a number of new formations during the winter, as
a result of which Germany would have 240 divisions,
including 186 first-class attack divisions.
Ribbentrop also dwelt upon the prospects of a
"German-Russian conflict", which he said
"would result in a gigantic German victory
and signify the end of the Soviet regime".
<p>
The forthcoming attack of Germany upon
the Soviet Union was discussed in still jore
definite terms in the conversations of Germany's
leaders--Hitler and Ribbentrop--with Japanese
Minister of Foreign Affairs Matsuoka in March 1941.
<p>
In his conversation with Matsuoka on
27 March 1941, Ribbentrop told him that "The
German armies in the East are available at
any time. Should Russia one day take up an
attitude which could be interpreted as a threat
against Germany, the Fuehrer would dash Russia
to pieces. One is positive in Germany that
such a campaign against Russia would end in a
complete victory for German arms and the
absolute destruction of the Russian Army and
the Russian State. The Fuehrer is convinced
that in case of an advance against the Soviet
Union, a few months later as a power (<i>Grossmacht</i>)
Russia would no longer exist".
<p>
On the same day, Hitler spoke in the
same tenor to Matsuoka when he stated in the
presence of OSHIMA, Ott and Ribbentrop, that
Germany had concluded certain treaties with
the U.S.S.R., but still more important than

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--820--</i></center><hr><a name=page821></a><p>
<blockquote>

this was the fact that Germany had 160 to 200
divisions at her disposal for her protection
against the U.S.S.R. In his talk with Matsuoka
on 29 March 1941, Ribbentrop said that the
largest part of the German Army was concentrated
on the Eastern frontiers of the Reich,
and once more expressed his belief in the complete
defeat of the U.S.S.R. within a few months,
once the conflict had broken out. In that
conversation, Ribbentrop also said ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a conflict
with Russia was anyhow within the realms of
possibility. In any case Matsuoka could not
report to the Japanese Emperor upon his return
that a  conflict between Russia and Germany was
impossible. On the contrary, the situation
was such that such a conflict, even if it were
not probable, would have to be considered
possible." In reply, Matsuoka assured him that
"Japan would always be a loyal ally who would
devote herself entirely, and not just in a
lukewarm way, to the joint effort".
<p>
Soon after his return to Japan after
signing the Neutrality Pact in Moscow, Matsuoka
told Ott, German Ambassador to Tokyo: "No
Japanese Premier or Foreign Minister would
ever be able to keep Japan neutral in the
event of a German-Russian conflict. In this
case, Japan would be driven, by the force of
necessity, to attack Russia at Germany's side.
No neutrality pact could change this".
<p>
In his telegram of 20 May 1941 to
Matsuoka, OSHIMA advised that Weizsacker had
told him that "the German Government attached

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--821--</i></center><hr><a name=page822></a><p>
<blockquote>

great importance to Foreign Minister Matsuoka's
statement to Ott to the effect that Japan
would attack the U.S.S.R. in case of a Russo-German war".
<p>
The uncandid policy of the Japanese
Government in signing the Neutrality Pact is
confirmed by the fact that simultaneously with
the negotiations for the signing of the Pact,
negotiations with Germany were being conducted
for the extension of the Anti-Comintern Pact
which was to expire on 26 November 1941. That
Pact was prolonged for another five years on
26 November 1941, after the war between Germany
and the U.S.S.R. had broken out.
<p>
The Japanese policy towards the
U.S.S.R. and the Neutrality Pact is revealed
by Smetanin's talk with Matsuoka on the
25 June 1941, three days after Germany had
attacked Russia. Matsuoka, being asked by
Smetanin, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan,
whether Japan would remain neutral in accordance
with the Neutrality Pact between the
U.S.S.R. and Japan of 13 April 1941, evaded a
direct answer, but emphasized that the Tripartite
Pact was the basis of the foreign policy of
Japan, and if the present war and the Neutrality
Pact happened to be at variance with that
basis and with the Tripartite Pact, the
Neutrality Pact "will not continue if force".
We have already referred to the German Ambassador's
report of Matsuoka's sinister comments
upon his talk with Smetanin. In June 1941,
shortly before Germany's attack upon the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--822--</i></center><hr><a name=page823></a><p>
<blockquote>

U.S.S.R., UMEZU in his conversation with
Prince Urech said "he welcomed the Neutrality
Pact Japan-Russia for the moment. Since,
however, the Tripartite Pact is the unchangeable
basis of Japanese foreign policy, Japan's
attitude towards the Neutrality Pact must undergo
a change just as soon as the hitherto existing
German-Russian relations undergo an alteration".
<p>
It would appear that Japan was not
sincere in concluding the Neutrality Pact with
the U.S.S.R., but considering her agreements
with Germany more advantageous, she signed the
neutrality Pact to facilitate her plans for an
attack upon the U.S.S.R. This view of the
attitude of the Japanese Government towards
the U.S.S.R. coincides with that reported by
the German Ambassador to Tokyo in his telegram
to Berlin of 15 July 1941. Japan's "neutrality"
in the war between Germany and the U.S.S.R. in
reality served and seems to have been designed
to serve as a screen for such aid as she could
give Germany pending her own attack upon the
U.S.S.R. The evidence presented to this
Tribunal indicates that fare from being neutral
in accordance with the Pact with the U.S.S.R.,
Japan did render substantial assistance to Germany.

<center>
<h3>General Military Assistance by Japan to Germany</h3>
</center>

In Manchuria, Japan carried out large-scale
military preparations and concentrated
there a large army, thereby containing considerable
forces of the Soviet Army in the East

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--823--</i></center><hr><a name=page824></a><p>
<blockquote>

which otherwise might have been used against
Germany in the West. These military preparations
were so regarded by the German and
Japanese Governments. In his telegram to
Berlin on 3 July 1941, the German Ambassador
to Japan advised that "augmentation of military
preparations, among other things, with an eye
to realizing this object, together with the
aim of restraining Soviet Russia in the Far
East in her struggle with Germany is steadfastly
kept in the mind of the Japanese Government".
<p>
Ribbentrop in his telegram to Tokyo on
15 May 1942, likewise pointed out the great
importance which a successful surprise attack
on the U.S.S.R. would have for the further
progress of the war in the interests of the
Tripartite powers, but he emphasized at the
same time, as has been mentioned before, the
importance of Japan's "neutrality" as an active
aid to Germany in her war against the U.S.S.R.
"since in any event Russia must maintain troops
in East Siberia in anticipation of a Japanese-Russian conflict.

<center>
<h3>Japan Gives Germany Military Information<br>Concerning the U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

Evidence that Japan provided Germany
with military intelligence about the U.S.S.R.
is contained in a telegram from Ribbentrop to
the German Ambassador in Tokyo on 10 July 1941,
in which Ribbentrop wrote: "Please thank the
Japanese Foreign Minister at this opportunity
for having transmitted the telegram from the

<p><center><i>--824--</i></center><hr><a name=page825></a><p>
<blockquote>

Japanese Ambassador at Moscow. It would be
good if we could receive more news from Russia
in this way at regular intervals".
<p>
Evidence was presented to prove that
Japan provided Germany with economic, political and
military intelligence about the Soviet Union, derived
from Japanese military and diplomatic agencies.
Major General Matzumura, who from October 1941
to August 1943 held the post of Chief of the
Russian Section of the General Staff, testified
that he, in accordance with the order of
the General Staff, systematically provided
the 16th (German) Section of the General Staff
with intelligence for Colonel Kretchmer, the
German Military Attach&eacute; in Tokyo, regarding
Soviet armed forces in the Far East, the war
potential of the Soviet Union, the movement of
Soviet troops from the East to the West, as
well as of internal movements of Soviet troops.
<p>
Von Petersdorf, form Assistant Military
Attach&eacute; of the German Embassy in Tokyo, testified
that he had systematically received from
the Japanese General Staff secret information
about the Soviet Army, and e specially about the
Far Eastern Army--the disposition of troops,
their strength, detailed information about the
reserves, about the transfer of Soviet troops
to the European front, about the war industry
of the Soviet Union, etc. Von Petersdorf
stated that the information which he had
received from the Japanese General Staff
differed in scope and nature from that normally
received by military attach&eacute;s through the usual channels.

<h3>Japanese Interference With Soviet Shipping</h3>
</center>

The prosecution claimed and tendered
evidence to show that, despite Japan's obligation
of neutrality, the Soviet war effort was
seriously interfered with by Japanese interference
with Soviet shipping in the Far East.
in particular, there was evidence that at
Hongkong in 1941, Soviet ships at anchor, clearly
marked as such, were shelled and one sunk; that
in the same month Soviet ships were sunk by
bombs from Japanese aircraft; that many Soviet
ships were unlawfully arrested by Japanese naval
vessels and taken to Japanese ports and detained
on occasion for lengthy periods. Finally, it
was charged that the Japanese closed the Sangar
Strait and compelled Soviet ships to use other
less suitable and more dangerous approaches
to its Far Eastern seaboard. All this it was
claimed was done to hamper the U.S.S.R. in its
war with Germany, in defiance of Japan's
obligations under the Neutrality Pact and by
way of indirect preparation for the war Japan
intended to undertake against the U.S.S.R.
<p>
It has certainly been established that
the Neutrality Pact was entered into without
candour and as a device to advance Japan's
aggressive intentions against the U.S.S.R.

In the foregoing discussion of the 
Japanese attitude towards the U.S.S.R., we have
refrained from any detailed consideration of
the two matters raised by Counts
<a href=IMTFE-A6.html#count25 target=docwin>25</a>,

of the Indictment. These were not
without significance in the earlier discussion,
but as the Indictment raised them directly, we
thought it more convenient to reserve out
detailed consideration of them until this time.
<p>
Following Japan's alliance with
Germany under the Anti-Comintern Pact of
November 1936 and her military success in
North and Central China after Lukouchiaou in
1937, the Japanese Army, in the years 1938
and 1939, resorted to hostilities against the
U.S.S.R., first in the East of Manchuria and
then in the West. In July 1938, the scene of
hostilities was in the Lake Khassan area close
to the junction of the boundaries of Manchuria,
Korea, and the U.S.S.R. Maritime Province.
Then in May 1939, hostilities broke out in the 
Nomonhan Area, which is on the boundary between
the territories of Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia, or
the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchuria.
Both of these operations were claimed by the
Japanese to be mere border incidents caused by
uncertainty as to the boundaries and resulting
in clashes of the opposing frontier guard detachments.

<h3>Hostilities in the Lake Khassan Area</h3>

In the beginning of July 1938, the
Japanese border guards in the area West of Lake
Khassan were strengthened by a concentration of
field troops on the eastern side of the Tumen-Ula
River, which is a short distance West of
Lake Khassan. Between the river and the lake
there is a range of hills overlooking both,
along the crest of which, according to the
U.S.S.R. contention, the boundary ran; the
Japanese, on the other hand, contended that the
boundary was more to the Eastward and was along
the Western shore of Lake Khassan.

This height of land is of considerable
strategic importance, overlooking as it does to
the West the Tumen-Ula River, the railway running
North and South, and the roads communicating with
the Soviet Maritime Province and the city of 
Vladivostok. From the Japanese side, the importance
of the high land was its value in protecting
from observation and attack the railway and roads
forming the line of communication to the North
and East. Its military importance was realized
by the Japanese, and as early as 1933, the Kwantung
Army had made a thorough topographical study of
the area with a view, as stated by the Chief of
Staff of that Army in his report to the Vice
Minister of War in December 1933, to "the time
of hostilities against Soviet Russia".
<p>
Contemporary reports of the Soviet
border guard outposts, as well as other evidence,
indicate that during the month of July 1938, the
concentration of Japanese troops was being

<p><center><i>--828--</i></center><hr><a name=page829></a><p>
<blockquote>

carried out on an increasing scale. Before the
end of July, approximately one division of the
Korean Army was concentrated in a small sector,
probably not exceeding three kilometers in length.
General Tanaka, Ryukichi, in his evidence for
the defence says that when he arrived in the area
on the 31 July, the Japanese were attacking in
force. Incidentally, his evidence on earlier
preparations is interesting. He had paid a previous
visit to the area on 15 July, and he stated
that at that time, the Soviet troops had dug
trenches and placed barbed wire on the Western
slope, <i>i.e.</i> on the Manchurian side of Changku-Feng
Hill, along the crest of which, according
to the Soviet version, the boundary ran. These
defensive measures are significant of the intention
of the U.S.S.R. forces, but Soviet witnesses denied
that any such measures had been taken. If we
accepted Tanaka's evidence to its full extent, this
might suggest encroachment by the Soviet troops
on Manchurian territory. However, no claim was
made by the Japanese in respect of these defensive
measures. As will be seen later, the Japanese complaint
was that the Soviet troops should not have
been posted anywhere to the Westward of Lake
Khassan. Prior to the clash, the Soviet border
guard was small in number, not exceeding one
hundred in the sector under consideration.
<p>
In the early part of July, while the
Japanese troops were being concentrated in the
area of Lake Khassan, the Japanese Government
opened diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet
Government with a view to obtaining the withdrawal
of the Soviet border guards right back to

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--829--</i></center><hr><a name=page830></a><p>
<blockquote>

the East side of Lake Khassan. On 15 July, the
Japanese Charge d'Affaires in Moscow, Nishi,
pursuant to the instructions of his government,
declared to the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs
that the entire territory West of Lake Khassan
belonged to Manchuria and demanded the withdrawal
of Soviet forces form the West side of the lake.
About the same time, SHIGEMITSU, who had been on a
mission in Western Europe, was sent to Moscow with
instructions to secure the fulfillment of the
Japanese demands. Then followed discussions in
which the Soviet representative reiterated that
the boundary ran along the height of land to the
West of, and not along the shore of Lake Khassan.
He said this was supported by the Hunchun Protocol
of 1886 by which the boundary line was fixed.
SHIGEMITSU adopted a peremptory attitude and
said regarding the Hunchun Protocol: "To my mind
at this critical moment speaking of some map is
unreasonable. This will only complicate matters."
On 20 July, SHIGEMITSU made a formal demand for the
withdrawal of the Soviet troops adding that
"Japan has rights and obligations to Manchukuo to
use force and make the Soviet troops evacuate
from the territory of Manchukuo unlawfully
occupied by them".
<p>
On the question of the location of the 
boundary , a map and a number of other evidentiary
documents were produced before us and considerable
evidence given. The Hunchun Protocol already
referred to was signed in 1886 by the representatives
of China and russia and attached to it
is a map indicating the boundary. In both 
the Chinese and Russian texts of the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--830--</i></center><hr><a name=page831></a><p>
<blockquote>

Protocol there is reference to the map, and both
contain the following significant passage,
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the red line on the map marks the boundary
all along the watershed and the water that flows
Westward and pours into the river Tumen belongs
to China and the water that flows eastward and
pours into the sea belongs to Russia." There is
a slight discrepancy in the two texts in the
detailed description of the boundary. That there
may have been some doubts at the time as to the
exact location of the boundary cannot be disregarded;
however, in the state of existing international
law such doubt, if any, as existed would not have
justified a resort to arms.
<p>
On the 21st of July 1938, War Minister
ITAGAKI, together with the Chief of the General
Staff, obtained an audience with the Emperor and
requested that the Emperor sanction the use of
armed forces at Lake Khassan to enforce the
Japanese demands. The eagerness with which the
War Minister and the Army desired to resort to
military operations is illustrated in ITAGAKI's

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--831--</i></center><hr><a name=page832></a><p>
<blockquote>

untruthful statement to the Emperor, that the
use of force against the U.S.S.R. had been discussed
with the Navy and Foreign Ministers, who were
in entire agreement with the Army. On the
following day, however, at a Five Ministers
Conference attended by ITAGAKI, the question of
the opening of hostilities at Lake Khassan was
discussed, and in the decision adopted it was
stated, "(We) have made preparations for emergencies.
The use of prepared military power is
to be carried out by the Imperial Order after
negotiation with the authorities concerned."
Thus was obtained authority for the use of armed
force at Lake Khassan; the only question remaining
unsettled was the date of commencement of hostilities.
This question was settle done week later:
namely, on the 29th of July 1938, when the
Japanese launched the first attack in the nature
of a reconnaissance in the vicinity of Besymyannaya
Hill, one of the hills on the height of land.
this attack was make by a small number of troops,
probably not exceeding one company, which succeeded
in overwhelming the small Soviet border
guard posted on the hill. Later in the day,
Soviet border guard reinforcements were brought
up and drove the Japanese from the ground they
had taken.
<p>
On the night of the 30-31 July, the 
Japanese returned to the attack with the main
forces of one division, this time on another of
the hills on the ridge known as Zaozernaya Hill.
The witness, Tanaka, Ryukichi, whose evidence
for the defense has already been referred to,
confirmed the fact that on the 31st of July, when

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--832--</i></center><hr><a name=page833></a><p>
<blockquote>

he returned to the area, the Japanese troops were
attacking in force. It is true that he adds that
the Japanese troops were on Manchurian territory;
but this statement may be based on the Japanese
claim that Manchurian territories extended as far
as the West shore of Lake Khassan; in any event,
the Tribunal can find no evidence that the initiative
was taken by the Soviet troops, which alone
would have justified the Japanese attack.
<p>
The fighting in the area continued form
the 31st of July until the 11th of August, 1938,
by which time, with the aid of Soviet support
troops brought up after the opening of hostilities,
the Japanese troops employed in the operation
had been defeated and practically wiped out.
Thereupon, the Japanese Government agreed that
hostilities should cease and that the boundary
be restored to the height of land along the
range of hills in conformity with the Soviet contention.
<P>
From the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal
has come to the conclusion that the
attack by the Japanese troops at Lake Khassan
was deliberately planned by the General Staff
and by ITAGAKI as Minister of War and was
authorized at least by the Five Ministers who
participated in the conference of the 22nd of
July 1938. The purpose may have been either
to feel out the Soviet strength in the area or
to seize the strategically important territory
on the ridge over-looking the line of communication
to Vladivostok and the Maritime Province.
The attack having been planned and undertaken
with substantial forces cannot be regarded as a

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--833--</i></center><hr><a name=page834></a><p>
<blockquote>

mere clash between border patrols. That the
Japanese initiated the hostilities is also established
to the Tribunal's satisfaction. Though
the force employed was not very large, the purpose
above mentioned and the result if the attack had
been successful are sufficient in the opinion of
the Tribunal to justify describing the hostilities
as a war. Furthermore, having regard to the
state of international law then existing and the
attitude adopted by the Japanese representatives
in the preliminary diplomatic negotiations, the
operations of the Japanese troops were, in the
opinion of the Tribunal, clearly aggressive.

<center>
<h3>Operations in Nomonhan (Khalkhin Gol)</h3>
</center>

The hostilities in the Nomonhan district
which lasted from May until September in 1939
were on a very much larger scale than those at
Lake Khassan. They occurred at the eastern
boundary of Outer Mongolia where it adjoins the
Province of Heilungkiang. Immediately to the
South is the Province of Chahar, which in 1939 was
under Japanese control.
<p>
The importance of Outer Mongolia in its
relation to Japanese military plans toward the
U.S.S.R. was great. Bordering as it does Soviet
territory from Manchuria to a point West of Lake
Baikal, its military control by an unfriendly
state would be a menace to Soviet territory
generally, and in particular, a menace to the
Trans-Siberian Railway which is the connecting
link between Soviet territory in the West and in
the East and which for many miles runs approximately

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--834--</i></center><hr><a name=page835></a><p>
<blockquote>

parallel with and not very far from the
northern limits of Outer Mongolia. Outer Mongolia's
strategic importance was recognized by both the
U.S.S.R. and Japan.
<p>
As early as 1933, ARAKI in an article entitled
"Japan's Mission in the Showa Era" advocated
the occupation of Outer Mongolia, adding that "Japan
does not want such an ambiguous area as Mongolia
to exist near to her sphere of influence.
Mongolia by all means should be Mongolia of the
East." A few years later in 1936, ITAGAKI, who
was then Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army,
pointed out in a conference with Ambassador Arita
that "Outer Mongolia is of importance from the
point of view of Japanese-Manchukuoan influence
today because it is the flank defense of the
Siberian Railroad which is a connecting line
between Soviet territories in the Far East and
in Europe. If Outer Mongolia be combined with
Japan and Manchukuo, Soviet territories in the
Far East will fall into a very dangerous condition
and it is possible that the influence of
the Soviet Union in the Far East might be removed
without fighting. Therefore, the army aims to
extend Japanese-Manchurian Power into Outer
Mongolia by all means at hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."
<p>
The U.S.S.R., in anticipation of a possible
move by Japan or by any other country, in 1936
entered into a mutual assistance agreement with
the Mongolian People's Republic in virtue of
which Soviet troops were stationed in a number of
Mongolian towns; some Soviet troops had been sent
to the Eastern part of Outer Mongolia a short time

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--835--</i></center><hr><a name=page836></a><p>
<blockquote>

before the hostilities broke out in Nomonhan.
<p>
On the 11th of May, 1939, hostilities
opened with an attack on the Mongolian border
guards by Japanese reconnaissance troops numbering
several hundred. Between that date and the 27th
of the month, further attacks were made by the
Japanese in small numbers, each of which was
repulsed. In the interval, support troops had
been brought up by both sides. on the 28th of
May, fighting was resuemd on a large scale supported
by aircraft, artillery, and tanks. Thereafter,
the struggle developed on an increasing scale
and was only then terminated in September when
the Japanese admitted defeat.
<p>
It is difficult to say with accuracy
the size of the forces employed, but that they
were large can be judged from the various
estimates of total casualties and the area of the
operations. The Japanese casualties in killed,
wounded, and prisoners exceeded 50,000; the
Mongolian-Soviet losses being more than 9,000.
The operations were on a front of 50 to 60 kilometers
and to a depth of 20 to 25 kilometers.
<p>
The defense in this case is much the
same as that in the Lake Khassan Incident: namely,
that the affair amounted to nothing more than a
border clash over a dispute as to the exact location
of the boundary between Outer Mongolia and
Manchuria. The Japanese contention was that in
the area where the fighting took place, the
boundary was the Khalkhin Gol River which at that
point flows in a North-Westerly direction,
whereas the Mongolian contention was

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--836--</i></center><hr><a name=page837></a><p>
<blockquote>

that is was some 20 kilometers to the east of
the river. Many maps were produced and much evidence
given regarding the location of the boundary.
Furthermore, evidence was given by members of the
Mongolian border guard who had served for some
time before the clash that the boundary line was
clearly marked with border marks along the line
claimed by them as the boundary. It is not
necessary to determine the position of the boundary
at this time. It was subsequently agreed upon.
The issue before us is concerned with the justification
for the fighting which took place.
<p>
The most convincing evidence of the
character and extent of the operations is found
in a captured Japanese document, being a Proclamation
of the Commanding General of the 6th Army,
dated the 5th of September 1939. It reads as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
Although the order to reform the 6th
Army was issued before, I must now
state with sorrow that the realization
of the glorious task of defense of the
North-west area failed because the
order was not carried out. The Army
was cast into a whirlpool of irregular
war on the frontier between Manchuria
and Mongolia. Such control of actions
on the front continued for more than
ten days into the present. Due to the
brave and resolute actions of all the
units under Lieutenant-General
Kamatsubara chaos in the course of

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
battles was diminished. Now the Army
is preparing in the  Dzindzin Sume area
for a new offensive.
<p>
The Commanding General of the
Kwantung Army decided this autumn to
help us by sending the well trained
troops stationed in Manchuria, he
transfers them to the place of the
future battle, places them under my
command and plans urgent measures to
be taken to settle the conflict. The
circumstances are now such that it is
clear that the matter is beyond the
limits of a mere frontier conflict.
We are now waging a sacred war in
China and any changes in the conflict
under the circumstances of the complicated
inner and outer situation acquire
great state importance. The army has
only one way to carry out its actions,
that is to make the army unanimous and
consolidated and immediately strike a
crushing blow at the enemy to annihilate
its growing insolence. At present the
preparation of the army is being successfully
carried on. The Army will
meet the coming autumn by finishing
with one blow this mouse-stirring and
will proudly show to the world the
might of the selected Imperial troops.
The officers and soldiers have a deep
understanding of the present circumstances.
All men of the army from

brave and decisive spirit and are sure

</blockquote>
<p>
No serious attempt was made by the defense
to establish that the Mongolian or Soviet troops
initiated the fighting, nor was it contended in
argument that such was the case. On the other
hand, the prosecution brought witnesses who had
taken part in the operations who say that the
hostilities were initiated by the Japanese-Manchurian
troops. The Tribunal accepts the
prosecution evidence on that point. Preparations
for the conflict were undoubtedly made by the
Kwantung Army, but no evidence was given to enable
us to say whether the General STaff or the Government
authorized the commencement of the hostilities.
The most the Tribunal is prepared to say
is that it is improbable for operations to have
been conducted on so extensive a scale without
the prior knowledge of at least the Japanese
General Staff and the War Ministry. Shortly after
the outbreak of the affair, HIRANUMA, who was
then Prime Minister, was informed of its occurrence
by War Minister ITAGAKI. He says in his interrogation
before trial that he requested ITAGAKI to
stop the hostilities, but that he "could give no
orders" and that "the military circles were of a
different opinion". It is therefore, clear that
in the very early stages of the conflict, both
HIRANUMA and ITAGAKI had full knowledge of the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--839--</i></center><hr><a name=page840></a><p>
<blockquote>

situation and there is no evidence that either
did anything to prevent continuation of the conflict.
<p>
As in the case of the Lake Khassan Incident,
the Japanese troops were completely defeated; what
would have followed if they had been successful is
purely speculative. however, the mere fact that
they were defeated does not determine the character
of the operations. These operations were on a large
scale, extending over a period of over four months; they
were obviously undertaken by the Japanese after careful
preparation as appears from the Proclamation of the
Commander-in-Chief of the 6th Army, and the intention
was to exterminate the enemy troops opposing them.
The contention that the incident was a mere clash
between opposing border guards is therefore untenable.
In the circumstances, the Tribunal holds that the
operations amounted to an aggressive war waged by the Japanese.

<center>
<h3>The Defense of Condonation</h3>
</center>

A subsidiary contention of the Defence with
respect to both the Lake Khassan and Nomonhan fighting
is that each was settled by an agreement between the
Japanese and U.S.S.R. Governments. By an agreement
signed by SHIGEMITSU and Molotov in the 10th of
August, 1938, the fighting at Lake Khassan was brought
to an end; each side withdrew to the positions occupied
by them prior to the hostilities, and thereafter tranquility
was restored.
<p>
Under the TOGO-Molotov Agreement of the 9th
of June, 1940, signed long after the fighting

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--840--</i></center><hr><a name=page841></a><p>
<blockquote>

had ceased at Nomonhan, Japan and the U.S.S.R.
agreed on the boundary between Outer Mongolia
and Manchuria. Subsequently to these agreements,
a general settlement was made by the Neutrality
Pact between Japan and the U.S.S.R. in April 1941.
<p>
Relying on these three agreements,
Counsel for Defence concludes his argument on
the point by saying that after two types of
agreements--one specific, one general, these
matters cannot now be reopened.
<p>
In none of the three agreements on
which the Defence argument is based, was any
immunity granted nor was the question of liability,
criminal or otherwise, dealt with. the Tribunal
is therefore of the opinion that these agreements
afford no defence to the criminal proceedings
being taken before this International Tribunal.
in a matter of criminal liability, whether domestic
or international, it would be against the public
interest for any tribunal to countenance condonation
of crime either expressly or by implication.

<h3>Defence That Mongolia Was Not Independent</h3>
</center>

Counsel for the Accused TOGO, in his argument generally on
<a href=IMTFE-A6.html#count26 target=docwin>Count 26</a>,
submitted that the Count was not proven for the reason that the "Soi-disant
Mongolian People's Republic" was an integral
part of the Republic of China and not a sovereign
state until 1945. The Tribunal is not concerned
with, nor dies it consider it necessary to decide,
the status of Outer Mongolia. We are dealing with
criminal matters in which intent is of paramount
importance, and the Defence will not now be permitted
to repudiate the written commitments of the Japanese
Government in which it formally acknowledged the
status of the Mongolian People's Republic. By
agreement on the 9th June, 1940, between the
Governments of the U.S.S.R. and Japan, signed on
behalf of the latter by the Accused TOGO, provision
was made for the fixing of the boundary between
Manchuria and Outer Mongolia; the signatories
respectively stating on behalf of the Mongolian
People's Republic and Manchukuo that they consented
to the agreement.
<p>
In the face of this clear acknowledgement
of the sovereign status of Outer Mongolia, and in
the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Accused
cannot now be heard to say that the point has not
been proven, nor can they be heard to say that the
Tribunal may take judicial notice of the fact that
Outer Mongolia was until 1945 an integral part of
the Republic of China.

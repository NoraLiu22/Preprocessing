His system for naming, ranking, and classifying organisms is still in wide use today (with many changes). Hisideas on classification have influenced generations of biologists duringand after his own lifetime, even those opposed to the philosophicaland theological roots of his work.<P><hr><H3>Biography of Linnaeus</H3>He was born on May 23, 1707, at Stenbrohult, in the province ofSm&aring;land in southern Sweden. His father,Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus, was both an avid gardener and a Lutheran pastor,and Carl showed a deep love of plants and a fascination with their names from avery early age. Carl disappointed his parents by showing neither aptitude nordesire for the priesthood, but his family was somewhat consoled whenLinnaeus entered the University of Lund in 1727 to study medicine. A yearlater, he transferred to the University of Uppsala, the most prestigiousuniversity in Sweden. However, its medical facilities had been neglected andhad fallen into disrepair. Most of Linaeus's time at Uppsala was spentcollecting and studying <a href="/plants/plantae.html">plants</a>, his true love. At the time, training inbotany was part of the medical curriculum, for every doctor had toprepare and prescribe drugs derived from medicinal plants. Despite being inhard financial straits, Linnaeus mounted a botanical and ethnographical expedition to Lapland in 1731 (the portrait above showsLinnaeus as a young man, wearing a version of the traditional Lappcostume and holding a shaman's drum). In 1734 he mounted another expedition to central Sweden. <P>Linnaeus went to the Netherlands in 1735, promptly finished his medical degree at theUniversity of Harderwijk, and then enrolled in the University of Leiden forfurther studies. That same year, he published the first edition of hisclassification of living things, the <i>Systema Naturae</i>. During theseyears, he met or corresponded with Europe's great botanists, and continuedto develop his classification scheme. Returning to Sweden in 1738, he practicedmedicine (specializing in the treatment of syphilis) and lectured in Stockholm before being awarded a professorship at Uppsala in 1741. At Uppsala, he restored the University's botanical garden (arranging the plants according to his system of classification), made three more expeditions to various parts of Sweden, and inspired a generation of students. He was instrumentalin arranging to have his students sent out on trade and exploration voyages to all parts of the world: nineteen of Linnaeus's students went out on these voyages of discovery. Perhaps his most famous student, Daniel Solander, was the naturalist onCaptain James Cook's first round-the-world voyage, and brought back the first plant collections from Australia and the South Pacific to Europe. Anders Sparrman,another of Linnaeus's students, was a botanist on Cook's second voyage. Another student, Pehr Kalm, traveled in the northeastern American colonies for three years studying American plants.Yet another, Carl Peter Thunberg, was the first Western naturalist to visit Japan in over a century; he not only studied the flora of Japan, but taught Western medicineto Japanese practicioners. Still others of his students traveled to South America, southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many died on their travels.<P><a href="/history/images/systema.jpg"><img ALIGN=right HSPACE=5 src="/history/images/systemasmall.jpg" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=193></a>Linnaeus continued to revise his <i>Systema Naturae</i>, which grew from a slim pamphlet to a multivolume work, as his concepts were modified and as more and more plant and animal specimens were sent to him from every corner of the globe.(The image at right shows his scientific description of the human species from the ninth edition of <i>Systema Naturae</i>.  At the time he referred to humanity as <i>Homo diurnis</i>, or "man of the day". Click on the image to see an enlargement.) Linnaeus was also deeply involved with ways to make the Swedish economy more self-sufficient and less dependent on foreign trade, either by acclimatizing valuable plantsto grow in Sweden, or by finding native substitutes. Unfortunately, Linnaeus'sattempts to grow cacao, coffee, tea, bananas, rice, and mulberries proved unsuccessfulin Sweden's cold climate. His attempts to boost the economy (and to prevent the faminesthat still struck Sweden at the time) by finding native Swedish plants that could beused as tea, coffee, flour, and fodder were also not generally successful. He still found time to practice medicine, eventuallybecoming personal physician to the Swedish royal family. In 1758 he bought the manor estate of Hammarby, outside Uppsala, where he built a smallmuseum for his extensive personal collections. In 1761 he wasgranted nobility, and became Carl von Linn&eacute;. His later years weremarked by increasing depression and pessimism. Lingering on for several yearsafter suffering what was probably a series of mild strokes in 1774, he died in 1778. His son, also named Carl, succeeded to his professorship at Uppsala, but never was noteworthy as a botanist. When Carl the Younger died five years later with noheirs, his mother and sisters sold the elder Linnaeus's library, manuscripts, andnatural history collections to the English natural historian Sir James Edward Smith,who founded the Linnean Society of London to take care of them.<hr><P><H3>Linnaeus's Scientific Thought</H3>Linnaeus loved nature deeply, and always retained a sense of wonder at the world of livingthings. His religious beliefs led him to natural theology, a school of thoughtdating back to Biblical times but especially flourishing around 1700:since God has created the world, it is possible to understand God's wisdom bystudying His creation. As he wrote in thepreface to a late edition of <i>Systema Naturae</i>: <i>Creationis telluris estgloria Dei ex opere Naturae per Hominem solum</i> -- The Earth's creation isthe glory of God, as seen from the works of Nature by Man alone. The study of nature would reveal the Divine Order ofGod's creation, and it was the naturalist's task to construct a "naturalclassification" that would reveal this Order in the universe. <P>However, Linnaeus's plant taxonomy was based solely on the number and arrangement of the reproductive organs; a plant's class was determined by itsstamens (male organs), and its order by its pistils (female organs). This resulted inmany groupings that seemed unnatural. For instance, Linnaeus's Class Monoecia,Order Monadelphia included plants with separate male and female "flowers" on thesame plant (Monoecia) and with multiple male organs joined onto onecommon base (Monadelphia). This order included conifers such as pines, firs, and cypresses (the distinction between true flowers and conifer cones was not clear), but also included a few true flowering plants, such as the castor bean. "Plants"without obvious sex organs were classified in the  Class Cryptogamia, or "plants with a hidden marriage," which lumped together the algae, <a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichens.html">lichens</a>, <a href="/fungi/fungi.html">fungi</a>, <a href="/plants/bryophyta/bryophyta.html">mosses</a> and other bryophytes, and <a href="/plants/pterophyta/pteridopsida.html">ferns</a>. Linnaeus freely admitted that this produced an "artificialclassification," not a natural one, which would take into account all thesimilarities and differences between organisms. But like many naturalists ofthe time, in particular <a href=/history/Edarwin.html>Erasmus Darwin</a>,Linnaeus attached great significance to plant sexual reproduction, which hadonly recently been rediscovered. Linnaeus drew some rather astonishingparallels between plant sexuality and human love: he wrote in 1729 how<blockquote>The flowers' leaves. . . serve as bridal beds which the Creator has sogloriously arranged, adorned with such noble bed curtains, and perfumed with so many soft scents that the bridegroom with his bride might therecelebrate their nuptials with so much the greater solemnity. . . </blockquote>The sexual basis of Linnaeus's plant classification was controversial in its day;although easy to learn and use, it clearly did not give good results in many cases.Some critics also attacked it for its sexually explicit nature: one opponent, botanistJohann Siegesbeck, called it "loathsome harlotry". (Linnaeus had his revenge,however; he named a small, useless European weed <i>Siegesbeckia</i>.) Later systems of classification largely follow<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/ray.html>John Ray's</a> practiceof using morphological evidence from all parts of the organism in allstages of its development. What has survived of the Linnean system is itsmethod of hierarchical classification and custom of binomial nomenclature.<P>For Linnaeus, species of organisms were realentities, which could be grouped into higher categories called <b>genera</b>(singular, <b>genus</b>). By itself, this was nothing new; since Aristotle,biologists had used the word genus for a group of similar organisms, and thensought to define the <i>differentio specifica</i> -- the specific differenceof each type of organism. But opinion varied on how genera should begrouped. Naturalists of the day often used arbitrary criteria to group organisms, placingall domestic animals or all water animals together. Part of Linnaeus'innovation was the grouping of genera into higher taxa that were also based onshared similarities. In Linnaeus's original system, genera were grouped intoorders, orders into classes, and classes into kingdoms. Thus the kingdomAnimalia contained the class Vertebrata, which contained the order Primates,which contained the genus <i>Homo</i> with the species <i>sapiens</i> --humanity. Later biologists added additional ranks between these to expressadditional levels of similarity.<P>Before Linnaeus, species naming practices varied. Manybiologists gave the species they described long, unwieldy Latin names,which could be altered at will; a scientist comparing two descriptions ofspecies might not be able to tell which organisms were being referred to.For instance, the common wild briar rose was referred to by differentbotanists as <i>Rosa sylvestris inodora seu canina</i> and as<i>Rosa sylvestris alba cum rubore, folio glabro</i>.The need for a workable naming system was made even greater by the hugenumber of plants and animals that were being brought back to Europe fromAsia, Africa, and the Americas. After experimenting with various alternatives,Linnaeus simplified naming immensely by designating one Latin name to indicatethe genus, and one as a "shorthand" name for the species. The two names makeup the <b>binomial</b> ("two names") species name. Forinstance, in his two-volume work <i>Species Plantarum</i> (<i>The Species ofPlants</i>), Linnaeus renamed the briar rose <i>Rosa canina</i>.This binomial system rapidly became the standard system for naming species.Zoological and most botanical taxonomic priority begin with Linnaeus: theoldest plant names accepted as valid today are those published in <i>SpeciesPlantarum</i>, in 1753, while the oldest animal names are those in the tenthedition of <i>Systema Naturae</i> (1758), the first edition to usethe binomial system consistently throughout. Although Linnaeus was not the first to use binomials, he was the first to use them consistently, and for this reason, Latin names that naturalists used before Linnaeus are not usually considered valid under the rules of nomenclature.<P>In his early years, Linnaeus believed that the species was not only real,but unchangeable -- as he wrote, <i>Unitas in omni specie ordinem ducit</i>(The invariability of species is the condition for order [in nature]). ButLinnaeus observed how different species of plant might hybridize, to createforms which looked like new species. He abandoned the concept that specieswere fixed and invariable, and suggested that some -- perhaps most --species in a genus might have arisen after the creation of the world, through hybridization. In his attempts to grow foreign plants in Sweden, Linnaeus also theorized that plant species might be altered through the processof acclimitization. Towards the end of his life, Linnaeus investigatedwhat he thought were cases of crosses between genera, and suggested that,perhaps, new genera might also arise through hybridization.<P>Was Linnaeus an evolutionist? It is true that he abandoned his earlierbelief in the fixity of species, and it is true that hybridization has producednew species of plants, and in some cases of animals. Yet to Linnaeus,the process of generating new species was not open-ended and unlimited.Whatever new species might have arisen from the <i>primae speciei</i>, the original species in the Garden of Eden, were still part ofGod's plan for creation, for they had always potentially been present.Linnaeus noticed the struggle for survival -- he once called Nature a"butcher's block" and a "war of all against all". However, he considered struggle and competition necessary to maintain the balanceof nature, part of the Divine Order. The concept of open-ended evolution, notnecessarily governed by a Divine Plan and with no predetermined goal, neveroccurred to Linnaeus; the idea would have shocked him. Nevertheless, Linnaeus's hierarchical classification and binomial nomenclature,much modified, have remained standard for over 200 years. Hiswritings have been studied by every generation of naturalists, including<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html>Erasmus Darwin</a>and Charles Darwin. The search for a "natural system" of classificationis still going on -- except that what systematists try to discover and useas the basis of classification is now the evolutionary relationships of taxa.<hr><P>The <a href="http://linnaeus.nrm.se/botany/fbo/welcome.html.en">Linn&eacute; Herbarium</a>, at the<a href=http://www.nrm.se/>Swedish Museum of Natural History</a>,preserves some of Linnaeus's original plant specimens.

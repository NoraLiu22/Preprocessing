<H1>Lepidoptera and some other life forms</H1>

<P>This "project" has started as my desire to scan images of Finnish
lepidoptera and make them available on the web. The original idea has
evolved and is still evolving into different directions. From the
lepidoptera I am expanding to other life forms, however the
lepidoptera contains the most information. <STRONG>Other sections are mostly
species lists</STRONG>.</P>

<DL>
<DT> <STRONG>Referencing this site</STRONG>

<DD>I've no objections of placing direct links to any HTML file at any
level. However, this structure is constantly changing, and the deeper
you link, the higher the chance that link stops working after some
revision.  When placing direct links to the images (which should be
avoided in general), the link should be associated with copyright
information of the refenced image.

<DT> <STRONG>Taxonomic referencing</STRONG>

<DD><B>Don't do it!</B> Or, if you do, keep in mind that this site is
a collection of names (taxa). The <b>status or ranking</b> of a
specific taxon in this site <b>should not be referenced</b>. This site
does not contain orignal taxonomic information or opinions. Everthing is
based on published literature or other information given to me. Use
the referenced original sources (when I have listed them - if not,
then source may be some other, random web page). The structure is
dynamic and keeps changing depending on what authority I decide to
follow at that point of time.

<A HREF="warp/index.html"><IMG SRC="icons/warp.gif" border=0
align=left alt="WARP"></A> <P>The above links lead into taxonomical
tree structure, which may be hard to navigate, until you are familiar
with it. The other way to navigate directly deep into the taxonomic
tree structure is through the "warp page", which collects all the
automaticly generated indexes into single page. The <EM>warp page</EM>
enables quick access to:

<DL>
<DT> <STRONG>Photograps</STRONG>

<DD> The fastest way to see what images are available is the <A
HREF="warp/life-English-Photolist.html"><STRONG>life-English-Photolist</STRONG></A>. This
is a top level list containing references to actual photo lists.


<BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>The images are copyright to photographers as
indicated. They are <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> public domain. To use them
outside this structure, contact the photographer in question and
ask.</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<EM>As it will be totally impossible for me to get all pictures
myself, I will gladly accept images of life forms from anywhere in the
world to be placed into the structure. If you have pictures, which are
accompanied with species name, location, approximate date and
photographer, and which you are willing have displayed under my
structure, contact me for details. But read the <A
HREF="license.html">"license"</A> for a brief basics on terms of
usage.</EM>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>There is a page set from the thumbnails of the photographs from
each person that has contributed more than few photographs to this
site. The <a href="warp/album-list.html">table of contents</a> of
these "album pages" contains contains the links to the thumbnail pages
(in rather random order).</p>


<DT> <STRONG>Common names</STRONG>

<DD> Separate alphabetical indexes are generated for Finnish and
English common names. For English example, see <A
HREF="warp/lepidoptera-English-index-r.html">names indexed under
<STRONG>R</STRONG></A>. And for a Finnish example, see <A
HREF="warp/lepidoptera-Finnish-index-r.html">names indexed under
<STRONG>R</STRONG></A>. These indexes include only species from which
a common name is entered into the system.

<P>Also, as with photographs, there are lists containing all common
names recorded in this structure for <A
HREF="warp/life-Finnish-list.html">Finnish</A> or <A
HREF="warp/life-English-list.html">English</A>. <EM>However, note that
the great majority of the taxa do not have a common name listed.</EM></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM><P>The structure includes occasional common name with other languages
than English or Finnish, and similar indexes could be generated from
them, but is not currently done. Too few species would have entry.</P>
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>


<DT> <STRONG>Scientific names</STRONG>

<DD> Similar alphabetical indexes are generated from the scientific
names, for example <A
HREF="warp/lepidoptera-index-r.html"><STRONG>R</STRONG></A>. As with
common names indexes, the links in indexes take you directly
into the corresponding location in the taxonomical tree structure.

<P>There is also a plain scientific names <A
HREF="warp/life-list.html">list of lists</A> for all taxa (otherwise it
is similar to the previously mentioned common name lists).</P>

<DT> <STRONG>Checklists</STRONG>

<DD> The checklists are lists that include only the species recorded
from Finland. These lists are not complete for every group. The most
accurate one is the <A
HREF="warp/lepidoptera-fi-Finnish-list.html"><i>Lepidoptera</i></A>
list. Again, there is also a <A
HREF="warp/life-fi-Finnish-list.html">top level list</A> for accessing
all Finnish checklists (or partial lists)

<DT> <STRONG>Protected species list</STRONG> (not in warp page)
<DD> <EM>Changed
1997</EM>  The list of <A
HREF="protected.html">protected insect species</A> in Finland.

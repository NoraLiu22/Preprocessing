Dim the lights in a room.  After a few minutes, look at the eyes of 
another person and note the size
of the pupil (the black center spot in the middle of the eye). Turn the 
room lights back on.  Check the size of the pupils again.  The pupils 
should now be smaller.  This is the <font color = red>pupillary 
response</font>:
it "automatically" keeps out excessive light that may damage the
eye.<P>

<h2><img src="./gif/2do.gif"> Methods</h2>
Here's a quick demonstration of reflexes.  Talk to a group of people about 
how the brain and the rest of the nervous system controls movement.  Then, 
suddenly slam a book on a table to create a loud noise.  Ask the class 
and count the number of students who:
<OL>
<LI>Twitched
<LI>Moved their heads
<LI>Blinked their eyes
<LI>Put their hands up
<LI>Screamed
</ol>
Reflexes are used to protect the body automatically. They get us away from 
objects that might hurt us, 
before they hurt us.  For example, if you put your hand on a hot stove, 
you immediately remove your hand BEFORE the message, "Hey, my hand is on 
a hot, burning stove," gets to your brain.<P>

Reflex)</u></H1></center> For grades 6-12<P>

<h2><img src="./gif/2do.gif"> Methods</h2> The <font color = red>knee jerk
reflex</font> is one that you may have had tested at a check up at the
doctor's office.  In this test, the doctor hits your knee at a spot just
below your knee cap and your leg kicks out.  Try it!  Have a partner sit
with his or her legs crossed so that his leg can swing freely.  Hit his
leg just below the knee with the side of your hand.  DO NOT USE A
HAMMER!!!!  The leg will kick out immediately (if you hit the right
place).<P> 

<img src="pat1.gif" align= right vspace = 20 hspace=15>The knee jerk
reflex (seen in the figure to the right) is called a <font color =
red>monosynaptic reflex</font> because there is only one synapse in the
circuit needed to complete the reflex. It only takes about 50 milliseconds
between the tap and the start of the leg kick.  That is fast! The tap
below the knee causes the thigh muscle to stretch.  Information is then
sent to the spinal cord.  After one synapse in the ventral horn of the
spinal cord, the information is sent back out to the thigh muscle that
then contracts.  <P>

Our built-in reflexes really do protect us. Another demonstration of
these built-in capabilities is the <font color = red>blink reflex</font>. 
Have a student stand behind a see-through barrier like a window or a wire
screen.  Throw a cotton ball at the person.  Did he blink?  Probably. 
This is the blink reflex and serves to protect our eyes from damage.<P>

Unlike the other activities on this reflex page, this project does not
test a simple reflex.  Rather, this activity is designed to measure your
response time to something that you see.<p>

Get a ruler (or a yardstick or candy bar). Hold the ruler near the end
(highest number) and let it hang down.  Have another person put his or her
hand at the bottom of the ruler and have them ready to grab the ruler
(however, they should not be touching the ruler).  Tell the other person
that you will drop the ruler sometime within the next 5 seconds and that
they are supposed to catch the ruler as fast as they can after it is
dropped.  Record the level (inches or centimeters) at which they catch the
ruler (you can convert the distance into reaction time with the chart
below). Test the same person 3 to 5 times (vary the time of dropping the
ruler within the 5 second "drop-zone" so the other person cannot guess
when you will drop the ruler).<p>

Here is a table to convert the distance on the ruler to reaction time.
For example, if you caught the ruler at the 8 inch mark, then your
reaction time is equal to 0.20 seconds (200 ms).  Remember that there are
1,000 milliseconds (ms) in 1 second.<P>

If you want to be more precise with your calculations, use the following
calculator (cm only) or formula:<p>

<TD align=center>Formula 1<P><img src = "./gif/grav1.gif"></td> <TD
align=center>Formula 2<P><img src = "./gif/grav2.gif"></td></tr> <tr><td
colspan=2>Formula 1 provides you with the distance an object will fall in
a given amount of time.  By rearranging Formula 1 into Formula 2, you can
get the amount of <font color=red>time</font> it takes an object to fall a
certain distance...that's what you want to find out. All you have to do is
plug in the distance (in either centimeters or inches) that the ruler
fell into Formula 2 - this will give you the reaction time.
<p>

In the formulas, t = time (in seconds); y = distance (in cm); g = 980
cm/sec<sup>2</sup> (acceleration due to gravity).  [Note:  you can also
use inches in your distance measurement, but you must change g to equal
385.8 in/sec<sup>2</sup>.] </td></tr></table></center><p>

This reaction time experiment required visual information (the movement of
the ruler) to travel to your brain.  Then your brain sent a motor command
(<font color = red>"grab that falling ruler"</font>) to the muscles of
your arm and hand. If all went well, you caught the ruler!!
<p>

<h2><img src = "quest1.gif"> Questions and Comparisons</h2>

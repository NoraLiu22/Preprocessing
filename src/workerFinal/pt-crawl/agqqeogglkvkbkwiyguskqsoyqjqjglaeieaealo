              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Virginia has a total 
                of 675,000 to 750,000 beef cows on 23,000 farms. Most of these 
                are found in the Piedmont and Mountain (also called Ridge and 
                Valley) regions.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are 3 phases 
                in the production of beef cattle.</font></p>
              <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>1. Beef Cow produces 
                a Calf <br>
                (Cow-Calf Producer) </b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Beef cows have a 
                calf each year, beginning when they are 2 years old. Calves drink 
                milk (nurse) that the cow produces. At 6 to 10 months of age the 
                calf is weaned (separated from its mother), at which point it 
                weighs from 400 to 600 pounds. Cow-calf operations use pasture 
                and hay to feed their cows. Little or no grain is fed. Cows live 
                outside year around, using trees as shelter when needed. They 
                also grow very heavy haircoats to protect them from winter weather. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2. Weaned Calf 
                Grows<br>
                (Stocker or Backgrounding Operation)</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Most weaned calves 
                stay in Virginia through this next phase. The cow-calf producer 
                often sells his calves, and they are bought by a stocker or backgrounding 
                operator. This producer uses feeds produced on his farm to grow 
                cattle. Some producers use mostly pasture, letting cattle harvest 
                the grass directly. Others use feeds they have harvested, combined 
                with grains, and feed these to the cattle in barns or lots. Cattle 
                fed this way usually gain from 1 to 2 pounds each day. They are 
                sold at the end of this phase weighing 700 to 900 pounds at an 
                age of 10 to 14 months. Because these cattle are around 1 year 
                old they are called yearlings. Virginia has a large number of 
                producers who run stocker or backgrounding operations. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3. Feedlot Finishing 
                of Cattle</b> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Feedlots are facilities 
                that place cattle in pens or lots and bring all the feed they 
                eat to them. This feed is high in grain content, which makes the 
                cattle gain weight very quickly. Many animals gain over 4 pounds 
                per day in the feedlot. Because feedlots are found where large 
                amounts of grain (especially corn) are grown, Virginia does not 
                have many feedlots. Yearlings from the stocker operations are 
                sold to feedlots in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, 
                and Kansas. They are transported in 18-wheel tractor-trailers 
                specially designed to haul cattle. Cattle usually are in the feedlot 
                for 100 to 150 days. They are ready for sale weighing from 1050 
                to 1350 pounds. At this weight cattle are from 15 to 24 months 
                old. Steaks, roasts, and ground beef are then obtained from this 
                animal. So are important byproducts that are discussed in another 
                section of the beef cattle module.</font> </p>

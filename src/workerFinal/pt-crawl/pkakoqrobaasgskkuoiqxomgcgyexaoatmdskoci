<br/>

<b>CURRENT ICS POSITION OPENINGS</b><br/>

Step right up! There are still a few positions left that would make the

operation of ICS smoother. We need a few more leaders to contribute their

time and talent to the following areas in particular:<br/>

<br/>

Reporters/Writers/Reviewers<br/>

ICS needs more members writing about what is up in their particular area--documenting

concerts, masterclasses, new publications, new music and events. All members

are welcome; international members strongly encouraged.<br/>

<br/>

Job Openings Maintainer<br/>

Several members have requested that ICS maintain a list of current job openings

for cellists. Are you interested?<br/>

<br/>

Forum Assistants<br/>

Our forum directors need help in stimulating discussion within each ICS

forum. Armed with a list of ICS members that are most likely to be interested

in forum, the FAs and forum directors solicit conversation and interaction

with other members.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<b><br/>

OPINION POLL RESULTS -- "T O P 4 0" C E L L I S T S !<br/>

<br/>

</b>Because only 40 votes were cast, many excellent cellists were not included

in this list. I will ask our CGI programmesr to set up a web form so that

we can continue to count votes as they come in. But for the ever curious,

I have printed the short list anyway. The nine cellists listed received

at least two votes and are in order of most votes to least. The results

are interesting but I will refrain from commenting until more votes are

cast.<br/>

<p></p><center><b>SHORT LIST</b><br/>

YoYo Ma<br/>

Pierre Fournier<br/>

Mstislav Rostropovich<br/>

Jacqueline DuPre<br/>

Steven Isserlis<br/>

Pablo Casals<br/>

Leonard Rose<br/>

Emmanuel Feuermann<br/>

Heinrich Schiff</center>

<p>Some comments from voters:<br/>

I have heard YoYo Ma perform several times in London and his playing is

so natural and unaffected, and quite simply sublime. Add to that he is so

modest, unassuming and without any pretensions, he is my choice as the No.

1.<br/>

<br/>

My favorite cellist is Jacqueline Du Pre, often overlooked perhaps due to

her short career. Her sensitivity and expression is moving and beautiful.<br/>

<br/>

Leonard Rose has a sweet, lyrical quality about his playing, without sacrificing

anything in the technique department - always very clean and exact.<br/>

<h3><a name="letters"></a>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</h3>

***If you would like to respond to something you have read in 'Tutti Celli',

write to <a href="mailto:director@cello.org">CelloTalk@aol.com</a> and type

"Letter to Editor" in subject field. (Letters may be edited.)***

<br/>

<br/>

I just wanted to thank you for the interview with Margriet Tindemann. As

someone else who is interested in early music and also plays the viola da

gamba (after dark, like the cello), it was wonderful to read such a rational

and fascinating discussion. It led me to join up! Thanks and keep up the

good work.<br/>

Mai-Lan Rogoff<br/>

***Kudos again to Tim Finholt, our Exclusiver ICS Interviewer! All appreciative

members, please drop him a note of thanks at editor@cello.org!<br/>

<br/>

Love the site! I'm looking for an old friend who is a superb cellist/guitarist.

His name is Jeffrey Seagrams Johnson. Comes from Modesto, CA. Moved to San

Diego late 80's to teach. He plays electric cello as well. Can you help?<br/>

Eric Van der Wyk<br/>

&gt;Check the ICS membership directory at our website! Good luck!<br/>

&gt; JM<br/>

Thanks, I found him! He changed his name to Jeffrey MacFarland Johnson when

he got married 12 years ago. Do you know him? He has developed a midi cello.

Check out his web site: http://community.net/~johnsong/<br/>

***My hope for the ICS directory was to reunite cellists with colleagues

and friends from the past, and it seems that the growing database, 1500

ICS registrations at present, is starting to realize its purpose!<br/>

<br/>

Thanks for the fabulous service to the violoncello community around the

world. Please let me know how I can help to keep this service alive for

the next generation of violoncellists. I would like very much to start a

Home Page and post all m<a name="anchor968279"></a>y pedagogical material.

I would like very much to serve the young cellists of the world by keeping

them in touch with creative ways to practice and solve technical problems.

Again, a World of Thanks for your efforts. Please write me back if you have

time.<br/>

Serving you with great delectation,<br/>

<p></p><center><a href="Articles/harrell.html"><b>CONVERSATION WITH LYNN HARRELL</b></a><b><br/>

***An Internet Cello Society Exclusive!!!***<br/>

by Tim Finholt</b></center>

<p>Lynn Harrell is known throughout the world as a cellist, chamber musician,

recitalist, conductor, teacher, and recording artist. Mr. Harrell is the

recipient of numerous prestigious awards, including the Piatigorsky Award,

the Ford Foundation Concert Artists' Award, and the first Avery Fisher Prize

(jointly with Murray Perahia). <br/>

<br/>

"LH: My approach has changed throughout my life. As a youth, I was

all instinct. But then I met George Szell and James Levine, who were more

analytical musicians. These musicians, as well as many others, really knew

what they were doing, and I found that my instincts weren't enough. I soon

discovered that knowledge was a key to maintaining a high level, even though

there were days when I didn't feel like playing. Your mind can carry you

a long ways if you use it. They would say to me, "So sometimes you

don't feel like playing, what are you going to do? Are you going to give

a bad performance just because you don't feel like it?" You've got

to know what you're doing so, if you have a fever and you're really feeling

awful, that you can still give very close to your best performance. The

only way to do this is to really know what you're doing, and to study and

to learn. So there was a long period where I just didn't trust my instincts

anymore. But after awhile, I grew tired of this approach and felt like it

was time to let go and to trust my instincts. I was willing to let my instincts

take me where they wanted me to go. <br/>

<br/>

TF: In other words, for example, you knew how the Dvorak was "supposed"

to go, but then it was time to dig deeper into the music and search deeper

within yourself. <br/>

<br/>

LH: Yes. I suppose I've come to a stage in my life and career, where I do

certain things that somebody 25 years my junior would perceive as being

an indulgence, which is how I, as a youth, used to view Fournier's or Casals'

playing at times. I probably do this in part because I feel that I've paid

my dues and that I am entitled to some "liberties. " But this

also comes from a great deal of introspection, thought, and analysis over

the years, and so I see things differently than I did years ago." <br/>

<h3><a name="anchor992966"></a><a name="article"></a>FEATURE ARTICLES</h3>

<p></p><center><b>SCHUMANN BACH SUITE ACCOMPANIMENTS<br/>

Summarized by Tim Finholt*</b></center>

<p>Schumann's intense interest in Bach, whom he once qualified as the "praiseworthiest"

and as "one of the greatest creators of all times," accompanied

him from the awakening of his artistic talent as a musician up to his breakdown

in the Spring of 1854. The peak of Schumann's multi-faceted occupation with

Bach was reached in his arrangements of the six sonatas and partitas for

violin solo and the six suites for violoncello solo, to which he added a

piano accompaniment. His arrangements of the violin sonatas were printed

in 1854, but the publisher did not accept the violoncello suites. <br/>

<br/>

Three years after his death in 1856, Clara Schumann sent the manuscript

of the violoncello suites to the legendary violinist Joseph Joachim for

his opinion of Schumann's arrangements. After six months, Joachim reluctantly

expressed his opinion to Clara, "I must truly seriously warn you not

to have these published. Every day I look up to his music with ever greater

admiration and thankfulness for such magnificence. But precisely because

the laurels on the wreath of his immortality with which posterity has crowned

him are still so fresh and dense, we should be cautious not to be so forbearing

as to add a withering leaf to it, but rather conceal it from the gaze of

the musical world as an act of solicitous love." The fate of the arrangements

was thus sealed; they remained unpublished and the autograph itself is considered

lost. In fact, it was not until 1981 that a transcription of Suite No. 3

was found by the hand of cellist Julius Goltermann (1823-1876), a student

of David Popper. <br/>

<br/>

Schumann's piano accompaniments should not be seen as "stylistic transgressions"

or as a wanton meddling in the work of another master, but rather as "harmonic

braces." These "braces" were "fastened" to the

pieces solely in order to bring out the musical qualities of the original

in a more vivid manner, and to heave the pieces into the view of a public

which was not used to solo instrumental music. Even today, the discretion

of Schumann's arrangements deserves our full admiration; the piano accompaniment

never takes the upper hand and treats the original with surprising variety,

while remaining in harmony with the character of each movement. <br/>

<br/>

SEATS AND SITTING FOR CELLISTS</a><br/>

by Victor Sazer</b></center>

<p>"Oh, My Aching Back! Musicians suffer a higher rate of back pain

than the general population. The rate of such pain among cellists is higher

than for any other group of musicians. A major cause of cellists' back problems

is faulty sitting. <br/>

<br/>

Sitting is more complicated than standing and is usually more stressful.

Poorly supported sitting creates more pressure on your spinal disks than

standing. Standing permits greater freedom of movement. It allows your body

to maintain better balance and to shift your weight naturally as you move

your arms. Unless your feet can fully support all of your body's movements

when you are sitting, your body cannot be completely balanced. In addition,

when your feet are not properly placed, your knee and hip joints tend to

lock, impeding mobility..."<br/>

<h3><a name="spotlight"></a>MEMBER SPOTLIGHT</h3>

<p></p><center><a href="Articles/hall.html"><b>KEITH HALL</b></a><br/>

<br/>

"At the pre-concert dinner there were 12 people invited to a typical

Chinese style banquet in a Taipei restaurant. I was seated two away from

Rostropovich at the early part of the dinner but as the evening went on

we all moved seats. I was asked to sit next to him as we "had something

in common". We spoke for a while about the cello and the repertoire

- he seemed interested in the fact that I was tackling the first Britten

Suite - he later autographed my copy of the suites which I now have framed.

He was extremely entertaining during dinner telling many stories of his

life and experiences - including the one mentioned in an earlier edition

of ICS Tutti Celli regarding the "contract" between himself and

Britten over the suites."<br/>

<br/>

"At that point, a young Taiwanese violinist started to play "The

Swan" fairly close to our table. He played it beautifully - although

Slava pointed out to me he took 5 bows for the high B eight bars from the

end! We all suggested that we invite the violinist to our table for a drink

after he finished playing. I went up to him and asked him to come to our

table where there was a very "special guest" who wanted to meet

him. As he approached our table I saw his lower jaw drop about 3 inches

when he recognized who was sitting there. He had heard Rostropovich in concert

two years earlier in Taiwan and recognized him immediately. Imagine the

feeling of knowing you had just played the Swan to Rostropovich! Slava was

very interested in listening to the violinist (who spoke excellent English)

in relation to his studies and his work. The young violinist explained that

he traveled from one nightclub to another on his motorbike each night giving

small recitals - sometimes up to seven nightclubs each night. Slava responded

with - "maestro, you are seven times greater musician than I am, I

can only manage one concert hall each night!! "The young violinist

was completely bowled over by the comment. It certainly made his night a

memorable one!..."<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

Many issues were discussed, including the following:<br/>

1. Where does the left thumb go? Though the traditional answer is somewhat<br/>

across from the second (middle) finger, a new school of thought is emerging<br/>

that perhaps the thumb should be allowed to go where it wants to, some<br/>

natural rest position that depends on the mechanics of a particular passage.<br/>

2. Should the thumb press against the neck? The thumb should be relaxed

so<br/>

that it prevents the build-up of tension in the rest of the hand, which

increases dexterity as well. The concept of fingering needs to changed from<br/>

"pressing" to the controlled transfer of arm weight from one finger

to the next.<br/>

3. For ideas on a more "natural" approach to cello playing, read

Victor<br/>

Sazer's book called, "New Directions in Cello Playing."<br/>

4. Articulation: Techniques for articulation of notes was discussed,<br/>

including a SLIGHT hammering of fingers on the way down (placing them with

confidence), pulling fingers to the side to create a slight pluck when<br/>

lifting the fingers, or just lifting the fingers with conviction. We pay<br/>

more attention to how to place fingers, and often neglect the equally<br/>

important technique of lifting fingers.<br/>

5. You're Never Too Old: If you want a flood of e-mails, just ask for<br/>

stories demonstrating that it's never too late to learn the cello.<br/>

<br/>

Dear Marguerite, Sorry I have not responded until now, life has been crazy

and I was away for a while. I did find one citation for a cello arrangement

of the song "Plaisir D'amour" (which, by the way has been arranged

for many different instruments) on FirstSearch. The OCLC accession number

is 21276614. If you ask your local librarian to do an inter library loan

that number will make things easier. The odd thing is that the only place

which is listed as owning the thing is the Norfolk Public Library (Virginia).

But they do say they lend, so if they have it, you should be able to get

it. <br/>

<br/>

I've checked 3 out of the 5 collections we have on campus and no luck so

far. I'll get back in touch after checking the other two (I have to go to

another building to do that). In the meantime you can initiate the ILL request.

The other information on the score, by the way is this: "Plaisir damour:

for violin or cello solo with piano accompaniment; also trio. England: E.H.

Freeman, 1952 (plate No. 2022). Good luck and hope this helps!<br/>

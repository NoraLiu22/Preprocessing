        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Rickets 
        and osteomalacia, classic conditions of calcium and vitamin 
        D deficiency, are common problems in sun-basking reptiles, 
        such as the green iguana, when housed indoors. Vitamin 
        D deficiency may occur because exposure to ultraviolet 
        (UV) radiation of appropriate wavelength and intensity 
        is inadequate or because intake and/or absorption of dietary 
        vitamin D3 is insufficient. The principal benefit of artificial 
        light for captive herpetofauna, apart from photoperiodic 
        effects, is the promotion of vitamin D synthesis, provided 
        that artificial light includes appropriate ultraviolet 
        (UV) wavelengths. Dermal and epidermal conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol 
        to cholecalciferol requires irradiative exposure between 
        280 and 315 nm (Webb and Holick, 1988). Most artificial 
        lights sources do not emit a significant level of radiation 
        in this range.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
        objective of these projects was to determine the effectiveness 
        of oral and injectable supplementation of vitamin D3 as 
        well as experimental UV-emitting lamps as means of improving 
        the vitamin D status of captive green iguanas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Materials 
        and Methods<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Prior 
        to the initiation of these projects, all animals were 
        fed diets containing approximately 2,000 IU vitamin D3 
        per kg, 1.4% calcium and 0.7% phosphorus. None of the 
        animals were provided with exposure to natural or artificial 
        UV radiation for at least 6 months. However, many of the 
        animals had developed pathologic fractures and classic 
        signs of rickets, suggesting problems with calcium and/or 
        vitamin D metabolism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Serum 
        levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D for all animals were determined 
        by the radiorecptor assay technique of Chen et al. (1990). 
        Whole body radiographs, taken prior to and immediately 
        after the experimental period, were used as a gross measure 
        of skeletal calcification.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Project 
        1: Twenty-five green iguanas (11 adults, 14 juveniles) 
        were each allotted by age and weight to one of five treatment 
        groups. Animals receiving treatment 1 served as the control 
        and were provided with no additional vitamin D and no 
        UV lights. Iguanas on treatment 2 were given IM injections 
        of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) at the rate of 1,000-3,000 
        IU/kg body weight at beginning of the study (day 0), and 
        again on day 46. The initial injection was crystalline 
        cholecalciferol (Sigma Chemicals #C-9756, St Louis, MO) 
        in a glycerol suspension, and the subsequent injection 
        was an emulsifiable base containing 10,000 IU cholecalciferol/ml 
        in 95% ethanol (Henkel Corporation, LaGrange, IL). Animals 
        in treatments 3 through 5 had exposure for 12 hours per 
        day to a daylight phosphor lamp, a 35% Sylvania 2096 phosphor 
        experimental lamp or a 100% Sylvania 2096 phosphor experimental 
        lamp, respectively. The animals were able to regulate 
        their distance from the lamp from 5 cm to 70 cm [2-28 
        in.] but were provided with no shaded area. Blood was 
        collected from each animal on day 0, 27, 46, 67, 89, 166 
        and 204 for determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Project 
        2: Eight hatchling green iguanas, blocked by initial weight 
        and whole body bone mineral concentration, were allotted 
        to one of two treatment groups. On day 0, animals in treatment 
        group 1 were administered an oral dose of vitamin D3 suspended 
        in corn oil (34,000 IU/mI) at the rate of 0.25 &#181;l 
        (8.5 IU)/g body weight. Doses were administered to the 
        closest &#181;l using an adjustable Eppendorf &reg; micropipettor. 
        Additionally, the animals on treatment 1 were exposed 
        to General Electric Cool White fluorescent lamps for 12 
        hours daily.[<a href="#note">a</a>] Animals in treatment 
        group 2 were given no supplemental vitamin D but were 
        exposed to an experimental lamp, the Sylvania Experimental 
        Reptile Light (modification of the 25% 2096 phosphor lamp 
        with a color rendering index of at least 91 and a correlated 
        color temperature of 5500&#176;K), for 12 hours each day. 
        All lamps were mounted 61 cm [24.4 in.] from the floor 
        of the reptile enclosures. Although the iguanas were able 
        to regulate their distance from the lamp, between 30 cm 
        and 61 cm [12-24 in.], they were provided no completely 
        shaded area. Blood samples were obtained from each animal 
        on day 0, 7, 21 and 35 for determination of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
        D.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Results 
        and Discussion<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">It 
        is not clear why animals that consume diets high in calcium 
        and vitamin D3 should show evidence of calcium and/or 
        vitamin D deficiency. It was, however, clearly demonstrated 
        that bone metabolism in these green iguanas was severely 
        compromised prior to initiation of this study. Prior to 
        beginning treatments, no differences in any measure were 
        apparent between treatment groups in either project. Before 
        treatment, serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites 
        were extremely low or immeasurable in all animals. Likewise, 
        initial radiographs indicated mild to moderate osteomalacia, 
        a general lack of radiographic definition and thin cortices 
        in long bones. Radiographs taken after treatment revealed 
        improved radiographic definition and displayed signs of 
        healing in old fracture sites. No new fracture sites were 
        seen post-treatment m any of the animals.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Analyzed 
        data for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D are presented in Figures 
        1and 2. In Project 1, significant differences were not 
        evident between the control treatment and the daylight 
        treatment at any time (P&gt; 0.05). Differences between 
        the control treatment and the injection treatment were 
        seen only at day 27 (P &lt;0.005) and at day 67 (P &lt;0.0003), 
        each of which were approximately 3 weeks subsequent to 
        vitamin D injections. Both the 35% and 100% 2096 treatments 
        produced highly significant differences from other treatments 
        at all sampling times after baseline (P &lt;0.0001). In 
        Project 2, baseline concentrations were not significantly 
        different (P&gt; 0.05) between treatments, nor were there 
        significant differences between the oral dose treatment 
        and the UV light treatment at 7 days (P&gt; 0.05). By 
        days 21 and 35, however, differences between the treatments 
        were significant (P &lt;0.004 and P &lt;0.0007, respectively).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
        iguanas on Project 1 demonstrated a serum response in 
        25-hydroxyvitamin D to both forms of injectable cholecalciferol. 
        It appeared that the injection in the emulsified base 
        produced a higher response in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
        D concentrations and sustained elevated serum concentrations 
        of this vitamin D metabolite for a longer period. Each 
        injected dose was roughly equivalent to the total amount 
        of cholecalciferol an iguana would consume in a diet containing 
        2,000 IU/kg in a 5-month period. Yet, serum concentrations 
        were still significantly lower than those attained by 
        exposure to UV light.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
        percentage of 2096 phosphor was a significant factor in 
        producing elevated levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in animals 
        exposed to experimental lamps, with higher concentrations 
        of this vitamin D metabolite associated with higher percentages 
        of the phosphor. Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin 
        D in all animals exposed to the 2096 phosphor were maintained 
        consistently in excess of 200 ng/ml, and ranged as high 
        as 1,200 ng/ml.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
        Project 2, all dosed animals exhibited a serum response 
        to the oral cholecalciferol. The peak response in the 
        absorption curve to this oral dose may have been missed 
        due to the intervals between blood collections. However, 
        by day 21 serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
        in the orally dosed iguanas already were on the decline. 
        The amount of cholecalciferol administered to each animal 
        (8.5 IU/g BW) was an extremely high dose, yet, serum concentrations 
        of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly lower than those 
        attained by exposure to UV radiation. Serum concentrations 
        of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in all animals exposed to the Experimental 
        Reptile Light rose relatively rapidly, and were maintained 
        after day 21 in excess of 330 ng/ml, ranging as high as 
        575 ng/mI.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Serum 
        concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of the magnitude 
        seen in these projects have not been reported in other 
        species, but concentrations previously reported in captive 
        green iguanas housed outdoors were &gt; 400 ng/ml (Allen 
        et al., 1994). There may be several potential problems 
        associated with highly elevated serum concentrations of 
        vitamin D metabolites. In those species which have been 
        studied, concentrations such as those seen here, might 
        be associated with pathology. However, no clinical signs 
        or radiographic evidence of vitamin D toxicity were seen 
        in these iguanas.[<a href="#note">b</a>]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> To 
        attain such extraordinary serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin 
        D, the iguana must have a remarkable capacity to convert 
        cutaneous precursors to previtamin D3. Additionally the 
        thermal conversion of previtamin D3 to vitamin D3 also 
        must be highly efficient. The regulation of cutaneous 
        production of vitamin D3 precursors in human skin precludes 
        excess conversion of previtamin D3 to vitamin D3 by shifting 
        photoisomerization of previtamin D3 to its biologically 
        inert isomers, lumisterol and tachysterol, in lieu of 
        vitamin D3 (Holick et al., 1981 and Webb and Holick, 1988). 
        The extraordinarily elevated concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitarnin 
        D found in iguanas exposed daily for 12 hours to UV radiation 
        may challenge the effectiveness of this method of regulation. 
        It is quite possible, however, that if iguanas are provided 
        with access to shaded areas, as they would be in the wild, 
        they may regulate vitamin D production by behaviorally 
        limiting their UV exposure.[<a href="#note">c</a>]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Further 
        studies are necessary if the mechanism of vitamin D production 
        and regulation in iguanas are to be identified. It is 
        critical, however, to continue research with lamps such 
        as the Sylvania Expeimetal Reptile Light to establish 
        long term safety and effectiveness for maintaining the 
        health of captive herpetofauna. It is obvious that any 
        UV source identified for intended use with captive animals 
        should support adequate vitamin D3 photobiogenesis without 
        causing tissue damage or other adverse effects.</font></p>

        According to G.E., none of their fluorescent tubes, including 
        the GE Cool White, is made for, nor suitable for use as, 
        a UVB source for reptiles. Was the GE Cool White tube 
        chosen for Project 2 group because it was known that it 
        did not produce enough and so the test results would be 
        reflective only of the vitamin D injections?</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>b</b> 
        It is unknown which iguanas who were suffering from metabolic 
        bone disease (MBD) at the start of the study were allocated 
        to which groups. The use of oral and injectible D3 in 
        the clinical management of MBD is known to be effective, 
        temporarily increasing the serum D3 to kick-start, as 
        it were, increased calcium uptake when the cause, or part 
        of the cause, of the MBD, was due to inadequate UVB exposure. 
        Given that wild green iguanas do not get the full brunt 
        of the sun all day long, and that the amount of UV reaching 
        them varies during the course of the day when they are 
        exposed to full sun and partial shade, subjecting them 
        to very high output UVB sources in captivity without providing 
        shade results in their getting more UVB exposure than 
        they do in the wild. The serum concentrations of iguanas 
        kept under the VHO phosphor lamps was far in excess of 
        that known to be dangerous in other species. The iguanas 
        in the treatment groups exposed to the Sylvania 2096 lamps 
        were exposed to them for just over six months; longer 
        exposure periods are needed before any determination of 
        D3 toxicity will be known. Symptoms of D3 toxicity are 
        similar to those of MBD.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>c</b> 
        The report mentions the &quot;extraordinary serum concentrations&quot; 
        in the iguanas exposed to the UV lamps, and their &quot;remarkable 
        capacity to convert cutaneous precursors to previtamin 
        D3.&quot; In humans, the conversion process precludes 
        conversion of too much D3. This is one case where using 
        human biology as a model doesn't work: humans spend most 
        of their time outdoors with most of their bodies covered 
        by clothing. Vitamin D deficiencies have been common enough 
        to result in many foods being fortified with D. It is 
        thought that iguanas have a similar mechanism at play, 
        that their bodies will not convert any more previtamin 
        D3 to vitamin D3 than their body needs to maintain proper 
        functioning. One would then expect to see a level serum 
        25-hydroxyvitamin D in their blood. That many of the test 
        iguanas had highly elevated levels indicates that this 
        is not the case. In the wild, when iguanas retreat to 
        shaded areas to cool down, they are also reducing their 
        exposure to UVB. If one chooses to use the newer VHO UVB 
        fluorescent tube or lights in their iguana's environments, 
        one should make sure to provide shade areas for the iguana 
        to retreat to - and make sure the iguana is in fact thermoregulating 
        by spending time in the shade. If the iguana remains exposed 
        to the VHO source for prolonged periods of time, or never 
        uses the shaded area, consider switching to one of the 
        low output tubes known to be safe and effective (such 
        as DuroTest's Vita-Lite&reg; or Zoo Med's Repti-Sun&reg;) 
        or get the iguana's serum levels of D, calcium and phosphorous 
        checked regularly for the first several years to make 
        sure there is no sign of D toxicity. </font></p>

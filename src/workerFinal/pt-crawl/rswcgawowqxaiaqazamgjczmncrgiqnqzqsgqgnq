New question some college students are asking:<P>

"Should I worry about a bacterial meningitis?"</strong></center>

<h3>What is Bacterial Meningitis?</h3>

<table align=right border=0 cellpadding=5><tr><td width="350" 
align=center>The Meninges<BR><img src = "cover.gif"></td></tr></table>

Bacterial meningitis is an infection that leads to inflammation of the <a
href = "cover.html">meninges</A>, the coverings of the brain.  Several
types of bacteria, including <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and
<i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> can cause inflammation of the meninges.  
The bacteria that causes meningitis most often in young adults is
<i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>.  This type of infection is also called
meningococcal disease.<P>

Worldwide, meningococcal disease affects 310,000 people each year.  
According to the <a href = "http://www.cdc.gov">US Centers for Disease and
Control (CDC)</A>, approximately 2,600 people in the United States get
meningococcal disease each year.  Between 10-15% of the people who develop
the disease will die.  Of those who survive, 10% of the people will have
lingering symptoms such as deafness, seizures or stroke.  <P>

Although infants younger than two years old are at the highest risk for
meningococcal disease, first-year college students <i><U>who live in
dormitories</u></i> also have an increased risk for the disease.

<h3>Symptoms of Bacterial Meningitis</h3> Symptoms can develop quickly
(in less than a day).  People with meningitis do not always show all of 
the symptoms of the disease.  Widespread damage can occur if 
the infection spreads through the blood to tissues in the body.

<h3>How is Bacterial Meningitis Spread?</h3>

A meningococcal infection is spread from person-to-person through the air
or through nose and throat secretions.  Sneezing, coughing, kissing, and
sharing utensils or beverages can spread the disease.  Some people
infected by the bacteria will not have any symptoms of the disease.

<H3>How is Bacterial Meningitis Diagnosed?</h3>

Doctors look for the clinical symptoms of meningitis and can perform a <a
href =
"http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/sick/lumbar_puncture.html">lumbar
puncture</A> to examine a patient's <a href = "vent.html">cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF)</A> for evidence of infection.  Bacteria are grown from the
CSF sample to identify the type of infection and to determine the best
treatment for the patient.  A blood test or swab of the throat or nose is
sometimes used to identify the bacteria. <img src = "./gif/vaccine.gif"
vspace=20 hspace =20 align=right>

<h3>Treating Bacterial Meningitis</h3>

Patients with bacterial meningitis are treated with antibiotics.  Often
people who have come in close contact with the patient, such as family
members, are also treated with antibiotics to prevent an infection.

<h3>Preventing Bacterial Meningitis</h3>

A vaccine against four strains of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> is
available, but it is not given routinely. Because college freshman who
live in dormitories have a higher risk of meningococcal disease than other
populations, the <a href = "http://www.cdc.gov">CDC</A> has recommended
that these students and their parents be <a href =
"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4907a2.htm">educated about the
availability of the meningococcal vaccine</A>.  The close living
conditions in dormitories may place these students at a higher risk for
meningococcal disease.

the symptoms of viral meningitis are usually not as severe as 
those of bacterial meningitis.

Ethiopia are at the highest risk for meningococcal disease.  Living 
conditions and

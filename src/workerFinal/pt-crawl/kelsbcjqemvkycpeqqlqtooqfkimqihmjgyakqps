<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the Manage Resources page is first opened, it shows a table of existing resources that the current user has permission to change, including those created by this user and those that this user has been invited to manage by others. Refer to the information under the <a href="home#public-resource-table" class="xref page">Public Resources Table</a> section for detailed explanations of the Name, Organization, Type, Subtype, Records, Last Modified, Last publication, and Next publication columns. In addition, the Manage Resources Table includes the following column of basic information about the resources:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Visibility</strong> - a category stating who has access to view the resource. If the resource is "Public", all users will be able to see it on the <a href="home#public-resource-table" class="xref page">Public Resources Table</a> on the Home page. If the resource is "Private", it will be visible in the Manage Resources table only to the user who created it, to those who have been invited to manage it, and to users having the Admin role. Details about inviting others to manage a resource are given in the "Resource Managers" section under the "Resource Overview" heading in the "Manage Resources" section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Author</strong> - the IPT user who created the resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="create-a-new-resource"><a class="anchor" href="#create-a-new-resource"></a>Create a New Resource</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below the Manage Resource table is a form that can be used to create a new resource. First, a unique "shortname" must be provided for the resource. This short name will be used to uniquely identify the resource within the IPT instance, and will be used within the URL to access the resource via the Internet. The shortname must be at least three characters in length, may contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z and 0-9), but must not contain white space, punctuation other than hyphens or underscores, or accented characters (e.g., "firstresource" or "first_resource", but not "first resource" or "première ressource!"). Second, a resource type must be provided. Please note that when an optional Darwin Core archived resource is loaded (see below) the type will be determined automatically and overwrite this selection. Third, an optional archived resource can be uploaded. The following sections describe different types of archived resources from which a new resource can be derived:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#upload-a-darwin-core-archive">Darwin Core Archive</a> or Camtrap Frictionless Data Package,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#upload-a-zipped-ipt-resource-configuration-folder">zipped (.zip) IPT resource configuration folder</a>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#upload-a-metadata-file">metadata file</a> (EML or Frictionless metadata)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, you can always just <em>create an entirely new resource</em> without loading an existing archived resource. With this option the resource configuration will have to be created in its entirety through the IPT forms, including uploading source data files (or connecting to a database or URLs) and mapping the fields therein to terms in the appropriate extension or extensions. <strong>Please note the IPT has a 10GB file upload limit</strong>, however, there is <strong>no limit to the size of Darwin Core Archive the IPT can export/publish</strong>. Refer to the <a href="#upload-limits">note about file upload limits</a> to find out how to work around the file upload limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Begin by entering a new resource shortname as described above, and then click on the button labelled "Create". This will open the Resource Overview page. Proceed by completing the various sections of the manage resource page based on the descriptions under the "Resource Overview" heading of the "Manage Resources Menu" section.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

<p>The IPT is able to import valid Darwin Core Archive files up to 10GB in size.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to create a copy of a resource from its zipped IPT resource configuration folder. The only condition is that the resource must have been created under a compatible version of the IPT. Effectively, this will copy all the resource&#8217;s metadata, source data, and mappings. It will <strong>not</strong> copy the resource&#8217;s registration information, version history, DOI(s), version number, managers, publication status, created date, last publication date, or even preserve the resource short name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To do so, follow these instructions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Locate the resource configuration folder corresponding to the resource you want to copy. The resource configuration folders are stored inside the <code>$data-directory/resources</code> folder, and named using the resource short name. For example, if the resource had short name "ants", it would be found at <code>$data-directory/resources/ants</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zip (compress) the resource configuration folder: <code>ants/</code> → <code>ants.zip</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the "Create a New Resource" section on the "Manage Resource Menu" page:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Enter a new resource short name. You can preserve the zipped resource&#8217;s short name, provided it doesn&#8217;t already exist in your IPT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the button labelled "Choose File", then navigate to and select the intended zipped resource configuration folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After selecting the file, its name will appear next to the "Choose File" button. Click on the button labelled "Create". If there is a problem importing the selected file, an error message will alert the user. If the import is successful, a Resource Overview page will appear with the resource metadata, source data, and mappings all copied from the zipped resource into the new resource.</p>

<p>The IPT is able to import and export valid dataset metadata files that conform to the GBIF Metadata Profile. Information about the GBIF EML Metadata Profile and how to author a metadata document conforming to the GBIF Metadata Profile Darwin Core can be found in the <a href="gbif-metadata-profile" class="xref page">GBIF Metadata Profile – How To Guide</a>. To import a metadata file, select the resource type "metadata-only", then click on the button labelled "Choose File", navigate to and select the intended metadata file.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This area of the Resource Overview page allows a user to import primary data from files, databases or URLs into the IPT. If a resource has no source data it is considered a metadata-only resource, with information about a data set or collection, but without any primary data. It is possible to connect a resource to more than one data source if the sources are related to each other. More about relating multiple data sources is explained in the <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/index.htm#implement">Implementation Guide</a> section of the Darwin Core Text Guide.  Following are explanations for the preliminary step of choosing the source data, either from text files, database sources or a text file available at a URL:</p>

Click the ┇ menu at "Source Data" and select "Add". Then select "File" from the dropdown box in the modal window and click on the button labelled "Browse…" or "Choose file" to navigate to and select the file to import. The file name can only be composed of alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9), spaces, underscores, full stops, parentheses, and hyphens. After selecting the file, its name will appear to the right of the "Browse…" button.</p>

The IPT fills as many selections as it can from extension field names that match a data source field name. All of the remaining source field select boxes are left blank, signifying that the extension field has not been mapped to a source data field.

<p><strong>Data source field select box</strong> - ID field - This field can be matched to a source data field, or it can be set to "No ID" signifying that the field will not be mapped to a source data field. The ID field is required in order to link records from the two sources together. The ID can be auto-generated from the "Line Number" or "UUID Generator", but this feature is exclusively available when mapping a source to the Taxon Core Type&#8217;s taxonID field.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - the Title for the resource. This title will appear as the name of the resource throughout the IPT. The title will also appear in the GBIF Registry, and form part of the citation. Please use a descriptive title for users of the dataset.  "Aves Tanzanian collection at the Natural History Museum of Denmark (SNM)" is a good title, "aves_tz_snm" is not! Avoid using filenames or acronyms known only within your organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publishing Organization</strong> - the organization responsible for publishing (producing, releasing, holding) this resource. It will be used as the resource&#8217;s rights holder and publishing organization when registering this resource with GBIF and when submitting metadata during DOI registrations. It will also be used to auto-generate the citation for the resource (if auto-generation is turned on), so consider the prominence of the role. If the desired organization does not appear in the list it may be added by the IPT Administrator (see the information under the "Configure Organizations" heading in the "Administration Menu" section). Please be aware your selection cannot be changed after the resource has been either registered with GBIF or assigned a DOI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update Frequency</strong> - the frequency with which changes are made to the resource after the initial resource has been published. For convenience, its value will default to the auto-publishing interval (if auto-publishing has been turned on), however, it can always be overridden later. Please note a description of the maintenance frequency of the resource can also be entered on the Additional Metadata page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Type</strong> - the type of resource. The value of this field depends on the core mapping of the resource and is no longer editable if the Darwin Core mapping has already been made. If a desired type is not found in the list, the field "other" can be selected. Review the information under the "Configure Core Types and Extensions" heading of the "Administration Menu" section.</p>

<p><strong>Metadata Language</strong> - the language in which the metadata are written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Language</strong> - the language in which the data for the resource are written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data License</strong> - the licence that you apply to the resource. The license provides a standardized way to define appropriate uses of your work. GBIF encourages publishers to adopt the least restrictive licence possible from among three (default) machine-readable options (CC0 1.0, CC-BY 4.0 or CC-BY-NC 4.0) to encourage the widest possible use and application of data. Learn more about GBIF&#8217;s policy <a href="http://www.gbif.org/terms/licences">here</a>. If you feel unable to select one of the three options, please contact the GBIF Secretariat at <a href="mailto:participation@gbif.org">participation@gbif.org</a>. To find out how to apply a license at the record-level, refer to the <a href="applying-license" class="xref page">How To Apply a License To a Dataset</a> section.

<p>The current primary resource data as configured through mapping are written to the Darwin Core Archive file named dwca.zip. The data files in the Darwin Core Archive are then validated (see "Data Validation" section below).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After writing, the IPT also validates their content in the following ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a column representing the core record identifier (e.g. occurrenceID is the core record identifier of the Occurrence core) is found in the core data file, the IPT will validate that for each record, the core record identifier is present, and unique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Darwin Core term <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#basisOfRecord">basisOfRecord</a> is a required term in the Occurrence extension. Therefore the IPT validates that each Occurrence data file has a basisOfRecord column. In addition, the IPT validates that for each Occurrence record the basisOfRecord is present, and its value matches the <a href="https://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/dwc/basis_of_record_2022-02-02.xml">Darwin Core Type vocabulary</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Ensure that the <strong>IPT resource&#8217;s</strong> visibility is public and NOT registered.</p>

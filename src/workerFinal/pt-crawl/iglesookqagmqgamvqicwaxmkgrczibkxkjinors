<p align="left">
A project team of librarians and faculty members of eight higher institutions in Hong Kong, with the University Librarian of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University as the principal investigator, has been awarded a grant from The University Grants Committee (UGC) in 2015 to work on a three-year project entitled "Enhancing information literacy in Hong Kong higher education through the development and implementation of shared interactive multimedia courseware".
</p>
 
<p align="left">
Even though it is an international trend to integrate information literacy (IL) into the university curriculum, it is not yet a standard practice in Hong Kong.  Previous studies largely revealed that Hong Kong students, from freshmen to postgraduates, have a tendency to rely heavily on quick web information for research, and lack awareness and capability to evaluate information and acknowledge sources.
</p>

<p align="left">
A large scale study of students' information behaviour across all eight government funded institutions will be first conducted. The assessment of IL educational needs will form a knowledge base guiding the development of an evidence-based shared multimedia courseware. Based on authentic scenarios, the IL courseware will create an engaging learning experience to challenge misconceptions and to reinforce IL concepts tailored for different subject disciplines.
</p>
 
<p align="left">
To deepen IL embedment, a professional capacity building programme will be organised to aid librarians from participating institutions in building collaborative partnerships with faculties. Course Enhancement Funds will also be set up for individual faculties to work with librarians for embedding IL elements into the curricula.
</p>

<p align="left">
Through implementing and promoting the IL courseware, the project aims to enhance IL among Hong Kong university students and strives to bring about a paradigm shift to a valuing of IL among university management and faculty, as well as in-depth embedment of IL into the university curricula.
</p>

<p align="left">
The full project summary will be uploaded by UGC at a later date at <a href="http://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/activity/teach/teach.htm">http://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/activity/teach/teach.htm</a>.

<p align="left">
In February 2015 a group of individuals came together to explore and try to solve some of the issues facing small and specialist institutions who are trying to figure out how to build up infrastructure and expertise around research data preservation and sharing. Facilitated by the <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Joint Information Services Committee</a> (JISC) and their '<a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/research-at-risk">Research at Risk</a>' / '<a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/research-data-spring">Research Data Spring</a>' initiatives, the team that eventually formed includes a policy advisor and historian (representing the <a href="http://www.crest.ac.uk/about/">Consortium for Research Excellence, Support and Training</a> (CREST) / <a href="http://www.nua.ac.uk/">Norwich University of the Arts</a>), a programme manager for digital infrastructure (<a href="http://www.uca.ac.uk/">University for the Creative Arts</a>), a research officer and a director of information services (from <a href="http://www.leedstrinity.ac.uk/">Leeds Trinity University</a>), a developer of digital archives and research technologies (from <a href="http://ulcc.ac.uk/">University of London Computing Services</a> (ULCC)) and a chief technology officer (<a href="http://arkivum.com/">Arkivum</a>). 
</p>

<p align="left">
Drawing on their combined expertise, in the (very compressed &#150; March to June 2015) <a href="http://www.crest.ac.uk/welcome-to-the-crest-rdms-project-blog/">Stage 1</a> of the project, the team set out to investigate the following under the project heading: 'A Consortial Approach to Research Data Management':
</p>


<ul type="disc">
	<li>the policy landscape and what this means for small and specialist institutions attempting to meet funders' requirements;</li>
	<li class="spacetop">the current state of play vis-&#224;-vis existing commercial and open source systems (including those that CREST institutions had already engaged with, and those they were considering implementing); </li>
	<li class="spacetop">the barriers to entry, both for researchers operating in a variety of disciplines, and for institutions; and </li>
	<li class="spacetop">whether a shared and/or integrated service is viable solution.</li>
</ul>


<p align="left">
The group began with a <a href="http://www.crest.ac.uk/survey-drilling-down-into-the-drivers-for-rdms/">survey</a> of current policy and provision, and then instituted a series of consultative seminars and workshops designed to pin down current need, engaging with repository and research data managers from a wide group of art, design and media specialists, as well as Heads of Research from the 22-member CREST Research Group. From these consultations emerged a series of <a href="http://www.crest.ac.uk/project-reports-and-case-studies/">reports and case studies</a>, all made available through a series of blogs and on 
Open Access platforms.
</p>

<p align="left">
The project has now moved into Stage 2 (running from July until December 2015) wherein systems responding the Stage 1 spec focusing on workflows and interfaces are being built and tested, working towards a Proof of Concept. In addition, the CREST Research Group is considering the potential for a shared resource &#151; in the person of a Research Data Manager who looks after the overarching CREST system, and will support dissemination and engagement with the academic community &#151; thereby expanding the potential of the shared infrastructure. Concurrently the team has continued to engage in grass-roots discussions with researchers and developers, alongside national policy <a href="http://www.crest.ac.uk/open-research-data-policy-and-practice/">consultations</a> about what constitutes research data beyond the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.

The Clipper project (<a href="http://blog.clippertube.com/">blog</a>) is developing a free and open source software toolkit to support researchers and creative practitioners in all disciplines who work with digital audio-visual media; to do this we are adopting a collaborative co-design methodology to inform and shape this work. We are very interested in the implications of Clipper for creative practice, research, (co)authoring, new publishing models, data management and policy development. The technical work for the project is now well advanced and, along with researchers and creative arts practitioners, we have been getting strong interest across a wide range of digital service providers such as archives and libraries. We are are keen get input from as wide a range of stakeholder as possible to inform the future directions of our work, and we would be very grateful for any feedback and comment from D-Lib readers, who represent a key constituency.
</p>

<p align="left">
The current prototype is available online together with instructional videos for interested parties to try out at this web link: <a href="http://blog.clippertube.com/index.php/clipper-prototype-3/">http://blog.clippertube.com/index.php/clipper-prototype-3/</a>. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Here is a brief overview of the toolkit functionality taken from our <a href="http://blog.clippertube.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clipper-brochure-a4.pdf">brochure</a>: 
</p>

<p class="indentQuote">
"Clipper is a free open-source web application enabling researchers to create and share virtual-clips without altering the original media files. Clipper enables you to mark the start and end of interesting events while playing audio or video data files through a standard web browser. You can add rich text annotations to each clip (pinned to points on the timeline), and combine clips into playlists (cliplists)."
</p>

<p align="left">
This 'user generated data' is stored as metadata in HTML documents, which <b>point to</b> the source audio / video files and is viewable in any modern web browser. The end-user will only be able to play the original audio / video files if they have the rights to access them, <b>vital</b> for complying with copyright and data protection issues. Thus, although the Clipper documents are owned by the user, the original media stays where it is. Because the native file format of Clipper is HTML, Clipper documents are very portable, social-media-friendly and easy to integrate into existing systems.
</p>

<p align="left">
The choice of HTML for the native system data file format is starting to bring big benefits and we are still exploring the implications and opportunities connected with this decision &#150; one of the advantages being that user can 'own' their clipper documents and place them where they like for reuse. Besides being stored in HTML documents, the Clipper data is also stored in a database and in <a href="http://www.json.org/">Json</a> data format. We think this this provides a system that may play a useful role in long-term access and preservation strategies.
</p>

<p align="left">
So far, at workshops at the British Library (<a href="http://blog.clippertube.com/index.php/london-workshop-261015/">http://blog.clippertube.com/index.php/london-workshop-261015/</a>) and the National Library of Scotland (<a href="http://blog.clippertube.com/index.php/edinburgh-workshop-28915/">http://blog.clippertube.com/index.php/edinburgh-workshop-28915/</a>), discussions have revealed a wide range of possible applications for Clipper including:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Analysing and marking up ethnographical recordings 'in the field' offline (as local media) prior to upload to a server for sharing and collaboration</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Identifying key incidents in time lapse recordings from scientific microscopes</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Exporting Clipper data as CSV files to allow analysis and visualisation of the data</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Crowdsourcing metadata creation for audio-visual collections</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Facilitating 'deep-access' to digital archives to facilitate citizen research</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Providing story-telling and narratives tools to incorporate digital archive content</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Making it easy to cite, quote and comment audio-visual media and data in digital academic communications &#150; putting it on an equal footing with text.</li>
</ul>


<p align="left">
We are keen to further explore and identify opportunities and benefits for researchers, data managers, archivists, librarians, educators and general users &#150; to include them in the design and development process.

</p>

<p align="left">
OCLC is working with several leading libraries on a pilot project to learn more about how linked data services will influence future library workflows.
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Person Entity Lookup Pilot</b>
</p>

<p align="left">
The Person Entity Lookup pilot will help library professionals reduce redundant data by linking related sets of person identifiers and authorities. Pilot participants will evaluate new services to access WorldCat Person Entities, represented by over 100 million brief descriptions of authors, directors, musicians and others that have been mined from WorldCat, the world's largest database of library metadata.
</p>

<p align="left">
The pilot project began in September 2015, with the first service for evaluation launched in October, and is expected to wrap up in early 2016. The initial participating libraries include Cornell University, Harvard University, the Library of Congress, the National Library of Germany, the National Library of Medicine, the National Library of Poland, Stanford University, and the University of California, Davis. Additional participants will be added in December.
</p>

<p align="left">
"This pilot will allow us to gain important feedback from key library partners so we can determine how services might be developed to meet library needs," said Mary Sauer-Games, OCLC Vice President, Product Management. "This is an important step in our commitment to working with libraries to understand their workflow requirements as they begin to work with linked data."
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>First phase: "sameAs" data via Entity Lookup</b>
</p>

<p align="left">
The first service being evaluated in the pilot project uses a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a person to find a matching Person Entity, and returns the associated WorldCat Person Entity URI and other identifiers for that same person. The service leverages an index of "sameAs" relationships in the WorldCat Person description so matches can be found with a variety of URIs, including VIAF, ISNI, Wikidata, DNB, NDL, and many more. Responses are returned in a range of common Resource Description Framework (RDF) serializations, based on the client's preferences.
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Second phase: Search for Person Entities</b>
</p>

<p align="left">
In the second phase of the pilot project, to begin later this year, participants will evaluate a service that will search for matching entities, given a string representing a form of the person's name. We expect the search service to be useful to participants that lack authority identifiers in their data or need to match against other person entities represented in WorldCat.
</p>

<p align="left">
The service will search for matching strings and will respond with any associated WorldCat Person Entity URIs. The response will also include string labels for disambiguation purposes, which could be used for an auto-suggest feature or supplement to a browsing interface.

<p>October 29, 2015 &#151; &quot;Indiana University officially marked the establishment of an ambitious initiative aimed at preserving the university's extensive collection of audio, video and film holdings with a ceremony Oct. 21 at the Indiana Memorial Union.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The <a href="https://mdpi.iu.edu/">IU Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative</a> will preserve IU's rare and, in some cases, irreplaceable collections of 635,000 sound, video and films recordings, currently stored in 50 formats housed in 80 units across the IU Bloomington, IUPUI and regional campuses....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...First announced in the president's 2013 State of the University address, the initiative will receive $15 million over the next five years from the offices of the president, the provost and the vice president for research. It will be led by Carolyn Walters, Ruth Lilly Dean of University Libraries, and Brad Wheeler, vice president for information technology and chief technology officer at IU and interim dean of the IU School of Informatics and Computing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ambitious goal of the initiative will be to digitize, preserve and make universally available &#150; consistent with copyright or other legal restrictions &#150; all of the most critical media objects judged important by experts across the university's eight campuses by IU's bicentennial in 2020.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">New research highlights libraries' expanded roles

</p>

<p align="left">
<i><b>From health insurance seekers to students, libraries leverage expertise, digital services</b></i>
</p>

<p>October 14, 2015 &#151; &quot;A majority of our nation's nearly 17,000 public libraries provide programs to help identify health insurance resources and also training to increase familiarity with new technologies, according to a new study from the American Library Association (ALA). This year's Digital Inclusion Survey caps two decades of research on public libraries and the internet and the expanded roles libraries are playing in their communities....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Digital content offerings also continue to climb, with more than 90 percent of public libraries offering e-books, online homework assistance (95 percent) and online language learning (56 percent), to name a few. A recent survey from library ebook supplier OverDrive finds that more than 120 million e-books and audiobooks were borrowed from libraries they supply in the first nine months of 2015, representing year-over-year growth of almost 20 percent....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Funded by the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a> and managed by the ALA <a href="http://www.ala.org/ors">Office for Research &amp; Statistics</a> and the <a href="http://ipac.umd.edu/">Information Policy and Access Center</a> at the University of Maryland, the Digital Inclusion Study provides national- and state-level data. The <a href="http://www.icma.org/">International City/County Management Association</a> and ALA <a href="http://www.ala.org/oitp">Office for Information Technology Policy</a> are partners in the research effort....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...One in five public libraries has renovated buildings in the past five years, and two-thirds of all libraries upgraded technology infrastructure in the past 24 months. The most common renovations were to upgrade electrical or network capacity and enhance or add general spaces in the library. The most common technology upgrades were to replace computers or increase bandwidth. In all cases, however, rural libraries significantly lag their counterparts in larger population areas. While broadband capacity is inching up, 15 percent of rural libraries still have subscribed download speeds of 1.5 Mbps or less. Overall 82 percent of libraries (and 96 percent of rural libraries) fall below the minimum 100 Mbps broadband capacity <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/page/summary-e-rate-modernization-order">recommended</a> by the Federal Communications Commission.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">OCLC prints last library catalog cards</p>

<p>October 1, 2015 &#151; &quot;OCLC printed its last library catalog cards October 1, officially closing the book on what was once a familiar resource for generations of information seekers who now use computer catalogs and online search engines to access library collections. The final print run marked the end of a service that has steadily decreased over the past few decades as libraries moved their catalogs online. During the 44-year run of automated catalog card production, OCLC printed more than 1.9 billion cards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This final print run marked the end of a service that has steadily decreased over the past few decades as libraries have moved their catalogs online....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...OCLC built the world's first online shared cataloging system in 1971 and, over decades, merged the catalogs of thousands libraries through a computer network and database. That database, now known as WorldCat, not only made it possible for libraries to catalog cooperatively, but also to share resources held in other libraries on the network.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">CLIR Receives IMLS Grant to Assess National Digital Stewardship Residency Programs</p>

<p>September 22, 2015 &#151; &quot;The Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) has awarded the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) $172,996 to assess the impact of five related National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) initiatives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Between 2012 and 2015, the IMLS Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program funded a series of five projects designed to build capacity in the information services and cultural heritage professions for the collection, management, preservation, and distribution of digital assets to the American public. By the summer of 2016, 35 recent graduates of master's programs in library and information science (LIS) and related fields will have completed working residencies at leading U.S. institutions in the field of digital stewardship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;During the coming year, a research team led by former CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow Meridith Beck Sayre will gather data through interviews, site visits, and a survey in order to evaluate the significance of the residency experience for the residents and their host institutions, identify the differences among the five projects and the perceived effects of those differences on the residents, and articulate the factors common to successful and productive residencies. In late 2016, the team will produce a report with recommendations for future initiatives that build on the work of the residents and their mentors. The report will be published by CLIR at the conclusion of the project.&quot;</p>

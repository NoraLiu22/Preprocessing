            <font size="3">
            The Ryerson Index is a free index to death notices appearing in
            Australian newspapers. The date range covered extends from the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>
            of 1803 up to newspapers published within the last week or so.
            The Index also includes many funeral notices, and some probate notices and obituaries.
            <P>
	    In 2020, we commenced indexing notices from Funeral Directors' websites. This was in response to the mass closures of regional newspapers which occured in the second quarter of 2020.  
	    <P>
            Because the Index was originally created by the Sydney Dead Persons Society,
            its strength lies in notices from NSW papers - including in
            excess of two million notices from the <i>Sydney Morning
            Herald</i> alone. However, the representation
            from sources in other states continues to grow, with additional papers and funeral directors being
            regularly added, so that the Index can now truly be considered an Australian index.
            <P>
            Indexing is being continuously carried out by a team of volunteers,
            too numerous to mention individually, who give freely of their time to
            ensure the site continues to grow. Site updates generally occur weekly.
            <P>
            The index itself cannot by definition be considered a primary source of data,
            but is purely a research aid to direct the researcher to the original source
            of a notice. We at Ryerson cannot undertake genealogical research for you, we are too busy indexing!

					<HR>
					<b>19 December 2023</b><p>We are pleased to announce that we will be adding the 
					Queensland and Northern Territory Probate Indexes to Ryerson, commencing from 
					the beginning of January 2024. A future project is planned to back-index 
					Queensland from their online commencement in 2012, but the NT process of 
					removing their entries from the index once the grant has been made means 
					back-indexing for this Territory is not possible.  
					<HR>
					<b>28 June 2023</b><p>Today we added our <b>9 millionth</b> record to Ryerson. This 
					was also our quickest million ever, taking only 596 days. With such a dedicated 
					and enthusiastic team of volunteers, we are now aiming to have ten million records 
					sometime in 2025. 	
	     				<HR>
					<b>7 October 2022</b><p>We have now completed adding the online version of the NSW 
					Probate Index into Ryerson (approx 280,000 records). This covers the period from 
					21 Jan 2013 to date, and more than makes up for the loss of regional 
					and suburban newspapers in NSW, due to the closures in 2020. Further files will 
					be added as part of our regular updates, as they become available. 
					<HR>
					<b>26 January 2022</b><p>We have now turned on the ability to display ALL entries 
					from a specific newspaper or Funeral Director which has no more than 
					20,000 entries in Ryerson. This covers more than 90% of the sources we index.

		<H3><CENTER>INDEXING of DIGITAL-ONLY NOTICES</CENTER></H3>
		<font size="3">
		<p>Ryerson has just undergone the biggest change to the Ryerson indexing methodology in our 22 years of existence. As well as printed newspapers, 
		we now index notices published in digital-only format on the major publisher's websites, and on a growing number of funeral director's websites. 
		We believe our approach is the correct one 
		to bring more information on Australian death and funeral notices than ever before to the attention of Australian researchers.
		<p>This change was brought about by the large number of Australian papers (predominantly those published by ACM and News Corp) becoming digital-only, or 
		ceasing production altogether, during 2020.    
		<p>Because there is no "newspaper" associated with digital-only notices, we have chosen to identify them in the Ryerson search results by a standard 
		name unique to each publisher. In the case of News Corp (the only publisher with easily-accessible digital-only notices at this stage), search results will be listed 
		with a "publication" name of "News Corp Digital Notices". Others will be added as required.       
		<p>Funeral Director's notices are identified by the individual funeral director's name, and the coverage page for each funeral director 
		provides a link to their website, so that the original notice may be sought out.
		<p>We hope all our loyal users approve of this change. We believe everyone will benefit, as we are now able to increase our coverage of contemporary 
		death information to include many notices which would not have appeared in traditional print publications.

                  the notices from their local paper or funeral director. We find members of

                  know their local area and the names associated with it,
                  and usually have a personal interest in the notices
                  they are indexing.

                <FONT SIZE=3>
                On 16 January 2016, and without any warning to users, News Corp removed all their newspapers
                from Library PressDisplay (LPD). LPD is the web service whereby NLA and the various State Libraries
                provide online versions of newspapers via their eResources sites, with up to 12 months of back issues available.
                Both current editions and all back issues were removed.
                <p>The absence of News Corp papers in LPD will make it more difficult for us to keep these
                papers up to date. We will no longer be able to index the notices from News Corp papers remotely,
                but will now require local indexers with access to the printed edition. It will take us a
                while to find and train these indexers, but rest assured we will continue to index all the major
                Australian papers. Please keep an eye on our "Indexing Vacancies" box below to see how you can help.
                <p>If you are as annoyed at News Corp's action as we are, please contact your local News Corp paper and express your disapproval.

            Is your local paper currently included in Ryerson? If not,
            then why not take on the task of indexing the notices for
            us?
            <P>
            Do you have access to a library or other repository which has
            microfilm copies of newspapers available? We are always in
            need of people who can copy notices for us to index.
            <P>
            If you can help, please contact us via the link at the left of the screen.

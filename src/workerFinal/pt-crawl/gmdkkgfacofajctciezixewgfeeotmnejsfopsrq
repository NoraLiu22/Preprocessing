So let me explain. I&rsquo;m part of a team that built a life-sized model of<i> Tyrannosaurus rex</i>&nbsp;and then cut it up. The spectacle is a bloody, gory two-hour television special called&nbsp;<i>T</i>.<i>rex</i>&nbsp;Autopsy. The premise may seem absurd. But this is a whole new way of communicating science to the public, and it has been one of the highlights of my career.</p><hr/><h2 class="article__block-KZIY9">On supporting science journalism</h2><p class="article__block-KZIY9">If you&#x27;re enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

I&rsquo;ve dug up&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;fossils in the western United States, travelled the world studying tyrannosaur bones in museums, and described some of&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&rsquo;s closest cousins. It&rsquo;s a pretty cool job, but it comes with something of a peculiar annoyance. Sometimes I get strange people ringing me up with their pet theories on how dinosaurs evolved from space aliens, or emailing me long screeds about how dinosaurs never existed.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">I got an email like that last August from a television producer in London. At first it seemed like a joke: they wanted to autopsy a<i> T.rex</i>&nbsp;corpse in front of the cameras. Just another ambitious but insane young producer, I thought, wanting to make his mark in a television landscape where shows on Bigfoot and mermaids are now standard fare on networks that used to be dedicated to science programming.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">But I agreed to hear him out, and very quickly my opinion changed. They wanted to dissect a&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;alright, but by building the most scientifically accurate model possible, then using the pageantry of an autopsy to reveal how this most famous of dinosaurs actually functioned as a living, breathing, feeding, moving, growing animal.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">They needed a&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;expert to consult on the build of the model. I signed up immediately, along with several of my esteemed colleagues, and was later asked to expand my role and appear on-screen as one of the dissectors. That was how I found myself in the famous&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pinewoodgroup.com/our-studios/uk/pinewood-studios">Pinewood Studios</a>&nbsp;near London last April, next to where they were filming the new Bond movie, chopping up a 43-foot&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;with chainsaws, dripping with synthetic blood. Not a normal day at the office for an academic scientist who spends most of his time writing grants, advising students, and lecturing.</p><figure data-original-class="cms-video" class="article__image-EQ52t" data-block="sciam/image"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" class=" is-fluid" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6Uimaq9pcs" style="--w: 640; --h: 360; --w: 640; h: 360" title="Video player" width="640"></iframe></figure><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the end result. We&rsquo;ll probably be criticised by some internet cynics who feel we&rsquo;re trying to hoodwink the public into thinking this is a real tyrannosaur, or who disparage the whole idea of doing a dinosaur autopsy as too over-the-top. But that would be missing the point.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">We took the utmost care to make sure our tyrannosaur was completely in line with what we know from fossils. Everything we couldn&rsquo;t reconstruct from real fossils was informed speculation based on careful comparisons with living crocodiles,<a href="https://theconversation.com/take-a-t-rex-and-a-chicken-and-youll-see-how-dinosaurs-shrank-survived-and-evolved-into-birds-29996"> which are</a>&nbsp;close cousins of dinosaurs, and birds, which are their descendants. And having four real scientists (a vet and three paleontologists) conducting the autopsy, without a script, made it even more authentic.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">When I first walked into the autopsy room and saw the dinosaur, I was blown away. Yes I had consulted on the build, but the producers had deliberately prevented me from seeing the final model so I would be surprised. It was so realistic&mdash;pretty much how I think a real&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;would have looked&mdash;but made of latex, silicone, plastic, corn syrup, and various other goodies. What the artists made in four-and-a-half months and 10,000+ man hours is surely the most accurate and life-like dinosaur of all time.</p><figure data-original-class="cms-video" class="article__image-EQ52t" data-block="sciam/image"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" class=" is-fluid" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shBGtdqvLs4" style="--w: 640; --h: 360; --w: 640; h: 360" title="Video player" width="640"></iframe></figure><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Inside rex</b><br/>We go from head-to-tail on the dinosaur, cutting it up, talking about how each bit helps us understand&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;as a living animal; what it ate, how fast it moved, what injuries it suffered, what its metabolism was like and how quickly it grew, how it reproduced.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">So what exactly did we learn? If you thought dinosaurs were dim-witted, overgrown reptiles, think again.&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;had a huge brain, its eyesight was keen, it had feathers and it grew really fast. It was essentially a huge fluffy bird from hell.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Some of my favourite moments were spent inside the belly of the beast, as we removed the super-sized internal organs. We don&rsquo;t know much about dinosaur hearts and lungs and stomachs, because these soft parts don&rsquo;t easily fossilise. But they can leave signatures on the bones, and we can use birds and crocodiles for plausible speculation. That&rsquo;s how we designed the size, shape, and position of the guts in our model.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">The organs were remarkably life-like, and I say this as somebody who has dissected a lot of animals. In particular, the suitcase-sized heart really looked and felt like it had just been cut from a real&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;cadaver. The heart had four chambers inside, just like a bird, a sign of high metabolism and consistent with evidence from bones that&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;was a dynamic, fast-growing animal.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">The lungs had balloon-like extensions called air-sacs. These store air during the breathing cycle to make the lungs extra efficient, also just like birds. We know about these from the traces the air-sacs have left on&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;bones. The stomach was also incredibly bird-like, with two chambers. This isn&rsquo;t total speculation either: there is one spectacularly preserved tyrannosaur fossil with stomach contents that helped us in our design.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">It&rsquo;s easy to think of&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;as a monster, a villain in movies, a terror in our nightmares. But it was a real living breathing animal, a great lost wonder of the world. If our programme gives people a sense of what this creature was really like, it will have been well worth the hard work.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><i>T.rex Autopsy is on the&nbsp;</i><a href="https://channel.nationalgeographic.com/"><i>National Geographic Channel</i></a><i>.</i></p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><i>This article was originally published on&nbsp;</i><a href="http://theconversation.com/"><i>The Conversation</i></a><i>.

So let me explain. I&rsquo;m part of a team that built a life-sized model of<i> Tyrannosaurus rex</i>&nbsp;and then cut it up. The spectacle is a bloody, gory two-hour television special called&nbsp;<i>T</i>.<i>rex</i>&nbsp;Autopsy. The premise may seem absurd. But this is a whole new way of communicating science to the public, and it has been one of the highlights of my career."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"I&rsquo;m a paleontologist who has been studying dinosaurs for more than a decade. I&rsquo;ve dug up&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;fossils in the western United States, travelled the world studying tyrannosaur bones in museums, and described some of&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&rsquo;s closest cousins. It&rsquo;s a pretty cool job, but it comes with something of a peculiar annoyance. Sometimes I get strange people ringing me up with their pet theories on how dinosaurs evolved from space aliens, or emailing me long screeds about how dinosaurs never existed."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"I got an email like that last August from a television producer in London. At first it seemed like a joke: they wanted to autopsy a<i> T.rex</i>&nbsp;corpse in front of the cameras. Just another ambitious but insane young producer, I thought, wanting to make his mark in a television landscape where shows on Bigfoot and mermaids are now standard fare on networks that used to be dedicated to science programming."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"But I agreed to hear him out, and very quickly my opinion changed. They wanted to dissect a&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;alright, but by building the most scientifically accurate model possible, then using the pageantry of an autopsy to reveal how this most famous of dinosaurs actually functioned as a living, breathing, feeding, moving, growing animal."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"They needed a&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;expert to consult on the build of the model. I signed up immediately, along with several of my esteemed colleagues, and was later asked to expand my role and appear on-screen as one of the dissectors. That was how I found myself in the famous&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.pinewoodgroup.com/our-studios/uk/pinewood-studios\\">Pinewood Studios</a>&nbsp;near London last April, next to where they were filming the new Bond movie, chopping up a 43-foot&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;with chainsaws, dripping with synthetic blood. Not a normal day at the office for an academic scientist who spends most of his time writing grants, advising students, and lecturing."},{"tag":"figure","type":"image","attributes":{"class":"cms-video"},"content":"<iframe allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" class=\\" is-fluid\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"360\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6Uimaq9pcs\\" style=\\"--w: 640; --h: 360; --w: 640; h: 360\\" title=\\"Video player\\" width=\\"640\\"></iframe>"},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the end result. We&rsquo;ll probably be criticised by some internet cynics who feel we&rsquo;re trying to hoodwink the public into thinking this is a real tyrannosaur, or who disparage the whole idea of doing a dinosaur autopsy as too over-the-top. But that would be missing the point."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"We took the utmost care to make sure our tyrannosaur was completely in line with what we know from fossils. Everything we couldn&rsquo;t reconstruct from real fossils was informed speculation based on careful comparisons with living crocodiles,<a href=\\"https://theconversation.com/take-a-t-rex-and-a-chicken-and-youll-see-how-dinosaurs-shrank-survived-and-evolved-into-birds-29996\\"> which are</a>&nbsp;close cousins of dinosaurs, and birds, which are their descendants. And having four real scientists (a vet and three paleontologists) conducting the autopsy, without a script, made it even more authentic."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"When I first walked into the autopsy room and saw the dinosaur, I was blown away. Yes I had consulted on the build, but the producers had deliberately prevented me from seeing the final model so I would be surprised. It was so realistic&mdash;pretty much how I think a real&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;would have looked&mdash;but made of latex, silicone, plastic, corn syrup, and various other goodies. What the artists made in four-and-a-half months and 10,000+ man hours is surely the most accurate and life-like dinosaur of all time."},{"tag":"figure","type":"image","attributes":{"class":"cms-video"},"content":"<iframe allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" class=\\" is-fluid\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"360\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/shBGtdqvLs4\\" style=\\"--w: 640; --h: 360; --w: 640; h: 360\\" title=\\"Video player\\" width=\\"640\\"></iframe>"},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"<b>Inside rex</b><br/>We go from head-to-tail on the dinosaur, cutting it up, talking about how each bit helps us understand&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;as a living animal; what it ate, how fast it moved, what injuries it suffered, what its metabolism was like and how quickly it grew, how it reproduced."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"So what exactly did we learn? If you thought dinosaurs were dim-witted, overgrown reptiles, think again.&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;had a huge brain, its eyesight was keen, it had feathers and it grew really fast. It was essentially a huge fluffy bird from hell."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"Some of my favourite moments were spent inside the belly of the beast, as we removed the super-sized internal organs. We don&rsquo;t know much about dinosaur hearts and lungs and stomachs, because these soft parts don&rsquo;t easily fossilise. But they can leave signatures on the bones, and we can use birds and crocodiles for plausible speculation. That&rsquo;s how we designed the size, shape, and position of the guts in our model."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"The organs were remarkably life-like, and I say this as somebody who has dissected a lot of animals. In particular, the suitcase-sized heart really looked and felt like it had just been cut from a real&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;cadaver. The heart had four chambers inside, just like a bird, a sign of high metabolism and consistent with evidence from bones that&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;was a dynamic, fast-growing animal."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"The lungs had balloon-like extensions called air-sacs. These store air during the breathing cycle to make the lungs extra efficient, also just like birds. We know about these from the traces the air-sacs have left on&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;bones. The stomach was also incredibly bird-like, with two chambers. This isn&rsquo;t total speculation either: there is one spectacularly preserved tyrannosaur fossil with stomach contents that helped us in our design."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"It&rsquo;s easy to think of&nbsp;<i>T.rex</i>&nbsp;as a monster, a villain in movies, a terror in our nightmares. But it was a real living breathing animal, a great lost wonder of the world. If our programme gives people a sense of what this creature was really like, it will have been well worth the hard work."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"<i>T.rex Autopsy is on the&nbsp;</i><a href=\\"https://channel.nationalgeographic.com/\\"><i>National Geographic Channel</i></a><i>.</i>"},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"<i>This article was originally published on&nbsp;</i><a href=\\"http://theconversation.com/\\"><i>The Conversation</i></a><i>.

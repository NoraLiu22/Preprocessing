</ul>

<p>During the First World War, some Batswana served overseas in France with 
the unarmed South African Native Labour Contingent. But the most powerful 
chief, Kgosi Khama III of the Bangwato, boycotted recruitment for that force.</p> 

<p>In 1939 Bechuanaland automatically declared war on Germany with Great 
Britain, while the Union of South Africa initially refused and became 
potential enemy territory. There was chiefly resistance when, in early 
1941, the call went out again for unarmed "native labourers" to join 
the South African detachments fighting under the British in Egypt. 
Instead, the chiefs were very willing to provide men for the British 
Army–to be given firearms training as well as providing labour. 
The result was the formation of Bechuana, Basuto and Swazi companies 
for an African Pioneer Corps within the British Army - with about 10,000 men 
from Bechuanaland, about twice that number from Basutoland, and about a 
third of that from Swaziland.</p>

<p>Training began at Lobatse in July 1941, and the first Bechuana companies 
for the coast by train in September 1941. Once they were in the Middle-East, 
the African Pioneer Corps proved its worth in building roads and 
fortifications against potential Nazi invasion and in guarding camps. 
The more senior companies were then engaged by other sections of the 
British Army - and some were subsequently attached to the United States Army. 
They served as heavy artillery gunners, specialist bridge-builders, 
camouflage smoke-makers, drivers and mechanics, and front-line supply 
store shifters. </p>

<p>Those who went to Italy saw the most military action, year by year across 
the mountains from Sicily to as far as the borders of Austria and Jugoslavia, 
including one of the most intense battles of the Second World War - at 
Monte Cassino (known in Setswana as Marumong, the place of bullets).</p> 

<p>Men from Bechuanaland also went in roughly equal numbers to work in 
South Africa, which was booming with new factories that replaced imports 
and manufactured war materials. The impoverished Bechuanaland colonial 
administration invested what it could in disease control and livestock 
improvement, and required the chiefs to boost agriculture with compulsory 
mass labour on masotla (royal fields then known as "warlands").</p> 

<p>Post-war promises of local development were not fulfilled. Bechuanaland 
Protectorate reverted to its pre-war role as impoverished appendage of 
South Africa. But there was one final flourish of the old wartime 
partnership between the British crown and the people of Bechuanaland, 
in 1947, when King George VI of Britain came visiting with his 
family - to thank the people, and especially the soldiers, for their 
wartime service. </p>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern geological research has rendered it almost 
          certain, that the same causes which produced the various formations 
          with their imbedded fossils, have continued to act down to the present 
          day. It has therefore become possible that, by means of changes which 
          are known to have occurred in a given number of years, some measurement 
          of the time represented by the whole series of geological formations 
          might be obtained. It is true, that changes in the earth's surface, 
          the records of which constitute the materials for geological research, 
          occur very slowly, yet not so slowly as to be quite imperceptible in 
          historical time. Land has risen or sunk beneath the sea, rivers have 
          deepened their channels and have brought down sediment which has converted 
          water into land, cliffs have been eaten away and the surface of the 
          earth has been, in many ways, perceptibly and measurably altered during 
          an ascertained number of centuries. But it is found that these changes 
          are too minute, too limited and too uncertain, to afford the basis of 
          even an approximate measurement of the time required for those grand 
          mutations of sea and land, those contortions of rocky strata many thousands 
          of feet thick, those upheavals of mountain-chains and that elaborate 
          modelling of the surface into countless hills and valleys, with long 
          inland escarpments and deep rock-bound gorges, which form the most prominent 
          and most universal characteristics of the earth's superficial structure. 
          Another deficiency in this mode of measurement arises from the fact, 
          now universally admitted, that the record of past changes is excessively 
          imperfect, so that even if we could estimate with tolerable accuracy 
          the time required to deposit and upheave the series of strata of which 
          we have any knowledge; still that estimate would only represent an unknown 
          proportion, perhaps a minute fraction of the whole time which has elapsed 
          since the strata began to be formed. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is another class of geological phenomena 

          which enable us to measure those very gaps in the record of which we 

          have just spoken, and it is now generally admitted that the continual 

          change of the forms of animal and vegetable life which each succeeding 

          formation presents to us, affords the best means of estimating the proportionate 

          length of geological epochs. Though we have no reason to think that 

          this change was at all times effected by a uniform and regular process; 

          yet believing, as we now do, that it was due to the action of a vast 

          number and variety of natural causes acting and reacting on each other, 

          according to fixed general laws, it seems probable that, with much local 

          and temporary irregularity, there has been on the whole a considerable 

          degree of uniformity in the rate at which organic forms have become 

          modified. It may indeed be the case that this rate of variation has 

          continually increased or diminished from the first appearance of life 

          upon the earth until the present day, or has been subject to temporary 

          changes; but so long as we have no proof that such was the case, we 

          shall be safer in considering that the change has been tolerably uniform.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To measure geological time, therefore, all we require 

          is a trustworthy unit of measurement for the change of species: but 

          this is exactly what we have not yet been able to get; for the whole 

          length of the historical period has not produced the slightest perceptible 

          change in any living thing in a state of nature. Moreover, though, the 

          much longer time that has elapsed since the Neolithic or Newer Stone 

          age, has been sufficient for some changes of physical geography and 

          has, to some extent, altered the distribution of animals and plants, 

          it has not effected any alteration in their form. It is only when we 

          get back to the Pal&aelig;olithic or Older Stone age, when men used 

          chipped flints for weapons and Europe was, probably, either just emerging 

          from the severity of the glacial epoch, or in some of the intercalated 

          milder periods, that we meet with a decided change in the forms of life. 

          Elephants and rhinoceroses, bears, lions and hyenas then inhabited Europe; 

          but they were nearly all of species slightly different from any now 

          existing, while the reindeer, the musk-sheep, the lemming and some other 

          animals, were the same as those that still live in the Arctic regions: 

          all the mollusca, however, were identical with living species. In the 

          newer Pliocene Crag, on the other hand, which seems to have been deposited 

          just as the glacial epoch was coming on, there are 11 per cent. of extinct 

          species of shells and about 55 per cent. of extinct mammalia. What we 

          want, therefore, is to be able to estimate, by means of the physical 

          changes before alluded to, the time since the beginning or the end of 

          the glacial epoch. Then we should have the unit we require for measuring 

          geological time by the repeated changes in the forms of life as we go 

          further and further back into the past; but before showing how this 

          may perhaps be done, something must be said about physical and astronomical 

          determinations of the age of our globe.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago, Sir W. Thomson startled geologists 

          by placing a limit to the time at their disposal, which they had been 

          in the habit of regarding as practically infinite. He showed, from the 

          known laws of heat and the conservation of energy, that there are determinable 

          limits to the age of the sun. Then, applying the same principles to 

          the earth, he showed that, from the known increase of heat towards its 

          interior and from experiments on the rate of cooling of various rocks, 

          it cannot have existed in habitable state for more than about one hundred 

          million years. It is within that time, therefore, that the whole series 

          of geological changes, the origin and development of all forms of life, 

          must be comprised. But, geologists had been accustomed to demand a much 

          vaster period than this for the production of the series of fossiliferous 

          deposits in the crust of the earth; while the researches of Mr. Darwin 

          render it almost certain that, however vast the time since the Silurian 

          and Cambrian epochs, yet anterior to these, at least an equal, and probably 

          a much longer, series of ages must have elapsed since life first appeared 

          upon the earth, in order to allow for the slow development of the varied 

          and highly organised forms which we find in existence at those early 

          epochs. Sir Charles Lyell is not disposed to admit the accuracy of these 

          calculations, and Professor Huxley has criticised them in detail, with 

          a view of showing that they are, in many respects, unsound; while Mr. 

          Croll as strenuously maintains that they are sound in principle and 

          accurate within certain limits.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the bearing of Astronomy 
          upon the problem. In a series of admirable papers in the <i>Philosophical 
          Magazine</i>, Mr. Croll has fully discussed <font color="990000">[[p. 
          400]]</font> the question, how far variations in the excentricity of 
          the earth's orbit, together with the precession of the equinoxes, have 
          produced variations of climate in past ages. He has endeavoured to show 
          that the date of the last glacial epoch and those preceding, may be 
          determined by such considerations. With this view he has laboriously 
          calculated tables showing the amount of excentricity for a period of 
          three million years, at intervals of 10,000 years for a large portion 
          of that time, and 50,000 for the remainder. These tables show that the 
          amount of excentricity is alternately great and small at intervals of 
          50,000 or 100,000 years, as represented with sufficient accuracy in 
          the diagram, which I have constructed by means of his figures. Owing 
          to the precession of the equinoxes, combined with the revolution of 
          the apsides, either pole will be presented towards the sun (constituting 
          summer in that hemisphere and winter in the opposite one) at a different 
          point in the earth's orbit on each succeeding year, the motion being 
          such as to cause a complete revolution in 21,000 years. If, therefore, 
          at any one period, winter in the northern hemisphere occurs when the 
          earth is nearest the sun or in <i>perihelion</i> (as is the case now), 
          in 10,500 years it will occur in <i>aphelion</i>; at the one period 
          the winters will be shorter and warmer, at the other longer and colder. 
          When the excentricity is great (say two, three, or four times what it 
          is now), Mr. Croll shows that, from the known laws of heat in reference 
          to air and water, winter in <i>aphelion</i> will lead to an accumulation 
          of snow, in the polar regions, which the summer will not be able to 
          melt. This will go on increasing for many thousand years, till winter 
          occurs near the <i>perihelion</i>, when the snow will be melted and 
          transferred to the opposite pole. When the excentricity was very great 
          a glacial epoch would occur in each hemisphere for more or less than 
          10,500 years, the other portion of the period of 21,000 years being 
          occupied by an almost perpetual spring, with two transition periods 
          from that to the glacial epoch. By examining the diagram of excentricity, 
          we see that during the last three million years there have been more 
          than twelve periods of great excentricity, each long enough to admit 
          two or three, and several of them eight or ten, complete revolutions 
          of the equinoctial points, thus sufficing for the production of not 
          less than fifty or sixty glacial epochs in each hemisphere, with intervening 
          phases of perpetual spring or summer.</p>
<center><p><img src="../pics/S159.jpg" width="85%" height="auto" /></p></center>
          <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diagram also shows us (and this is of 

          very great importance) that the present amount of excentricity is exceptionally 

          small. During the last three million years there have only been five 

          occasions, always of very short duration, when it has been less than 

          it is now, while periods of high excentricity have often lasted for 

          two hundred thousand years at a time. This period of three million years 

          probably includes a large portion of the tertiary period, which therefore 

          should have mainly consisted of alternations of warm and cold climates 

          in each hemisphere, the latter generally forming true glacial epochs. 

          This seems the legitimate deduction from Mr. Croll's reasoning and from 

          the tables of excentricity with which he has furnished us; but, as he 

          very justly argues, we cannot expect to find geological evidence of 

          all these changes of climate. The warm and temperate periods will naturally 

          leave the best records, while the cold epochs will generally be characterised 

          only by an absence of organic remains. Besides, we must consider 10,500 

          years as a very small fragment of time in geology and we have good reason 

          for thinking that several such periods might pass away without the occurrence 

          of those exceptional conditions which Mr. Darwin and Sir C. Lyell have 

          shown to be necessary for the preservation of any geological record. 

          As to physical proofs of ice-action, very few could survive the repeated 

          denudations, upheavals and subsidences, which the surface must have 

          undergone since any of the earlier glacial epochs; so that it may be 

          fairly argued that these repeated changes of climate may have occurred 

          and yet have left no distinct record by which the geologist could interpret 

          their history. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the whole of his argument, Mr. Croll 
          considers astronomical causes to be the most important and effective 
          agents in modifying climate, while Sir Charles Lyell maintains that 
          the distribution of land and water, with their action on each other 
          by influencing marine and aerial currents, are of prepondering importance. 
          He has certainly shown that these causes have an immense influence at 
          the present time. The effects which, on Mr. Croll's theory, ought to 
          be produced by the existing phase of precession combined with even the 
          small amount of excentricity that now exists, is not only neutralised, 
          but actually reversed by terrestrial causes. Dove has shown that the 
          whole earth is really warmer when it is furthest from the sun in June, 
          than when it is nearest in December, a fact which is to be explained 
          by the northern hemisphere (turned toward the sun in June) having so 
          much more land than the southern. So, the northern hemisphere being 
          three millions of miles nearer the sun in winter than in summer, while 
          the southern hemisphere is the reverse, the northern winter ought to 
          be warmer and the northern summer cooler than the southern; but this, 
          too, is the opposite of the fact, for the southern summer is more than 
          11&deg; Fahr. cooler than ours, while its winter is nearly 5&deg; Fahr. 
          warmer. The immense differences of temperature of places in the same 
          latitude, sometimes amounting to nearly 30&deg; Fahr., can also be traced, 
          in almost every instance, to the distribution of land and water and 
          of winds and currents. Sir Charles Lyell further <font color="990000">[[p. 
          401]]</font> argues that the existing distribution of land is so extremely 
          irregular--such an undue proportion being near the poles, while there 
          is such a deficiency at the equator and in the south temperate zone--that 
          whatever differences may have occurred in past time, they can hardly 
          fail to have often been such as to cause a more uniform climate. Therefore 
          he believes that if the poles were tolerably free from land, so as to 
          admit of the uninterrupted circulation of the warmer equatorial waters 
          and to afford no lodgment for great accumulations of snow and ice, a 
          glacial epoch would be impossible even during the most extreme phases 
          of excentricity. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now much evidence to show that three distinct 

          modifications in physical geography occurred just before or during the 

          Glacial epoch, which would each tend to lower the temperature. The first 

          is the submergence of the Sahara, which would have caused the southerly 

          winds to be charged with aqueous vapour, condensing on the Alps into 

          snow instead of being, as now, dry and heated and acting powerfully 

          to melt the glaciers. The second is the submergence of Lapland, which 

          would have admitted the cold iceberg-laden waters of the Arctic Sea 

          into the very heart of Europe. The third is the probable submergence 

          of part of Central America, causing the Gulf Stream to be diverted into 

          the Pacific. The only proof of this is the fact that one-third of the 

          known species of marine fishes are absolutely identical on the two sides 

          of the isthmus of Panama; but it is impossible to conceive any means 

          by which such an amount of identity could have been brought about except 

          by a recent, if only a temporary, communication. A subsidence and elevation 

          no greater than what occurred in Wales about the same time--as proved 

          by Arctic shells of existing species in drift 1,300 feet above the sea--would 

          have effected the communication by a broad and deep channel. Now if 

          any two of these changes of physical geography occurred together, we 

          may be sure that a very small increase of excentricity would have led 

          to a more severe glacial epoch than would be possible, under existing 

          conditions, with a much larger excentricity. We must keep this in mind 

          when attempting to fix the most probable date for the last glacial epoch.</p>
<center><p><br /><font color="990000">[[p. 452]]</font> II.</p></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider an entirely distinct set 

          of facts which have an important bearing on the probable time elapsed 

          since the last glacial epoch. Messrs. A. Tylor, Croll, and Geikie have 

          shown that the amount of denudation now taking place is much greater 

          than has generally been supposed. The quantity of water discharged by 

          several rivers and the quantity of sediment carried down by those rivers 

          have been measured with tolerable accuracy, and allowing for the difference 

          of specific gravity between sediment and rock, it can be easily calculated, 

          from the known area of each river basin, what average thickness has 

          been removed from its whole surface in a year, since all the matter 

          brought down by the river must evidently have come from some part of 

          its basin. In this way it is found that the Mississippi has its basin 

          lowered 1/6000 of a foot per annum; the Ganges, 1/2358; the Rhone, 1/1526; 

          the Hoang-Ho, 1/1464; the Po, 1/729.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is evident that this amount will be distributed 

          very unequally over different parts of the basin, according as the surface 

          is flat or sloping, whether the slopes are of loose soil or of rock, 

          whether the rock is solid or friable. The perfectly flat alluvial plains 

          that form a considerable part of many river basins, will not only suffer 

          no denudation, but will generally receive deposits of sediment during 

          floods, and all such flat lands should therefore be deducted from the 

          area of the river. Slightly undulating lands, especially if well covered 

          with forest, will also suffer scarcely any denudation, as is well seen 

          in the case of the Rio Negro branch of the Amazon and other black water 

          rivers of South America, which hardly carry down any perceptible sediment 

          even when in full flood. Again, wherever lakes occur, they receive all 

          the sediment from the basin above them, which portion should therefore 

          be treated by itself, since it contributes no sediment to the main river. 

          If we look at a physical map of North America we see that a large extent 

          of the Mississippi basin consists of alluvial flats and slightly undulating 

          prairie, sufficiently explaining its small proportionate denudation. 

          Even the Rhone, which has a high rate of denudation, flows through a 

          great extent of low lands and perfectly flat meadows, while the upper 

          portion of its valley which produces most sediment is cut off by the 

          Lake of Geneva. In order, therefore, to arrive at any fair estimate 

          of the amount of denudation in the upland and mountainous portions of 

          the Rhone valley (which is what we require for our purpose) we have 

          considerably to reduce the area of its basin by taking away the flat 

          lands in all its valleys, and considerably to increase the amount of 

          sediment by adding all that is now poured into the Lake of Geneva. We 

          shall probably not be far wrong in adding one third to its denuding 

          powers on these grounds, which will lead us to the startling fact that 

          the Rhone basin is being lowered at the rate of a foot in a thousand 

          years; but even this is considerably less than in the case of the Po. 

          Mr. Croll takes the Mississippi denudation of a foot in six thousand 

          years as a measure for that of Europe; but for reasons above stated 

          I conceive this to be quite out of the question, and I maintain, that 

          if we are to use his measure of denudation for any practical purpose, 

          we must apply that of European rivers to European phenomena, that of 

          Alpine rivers to Alpine phenomena, and must further make the necessary 

          corrections for alluvial flats and intercepting lakes.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Croll and Sir Charles Lyell were at first both 
          inclined to adopt the period of high excentricity which occurred from 
          750,000 to 950,000 years ago as that of the glacial epoch, but Mr. Croll, 
          in consideration of the proofs of rapid denudation above given, now 
          believes that the <font color="990000">[[p. 453]]</font> period beginning 
          about 240,000 and ending about 80,000 years ago, is the more likely 
          one. Even this, however, offers difficulties. Denudation in Wales and 
          Scotland must probably have gone on as rapidly as the average rate of 
          the Rhone valley, especially during the period when the old glaciers 
          were disappearing; and eighty thousand years will therefore imply eighty 
          feet of average denudation over the whole surface of the country, if 
          less in one part then correspondingly more in another; but how is this 
          consistent with the preservation of ice-ground rock-surfaces and glacial 
          furrows in so many situations, as well as numberless heaps of loose 
          matter, the moraines of ancient glaciers, apparently just as they were 
          left by the ice? There are, it is true, a few considerations that go 
          to diminish though not to remove the difficulty. The amount of denudation 
          is now abnormally large, because the large quantities of glacial drift 
          left over the surface of the country, supply much of the sediment carried 
          down by the streams of Alpine countries. Many glacial markings were 
          at first covered up and preserved by drift or alluvium, and have been 
          since exposed by denudation: those earliest exposed are obliterated, 
          but new surfaces are being continually uncovered. The amount of denudation 
          of a solid rock-surface may not be a tenth part of that which now obtains 
          in glaciated districts; a fact which can only be ascertained by determining 
          the amount of sediment brought down by streams the basins of which are 
          <i>free from drift or gravel</i>, and consist almost wholly of <i>compact 
          rock surfaces</i>. We still have to deal with the difficulty of the 
          moraines, whose form and aspect are often so fresh that we can hardly 
          believe them to have been much changed since the ice left them, although 
          it is impossible to understand how they have escaped the denudation 
          which has lowered the whole surface of the country eighty, or even a 
          much smaller number of feet. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true Mr. Geikie, in his paper on Modern Denudation,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 

          suggests that all the effects of ice-action, now visible, are merely 

          the few examples which have been preserved owing to a concurrence of 

          favourable conditions, while a much larger number have been destroyed; 

          and I learn from him that there are in Scotland moraines in all stages 

          of decay. If this be the true explanation of the difficulty, it follows 

          that denudation must be extremely unequal, and that if one valley or 

          hill-side has remained unaltered during 80,000 years, another must have 

          been denuded to double the average amount. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having thus shown the difficulty there is in accepting 

          even the shorter period of 80,000 years for the date of the end of the 

          glacial epoch in Europe, let us see what other modes of measurement 

          are available. In Sir Charles Lyell's &quot;Antiquity of Man,&quot; 2nd ed., p. 

          28, we have three different calculations of the age of the bronze and 

          stone periods in Switzerland, which would place the latter at about 

          from 5,000 to 7,000 years ago. At page 321 of the same work, we have 

          an estimate of the age of the upper delta of the Tini&egrave;re by M. 

          Morlot. The lower delta (by the presence of Roman remains in one of 

          the upper strata) is calculated with tolerable certainty to be 10,000 

          years old, while the upper delta, 150 feet above the lake, is ten times 

          as large as the lower one, and is therefore supposed to be 100,000 years 

          old. From its fossil remains it is believed to be post-glacial; but 

          it is evident that, during the melting of the ice, the torrent might 

          have been more powerful, and have accumulated a delta much more rapidly 

          than now. The peat mosses of Denmark, indicating that the present beech-tree 

          vegetation of that country, which was also characteristic of it in the 

          Roman period, was in the Bronze age replaced by oaks, and in the still 

          earlier Stone age by fir-trees, imply a very long lapse of time; yet 

          this only takes us back to the Neolithic age, when all the shells and 

          all the mammalia were of existing species. The 8,000 or 10,000 years 

          of the Swiss Stone age may, however, have sufficed for this change. 

          There seems to be no doubt, that the time which elapsed from the close 

          of the glacial epoch (when man used the rudest flint weapons, and was 

          coeval with many extinct animals, when, moreover, the climate and physical 

          features of the country were considerably different from what they are 

          now) up to the Neolithic age, was much greater than from the latter 

          date to the present day, but how much greater it is impossible to determine. 

          The position of many of the tool-bearing gravels shows that rivers then 

          flowed at much higher levels, but from the known rate of denudation, 

          a valley might be deepened even 50 or 100 feet in as little as 50,000 

          years, since it is in valleys that the effects of denudation would be 

          greatest; and the extinction of the various animals might certainly 

          take place in an equal time under such conditions as are not unlikely 

          to have occurred at a period of great climatic change.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not appear, therefore, that any of the estimates 

          of time founded on an actual basis of observed change in a known period, 

          require us to assume more than 80,000 years since the close of the glacial 

          epoch, while the measurement of the existing rate of denudation renders 

          it almost certain that it was less rather than more. We may fairly assume, 

          that even if a large excentricity has been an essential condition of 

          a glacial epoch, the ice would maintain itself into a period of less 

          excentricity than would be required to bring one on. Now 74,000 years 

          ago the excentricity was about double what it is now, and the winter 

          of the northern hemisphere then occurred in <i>aphelion</i>, so that 

          the glacial epoch would at that time probably have been in full force, 

          and we may assume that it might continue 3,000 or 4,000 years longer. 

          But when we come to 65,000 years back, we find the excentricity scarcely 

          more than it is at present, and winter nearly in <i>perihelion</i>; 

          so that we must conclude, if excentricity has anything to do with it, 

          that the last glacial period came to an end not less than 70,000 years 

          ago.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is most important to observe that, for the 
          last 60,000 years, the excentricity has been very small--for three-fourths 
          of the time less than it is now. During this time the opposite phases 
          of precession, each lasting 10,500 years, will have produced scarcely 
          any effect on climate, which in every part of the earth will have been 
          <i>nearly uniform for that long period</i>. But this is quite an exceptional 
          state of things; for the curve of excentricity shows us that, during 
          almost the whole of the last three million years, the excentricity has 
          been high--almost always twice, and sometimes three and four times as 
          much as it is now. If, therefore, Mr. Croll's theory be correct, there 
          will have been a change each 10,500 years during this vast period (in 
          all the extra-tropical regions at least) from a very cold to a very 
          mild <font color="990000">[[p. 454]]</font> climate. This will necessarily 
          have caused much migration both of plants and animals, which would inevitably 
          result in much extinction and comparatively rapid modification. Allied 
          races would be continually brought into competition, altered physical 
          conditions would induce variation, and thus we should have all the elements 
          for natural selection and the struggle for life, to work upon and develop 
          new races. High excentricity would therefore lead to a rapid change 
          of species, low excentricity to a persistence of the same forms; and, 
          as we are now, and have been for 60,000 years, in a period of low excentricity, 
          <i>the rate of change of species during that time may be no measure 
          of the rate that has generally obtained in past geological epochs</i>. 
          Thus we should have explained the extraordinary persistence of organic 
          forms during the historical period as well as during the preceding Neolithic 
          age, although slight changes of climate and of physical geography have 
          undoubtedly taken place; and it would prove to be not so much the <i>usually</i> 
          slow rate of organic change, as the fact of our living in the midst 
          of an <i>exceptionally uniform climatic epoch</i>, that has hitherto 
          prevented us from obtaining a measure of the average duration of species. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These considerations have an important bearing on 

          our estimate of the duration of the glacial epoch itself, and on our 

          calculation of geological time from the change of species since its 

          commencement. If it terminated 70,000 years ago, and if each 10,500 

          years before that date, there was alternately a warm period and a glacial 

          epoch, there would necessarily occur a series of northern and southern 

          migrations of animals and plants, and thus deposits formed at times 

          not geologically remote, might contain very distinct groups of animals. 

          These might even meet and be confounded in the same strata, and thus 

          lead to that extraordinary mixture of northern and southern forms which 

          occurs in some of the more recent formations, like the hippopotamus 

          and mammoth in the Norfolk crag and the lower brick-earths.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geologists seem hardly to have attached sufficient 

          importance to the great gap that intervenes between the Pal&aelig;olithic 

          and Pre-historic ages. Mr. Boyd Dawkins has shown, from a careful study 

          of their mammalian remains, that the whole of the post-glacial river 

          deposits and cave-beds of this country (148 in number) are of the same 

          age, being characterised by about twenty species of extinct or arctic 

          mammalia, and this was the age of Pal&aelig;olithic man. In the Pre-historic 

          or Neolithic age all these have disappeared, while the sheep, goat, 

          dog, and <i>Bos longifrons</i> are first met with. Now, on the theory 

          that this Pal&aelig;olithic age was entirely post-glacial, and that 

          the climate and physical geography of Britain have been since slowly 

          approaching their present condition, how is this great gap to be accounted 

          for? The large number of places where remains have been found, shows 

          that the conditions requisite for preserving them very frequently occurred, 

          and there must therefore have been some special cause which has prevented 

          any record being left of the long period during which they were becoming 

          extinct. Mr. J. Scott Moore<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> maintains that 

          they were all pre-glacial, and that the gap was the glacial epoch itself. 

          He adduces in corroboration the striking fact that none of the supposed 

          post-glacial gravels ever rest on the boulder clay, but always on an 

          older rock, which could hardly have been the case in every instance 

          were they all post-glacial. Again, Mr. Boyd Dawkins tells us that the 

          identity of such a large proportion of the species of pre-glacial and 

          post-glacial mammals &quot;forbids the idea of the existence of any gap or 

          lacuna which would warrant the classification of the one as tertiary 

          and the other as quaternary.&quot; But if we admit the occurrence, during 

          the last glacial epoch, not only of one or two, but of a series of alternate 

          cold and warm periods, we may make the Pal&aelig;olithic age <i>inter-glacial</i>, 

          and suppose it to have occupied several of these alternations of climate. 

          If we further place the last submergence which separated Britain from 

          the Continent, during one of the later phases of extreme cold, when 

          most of the extinct mammalia, as well as man, had migrated southwards, 

          we shall sufficiently account for the great gap that intervenes between 

          the Pal&aelig;olithic and Pre-historic ages. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the &quot;Principles of Geology,&quot; 10th ed., vol. i, 

          p. 300, Sir C. Lyell has given an estimate of the duration of geological 

          epochs, from the proportionate change in the species of marine mollusca, 

          taking as a basis a million years since the beginning of the glacial 

          epoch. Of the marine shells then living, six per cent. have become extinct, 

          while at the close of the glacial epoch they were all of existing species, 

          but this does not necessarily imply that the former are many times older 

          than the latter. The glacial period itself may have been the cause of 

          their extinction independently of mere time; so that the Bridlington 

          beds, where the above-mentioned proportion of extinct species occurs, 

          need not on this account be more than twice as old as those glacial 

          or post-glacial drifts which contain only living species, or, according 

          to our previous estimate, about 140,000 years. The Norfolk crag, which 

          contains eleven per cent. of extinct shells, may be from 40,000 to 60,000 

          years older; this will allow for two or three alternations of warm and 

          cold periods, which, at a time of such high excentricity, must have 

          been strongly contrasted, and have led to a correspondingly rapid change 

          of species. From these considerations it becomes evident that the time, 

          measured by the occurrence of five per cent. of extinct species of marine 

          shells, is not necessarily the whole number of years which has elapsed 

          since they existed, but only that number <i>minus</i> the last 60,000 

          years of uniform climate and specific immobility; and we may be even 

          too lavish of time if we allow so much as 100,000 years for this amount 

          of change under the influence of those repeated alternations of climate 

          which have characterised the last three million years and which have 

          probably more or less characterised all past geological time. If now 

          we take this number as our datum instead of a million years, all Sir 

          Charles Lyell's figures will be reduced to a tenth, and will stand thus: 

          the time elapsed since the beginning of the--

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These figures will seem very small to some geologists 
        who have been accustomed to speak of &quot;millions&quot; as <font color="990000">[[p. 
        455]]</font> small matters; but I hope I have shown that, so far as we 
        have any means at present of measuring geological time, they may be amply 
        sufficient. Taking Sir William Thomson's allowance of a hundred million 
        years for the time during which the earth can have been fit for life, 
        it yet allows Mr. Darwin, for the process of development from the primordial 
        germ, three times as many years anterior to the Cambrian epoch as have 
        elapsed since that date, an amount of time which, I believe, will fully 
        satisfy him, by whatever scale we may measure it. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence of the rapidity of denudation would 

          indeed tend to the still further shortening of the estimate here given; 

          and it is not impossible that a concurrence of geographical conditions 

          might have brought down the glacial epoch into a period when the excentricity 

          was no greater, or even less, than it is now. This, however, is hardly 

          probable, and I am inclined to think that the considerations already 

          alluded to will, to a considerable extent, explain how it is that so 

          many signs of glacial action still remain, in spite of such denudation. 

          The only argument I consider new in this paper, is that derived from 

          the uniformity of climate during the last 60,000 years, and the alternations 

          of heat and cold for a long time previously, leading to a slower change 

          of species since the glacial epoch than at any former period, thus allowing 

          us to suppose change of form in the organic world to go on more rapidly 

          than we had before thought possible. If this be a sound deduction, it 

          will, I believe, more than anything else, enable us to bring the period 

          required for the development of the whole organic world within that 

          which modern natural philosophy assigns as the age of the habitable 

          earth.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the force of my argument appears to depend 

          upon the accuracy of Mr. Croll's view, that, during a time of great 

          excentricity, there will be in each hemisphere alternately a glacial 

          epoch for about 10,500 years, and a perpetual spring or summer for about 

          an equal period. But Sir Charles Lyell argues, with great force, for 

          the opposite view, that the cold of one period would be continued through 

          the other, and that during the whole continuance of a phase of high 

          excentricity both hemispheres would be in a state of glaciation. Supposing 

          this view to be the true one, it will not very materially affect my 

          argument, for the diagram shows many comparatively rapid alternations 

          from a very high to a very low excentricity, which would also be from 

          a glacial to a temperate climate and would certainly tend to comparative 

          rapidity of specific change; while in each 10,500 years there would, 

          no doubt, be some retreat and advance of the snow line, followed by 

          a less amount of migration, competition, and variation. During the last 

          60,000 years, on the other hand, the change of excentricity has been 

          hardly perceptible, and the change of organic forms may be supposed 

          to have been far below the average.</p>

Two becoming one. Amen.” <strong>Katie Rife</strong></p>

<p>“The plot may suggest a classic thriller – a story of gangsters and a toxic passion between a criminal (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and an American student in Paris (Jean Seberg) – but the form is just revolutionary. The narration, the editing, the dialogue, the way the shooting interacts with the city and the people of Paris, all its spontaneity and improvisation: it prefigured a new cinema, movies as manifesto.” <strong>Mustapha Benfodil</strong></p>

<p>“This masterpiece of modern French cinema liberated filmmakers from a lot of constraints and began a new era of playfulness. Without it, cinema today would not be what it is.” <strong>András Bálint Kovács</strong></p>

Though it has always been global and inclusive in scope, the poll has expanded significantly each decade. In 1992, 101 directors voted; fast-forward to 2012, when 358 filmmakers took part. This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors. This electorate spans experimental, arthouse, mainstream and genre filmmakers from around the world. In every case, the voter is a director of note.

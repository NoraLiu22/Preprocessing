1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<em>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: A note concerning reciprocity of free trade printed in the July
1879 number of <U>The Nineteenth Century</U>. Original pagination indicated within double brackets.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#990000">[[p. 179]]</font> Although the subject of 'Reciprocity' is not yet of sufficient popular interest to be
the subject of another article in the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, I beg to be allowed to say a few words in
reply to Mr. Lowe's very forcible, not to say violent and contemptuous, article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have often been at once amused and disgusted at a common practice in the House of
Commons, of flatly denying facts which a previous speaker had alleged as undisputed, or had
proved on good evidence; but I hardly expected that, in an article deliberately written and
published, so eminent a politician as Mr. Lowe would condescend to similar tactics, and attempt
to overthrow an adversary by the mere force of his weighty <em>ipse dixit</em>. Yet the most important
part of his reply to me, that which he thinks--'so complete and absolute that I am convinced, had
it occurred to Mr. Wallace, his article would never have been written'--consists in the assertion
that my proposal, even if carried out, would be quite inoperative, because, when foreign
countries protect any class of manufactures, they thereby acknowledge that they cannot compete
with us in our own or in any neutral markets, and that 'by the conditions of the problem it is impossible' that they should do so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the fact that such protected goods <em>are</em> imported into this country, and <em>do</em> compete
successfully with our own, must surely be known to Mr. Lowe; and I am afraid the most
charitable view we can take is, that his article was written with some of that want of consideration which he so confidently alleges against myself. What does he say to the fact that the
United States sent to this country in 1877 manufactured goods to the value of 3,559,521<em> l.</em>,
including large quantities of cotton and iron goods, sugar, and linseed oil-cake, although every
one of these manufactures is protected by almost prohibitive duties? Again, we have paper
imported to the value of more than half a million a year, although the manufacture is heavily
protected in every country but our own; and the competition of this protected foreign article,
which, according to Mr. Lowe, <em>cannot</em> compete with ours, has yet ruined many of our paper
manufacturers. So iron goods of all kinds are heavily protected in France, Belgium, America, and
some other countries; yet iron and steel in various <font color="#990000">[[p. 180]]</font> forms were imported in 1877 to the
value of over 1,500,000 <em>l.</em> Our total imports of manufactured goods (including metals) in 1877
amounted to 64,635,418<em> l.</em>; and almost the whole of these goods are protected in the countries
which export them. Most of them, in fact, are sent to us because they <em>are</em> protected, the
manufacturers finding it to their advantage to work to the full power of their plant and capital,
selling the larger portion of their output at a good profit in the home market, and, with the
surplus, underselling us, which they are enabled to do <em>because all the fixed charges of the
manufacture are already paid out of the profits of the domestic trade</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having thus disposed of Mr. Lowe's main attack, and shown that what he declares to be
'impossible' nevertheless occurs, I have only to notice his singular attempt to put me in the
wrong by giving a new and unjustifiable meaning to one of the plainest words in the English
language. He says that I am quite mistaken in considering 'free trade' to be essentially mutual--to
mean, in fact, what the component words mean--free commerce, free exchange, free buying and
selling. On the contrary, says Mr. Lowe, it means free buying only, though selling may be ever so
much restricted. But surely buying alone is not 'trade,' but only one half of 'trade.' Just as
imports cannot exist without exports of equal value, so I have always considered that buying
cannot long go on without selling, and that the two together constitute trade. Mr. Lowe, however,
says I am historically wrong, but he does not give his authorities; and without very conclusive
proof I cannot admit that the English language, as well as the English commercial system, was
revolutionised by the free-trade agitation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most important of my arguments--that reciprocal import duties are just and
politic, in order to secure 'stability and healthy growth' to our manufactures--Mr. Lowe, with
more ingenuity than ingenuousness, converts into a plea on my part for stagnation and freedom
from competition; and he maintains that the power of foreign governments to alter their import
duties and bounties at pleasure, with the certainty that we shall take no active steps to neutralise
their policy, is a healthy incentive to activity and enterprise!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remainder of Mr. Lowe's arguments and sarcasms may pass for what they are worth;
but, while so many of our manufacturers, and that large proportion of our population who are
dependent directly or indirectly on manufacturing industries, are suffering from the unfair
competition brought upon them by foreign protection, the allegation that these form an
insignificant <em>class</em>, and may be properly spoken of as 'particular trades' whose prosperity is of
little importance to the rest of the community in comparison with that <em>summum bonum</em>--cheap
goods--deserves a word of notice. I therefore beg leave <font color="#990000">[[p. 181]]</font> to call attention to Richard
Cobden's opinion of the supreme importance of these manufactures to England's welfare. He
says:--</p>

<blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the prosperity, then, of this interest [the manufacturing] hangs our foreign
commerce; on which depends our external rank as a maritime state; our custom-duties,
which are necessary to the payment of the national debt; and the supply of every foreign
article of domestic consumption--every pound of tea, sugar, coffee, or rice--and all the
other commodities consumed by the entire population of these realms. In a word, our
national existence is involved in the well-being of our manufacturers.</font>

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are asked, To what are we indebted for this commerce? we answer, in the name
of every manufacturer and merchant in the kingdom, The <em>cheapness</em> alone of our
manufactures. Are we asked, How is this trade protected, and by what means is it
enlarged? the reply still is, By the <em>cheapness</em> of our manufactures. Is it inquired how this
mighty industry, upon which depend the comfort and existence of the whole empire, can
be torn from us? we rejoin, Only by the <em>greater cheapness</em> of the manufactures of
another country.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></font></p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In another passage in the same volume he says: 'The French, whilst they are obliged to prohibit
our fabrics from their own market, because their manufacturers cannot, they say, sustain a
competition with us, even with a heavy protective duty, never will become our rivals in third
markets where both will pay alike;' from which it appears that he never contemplated the state of
things that has actually come about, when, by means of protective duties, and our open markets
supplying all the world with cheap coal, iron, and machinery, other nations have been enabled to
foster their manufactures till they have reached such a magnitude as not only to supply
themselves, but, with their surplus goods, produced cheaply by means of protection, are actually
able to undersell us at home. That time has, however, come; and I feel sure that if Cobden were
now among us, his strong sense of justice and clear vision as to the true sources of our prosperity
would lead him to advocate some such course of action as I have proposed, in order to bring
about those benefits to the all-important manufacturing interests of our country, which the system
of free imports--miscalled 'free trade'--has not procured for it.</p>

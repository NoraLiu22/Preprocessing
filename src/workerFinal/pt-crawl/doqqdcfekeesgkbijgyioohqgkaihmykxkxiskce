<p id="q120"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />
<strong>J.K.:</strong> Is the limbic system present in both hemispheres? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, areas of the limbic system are found
in both hemispheres. The limbic system is composed of several structures
including the cingulate cortex, the hippocampus, amygdala, mamillary
bodies, anterior nucleus of the thalamus and interconnecting pathways.  
These structures are found in both hemispheres. </p>

<hr />

<p id="q119"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />

<strong>W.A.:</strong> How does strychnine affect the nervous system? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Strychnine blocks receptors for the 
neurotransmitter called glycine.  Glycine is an inhibitory 
neurotransmitter used in many places of the nervous system including the 
spinal cord, brain stem and cerebellum.  Strychnine therefore blocks 
inhibition and can cause convulsions, muscles cramping and respiratory 
problems. </p>

<hr />

<p id="q118"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />
<strong>B.L.:</strong> Do ALL mammals have seven neck bones? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Mice, cats, dogs, horses, whales, humans 
and most other mammals have only seven neck bones (cervical vertebrate), 
but there are exceptions to this rule.  
The <a href="http://www.manatees.net/" title="EXTERNAL LINK - mantees website">manatee
</a> and the two-toed sloth have only SIX cervical vertebrae and the <a href="http://www.sloth.com/" title="sloth.com website">three-toed sloth</a> has NINE cervical vertebrae. </p>

<hr />

<p id="q117"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" /> <strong>K.A.:</strong> 
What would happen if two action potentials coming from opposite directions collide? Would they sum up to a specific point or would they cancel each other out? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Colliding action potentials cancel each
other out because the refractory period of either spike prevents the
continuation of an impulse in either direction. </p>

<hr />

<p id="q116"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />
<strong>N.V.:</strong> What is the width of the spinal cord? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> It depends on what <a href="spinal.html"> segment of the spinal cord</a> and which plane you measure: </p>

<p> Midthoracic area (tranverse diameter) = 10 mm <br />
Midthoracic area (sagittal diameter) =  8 mm <br />
Cervical enlargement (transverse diameter) = 13-14 mm <br />
Cervical enlargement (sagittal diameter) = 9 mm <br />
Lumbar enlargement (transverse diameter) = 12 mm <br />
Lumbar enlargement (sagittal diameter) = 8.5 mm </p>

<p>(Reference: Carpenter, M.B. and Sutin, J.S. Human 
Neuroanatomy, Baltimore:  Williams &#38; Wilkins, 1983.)</p>

<p id="q115"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" /> 
<strong>L.H.:</strong> What is the origin of the word &#34;ballismus?&#34; </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Ballismus comes from the Greek word
&#34;ballismos&#34; meaning &#34;a jumping about&#34;  or &#34;dancing.&#34; </p>

<hr />

<p id="q114"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />
<strong>P.R.:</strong> What is the difference between gray matter and 
white matter? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Gray matter consists primarily of neuron
cell bodies. For example, in the brain, gray matter forms the outside
layers of cortex and nuclei deep within the brain.  White matter consists
of myelinated axons. </p> 

<hr />

<p id="q113"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" /> 
<strong>A.C.:</strong> What is the purpose of the knee jerk reflex? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> The knee jerk reflex helps with posture.  
When the knee bends, it stretches the leg muscle (quadriceps femoris).  
The muscle stretch starts the reflex and the leg straightens.</p>

<hr />

<p id="q112"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" /> 
<strong>E.B.:</strong> Does the drug Ecstasy (MDMA) affect women and men 
differently? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Few studies have examined gender
differences of the effects of MDMA.  However, Liechti et al. (2001)  
reported that the perceptual changes, anxiety and adverse effects (e.g.,
jaw clenching, dry mouth, appetite changes) of MDMA are greater in women
than in men.  Blood pressure increases caused by MDMA are higher in men
than in women. </p>

<p> Reference: Liechti, M.E., Gamma, A. and Vollenweider, F.X. <a href=

<p id="q111"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />
<strong>A.A.:</strong> For how long can drugs be detected after you take 
them? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> It depends on the drug and the test.  
Urine tests are the most common way drugs are detected.  However, samples
of a person&#39;s blood, saliva, breath, sweat and hair can also be tested to
detect drug use. The presence of breakdown products (metabolites) in a
sample is an indication of drug use. </p>

<p> According to <strong>The Medical Letter</strong>, August 19, 2002 (Volume 44), 
the following drugs can be detected in <strong>urine</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Amphetamines: 2-3 days</li>
<li>Cocaine metabolites: 2-3 days; up to 8 days with heavy use</li>
<li>Marijuana metabolites: 1-7 days (light use); 1 month with moderate to 
heavy use</li>
<li>Opiate metabolites: 1-3 days</li>
<li>Phencyclidine: 7-14 days</li> </ul>

<p> According to Keltner, N.L. and Folks, D.G., in <strong>Psychotropic Drugs</strong>, 
(St. Louis:  Elsevier Mosby, 2005): </p>

<strong>C.L.:</strong> While sitting in a chair, move your right leg in a
clockwise motion.  At the same time, try to draw a &#34;6&#34; in the air with your right hand.  This is difficult to do! Why? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer from Dr. Pat F. (Neuroscientist Network
member):</strong> The motor coordination between upper and lower limbs is
interconnected, both unilaterally and bilaterally.  These interconnections
are a holdover from our quadrupedal gait patterns. They are an
evolutionary holdover, but are functional early in life. Recall that all
humans, despite being considered bipedal (walking upright on our lower
limbs), we are quadrupedal in our early stages of life (crawling as a
child).  These interconnections serve to provide a coordinated sequencing
of movements of the upper and lower limbs. Evidence of these circuits and
their retained functionality even in the adult is noted with the arm swing
during walking.  While some of the movement is passive, there is indeed
increased muscle activity and even spinal motor neuron activity
corresponding to these movements.  This is evidence that they are not
simply passive, but actually driven by nervous system activity. If you
analyze the arm swing during bipedal gait, you will notice that it
corresponds to the same sequence observed with a quadruped gait. These
circuits are relatively easily overpowered by conscious voluntary control
from higher centers. </p> 

<p> So... Short answer, the control of upper and
lower limb movements is influenced by &#39;old&#39; reflex circuitry within the
spinal cord and this circuit tries to maintain a symmetry of movement.</p>

<strong>S.C.:</strong> What are the 10 most common elements in the human body? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> According to <strong>The Handy Science Answer
Book</strong> (1994) compiled by the Science and Technology Department of the
Carnegie Library of Philadelphia, the human body is composed of: </p>

<pre>
Oxygen - 65%
Carbon - 18.5%
Hydrogen - 9.5%
Nitrogen - 3.3%
Calcium - 1.5%
Phosphorus - 1.0%</pre>

<p> Potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine and magnesium each occur at 0.35% or
less.  There are other elements found in trace amounts.</p>

<p id="q102"> <img src="gif/quest1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />

<strong>Y.D.:</strong> What is a beta-blocker? </p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> A beta-blocker is a drug that binds to beta receptors thus stopping the action of the neurotransmitter called norepinephrine.  These drugs work by blocking the action of the <a href="auto.html">sympathetic nervous system</a> on the heart. They can prevent increased heart rate and pumping strength and are used to treat high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats. </p>

telegraph. When Samuel F. B. Morse sent an electrical signal
for "What hath God wrought!" over a wire from Washington
to Baltimore in 1844, he created a new technology and
industry. Over the years, inventors sought to improve the
telegraph. Alexander Graham Bell at the 1876 World's Fair
in Philadelphia unveiled to the public a device that for the
first time turned mechanical sound waves into electrical
current and back again. He spoke into a microphone and his
voice came out from a vibrating diaphragm speaker. The
telephone was an instant success, won a prize at the Fair,
launched what would become the world's largest
communication company, and influenced countless others to
improve the technology of sound recording. Thomas Edison
was influenced by Bell's work to create the cylinder
phonograph in 1877. When Oberlin Smith visited Edison's
lab at Menlo Park, NJ, in early 1878, he was inspired to
improve the phonograph by a different method, using a
magnetizing coil to record sound on wire rather than Edison's
method of using a needle to etch a wavy groove on a wax
cylinder. He did not succeed, but wrote an accurate
description in a memorandum 1878 Sept. 23, and wrote an
article for Electrical World in 1888 Sept. that was also
published in French by La Lumiere Electrique. The idea was
in the air. (1) </span></span></p>

where Smith had failed. He built and patented the first
working magnetic recorder called the Telegraphone Poulsen
had become a telephone engineer at the Copenhagen
Telephone Company in 1893 and began to experiment with
magnetism to record telephone messages. By 1899 he filed
U.S. patent 661,619 for a vertical wire-covered cylinder, and
in 1900 demonstrated improved drum and horizontal wire
cylinder models at the 1900 Paris Exhibition. While making
these improved models, Poulsen and his partner Peder O.
Pedersen discovered the application of a direct current to the
recording head, called dc bias, and improved the sound
quality on a steel tape version of the Telegraphone. At the
Paris fair, Poulsen recorded the voice of Emperor Franz
Joseph, today preserved in the Danish Museum of Science
and Technology as the oldest magnetic sound recording.
Poulsen stopped his work on magnetic recording and turned
to radio after 1902, and only a small number of his machines
were made in Denmark and Germany. The American
Telegraphone Company acquired the patent rights in 1905
and made dictating machines, selling 50 to the Du Pont
Company. However, the signal remained weak without
amplification and the wire spools became twisted and were
unreliable. The wax cylinder phonographs of the rival
Ediphone and Dictaphone companies were cheaper and more
reliable. By 1918, the company went into receivership and
stopped manufacturing after 1924. (2) </span></span></p>

in World War I. In 1914 Germany used wire recorders
purchased from the American Telegraphone Company to
transmit high-speed wireless telegraph messages to German
submarines in the Atlantic. Only another Telegraphone
operating at high speed could record the messages and make
them intelligible at a slower speed. Charles Apgar, an
employee of the American Marconi Company, was operating
an amateur radio station W2MN and had developed an
amplifier using a DeForest Audion tube. He picked up the
German radio transmissions, amplified them through a
loudspeaker and recorded them on Dictaphone cylinders and
gave them to the government. Secretary of the Navy
Josephus Daniels ordered the Navy to seize the German
radio station in Sayville NY on 1915 July 8, to stop the use
of its Telegraphones by German spies. The Naval Research
Laboratory in Washington began research on magnetic
recording with 4 Telegraphones purchased from the
American Telegraphone Company. In 1921 W. L. Carlson
and Glenn L. Carpenter filed for patent 1,640,881 on the
application of ac bias to the record head to improve the
quality of telegraph signals. But as Poulsen had discovered,
magnetic recording was not yet practical and ac bias would
be forgotten when the Navy ended its experiments. (3) </span></span></p>

War I. Kurt Stille had bought a Telegraphone in 1903 for his
experiments, and by 1924 began sales of an improved wire
recorder with an electronic amplifier to be used as a dictation
machine. In 1928 he formed the Echophone Company with
Karl Bauer and contracted with Ferdinand Schuchard AG
and its talented engineer Semi Begun to manufacture the
Dailygraph, the first cassette magnetic recorder. In 1932
International Telephone and Telegraph bought Stille's
companies and merged them into C. Lorenz AG. Begun
developed the Textophone dictation machine in 1933 and the
Lorenz company sold thousands to Hitler's Nazi government.
Begun also developed the Stahltone-Bandmaschine steel tape
recorder in 1935 for mobile radio broadcasting. The RRG
state radio service used Begun's machines at the 1936 winter
Olympic games, but by that time the young Jewish engineer
had decided to immigrate to the U.S. (4) </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.0983333in; margin-bottom: 0.0625in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The German engineer Fritz Pfleumer discovered a different
method of magnetic recording. While relaxing in a Paris caf&eacute;
on a business trip in 1927 for the Universelle Company that
made cigarette machines, he thought of coating paper tape
with iron oxide in the same way that he had been coating
cigarette paper with bronze powder lacquer. His German
patent for "sounding paper" was granted 1928 Jan. 1, but his
tape recorder tore up the paper tape and was only used to
demonstrate the potential of tape for editing and reuse.
Hermann Bucher, Chairman of the Board of Directors of
AEG took a personal interest in this potential and signed a
contract with Pfleumer 1932 Nov. 28, to develop a recorder.
Theo Volk led the AEG team that worked with Pfleumer and
with another team led by chemist Friedrich Matthias of
BASF, a subsidiary of the I. G. Farben chemical giant. AEG
had expertise in producing high-frequency coils filled with
carbonyl iron powder supplied by BASF, and I.G. Farben
also produced films and plastics and a variety of coated
materials. The partnership created by Bucher and Pfleumer
because both were music lovers, would become one of the
greatest corporate research and development triumphs of the
century. Over the next three years, the teams perfected a tape
and recorder that became the standard design for the industry
for the next 30 years. Eduard Schuller patented in 1933 the
ring-shaped magnetic head that was one of the team's most
important inventions. Previous heads were shaped like
phonograph needles or chisel and damaged the soft tape.
Schuller's ring focused a strong magnetic field on a small
area of tape without damaging the surface. Matthias
developed a two-layer magnetic tape, bonding a top layer of
carbonyl iron powder with a base layer of cellulose acetate,
similar to the kind of layered safety film made by Agfa for
photography. Measuring and testing devices were invented
to evaluate the performance of the recorders built by AEG.
A tape drive system of capstans and motors and brakes had
to be created, and everything had to work with the
electronics of amplifiers and speakers. Finally, the
Magnetophone K1 debuted at the Berlin Radio Fair in 1935
August. (5) </span></span></p>

other kinds of magnetic recorders were being developed in
Britain, the United States, and Japan. Ludwig Blattner had
bought the rights to a steel tape device from Kurt Stille in
1929 that became the Blattnerphone. The BBC needed a
recorder for its shortwave radio Empire Service that could
broadcast the same program at different times throughout the
British Empire, and improved the dc motor of the
Blattnerphone with a synchronous ac motor and reduced the
steel tape width to 3 mm. The BBC would use these
improved steel tape recorders from 1932 to 1936. The
Marconi Wireless Company also improved the Blattnerphone
for sale to radio stations in Canada, Australia, France,
Poland, and Egypt. In 1935, the BBC and Marconi and Stille
Inventions Ltd. joined to develop an improved
Marconi-Stille recorder with a signal-to-noise ratio of 45 dB.
However, the steel tape was persistent problem. It took two
people to mount the 2700-meter reels that weighed 35 kg,
and the brittle tape broke so frequently that the
Marconi-Stille recorders came with a built-in spot welder. In
the United States, Clarence Hickman at Bell Labs developed
a steel tape telephone recorder but Bell did not market the
machine outside the company. Semi Begun developed the
Soundmirror steel tape recorder in early 1939 at the Brush
Development Company in Cleveland, Ohio, that would be
used by the military. Marvin Camras invented an improved
recording head for wire in 1939 at the Armour Research
Foundation in Chicago, and added his rediscovery of ac bias
in 1940 for the Model 50 commercial wire recorder
introduced in 1940. Kenzo Nagai in Japan also rediscovered
ac bias in 1938 and patented its application to voice
recording. His work would stimulate the Japanese consumer
electronics industry after World War II. (6) </span></span></p>

magnetic recorders. It was portable (the "K" stood for
"Koffer" or portable case in the K1 model of 1935) and was
self-contained with its own amplifier and speaker. It was
cheaper and more reliable than the steel wire and tape
machines. It was financed and manufactured by large and
powerful corporations in Germany. The Germany military
adopted a field version called the Tonschreiber, or "sound
writer," and AEG made a very small spring-driven model C
and a model D for war correspondents and a model F
dictation machine. The models made for the German Navy
were the RE-3 and the R-26. BASF developed a factory to
mass-produce the reels of acetate tape, replacing the
carbonyl iron coating (light gray in color) with magnetite
(black). BASF tested the new tape by recording a concert by
Thomas Beecham and the London Philharmonic Orchestra
1939 Nov. 19, at the factory in Ludwigshafen. But the
quality of the tape recording that still used dc bias was not
good. BASF improved the tape in 1939 with a new
formulation of gamma ferric oxide (reddish-brown). The
German broadcasting group RRG joined the AEG-BASF
partnership and worked to improve its quality. RRG engineer
Walter Weber re-discovered ac biasing in 1940 April, and
the Magnetophone demonstrated to journalists in Berlin
1941 June 10, produced a 60 dB dynamic range and the
50-10,000 Hz frequency response. The model K7 in 1943
had synchronous motors to reduce wow and flutter and could
even record in stereo. The tape speed of 30 ips (77 cm/s)
became the standard for future speeds of 15, 7.5, 3.75 and
1.875 in/s. Karl Schwarz of the Klangfilm company in Berlin
developed a magnetic film stock tape that allowed sound to
be recorded on the new color film from Agfa. Although an
accidental explosion destroyed the Ludwigshafen tape
manufacturing plant in 1943 July, the production was taken
over by the Agfa plant in Wolfen. A new plant was built in
Aschbach near Ludwigshafen to make the Type L tape with
a polyvinyl chloride plastic base; it had 10 dB increased
sensitivity. (7) </span></span></p>

America at the end of the war. He was an electrical engineer
in the Signal Corps assigned to investigate radar interference
in Britain. As he listened to hours of music broadcast from
Germany each night, he wondered how full orchestras could
be playing symphonies at all hours of the night. The quality
was equal to live radio, and was better than shellac records.
On a trip to Radio Frankfurt he discovered the secret:
Magnetophones with ac biasing. He studied the circuitry of
these machines, and sent 2 old machines with dc biasing
home to San Francisco with 50 reels of BASF Type L tape.
He modified the electronics of the old machines to add ac
biasing and demonstrated them 1946 May 16, to the Institute
of Radio Engineers in San Francisco. Harold Lindsay heard
this demonstration and told Mullin about the Ampex
Corporation that had been founded by Alexander Matthew
Poniatoff in 1944 (the name came from his initials plus "ex",
to avoid using the same name AMP already taken by the
Aircraft Marine Products company). Ampex Electrical and
Manufacturing Company built high quality motors and
generators that used Alnico 5 magnets from the GE, but with
the war ended Poniatoff was looking for a new product.
Mullin provided Ampex with some information about his
Magnetophone but was also supplying information to Col.
Richard Ranger in New Jersey who was developing his own
tape recorder. Ampex used the FIAT reports of the U.S.
Government Intelligence Agency Reports on German
industries to gain more information to develop its own tape
recorder design. (8) </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.0983333in; margin-bottom: 0.0625in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Bing Crosby opened the floodgates for magnetic tape
recording in the broadcast industry. Despite the network
prohibition of recordings, during the war years some radio
stations had started using Brush and Armour wire recorders
for broadcasting news events and for west coast delayed
time. The new ABC network allowed Bing Crosby to record
his "Philco Radio Time" show in the fall of 1946 on
transcription discs but these were difficult to edit. Crosby's
technical producer Murdo McKenzie learned about Mullin's
Magnetophone, now called the Magnetrack for a motion
picture film recording business he started with W. A. Palmer
in Hollywood. In 1947 August, McKenzie arranged three
different recordings of Crosby's first Philco show of the
1947-48 season: by Mullin, Ranger, and transcription disc.
Mullin's tape recording was superior and won the contract to
record and edit Crosby's radio shows. Ampex was finishing
its prototype of the Model 200A tape recorder and Mullin
used the first two models as soon as they were built. Crosby
pre-paid 50,000 $ in the Ampex company to expand
production, and Bing Crosby Enterprises became its West
coast distributor. The radio networks and the leading
recording studios adopted the recorders. Ampex later
boasted that the tape recorder and the LP "gave birth to the
high fidelity era." (9) </span></span></p>

at the Brush company developed a ring-type recording head
under contract with the Office of Scientific Research and
Development. This ring worked best with coated tape, and
with Gerard Foley of the Batelle Memorial Institute
developed paper and acetate tapes coated with alnico and
magnetite powders. Brush approached a number of
companies, including the Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing company, to manufacture the tape. In 1944,
Ralph Oace at 3M solved the problem of coating a paper
base with the magnetite powder, but the war ended the
funding for the project. The Shellmar company manufactured
the paper magnetite tape in 1946 for the Brush Soundmirror
tape recorder and also a 5-inch magnetic disk for the Brush
Mail-A-Voice disk recorder that sold for only 40 $. The
experiments of Oace and the FIAT reports of the German
BASF tapes caused the 3M company to create a magnetic
tape laboratory in 1946. This lab discovered that
needle-shaped acicular particles of gamma ferric oxide
produced better coercivity (350 oersteds) than the
cube-shaped particles of magnetite used by Brush (150
oersteds). 3M introduced the Type 100 paper tape (black
oxide) in 1947, and the popular Type 111 acetate tape (red
oxide) in 1948 that Bing Crosby used to record his Philco
show with the new Ampex 200A tape recorders. By 1948 the
American tape recorder industry was firmly established. The
Magnecord company introduced the PT-6 professional
recorder for 750 $, far less than the Ampex models, and a
stereo model in 1949. (10) </span></span></p>

as a solution to the problems of data storage and speed. In
1937, Victor Atanasoff considered a variation of Poulsen's
magnetic drum as a possible memory device for his early
ABC electronic computer. However, he could not afford the
vacuum tubes necessary to amplify the magnetic pulses, and
decided to use non-magnetic capacitors on the drum. In
1947, William C. Morris led a group of engineers at
Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in Minneapolis that
had worked on Project Goldberg for the Navy to develop a
computer that could solve cryptographic problems. They
built the first magnetic drum out of recording tape from a
captured German Magnetophone recorder and heads from a
Brush wire recorder. The strips of tape would not stick to the
aluminum drum, so they spray-painted an iron oxide
emulsion obtained from 3M in Minneapolis directly onto the
surface of the drum. John Coombs reported their success at
the Chicago National Electronics Conference in 1947
November. The drum was 5 inches in diameter and revolved
at 3000 rpm, recording at a density of 230 bits per inch with
a rigid head mounted only 0.001 inch from the surface of the
drum. Howard Aiken at Harvard was also experimenting
with a magnetic drum on the Mark II computer in 1947, and
he would make the drum the key feature of his improved
Mark III computer in 1948. Harry Huskey would use a
magnetic drum in this design of the Standards Eastern
Automatic Computer for the National Bureau of Standards
in 1948. Arnold D. Booth in Britain built a magnetic drum
for the Automatic Relay Computer in 1948 and would install
a drum in the Manchester "baby" computer in 1949. The
ERA would build the Atlas computer in 1948 with a
magnetic drum 8.5 inches in diameter with 200 read/write
heads and a capacity of 16,384 words of 24-bit length. The
ERA would patent its drum design in 1948, including the
so-called "sprocket track" that was a control track to map the
addresses of data in the storage tracks. The access speed and
large capacity of magnetic drums exceeded all other forms of
computer memory in use during the decade after World War
II, such as the CRT and the mercury delay line. It would
remain the preferred computer memory until the faster
magnetic core devices became available in the late 1950s.

capacity needed for data storage. John W. Mauchly and J.
Presper Eckert began work in 1943 on ENIAC at the
University of Pennsylvania for the U.S. Army. It was not
finished during the war but in 1946 they started the
Electronic Control Co. and received grant from National
Bureau of Standards to build a ENIAC-type computer with
magnetic tape input/output, renamed UNIVAC in 1947 but
the project ran out of money. The two scientists formed
Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC) in 1947
Dec., and developed by 1949 the BINAC stored-program
computer for Northrop Aircraft, with mercury delay line
memory and a primitive magnetic tape drive. Remington
Rand bought EMCC in 1950 Feb. and provided funds to
finish UNIVAC 1951 March 30. It announced on 1951 June
14, the sale of UNIVAC I to the Census Bureau. It was the
first commercial computer to feature a magnetic tape storage
system that consisted of eight UNISERVO tape drives
standing separate from the CPU and control console on the
other side of a garage-size room. Each tape drive was six feet
high and three feet wide, used 1/2-inch metal tape of
nickel-plated bronze 1200 feet long, recorded data on eight
channels at 100 inches per second with a transfer rate of
7,200 characters per second. The complete UNIVAC system
weighed 29,000 pounds, included 5200 vacuum tubes, and
an offline typewriter-printer UNIPRINTER with an attached
metal tape drive. Later, a punched card-to-tape machine was
added to read IBM 80-column and Remington Rand
90-column cards. The UNIVAC I was used in 1952
November to calculate the presidential election returns and
successfully predict the winner, although it was not trusted
by the TV networks who refused to use the prediction.
Magnetic tape systems became the standard data storage
system in the 1950s. The SAGE aircraft-warning system was
the largest vacuum tube computer system ever built. It began
in 1954 at MIT's Lincoln Lab with funding from the Air
Force. The first of 23 Direction Centers went online in 1956
Nov., and the last in 1962. Each Center had two 55,000-tube
computers known as "Clyde" that weighed 275 tons and had
magnetic core memory, magnetic drum and magnetic tape
storage, graphics display, and were connected by one of the
first computer networks. (13) </span></span></p>

Recording project at the new IBM research lab in San Jose,
California, under the direction of Reynold B. Johnson. The
purpose was to find a better method than punched cards or
drums or tape to store and access information. They read an
article by Jacob Rabinow at the National Bureau of
Standards in the 1952 August  issue of Electrical
Engineering about "The Notched-Disk Memory" that stored
magnetic pulses on thin metal disks mounted vertically in a
doughnut-shaped ring. Each disk had a notch to align
magnetic read/write heads. Critchlow adopted this magnetic
disk idea in 1953 February, and Johnson began work at San
Jose on a 50-disk system with the capacity of 50,000
punched cards, or 4 million characters. In 1953 April,
William A. Goddard headed a team of 4 engineers to
develop the disk device. In May, he adopted the "air head"
method of maintaining a uniform head-surface gap of 0.002
inch using a forced air cushion. In June a successful test was
completed with the airhead reading a writing digital data on
the surface of a 16-inch aluminum disk sprayed with iron
oxide paint. By October, spray paint was replaced by spin
coating, and a servo-controlled cable-and-pulley carriage
was used to successfully locate random tracks on the
spinning disk. In 1954 February, data was being transferred
to and from a card reader. During 1954 a Model II was
designed and built with a 50-disk array mounted on a vertical
shaft. This model was given its first public demonstration in
1955 May as the Random Access Memory Accounting
Machine, or RAMAC. An improved Model II was
demonstrated at the 1956 February Western Joint Computer
Conference. Each disk was 24 inches in diameter and 0.1
inch thick and separated from other disks by 0.3-inch
spacers. The disks revolved at 1200 rpm and were accessed
by a single read/write head that moved up and down the
stack of platters Each disk had 100 circular tracks with a
density of 500 characters per track, recorded by IBM's NRZI
variable density method of 100 bits per inch on the inner
track and 55 bits per inch on the outer track. This was the
equivalent of storing 5 MB on a magnetic drum 13 inches
diameter and 42 feet long. The disk array became the IBM
350 Disk Storage, and deliveries to customers began in 1956
June for a monthly lease of 750 $. The IBM 1301 Disk
Storage was announced 1961 June 2. Each module had 25
disks and could store 28 MB. Up to 10 modules could be
added to a computer for a maximum of 280 MB. Each disk
had 50 tracks per inch with 520 bits per inch density, rotating
at 1800 rpm. This was first used in the SABRE airline
reservation system in 1961 that used 6 magnetic drums and
16 modules of the 1301 Disk Storage unit. The drums only
had capacity for 1.1 MB each, but were 20 times faster in
access time. In 1963 September, the 1302 Disk Storage
increased capacity 4 times by doubling the tracks per inch
and the bits per track. The 1316 Disk Pack announced 1962
October 11, (at first called the 1311 Disk Storage Drive) was
a removable pack of 6 disks, with a capacity of 2 MB, and
popular with smaller computers and a versatile storage
medium. (14) </span></span></p>

the automobile and the teenager to create a new generation
of stereo "Hi-Fi" components. Magnetic tape and FM radio
made possible a new quality of sound. The tape recorder
industry quickly expanded in Europe and Asia after the war.
In Britain, EMI used the German design to produce the
BTR1 for its Abbey Road studio in 1947 November. The
Grundig Company in Germany was started by radio dealer
Max Grundig after World War II to produce radio repair
instruments. It expanded into radio set production, making
the Heinzelmann in 1946 and the Grundig Boy in 1949 that
was one of the first portable cabinet radios. Grundig took
over the Lumophon factory in Nuremberg and in 1951 began
production of its first tape recorder, the Reporter 300. Willi
Studer in Zurich produced his first recorder, the Dynavox, in
1949 and the Studer 27 in 1951 and the Revox A77 in 1967.
Stefan Kudelski, a physics student in Switzerland, built the
Nagra I portable tape recorder with wind-up motor in 1951
used by the Everest explorer Raymond Lambert and by the
deep-sea bathyscaph Trieste. In Japan, Sony ( then called
Totsuko) in 1950 sold its first G-type tape recorder in Tokyo
at a price of 400 $ but it weighed over 100 lbs. Masaru Ibuka
and Akio Morita licensed transistor technology from
Western Electric in 1953, and began a consumer electronics
revolution with transistor radios, TVs (the TV8-301 of 1960
was nicknamed "Kennedy's dog" because JFK kept a set near
him), and the first all-transistor tape recorder in 1961. (15) </span></span></p>

greatest successes, but it began as another example of the
influence of Bing Crosby. John Mullin at Bing Crosby
Enterprises demonstrated an experimental 12-head VTR at
100 in/s in 1951. The Ampex team led by Charles Ginsburg
began work on VTR in 1951 October. Ray Dolby, 19,
dropped out of school to join the project and helped the team
demonstrate the first system 1952 Nov. 19, but with a poor
picture. A second system in 1953 March used 4 heads rather
than 3 but problems continued with "Venetian blinds" effect
due to discontinuous recording from one head to the next. By
1954, the Ampex team included with Charles E. Anderson,
Shelby Henderson, Fred Pfost, and Alex Maxey. By 1955
Feb. Anderson designed an FM circuit; Ray Dolby rejoined
the team after his stint in the Army and designed a
multivibrator modulator by Feb. 25; Maxey discovered how
to vary tape tension and Pfost developed a new
sandwich-type magnetic head. The improved model was
shown in 1956 Feb. to Bill Lodge of CBS and other TV
people in preparation for the first public demonstration in
April. The Mark IV went on public display 1956 April 16, at
the Chicago convention of the National Association of Radio
and Television Broadcasters, the same day that Ray Dolby
demonstrated the older Mark III in Redwood City. The Mark
IV, later renamed the VRX-1000, used 2-inch wide 3M tape
at 15 in/s over rotating head assembly recording at a slant on
tape surface with AM** sound. During the next 4 weeks,
Ampex took orders worth 4.5 million dollars, and took out a
trademark on the name "videotape" for its recorder. CBS
used a new Ampex VTR for the delayed broadcast of
"Douglas Edwards and the News" 1956 Nov. 30. Color
videotape was used to record the Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen
Debate in Moscow in 1959. (16) </span></span></p>

in September demonstrated prototype helical scan model
VTR-1, with 2-inch tape running at 15 in/s over just one
head. After the demonstration, Sony began to develop the
helical scan VTR. Sony persuaded Ampex to share its VTR
patents and Sony shared transistorized circuitry with Ampex.
In 1961, JVC (founded as the American-owned Victor Co.
of Japan in 1946, but owned by Matsushita since 1953)
demonstrated helical scan color VTR with 2 heads to
compete with Sony's PV100 that was adopted by American
Airlines in 1964 for in-flight movies. Helical scan
technology held great promise for its potential to reduce the
size of tape machines and permit slow motion and stop
action effects, but not for another decade. The first "instant
replay" on commercial television in 1967 March at the ABC
"World Series of Skiing" in Vail, Colorado, was not by
videotape but with the Ampex HS-100 color video magnetic
disk recorder. Sony tried to develop a consumer VTR in the
1960s, but the open-reel machines were too large and
complicated and expensive. (17) </span></span></p>

the Philips company introduced the compact cassette for
consumer audio recording and playback on small portable
machines such as the Norelco Carry-Corder 150. Philips
intended the cassette to be used for business dictation, and
had no idea that it would appeal more to consumers who
wanted a simple method to record music. The cassette used
0.15-in (3.81 mm) tape with 4-tracks running at 1-7/8 in/s,
allowing 30 or 45 minutes of stereo music per side, and most
importantly, was only 1/4 the size of other cassette systems.
Earl "Madman" Muntz in California had become successful
putting the 4-track Fidelipac in his cars, and William Lear
modified the Muntz player with new small record heads from
Nortronic to create the 8-track player in 1964, adopted by
RCA and Ford. These players were fine for cars and
Learjets, but too large to carry in your pocket. The Philin/s
compact cassette would soon dominate the world market and
push the 8-track players into the dustbin of history. (18) </span></span></p>

revolution in the 1970's. Sony introduced the 3/4-inch
U-matic VCR in the U.S. in 1971, and for the first time,
allowed other manufacturers to sell machines that could play
the cassette, and thus succeeded in establishing a world
standard for the 3/4-inch videocassette. In 1975 Sony
introduced in the U.S. the Betamax consumer VCR console
for 2295 $ with one-hour 1/2-inch tape cassettes for 15.95 $.
Sony sought to create a standardized format, as it had done
with the U-matic, by getting other companies to produce
machines that would play the Beta cassettes, but refused to
license the cassettes themselves. The next year JVC
introduced the VHS format and a VCR for only 885 $ and
licensed the technology to other companies. Sony would lose
the "Betamax War" with VHS, but it would triumph with the
Walkman portable audio cassette player in 1979. The
TPS-L2 inaugurated a new era of personal music listening.
The Sony family of portable personal music players would
grow to include over 500 models, from the original
pocket-sized 14-oz Walkman to the D-88 Pocket DiscMan of
1988 to the DAT Walkman TCD-D3 of 1991 to the
MiniDisc of 1992 to the digital Discman of 1999. According
to Sony, in the 20-year history of the Walkman devices, 100
million units were sold in the U.S. creating a 1 billion dollar
industry. (19) </span></span></p>

multibillion-dollar industry. IBM had perfected in the 1960s
a method of adhering a magnetic stripe to the surface of a
plastic credit card. This stripe could have multiple tracks and
allow read and write operations from special machines
capable of decoding binary data. American Airlines and
American Express first used striped cards for ticketing at
O'Hare Airport in Chicago. The first of three tracks on early
credit cards was used by the airline industry. The second
track contained identifying information such as account
numbers and names. The third track was read-write and
could hold the balance of an account. The American Banking
Association approved use of the magnetic stripe in 1971 but
most banks resisted its use. In 1972, Dee W. Hock, president
of National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI, later to be called
Visa), adopted the magnetic stripe for its new Uni-Card
division in competition with the cards of the nation's largest
banks, including Bank of America and Citibank. Eventually,
the banks followed his lead and made the magnetic stripe
common on all credit cards. (20) </span></span></p>

the floppy disk. The engineers at IBM who had developed
RAMAC and the early disk drives understood their
significance. In late 1967, a group known as "Dirty Dozen"
left the IBM research lab in San Jose to found Information
Storage Systems (ISS) that sold disk drives through Telex.
They were followed during next three years by over 200
other engineers who would leave IBM for the new disk drive
companies like Memorex and Shugart Associates. After the
departure of the Dirty Dozen, IBM assigned David I. Noble
the job of designing a cheap and simple device to load
operating code into large computers. Called the Initial
Control Program Load, it was supposed to cost only 5 $ and
have a capacity of 256 KB. During 1968 Noble
experimented with tape cartridges, RCA 45-rpm records,
dictating belts, a magnetic disk with grooves developed by
Telefunken, but finally created his own solution -- the floppy
disk. Called the "Minnow," it was a plastic disk 8 inches in
diameter, 1.5 mm thick, coated on one side with iron oxide,
attached to a foam pad and designed to rotate on a turntable
driven by an idler wheel. A read-only magnetic head was
moved over the disk by solenoids and read data from tracks
prerecorded on the disk at a density of 1100 bits per inch.
The disk was "hard-sectored" with 8 holes around the center
to mark the beginning of data sectors. At first, its capacity
was only 81.6 KB, but by Feb. 1969 he had doubled the
thickness of the plastic base to 3 mm and coated both sides
to add more capacity. In June 1969, the Minnow was added
to the IBM System 370 and soon began to be used by other
divisions in IBM. In 1970, the name was changed to Igar and
Noble had a staff of 25 engineers to help him make
improvements. By 1971, Igar became the 33FD disk drive
and the 8-inch floppy disk became the Type 1 diskette. The
speed was 360 rpm, with head access time of 50
milliseconds. The 8 hard sector holes were replaced by a
single index hole for "soft sectors" or "IBM sectoring"
across 77 tracks. In 1976 the 43FD disk drive was sold with
dual heads to read and write to both sides of the diskette. A
new model 53FD was added in 1976 that used modified
frequency modulation to record double-density on both sides,
resulting in a capacity of 1200 KB. (21) </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.0983333in; margin-bottom: 0.0625in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The floppy disk emerged from IBM at the same time the
microprocessor emerged from Intel. When the first Altair
and Imsai microcomputers came on the market in 1974 using
the 8080 processor, there were no peripherals available to
store data or even display words on a CRT screen. The only
input/output device was a Teletype. There wasn't even an
operating system for these new computers. In 1975, Alan
Shugart produced an 8-inch floppy disk to hold 800k that
offered for the first time a low-cost drive for the emerging
personal computer market. In 1976, Jim Adkisson, a Shugart
engineer, sat down for lunch with a customer who
complained that the 8-inch drive was too big for the personal
computer. When Adkisson asked what the size should be, the
customer pointed to a napkin on the table and said, "About
that size." Adkisson returned to the Shugart lab with the
napkin and designed the 5.25-inch floppy drive, introduced
in 1976 as the model SA400 with a capacity of 110 KB. The
model became one of Shugart's best sellers, with shipments
the rose to 4000 drives per day. The company turned to
Matsushita in Japan to help make the drives, starting that
company on its rise to becoming the largest floppy drive
manufacturer in the world. Sony developed a 3.5-inch floppy
drive by 1980 and began a two-year effort to make it the U.S.
floppy disk standard. Sony declared that its new drive was
smaller, faster, better protected, and could fit in a shirt
pocket. A group of U. S. disk manufacturers opposed the
new standard. The group was led by Shugart Associates and
Control Data, and included Verbatim, Micro Peripherals,
Dysan and Tabor. They sought to keep the standard 8-inch
and 5.25-inch disks made by U.S. companies since IBM
introduced the floppy disk in 1971. However, no American
company had a product equal to the Japanese diskette. Sales
of the 3.5-inch floppy began to surpass the 5.25-inch version
by 1989, and Japanese companies would drive most U.S.
disk producers out of the market. (22) </span></span></p>

the cassette and disk and magnetic tape. In1986 Sony/Philips
introduced Digital Audio Tape, or DAT, as a result of efforts
of the 81-member firm R-DAT consortium to develop a
recordable version of the optical compact disc. Because of
copyright problems, electronics firms delayed development
of consumer products and DAT remained a high-priced
professional medium. In 1991 the Alesis Corporation of Los
Angeles introduced its new ADAT machine that recorded 8
tracks of digital audio to a standard S-VHS videocassette
using the same helical scan technology that created the
videocassette boom in the 1970s. With a list price of 3995 $,
and cassettes at 15 $, the ADAT made multitrack digital
recording affordable for the small studio, with the ability to
connect together up to 16 ADATs for a total of 128
synchronized tracks. 20,000 were sold in its first year from
1992 October to 1993 November and 80,000 sold by 1998.
The Electronic Musician declared in 1992 Oct. that "ADAT
is more than a technological innovation; it's a social force."
In 1992 Sony began sales of the MiniDisc that had been
announced 1991 May 30. The MD was a recordable
magneto-optical disc encased in a plastic cartridge with the
same 74-minute capacity as the CD but at half the size and
with greater compression. The MD was intended to replace
the CD and the compact cassette. Sales of cassette tapes
began to decline in1989, and Sony felt that the compact
cassette system was nearing the end. In1993 the Tascam
division of Teac introduced in February the DA-88 digital
8-track recorder for 4,499 $, the first modular digital
multitrack (MDM) recorder to use the Hi-8 videotape.
In1997 sales began of the Digital Video cassettes following
the DV and miniDV standard introduced by Panasonic &amp;
Sony. In 1999 Panasonic announced Digital-VHS (DVHS),
the first VCR capable of recording all 18 Digital TV format
including HDTV. Just as computers continued to use
magnetic hard disks to store data, audio recording continued
to use magnetic tape and cassettes for the new era of digital
sound. (23) </span></span></p>

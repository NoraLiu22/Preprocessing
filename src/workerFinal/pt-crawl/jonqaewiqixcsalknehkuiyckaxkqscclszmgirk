It was the largest empire in the world at the time and covered much of modern-day Iraq, Syria, and parts of Iran, Turkey, and Egypt. The Neo-Assyrians were known for their military might, efficient administration, and innovative use of technology, including the development of siege warfare and the use of iron weapons. They also had a well-organised system of government, with a king who had absolute power and a bureaucracy that helped him govern. <br /><br />One of the most notable achievements of the Neo-Assyrians was their expansion of the empire through military conquest. They employed a standing army, which was one of the largest and most well-trained in the ancient world. The army was divided into specialised units, such as archers, infantry, and charioteers, and was equipped with advanced weapons and tactics. The Neo-Assyrians also developed a reputation for their brutal treatment of conquered peoples, often employing mass deportations and massacres to ensure obedience. <br /><br />Despite their military might, the Neo-Assyrians were also known for their cultural achievements, particularly in the fields of art, literature, and science. They were great patrons of the arts and architecture, and built impressive structures such as the palace of King Sargon II at Dur-Sharrukin. They also produced great works of literature, including the epic of Gilgamesh, and made significant advances in science and medicine, with scholars producing important works on astronomy, mathematics, and the human body.  <br /><br /></b><!-- text above adapted from ChatGPT-->  <p><a href="images43/IMG_1691map.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1691mapsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1691mapsm" width="950" height="753" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Map of the area of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. <br /><br /> Photo: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Vorderasiatisches Museum, Ausführung: Christoph Forster, datalina  <br /> Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <br /><table align="center" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" class="style3">	<thead>        <tr>            <th class="headline" colspan="5" align="center" >Kings of Neo-Assyria</th>		</tr>	</thead>		<tbody>		<tr>            <th class="headlinelower" align="center" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th> 			<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Clickable<br />Image</th>			<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Years</th>			<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Dates</th>			<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Comments</th>        </tr>        <tr>		<td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#ashurdanii">Ashur-dan&nbsp;II</A></td>                 	<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#ashurdanii" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/assurdanstatuethumb.jpg" alt = "assurdanstatuethumb" width="100" height="251" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >23</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >934&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;912&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Ashur-Dan II, son of Tiglath Pileser II, was the earliest king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. He was best known for recapturing previously held Assyrian territory and restoring Assyria to its natural borders, from Tur Abdin (southeast Turkey) to the foothills beyond Arbel (Iraq). The reclaimed territory through his conquest was fortified with horses, ploughs, and grain stores. His military and economic expansions benefited four subsequent generations of kings that replicated his model. Ashur-Dan was the first king to conduct regular military campaigns in over a century. His military campaigns primarily focused on northern territories along mountainous terrain that made controlling it problematic.  These areas were vital because they lay close to the Assyrian heartland and thus were vulnerable to enemy attacks. </td>        </tr>                                       <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#adadii">Adad-nirari II</A></td>                   			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#adadii" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/adad_nirari_II_thumb.jpg" alt = "adad_nirari_II_thumb" width="100" height="145" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></td>              <td class="style1" align="center" >21</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >911&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;891&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Adad-nirari firmly subjugated the areas previously under only nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting troublesome Arameans.

He also campaigned to the west, subjugating the Aramean cities of Kadmuh and Nisibin. Along with vast amounts of treasure collected, he also secured the Kabur river region.

The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art.  He was renowned for his brutality, using enslaved captives to build a new Assyrian capital at Kalhu (Nimrud) in Mesopotamia where he built many impressive monuments.  He was also a shrewd administrator, who realised that he could gain greater control over his empire by installing Assyrian governors, rather than depending on local client rulers paying tribute.			</td>        </tr>                                          <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#shaliii">Shalmaneser&nbsp;III</A></td>                                  			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#shaliii" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ShalmaneseriiiBM118884thumb.jpg" alt = "ShalmaneseriiiBM118884thumb" width="100" height="179" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></td>                                                  			<td class="style1" align="center" >35</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >858&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;824&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >  Shalmaneser III expanded the Assyrian Empire to include parts of modern-day Turkey, Iran, and Syria. He was known for his military campaigns, which he recorded on the Black Obelisk, a monument that lists the kings he defeated and tribute he received. One of Shalmaneser's most significant military campaigns was against the state of Urartu, located in modern-day Armenia. He attacked Urartu several times, almost every year of his reign, and eventually defeated the Urartian king Sarduri II in 843 BC. Shalmaneser also campaigned against the Aramaean states, including Damascus and Israel. He besieged Damascus twice but was unable to capture it. However, his campaigns weakened the Aramaean states and allowed Assyria to gain control over them. Shalmaneser  was also known for his building projects, including the construction of the Central Palace at Nimrud. The palace was decorated with reliefs depicting scenes from Shalmaneser's military campaigns and showed his power and authority as the king of Assyria. He also built several temples in his honour, including the temple of Ninurta at Kalhu.  		</td>        </tr>                                               <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#shamv">Shamshi-Adad&nbsp;V</A></td>                                                                			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#shamv" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/shamsiadadvthumb.jpg" alt = "shamsiadadvthumb" width="100" height="150" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></td>                                			<td class="style1" align="center" >13</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >823&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;811&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >The first years of Shamshi-Adad's reign saw a serious struggle for the succession of the aged Shalmaneser.

The rebellious brother, according to Shamshi-Adad's own inscriptions, succeeded in bringing to his side 27 important cities, including Nineveh. The rebellion lasted until 820&nbsp;BC,  weakening the Assyrian empire and its ruler.   Later in his reign, Shamshi-Adad campaigned against Southern Mesopotamia, and signed a treaty with the Babylonian king Marduk-zakir-shumi I. In 814&nbsp;BC, he won the Battle of Dur-Papsukkal against the Babylonian king Marduk-balassu-iqbi, and a few Aramean tribes settled in Babylonia. The extent of Shamshi-Adad's victory was such that he obtained the submission of the Babylonian king and, after obtaining booty from several Babylonian cities, he returned to Assyria with palace treasures and sacred statues of gods. 				</td>        </tr>            	                                                      <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#adadiii">Adad-nirari&nbsp;II</A></td>                                			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#adadiii" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2409attendantgodthumb.jpg" alt = "IMG_2409attendantgodthumb" width="100" height="143" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></td>   			<td class="style1" align="center" >28</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >810&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;783&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" > Adad-nirari's youth at the time of his ascension to the throne, and the struggles his father had faced early in his reign, caused a serious weakening of Assyrian rulership over their indigenous Mesopotamia, and made way for the ambitions of officers, governors, and local rulers.

Among his actions was a siege of Damascus in the time of Ben-Hadad&nbsp;III in 796 BC, which led to the eclipse of the Aramaean Kingdom of Damascus and allowed the recovery of Israel under Jehoash (who paid the Assyrian king tribute at this time) and Jeroboam II.

This period also extends throughout the reigns of his two immediate successors, his brothers Ashur-dan&nbsp;III and Ashur-nirari&nbsp;V. By the end of Adad-nirari III's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was declining. In particular, the power of the king himself was being threatened due to the emergence of extraordinarily powerful officials, whom while they accepted the authority of the Assyrian monarch in practice acted with supreme authority themselves and began to issue their own inscriptions, similar to those of the kings.  This arrangement continued during the reign of Shalmaneser and his immediate successors, a time from which inscriptions from such officials are more common than inscriptions by the kings themselves.  At the same time, the enemies of Assyria grew stronger and more threatening. This period of Assyrian decline coincided with the peak of the northern Kingdom of Urartu. 			</td>        </tr>                                            <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#ashuriii">Ashur-dan&nbsp;III</A></td>                                   			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#ashuriii" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ashur_dan_eclipsebthumb.jpg" alt = "ashur_dan_eclipsebthumb" width="100" height="130" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></td>                              			<td class="style1" align="center" >18</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >772&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;755&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Ashur-dan ruled during a period of Assyrian decline from which few sources survive.

Ashur-dan's reign was a particularly difficult one as he was faced with two outbreaks of plague and five of his eighteen years as king were devoted to putting down revolts. 			</td>        </tr>                                                   <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#ashurnv">Ashur-nirari&nbsp;V</A></td>                                        			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#ashurnv" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ashurniraritabletthumb.jpg" alt = "ashurniraritabletthumb" width="100" height="130" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></td>                                                   			<td class="style1" align="center" >10</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >754&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;745&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" > Like his predecessor, Ashur-nirari ruled during a period of Assyrian decline from which few sources survive.

He ended a period of Assyrian stagnation, introduced numerous political and military reforms and more than doubled the lands under Assyrian control. Because of the massive expansion and centralisation of Assyrian territory and establishment of a standing army, some researchers consider Tiglath-Pileser's reign to mark the true transition of Assyria into an empire. The reforms and methods of control introduced under Tiglath-Pileser laid the groundwork for policies enacted not only by later Assyrian kings but also by later empires for millennia after his death.  	            	            Tiglath-Pileser early on increased royal power and authority through curbing the influence of prominent officials and generals. After securing some minor victories in 744 and 743, he defeated the Urartian king Sarduri II in battle near Arpad in 743.   After defeating Sarduri, Tiglath-Pileser turned his attention to the Levant. Over the course of several years, Tiglath-Pileser conquered most of the Levant, defeating and then either annexing or subjugating previously influential kingdoms, notably ending the kingdom of Aram-Damascus. Tiglath-Pileser's activities in the Levant were recorded in the Hebrew Bible. After a few years of conflict, Tiglath-Pileser conquered Babylonia in 729, becoming the first king to rule as both king of Assyria and king of Babylon. 	            	        </td>        </tr>                                                     <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#shalmv">Shalmaneser&nbsp;V</A></td>                                                                          			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#shalmv" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2252_BM_118933shalmaneservsmthumb.jpg" alt = "IMG_2252_BM_118933shalmaneservsmthumb" width="100" height="168" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>                                    			<td class="style1" align="center" >5</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >726&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;722&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >  Shalmaneser campaigned extensively in the lands west of the Assyrian heartland, warring not only against the Israelites, but also against the Phoenician city-states and against kingdoms in Anatolia.

The circumstances of his deposition and death are not clear, though they were likely violent, and it is unlikely that Sargon II was his legitimate heir. It is possible that Sargon II was entirely unrelated, which would make Shalmaneser V the final king of the Adaside dynasty, which had ruled Assyria for almost a thousand years. 	        </td>        </tr>                                                              <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#sargon">Sargon&nbsp;II</A></td>                                                                          			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#sargon" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1329sargon_stele_cyprusthumb.jpg" alt = "IMG_1329sargon_stele_cyprusthumb" width="100" height="167" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>                        			<td class="style1" align="center" >17</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >721&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;705&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" > Modelling his reign on the legends of the ancient rulers Sargon of Akkad, from whom Sargon II likely took his regnal name, and Gilgamesh, Sargon aspired to conquer the known world, initiate a golden age and a new world order, and be remembered and revered by future generations.

An accomplished warrior-king and military strategist, Sargon personally led his troops into battle. By the end of his reign, all of his major enemies and rivals had been either defeated or pacified. Among Sargon's greatest accomplishments were the stabilisation of Assyrian control over the Levant, the weakening of the northern kingdom of Urartu, and the reconquest of Babylonia. From 717 to 707, Sargon constructed a new Assyrian capital named after himself, Dur-Sharrukin ('Fort Sargon'), which he made his official residence in 706. 	        </td>        </tr>                                                              <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#senna">Sennacherib</A></td>                                                           			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#senna" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/sennacheribportraitthumb.jpg" alt = "sennacheribportraitthumb" width="100" height="137" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>           			<td class="style1" align="center" >24</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >704&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;681&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >  	      The second king of the Sargonid dynasty, Sennacherib is one of the most famous Assyrian kings for the role he plays in the Hebrew Bible, which describes his campaign in the Levant. (II Kings, II Chronicles, and Isaiah). 	        	        Although Sennacherib was one of the most powerful and wide-ranging Assyrian kings, he faced considerable difficulty in controlling Babylonia, which formed the southern portion of his empire.   Because Babylon,  had been the target of most of his military campaigns and had caused the death of his son, Sennacherib destroyed the city in 689 BC. Sennacherib transferred the capital of Assyria to Nineveh, where he had spent most of his time as crown prince. To transform Nineveh into a capital worthy of his empire, he launched one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history. He expanded the size of the city and constructed great city walls, numerous temples and a royal garden. His most famous work in the city is the Southwest Palace, which Sennacherib named his 'Palace without Rival'. In 681 BC, he was murdered by two of his sons who hoped to seize the throne, but another son,  Esarhaddon raised an army and seized Nineveh, installing himself as king as intended by Sennacherib.   </td>        </tr>                                                              <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#esar">Esarhaddon</A></td>                                                			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#esar" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/esarentrythumb.jpg" alt = "esarentrythumb" width="100" height="181" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>                			<td class="style1" align="center" >12</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >680&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;669&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >  Esarhaddon is most famous for his conquest of Egypt in 671 BC, which made his empire the largest the world had ever seen, and for his reconstruction of Babylon, which had been destroyed by his father.  After a very difficult ascension to the throne, Esarhaddon was plagued by paranoia and mistrust for his officials, governors and male family members until the end of his reign. As a result of this paranoia, most of the palaces used by Esarhaddon were high-security fortifications located outside of the major population centres of the cities.   Also perhaps resulting from his mistrust for his male relatives, Esarhaddon's female relatives, such as his mother Naqiʾa and his daughter Serua-eterat, were allowed to wield considerably more influence and political power during his reign than women had been allowed in any previous period of Assyrian history. Despite a relatively short and difficult reign, and being plagued by paranoia, depression and constant illness, Esarhaddon remains recognised as one of the greatest and most successful Assyrian kings. He quickly defeated his brothers in 680, completed ambitious and large-scale building projects in both Assyria and Babylonia, successfully campaigned in Media, the Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia, the Caucasus, and the Levant, defeated and conquered Lower Egypt, and ensured a peaceful transition of power to his   Ashurbanipal   after his death.   </td>        </tr>                                                         <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#ashurb">Ashurbanipal</A></td>                                            			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#ashurb" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ashurbanipal_bronzethumb.jpg" alt = "ashurbthumb" width="100" height="136" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>                                                                        			<td class="style1" align="center" >38</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >668&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;631&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >   Ashurbanipal  is generally remembered as the last great king of Assyria. Inheriting the throne as the favoured heir of his father Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal's 38-year reign was among the longest of any Assyrian king. Though sometimes regarded as the apogee of ancient Assyria, his reign also marked the last time Assyrian armies waged war throughout the ancient Near East and the beginning of the end of Assyrian dominion over the region.  Much of the early years of Ashurbanipal's reign was spent fighting rebellions in Egypt, which had been conquered by his father. Much of Ashurbanipal's late reign is poorly known.Ashurbanipal is chiefly remembered today for his cultural efforts. A patron of artwork and literature, Ashurbanipal was deeply interested in the ancient literary culture of Mesopotamia. Over the course of his long reign, Ashurbanipal utilised the massive resources at his disposal to construct the Library of Ashurbanipal, a collection of texts and documents of various different genres. Perhaps comprising over 100&nbsp;000 texts at its height, the Library of Ashurbanipal was not surpassed until the construction of the Library of Alexandria.			</td>        </tr>                                                         <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#brick">Ashur-etil-ilani</A></td>                                               			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#brick" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ashuretililanibrickthumb.jpg" alt = "ashuretililanibrickthumb" width="100" height="106" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>                                       			<td class="style1" align="center" >8</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >630&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;623&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >   The spread of inscriptions by Ashur-etil-ilani   in Babylonia suggest that he exercised the same amount of control in the southern provinces as his father Ashurbanipal had, having a vassal king (Kandalanu) but exercising actual political and military power there himself. His inscriptions are known from all the major cities, including Babylon, Dilbat, Sippar and Nippur.  Too few inscriptions of Ashur-etil-ilani survive to make any certain assumptions about his character. Excavations of his palace at Kalhu, one of the more important cities in the empire and a former capital, may indicate that he was less boastful than his father as it had no reliefs or statues similar to those that his predecessors had used to illustrate their strength and success. There are no records of Aššur-etil-ilāni ever conducting a military campaign or going on a hunt. His Kalhu palace was quite small with unusually small rooms by Assyrian royal standards.  			</td>        </tr>                                                            <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#burn">Sin-shar-ishkun</A></td>                                                  			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#burn" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/letter_of_Sinsharraishkunthumb.jpg" alt = "letter_of_Sinsharraishkunthumb" width="100" height="121" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>                                                   			<td class="style1" align="center" >11</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >622&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;612&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >   On taking the throne, Sin-shar-ishkun was immediately faced by the revolt of one of his brother's chief generals,   who attempted unsuccessfully to usurp the throne for himself. This failed attempt on the throne contributed to instability, and Sin-shar-ishkun lost control of Babylonia to Nabopolassar, who consolidated his power and formed the  Neo-Babylonian Empire, restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule.This Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed Median Empire under Cyaxares, then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked Assur, the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked, brutally sacked, and razed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital.  What doomed Assyria might   have been the lack of an effective defensive plan for the Assyrian heartland, which had not been invaded in five hundred years, combined with having to face an enemy which aimed to outright destroy Assyria rather than simply conquer it.   			</td>        </tr>                                 <tr><td class="style1" align="left" ><A HREF ="#battle">Ashur-uballit II</A></td>                                                               			<td class="style1" align="center" ><a href="#battle" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/battlethumb.jpg" alt = "battlethumb" width="100" height="140" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5">            </td>                                      			<td class="style1" align="center" >3</td>            <td class="style1" align="center" >612&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;609&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >   Ashur-uballit II   was the final ruler of Assyria, ruling from his predecessor Sin-shar-ishkun's death at the Fall of Nineveh in 612 BC to his own defeat at Harran in 609 BC.  He was possibly the son of Sin-shar-ishkun  and likely the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh in 626 and 623 BC.Over the course of Sin-shar-ishkun's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had been irreversibly weakened.  However,  Ashur-uballit rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at Harran where, bolstered by an alliance with Egypt, he ruled for three years. His identification as 'king of Assyria' comes from Babylonian sources. Contemporary Assyrian inscriptions suggest that the Assyrians saw Ashur-uballit  as their legitimate ruler, but continued to refer to him as 'crown prince' seeing as he could not undergo the traditional Assyrian coronation ceremony at Assur and thus hadn't formally been bestowed with the kingship by the Assyrian chief deity, Ashur. His rule at Harran came to an end when the city was seized by Medo-Babylonian forces in 610 BC. Ashur-uballit's attempt at retaking it in 609 BC was repulsed whereafter he is no longer mentioned in contemporary chronicles, signalling the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy.      </tbody></table><br /><br /><center>Table of Neo-Assyrian  Kings, adapted  from various sources, including cdli.ox.ac.uk <!--cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=neo-assyrian_empire --> and Wikipedia.</center><br /><br clear ="all"> <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><a name="ashurdanii"></a>   <h1>King Ashur-dan II</h1><p><a href="images43/assyria_934_bc2g.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/assyria_934_bc2gsm.jpg" alt = "assyria_934_bc2gsm" width="950" height="799" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p> Map of Assyria 1392 CC - 934 BC<br /><br /> This map shows the extent of the Assyrian Empire when King Ashur-dan II came to the throne.

The stela consists of a small boulder, on one face of which a fiat panel has been sunk, leaving figures and symbols standing out within it in low relief. The greater part of the inscription has been carved upon the flat surface of the panel, but the last seven lines extend below the panel to the base of the stone.<br /><br />The stela is set up in honour of Adad-etir, the dagger-bearer of Marduk, by his eldest son. The name Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, which occurs in l. 4, is that of Adad-etir's son, not the name of the king to whom Adad-etir owed allegiance; and the two figures standing on the lower ledge of the panel represent Adad-etir and his eldest son, not Adad-etir and the king. The stele is closely related to a kudurru, since it is protected by carved symbols and by the addition of imprecatory clauses to the text. These symbols include (1) winged solar disc; (2) crescent; and (3) lion-headed mace upon a pedestal. <br /><br />   Findspot: Marduk Temple (Babylon)<br /><br /> Diameter 127 mm, height 380 mm, thickness 127 mm, width 270 mm.<br /><br />  Inscription translation of cuneiform: (1) (This) image of Adad-etir, the dagger-bearer of Marduk, (2) adorned by Sin, Shamash, and Nergal, (3) who fears Nabu and Marduk, who owes allegiance (4) to the king, his lord, Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, (5) his eldest son, has fashioned, (6) and for future days, (7) for his seed and his posterity, (8) has set up.

The figures represent father and son together, and their shaven heads show that they are both priests, it being normal in ancient Mesopotamia for a son to adopt his father's profession<br /><br />There are three divine symbols above the two priests: a winged solar disc representing the sun-god Shamash, a crescent of the moon-god Sin and a lion-headed mace on a pedestal.<br /><br />The cuneiform inscription includes curses on anyone who may deface the stela. It translates: 'May Marduk, the great lord, in anger look upon him, and his name and his seed may he cause to disappear. May Nabu, the scribe of all, curtail the number of his days. But may the man who protects it be satisfied with the fullness of life.'<br /><br />Since the fourth line of the inscription, taken from its context, contains the words 'the king his lord Marduk-balatsu-ikbi,' the stele has been traditionally assigned to the reign of Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, king of Babylon about 830 B.C.<br /><br /> That the two figures do not represent Adad-etir paying homage to his king is sufficiently obvious, from the absence of any royal headdress and other royal insignia from the taller figure. Further, the phrase 'ka-rib šarri-šu' is simply a descriptive title, on a par with 'si-mat (ilu)Sin (ilu)Šamaš u (ilu)Nergal' and 'pa-liḫ (ilu)Nabû u (ilu)Marduk'; the three phrases describe Adad-etir's personal endowments and his correct attitude towards divine and human authority. The writer merely refers to Adad-etir's loyalty: the name of the reigning king is immaterial and is therefore omitted.<br /><br />On the other hand, Adad-etir's eldest son, who set up the stele as an act of piety, was not likely to omit his own name; and in the sculptured figures he represents himself paying homage to his father. It may be noted that the figures are dressed precisely alike, the only difference being that the father is taller than the son. Each raises one hand and rests the other on the handle of the dagger in his belt.<br /><br />    This stela comes from the Temple of Marduk in Babylon. It is a commemorative monument set up in honour of a private individual called Adad-etir. He was an official in the temple, known as 'the dagger bearer', and this stela was erected by his son Marduk-balassu-iqbi. The figures carved in relief on the front represent the father and son together. Their shaven heads show that they are both priests, it being normal in ancient Mesopotamia for a son to adopt his father's profession. There are three divine symbols above the two priests: a winged solar disc representing the sun-god Shamash, a crescent of the moon-god Sin and a lion-headed mace on a pedestal.<br /><br />  Associated names:<br /><br />Named in inscription: Adad-Etir (temple official)<br />Named in inscription: Marduk-balassu-iqbi (Dedicator of stela)<br />Named in inscription: Marduk<br />Named in inscription: Nabu<br />Named in inscription: Sin<br />Named in inscription: Shamash<br /><br />Associated places<br /><br />Named in inscription: Marduk Temple (Babylon)<br />Asia: Middle East: Iraq: Iraq, South: Marduk Temple (Babylon)    <br /><br /> Catalog: Diorite or granite, ME 90834<br /> Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: &copy;  Card with the display at the British Museum,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />   <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><a name="tukult"></a> <h1>King Tukulti-Ninurta II</h1><p> <a href="images43/tukultininurta.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/tukultininurtasm.jpg" alt = "tukultininurtasm" width="500" height="702" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Reign of King Tukulti-Ninurta II (890&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;884&nbsp;BC)<br /><br /> Wall-tile<br /><br /></b> Glazed wall-tile of fired clay  showing a charioteer.

It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as the largest city in the world for several decades. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.<br /><br />It was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years  until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of a Christian bishop. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 13th century AD.<br /><br />Its ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul, in Iraq's Nineveh Governorate. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus, site of a shrine to Jonah, the prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large amounts of Assyrian sculpture and other artifacts have been excavated there, and are now located in museums around the world. <br /><br />Photo:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Layard (1853)</span></a> from a sketch by James Fergusson  (1808–1886)<br /> Proximal source: New York Public Library<br /> Text: Wikipedia </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images43/ninevehlayard1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ninevehlayard1sm.jpg" alt = "ninevehlayard1sm" width="950" height="589" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Restoration of a hall in an Assyrian Palace.  <br /><br />Photo:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Layard (1849)</span></a>  <br /> Proximal source: New York Public Library </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />  <p> <a href="images43/Ninevehmashkigate.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/Ninevehmashkigatesm.jpg" alt = "Ninevehmashkigatesm" width="950" height="604" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b> Nineveh - Mashki Gate</b><br /><br />The reconstructed Mashki Gate of Nineveh.

From Nimrud.<br /><br />This protective spirit guarded the entrance into what may have been a banquet hall. <br /><br /> From the ninth to the seventh century B.C., the kings of Assyria ruled over a vast empire centered in northern Iraq. The great Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (reigned 883–859 BC), undertook a vast building program at Nimrud, ancient Kalhu. Until it became the capital city under Ashurnasirpal, Nimrud had been no more than a provincial town.<br /><br />The new capital occupied an area of about nine hundred acres, around which Ashurnasirpal constructed a mudbrick wall that was 120 feet thick, 42 feet high, and five miles long. In the southwest corner of this enclosure was the acropolis, where the temples, palaces, and administrative offices of the empire were located. In 879 BC Ashurnasirpal held a festival for 69&nbsp;574 people to celebrate the construction of the new capital, and the event was documented by an inscription that read: 'the happy people of all the lands together with the people of Kalhu — for ten days I feasted, wined, bathed, and honoured them and sent them back to their homes in peace and joy.'<br /><br />The so-called Standard Inscription that ran across the surface of most of the reliefs described Ashurnasirpal's palace: 'I built thereon [a palace with] halls of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood, teak, terebinth, and tamarisk  as my royal dwelling and for the enduring leisure life of my lordship.' The inscription continues: 'Beasts of the mountains and the seas, which I had fashioned out of white limestone and alabaster, I had set up in its gates. I made it [the palace] fittingly imposing.'<br /><br /> Among such stone beasts is the human-headed, winged lion (lamassu) pictured here. The horned cap attests to its divinity, and the belt signifies its power. The sculptor gave these guardian figures five legs so that they appear to be standing firmly when viewed from the front but striding forward when seen from the side. Lamassu protected and supported important doorways in Assyrian palaces.<br /><br />Dimensions: 311  x 62  x 277 cm, 7257 kg<br /><br />Catalog:  Medium: Gypsum alabaster,  Accession Number: 32.143.2 <br />Credit Line: Gift of John D.

Occasionally, on narrow panels, part of the text was omitted. Otherwise there was no significant variation and the catalogue of royal titles, claims and achievements was simply repeated over and over again. <br /><br /><blockquote><b>Palace of Ashurnasirpal, priest of Ashur, favourite of Enlil and Ninurtya, beloved of Anu and Dagan, the weapon of the great gods, the mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria; son of Tukulti-Ninurta, the great king, the mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria; the valiant man, who acts with the support of Ashur, his lord, and has no equal among the princes of the four quarters of the world; the wonderful shepherd who is not afraid of battle; the great flood which none can oppose; the king who makes those who makes those who are not subject to him submissive; who has subjugated all mankind; the mighty warrior who treads on the neck of his enemies, tramples down all foes, and shatters the forces of the proud; the king who acts with the support of the great gods, and whose hand has conquered all lands, who has subjugated all the mountains and received their tribute, taking hostages and establishing his power over all countries. <br /><br />When Ashur, the lord who called me by name and has made my kingdom great, entrusted his merciless weapon to my lordly arms, I overthrew the widespread troops of the land of Lullume in battle. With the assistance of Shamash and Adad, the gods who help me, I thundered like Adad the destroyer over troops of the Nairi lands, Habhi, Shubaru, and Nirib. I am the king who has brought into submission at his feet the lands from beyond the Tigris to Mount Lebanon and the Great Sea (the Mediterranean), the whole of the land of Laqe, the land of Suhi as far as Rapiqu, and whose hand has conquered from the source of the river Subnat to the land of Urartu. <br /><br />The area from the mountain passes of Kirruri to the land of Gilzanu, from beyond the Lower Zab to the city of Til-sha-Zabdani, Hirimu and Harutu, fortresses of the land of Karduniash (Babylonia), I have restored to the borders of my land. From the mountain passes of Babite to the land of Hashmar I have counted the inhabitants of my land. Over the lands which I have subjugated I have appointed my governors, and they do obeisance. <br /><br />I am Ashurnasirpal, the celebrated prince, who reveres the great gods, the fierce dragon, conqueror of the cities and mountains to their furthest extent, king of rulers who has tamed the stiff-necked peoples, who is crowned with splendour, who is not afraid of battle, the merciless champion who shakes resistance, the glorious king, the shepherd, the protection of the whole world, the king, the word of whose mouth destroys mountains and seas, who by his lordly attack has forced fierce and merciless kings from the rising to the setting sun to acknowledge one rule.<br /><br />The former city of Kalhu (Nimrud) which Shalmaneser king of Assyria, a prince who preceded me, had built, that city had fallen into ruins and lay deserted. That city I built anew. I took the peoples from whom my hand had conquered from the lands which I had subjugated, from the land of Suhi, from the whole of the land of Laqe, from the city of Sirqu on the other side of the Euphrates, from the furthest extent of the land of Zamua, from teh Bit-Adini and the land of Hatte, and from Lubarna, king of the island of Patina, and made them settle there. <br /><br />I removed the ancient mound and dug down to the water level. I sank the foundations 120 brick courses deep.

From Nimrud, the North-West Palace.<br /><br />From the ninth to the seventh century B.C., the kings of Assyria ruled over a vast empire centred in northern Iraq. The great Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (reigned 883–859 BC), undertook a vast building program at Nimrud, ancient Kalhu. Until it became the capital city under Ashurnasirpal, Nimrud had been no more than a provincial town.<br /><br />The new capital occupied an area of about nine hundred acres, around which Ashurnasirpal constructed a mudbrick wall that was 120 feet thick, 42 feet high, and five miles long. In the southwest corner of this enclosure was the acropolis, where the temples, palaces, and administrative offices of the empire were located. In 879 B.C. Ashurnasirpal held a festival for 69&nbsp;574 people to celebrate the construction of the new capital, and the event was documented by an inscription that read: 'the happy people of all the lands together with the people of Kalhu—for ten days I feasted, wined, bathed, and honoured them and sent them back to their home in peace and joy.'<br /><br /><a name="standard"><br /></a><b>The so-called Standard Inscription that ran across the surface of most of the reliefs described Ashurnasirpal's palace: 'I built thereon [a palace with] halls of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood, teak, terebinth, and tamarisk [?] as my royal dwelling and for the enduring leisure life of my lordship.' The inscription continues: 'Beasts of the mountains and the seas, which I had fashioned out of white limestone and alabaster, I had set up in its gates. I made it [the palace] fittingly imposing.'</b><br /><br /> Among such stone beasts is the human-headed, winged bull pictured here. The horned cap attests to its divinity, and the belt signifies its power. The sculptor gave these guardian figures five legs so that they appear to be standing firmly when viewed from the front but striding forward when seen from the side. Lamassu protected and supported important doorways in Assyrian palaces.<br /><br /> Dimensions 314 x 67  x 310 cm, 7257 kg.<br /><br />Catalog:  Medium: Gypsum alabaster,  Accession Number: 32.143.1 <br />Credit Line: Gift of John D.

The sculptures above are from the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (reigned 883–859 BC), a king whose military expeditions to the west reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, and helped lay the foundations for an empire that came to dominate the Near Eastern political landscape from the ninth through seventh centuries B.C. The king himself is depicted on one of the reliefs (32.143.4). Ashurnasirpal moved from the traditional Assyrian capital, Ashur, to Nimrud, and there built a new and spectacular palace, today called the Northwest Palace for its position on the site’s citadel. Texts survive describing the palace’s completion and inauguration, involving a banquet for almost 70&nbsp;000 people. The number is probably exaggerated, but there is no doubt that this was a huge festival.<br /><br />Like most ancient Near Eastern palaces, the Northwest Palace was made of mud brick. Ashurnasirpal seems to have been the first Assyrian king to line his palace walls with stone bas-reliefs, and his inscriptions boast of finding and utilising the stone that made it possible. This stone, which could be quarried locally, is a gypsum, sometimes called alabaster (it is almost white when first cut) and colloquially known as 'Mosul marble' after the nearby modern city. The slabs are extremely heavy, and simply quarrying and transporting the stone for use in the palace was a major undertaking. Once in position, the carving of the reliefs, with their carefully modelled figures and perfectly smooth backgrounds, represented another enormous task. An inscription describing the king’s achievements, today called the <a href="#standard">Standard Inscription</a> was carved across the centre of each panel. It seems likely that the repetition of the inscription, like that of the reliefs’ imagery, formed part of the magical protection of the palace and the king. Finally, the reliefs were brightly painted. Some pigment can still be seen in rare cases (31.72.1), and analysis of microscopic traces can sometimes reveal the original colours even when no paint is visible. Many of the figures in the reliefs wear clothes with embroidered patterns, rendered on the stone as fine engraving (1982.1188.4); these would originally have been picked out in contrasting colours.</blockquote> <br /><br />    <p><a href="images43/IMG_1691mapcentralcentral.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1691mapcentralcentralsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1691mapcentralcentralsm" width="950" height="653" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Map of the central area of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. <br /><br />  <br /><br />Photo: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Vorderasiatisches Museum, Ausführung: Christoph Forster, datalina  <br />Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />   <p><a href="images44/IMG_2312_BM118803spirit.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/IMG_2312_BM118803spiritsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2312_BM118803spiritsm" width="588" height="1200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b>Reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC) <br /><br />Spirit<br /><br /></b> 865 BC - 860 BC<br /><br />  Gypsum wall panel  relief, of a  winged human-headed horned protective spirit with right hand raised and a branch in the left hand, facing right.

The relief shows the king, standing on a light hunting chariot, which is guided by a charioteer and pulled by three horses. Three arrows have hit the lion. The King once again aims an arrow at the lion. The lion has turned its head back and seems to roar at its attacker in pain.The royal lion hunt is a symbol of the King overcoming the dangers and challenges to the Assyrian state by its ruler.<br /><br />Particularly noteworthy is in the initially coloured bas-relief of detail, such as in hunting chariots and weapons, as well as in the richly decorated horses with their teeth.<br /><br />This section of the relief is only the lower part of a three-walled wall relief, the total height of which was about 2300 mm.<br /><br />While the upper register with another narrative relief is lost, only a few remnants of two lines of cuneiform have been preserved from the middle register, which bore the king’s  <a href="#standard">standard inscription</a>.<br /><br />An almost identical representation, now in the British Museum in London, shows the bow-shooting king, who has just killed a male lion.<br /><br />Nimrud has been one of the primary sources of Assyrian sculpture, including the famous palace reliefs.<br /><br />A series of the distinctive Assyrian shallow reliefs were removed from the palaces, and sections are now found in several museums, in particular, the British Museum and the Pergamon Museums. These show scenes of hunting, warfare, ritual, and processions. There are about two dozen sets of scenes of lion hunting in surviving Assyrian palace reliefs.<br /><br />Neo-Assyrian palaces were very extensively decorated with such reliefs, carved in shallow reliefs on slabs that are mostly of gypsum alabaster, which was plentiful in northern Iraq.Other animals were also shown being hunted, and the main subject for narrative reliefs was the war campaigns of the king who built the palace. Other reliefs showed the king, his court, and 'winged genie' and lamassu protective minor deities.<br /><br /> Nimrud is an ancient Assyrian city located 30 kilometres (20 mi) south of the city of Mosul, in the Nineveh plains in Upper Mesopotamia.It was a major Assyrian city between about 1350 BC and 610 BC. The city is located in strategic position north of the point that the river Tigris meets its tributary, the Great Zab.<br /><br />In the mid 19th century, biblical archaeologists proposed the Biblical name of Kalhu (Calah), based on a description in Genesis 10. The city gained fame when king Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC) made it his capital at the expense of Assur.He built a large palace and temples in the city, which fell into disrepair during the Bronze Age Collapse of the mid-11th to mid-10th centuries BC.<br /><br />Archaeological excavations at the site began in 1845, and many vital artifacts were discovered, with most being moved to museums in Iraq and abroad. Historical artefacts from Nimrud can now be found in over 76 museums worldwide, including 36 in the United States and 13 in the United Kingdom.  In 2015, the terrorist organization, the Islāmic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), destroyed much of the site. The excavated remains were damaged because of its Assyrian history.<br /><br />  The relief from the western wing of the so-called Northwest Palace of the royal residence in Kalchu (today Nimrud/Iraq) is only the lower part of a three-register wall relief, the total height of which was approx. 2300 mm. The king is depicted standing on a light hunting chariot, which is led by a driver and drawn by three horses.<br /><br /> Height 970 mm, width 1830 mm, depth 110 mm, weight 555 kg.   <br /><br />Catalog: Gypsum alabaster, Nimrud, VA 00959  <br />  Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Pergamon Museum, Berlin,  www.smb-digital.de/<br />Permalink:  id.smb.museum/object/1743971/relief-mit-darstellung-einer-l%C3%B6wenjagd  </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images43/IMG_2266kingandgoat.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2266kingandgoatsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2266kingandgoatsm" width="700" height="1207" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	<b>Reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)<br /><br />Wall panel;  gypsum alabaster relief from the   North West Palace of Nimrud. <br /><br />	</b> Circa 883 BC - 859 BC.<br /><br />    Gypsum alabaster wall panel depicting a protective spirit in relief: this figure, a man with wings like an angel, is a protective spirit, probably an 'apkallu'.

Layard (1849, 'Nineveh and its Remains', vol. I, p. 118) refers to how at the time of discovery there were extensive traces of black pigment covering the face of the man with the monkeys, and he speculated that this was either from a deliberate attempt to depict a negro or that the paint had washed down from the man's hair. No traces of this are now visible to the naked eye (2008). <br /><br />Layard refers to the survival at the time of excavation of pigment on selective portions of other sculptures at Nimrud, specifically on the hair, beards, eyes and sandals of some sculptures and the red-painted tongue of an eagle-headed genie (ibid., pp. 71-72, 126). The white infilling in the inscription on this particular scuplture may also be ancient and resembles a feature noted on Persepolitan (the capital of ancient Persia) inscriptions.<br /><br />Catalog: Gypsum alabaster,  pigmented,   Nimrud,    BM/Big number    124562 <br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <br /><!-- Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum--></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images43/IMG_2278_bm_98064.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2278_bm_98064sm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2278_bm_98064sm" width="700" height="1024" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	<b>Reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)<br /><br />	Eagle Headed Winged Genie<br /><br /></b> Gypsum alabaster wall panel relief, circa 865&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;860&nbsp;BC, showing an eagle-headed protective spirit in the character of a fertiliser of the date-palm,  facing right and holding a bucket   in one hand and in the other a spathe (leaf-like sheath for the flowers) of the date palm.

Next there are bearded, winged figures wearing a diadem instead of helmet. Finally there are winged, muscular, male figures with bird heads.

A river at the bottom is represented schematically by lines and spirals, and the rough ground by a pattern of scales. The king can be identified by his crown, a conical hat with a pointed top, and his is the grandest beard. The two arrows held upright in his right hand, with the bow lowered in his left, symbolise victory. He wears a sword slung on a swordbelt over his shoulder, and the end of the sheath is decorated with a pair of lions back to back. He has two wristlets; both incorporate rosettes, worn in the position of a modern wrist-watch. A spare bow and two quivers of arrows, an axe and a short javelin are carried in quivers on the side of the cab; decoration including a prancing bull is incised on the quivers.<br /><br />The rear of the chariot, from which a spear-shaft projects diagonally backwards, is closed by a spiked shield with a central boss in the shape of a lion's head. An attendant holds a sunshade over the king's head; in battle this man would use a shield to protect the king from arrows.<br /><br />The charioteer holds four reins in each hand, together with a whip. This is a typical Assyrian royal chariot of the period, holding a maximum of three people (most chariots carried only two crew) with six-spoked wheels. The two legs of a 'Y' shaped yoke pole is visible, rising from the base of the cab and shown in a distorted false perspective. A patterned cloth is visible above the horses' shoulders, attached to the front of the cab and the yoke. The horses themselves, of which royal chariots probably had a team of four (as revealed in river-crossing scenes) although only three are shown, are led by a groom in front. The tasselled harness is shown in detail, with crests and blinkers on the headstall.<br /><br />An armed groom in front is helping to lead the horses. His raised arm wears a wristlet similar to the king's.This is one of two pieces that originally formed the lower section of a single right-angled panel in the corner of a room; they were sawn in two for ease of transport in the 19th century. At the top of the panel can be seen a few signs of the so-called 'standard inscription'.<br /><br /> Height 1010 mm, width 860 mm, thickness 200 mm. <br /><br /> In set with  BM 124558, above.  <br /><br /> Photo: British Museum,  © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 <br /> (&#8239;<i>I was unable to photograph the relief at the time of my visit to the BM, since it was on loan&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>) <br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Catalog: Gypsum alabaster,   Nimrud, North West Palace, 124557<br />Text:   www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <br />  </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />   <p><a href="images44/IMG_2342_2343.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/IMG_2342_2343sm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2342_2343sm" width="950" height="191" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, click on this small image to see the full size photo. <br /><br /><p><b>Reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)<br /><br />Ashurnasirpal II<br /><br /></b> Production date circa 865&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;860&nbsp;BC.<br /><br />124553 (left): Gypsum wall panel relief showing a battle scene.

Iron chains were hung from the roof and suspended the ram, which could then swing freely. Its business end was covered by a metal plate, shaped into a blade that was rammed into the bricks of the wall. <br /><br />Archers occupied   the turret. From there they provided protective cover for the ram with their arrows. Over time, the siege engines grew lighter, requiring only four wheels. By the time of Sennacherib’s siege of Lachish (701 BC), he used smaller, prefabricated siege engines, sometimes groups of them all attacking the same wall or gate. <br /><br /> In many of the  images from this king's reign, the battering ram is shown at quite a steep angle, as in this image. I would have expected it to be horizontal when in use. The angle may perhaps be explained as for  artistic effect, but at first sight it is odd nevertheless.<br /><br /> <a href="images43/IMG_2321closeupofband.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2321closeupofband.jpg" alt = "IMG_2321closeupofband" width="277" height="386" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />My full explanation for this is given below, but the band around the base of the protruding ram can be identified as  a rope lashing. </p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>In addition, the ram is far too close to the roof when fully extended. It would have to have been quite low down to be swung effectively on chains. The longer the chains (and thus the higher the roof from which they were suspended), the greater the destructive power of the ram.<br /><br />The battering ram gets its energy by being pulled back so that the chains themselves are as close to horizontal as practical, and the ram is thus as close to the roof of the engine as possible. This means that the heavy battering ram has a lot of potential energy by reason of its elevation, supplied by a number of burly soldiers. This energy is released as kinetic energy when the ram is released, as gravity causes it to gain speed and destructive power, which is at its maximum when the ram reaches the point where it is as low as the chains suspending it will allow. The best results are obtained when this point is reached just when the ram hits the wall.    The ram would have no effect whatsoever if it were allowed to swing up to a position close to the roof of the engine at the same height as it started. <br /><br />In the same way, a child on a swing with long ropes will go very fast at the bottom of the arc, and reach a speed of zero at the top of the arc, high above the ground. Physics lecturers sometimes demonstrate this by suspending a heavy metal ball by a thin but strong wire to the ceiling of a classroom or lecture theatre, so that it is just above the floor, then  standing well back from the suspension point with the  metal ball barely touching their forehead, let it go, and watch as the ball comes back to kiss their forehead gently. Faith in the science is necessary to do this without flinching!<br /><br />Put 'swinging ball of death'  into a search engine to see this performed. And as the lecturer says, 'Don't try this at home!'<br /><br /> It may be that the artists had little practical knowledge of the machines.<br /><br />Some sources say that the ram used here was simply swung up and dropped down to hit the wall. While that is how some of the reliefs could be interpreted, the amount of energy supplied in such a system would be extremely limited.  There is no obvious mechanism for raising the ram apart from it being on an axle, and the ram raised by pulling down on the part inside the siege engine. When dropped, this would waste most of the energy otherwise available, since the weight of the battering ram outside the engine would be compensated for to a large extent by the weight of the ram inside the engine, on the other side of the axle.   <br /><br />A much less powerful ram could however be made by having the wooden pole on an axle placed very close to one end, and this axle then positioned at the front of the engine.  The pole could then be raised   using a strong rope affixed behind the metal cap. However this rope would need to be raised by soldiers in the tower, and the pole would need to be raised as high as possible before loosing the rope, with the ram then hitting the wall.  This pole appears to be able to be raised  only to 45&deg;, which again would limit its destructive power considerably. <br /><br />In addition, this would mean a wooden beam used for the ram of only three metres effective length and corresponding weight. Putting the wooden beam swung horizontally on chains would mean that the beam could be at least five metres longer, thus having a beam of eight metres length rather than three,  with a corresponding increase (nearly two times) in weight and thus effectiveness. <br /><br />The discovery of an iron chain (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Garfinkel et al.,   2021</span></a>) found on top of the siege ramp at Lachish also leads us to the method of construction outlined above. As <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Garfinkel et al.,   (2021) </span></a> point out: <blockquote>The battering ram was a large, heavy wooden beam with a metal tip on the active end. Its main effect was to deliver a repeated impact on the city wall, until the wall crumbled and collapsed. The ram’s operation required a mechanical device, probably a suspension frame, to swing the heavy beam back and forth. The ram and its operating device were placed inside a siege engine, a large wheeled wooden box covered with metal sheets to protect the attackers from objects hurled from the city above. The machine could carry additional military equipment, which in the case of Lachish seems to have included a water tank (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Ussishkin, 2004, fig. 13.59</span></a>). When all these functions were incorporated in a single siege engine, the result was a very heavy installation, which could easily weigh between 500 kg and 1000 kg (a ton). The wheels enabled this massive device to be propelled up the siege ramp to the city wall. It is likely that the siege engine was moved by both pushing and pulling, and that this was probably therefore done by night. The soldiers operating the ram entered the siege engine only when it was in its final position against the city wall.</blockquote> Catalog: Gypsum alabaster, 124536 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Don Hitchcock</p><br clear ="all"><p><b><br /><br /><a href="images43/IMG_2330lashing.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2330lashing.jpg" alt = "IMG_2330lashing" width="594" height="576" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />I strongly suspect that the reason for the strange orientation of the ram in the reliefs is because the sculptors only saw them when the siege machine had been transported back to the city. The siege machine would not have been dismantled for the trip home, but the ram would have had to be immobilised, it would be dangerous for it to be in battle mode, swinging randomly.<br /><br />One way to do that would be to put a rope around the beam, then pass the end through a hole in the base of the tower, around the horizontal joist at the front of the roof, back to the beam, then  lash the rope tight so that the beam was pressing hard against the base of the tower, so that it could not move. This would also have raised the beam out of the way of the oxen which drew it. <br /><br />This rope has been faithfully reproduced by yet another sculptor, as shown circled at left, who obviously did not realise that the rope was only put on when the siege engine had to be transported from one battle site to another, or when the siege engine was in storage.   <br /><br />Thus the sculptors thought that the beam when in use was raised and dropped instead of swinging back and forth, and carved the siege engine reliefs to reflect this misunderstanding. <br /><br /></b>Catalog: Gypsum alabaster,  North West Palace,  Nimrud,  124554<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Don Hitchcock</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />  <p> <a href="images43/IMG_2330siegedepiction.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2330siegedepictionsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2330siegedepictionsm" width="950" height="329" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	 <!-- <a href="images43/298477001britishmuseumphoto.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/298477001britishmuseumphotosm.jpg" alt = "298477001britishmuseumphotosm" width="950" height="364" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>--><b>Reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)<br /><br /> A siege in progress. </b><br /><br /> It is very useful to examine this wall relief above, which shows clearly the way that the siege engine was used in battle.   <br /><br />  In fact this particular panel is very instructive in many ways, and demonstrates several important types of siege warfare methods and equipment.     <br /><br />Note also that when the relief panel was cut to facilitate transport back to Britain, the cuts were made at angles calculated to cause the least damage to the figures.   <br /><br /> Description from the British Museum: Gypsum wall panel relief: showing Ashurnasirpal II besieging a city by a river.

The work was difficult and dangerous, and in this case they may have made the walls of the tunnels thinner and thinner until there were signs of cracking, and then used some method to knock away the thin walls from the outside.     <br /><br />In Mediaeval times in Europe,  the tunnels would have been shored up with wooden pillars and beams until a wide tunnel was made, then the tunnel would have been filled with firewood and set alight, causing the pillars and beams to catch fire and  collapse, and with them the wall above.        <br /><br />      At centre right is a siege engine outlined in green. The wheels are not shown, but there would have been six altogether. The sides appear to be made with wickerwork to keep the weight down, and for easy repair. There is a curious plaque on the front at the base of the tower which shows what may be the king, with a bow.  An archer and a stone thrower are standing in the tower, firing their weapons at the defenders.   <br /><br /> Two heavy soldiers shelter behind the siege engine and a half shield, held by one soldier,  while the other looses an arrow, both kneeling because the half shield does not provide much cover.  <br /><br /> A heavy pole with a strong iron cap on its forward end, used as a battering ram,  is suspended by at least two chains within  the siege engine, each looped under the ram, and attached to the roof at each end.  It is not obvious what the loop of rope  outlined here in yellow is for. It is unable to be discerned whether the iron cap is mushroom (seen here in profile)  or chisel shaped. <br /><br />Inside the five metre long siege engine would be perhaps six soldiers for an engine of this size, who would pull the battering ram back as far as possible, then loose it to pound the wall made of clay bricks, turning some to dust, and breaking and dislodging others. Eventually the wall would collapse when it was sufficiently undermined. <br /><br />  However things are not going well for the members of the siege engine team. A defender has managed to lower a large strong iron chain in a loop to catch the end of the battering ram, and immobilise it by pulling the chain up until the ram has become jammed on the upper part of the siege engine below the tower.    <br /><br />  Two men have been sent outside to fix the problem, which must be common, because they are well prepared with two heavy iron hooks which they have inserted into the links of the chain, and are in the process of pulling the chain down until they can free the chain from the battering ram, preferably by wrenching the chain from the hands of the defender on the wall above.  <br /><br />To make their day complete, the soldiers are being showered with burning torches, outlined here in red, to speed them on their task without delay. The burning torches would certainly inconvenience the soldiers struggling to free the battering ram, but more importantly would serve to set fire to the wicker work of the siege engine itself.<br /><br />Some help is at hand, because an out of view soldier is pouring water out in two solid streams (shown here in blue) on the torches. It appears that the water has been channelled somehow into (possibly tightly sewn cowskin) tubes so that the water can be directed onto the flames for just such occasions as this.   <br /><br />    <br /><br />Catalog: Gypsum alabaster,  North West Palace,  Nimrud,  124554, close up<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Don Hitchcock </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images44/IMG_2333lionhuntBM124534.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/IMG_2333lionhuntBM124534sm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2333lionhuntBM124534sm" width="950" height="359" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, click on this small image to see the full size photo. <br /><br /><p><b>Reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC)<br /><br />Ashurnasirpal II<br /><br /></b>  Gypsum wall panel relief showing Ashurnasirpal II hunting lions.

He was known for his military campaigns, which he recorded on the Black Obelisk, a monument that lists the kings he defeated and tribute he received. <br /><br />One of Shalmaneser's most significant military campaigns was against the state of Urartu, located in modern-day Armenia. He attacked Urartu several times, almost every year of his reign, and eventually defeated the Urartian king Sarduri II in 843 BC. <br /><br />Shalmaneser also campaigned against the Aramaean states, including Damascus and Israel. He besieged Damascus twice but was unable to capture it. However, his campaigns weakened the Aramaean states and allowed Assyria to gain control over them.<br /><br />Shalmaneser was also known for his building projects, including the construction of the Central Palace at Nimrud. The palace was decorated with reliefs depicting scenes from Shalmaneser's military campaigns and showed his power and authority as the king of Assyria. He also built several temples in his honour, including the temple of Ninurta at Kalhu. <br /><br />Photo: www.timetoast.com, threadreaderapp.com<br />	Text: various sources, including Wikipedia	<!-- www.timetoast.com/timelines/mesopotamia-timeline-da01f722-94f6-4d60-acd3-e10550dd69c7	threadreaderapp.com/thread/1215029601497493504.html			--></p><br clear ="all"><p><a href="images43/IMG_2314headlessculpture_shalmaneser.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2314headlessculpture_shalmanesersm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2314headlessculpture_shalmanesersm" width="490" height="800" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br /><b> King Shalmaneser III, 858&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;824&nbsp;BC      <br /><br />Headless statue   <br /><br /></b> The Guardian of the City Wall, from Ashur.   This statue, erected by Shalmaneser III, was long thought to represent the king himself.

Ashur-dan III is shown watching the eclipse. <br /> <br /> The eclipse has been dated to the tenth year of the reign of king Ashur-dan III.  <br /> <br /> For some years, Assyria had been passing through a period of weakness. Matters reached a climax in 763 BC when the total eclipse of the sun was taken as a terrible portent of the wrath of the gods. <br /> <br /> After 765 BC,   a very unstable time is suggested in the records. Plague is reported in both 765 and 759 BC and a revolt in the Assyrian heartland is recorded from 763–762 BC, a revolt in Arrapha 761–760 BC and a revolt in Guzana 759–758 BC until peace was at last restored in 758 BC.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the many revolts were in response to the plague epidemic as well as the Bur-Sagale solar eclipse on 15 June 763 BC. Solar eclipses, especially full eclipses that were visible to everyone in the empire (as was the case for this eclipse) were always interpreted as bad omens, and as such the epidemic and the eclipse may have been interpreted as the gods withdrawing their divine support for Ashur-dan's rule.  The last campaign noted  is a third campaign to Hatarikka in 755. It is probable that some, or perhaps even all, of the campaigns were actually led by Shamshi-ilu, rather than the king.  Ashur-dan died in 755 BC and was succeeded by his brother, Ashur-nirari V.  <br /> <br /> Artist:  Margaret Dovaston<br /> Photo and text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Hutchinson (1915)</span></a><br /> Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br />    <a name="ashurnv"></a>         <h1>King Ashur-nirari V</h1>               <p>	<a href="images43/ashurniraritablet.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ashurniraritabletsm.jpg" alt = "ashurniraritabletsm" width="950" height="652" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"> </a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b>Reign of King Ashur-nirari V <br /> <br /> 	King of Assyria 754 BC to 745 BC. </b><br /> <br /> 	     Fragment of a clay tablet; top right corner.

His military campaigns extendednorth into Urartu (Ararat), east into Iran, west tothe Mediterranean and south to the borders ofEgypt. He transformed troublesome foreignkingdoms into provinces of the empire ruleddirectly by Assyrian governors.<br /><br />Towards the end of his reign, Tiglath-pileser beganto build a new palace (the Central Palace) atNimrud, but this was never finished. A laterAssyrian king, Esarhaddon (reigned 680-669 BC),chose to build another palace at Nimrud (theSouth-West Palace). <br /><br />When the archaeologist Austen Henry Layard excavated both palaces inthe 1840s, he found that many of the reliefs fromthe Central Palace had been stacked for removalto Esarhaddon's new palace, while others hadalready been moved there.

On the right, an Assyrian soldier wears a mail-shirt over the tunic decorated with the fringed border which hangs down between his knees, and, as it seems, a helmet, pulls at the branches of a low tree. <br /><br />In front of this soldier are six warriors consisting of three slingers and before them, a man with round shield and dagger, all similarly dressed, except that the tunic of the shield-bearer is richly ornamented with concentric squares.<br /><br />He follows a pair of warriors; the first, wearing a garment decorated with fringes and small discs put into squares, is an archer; the man partly hidden by him and wearing an ornamented tunic holds a dagger in his right hand. The attitude of this pair strongly reminds one of two warriors standing behind the siege-shield, and Layard understandably mistook the figure in front of them as that of a shield. <br /><br />He is, however, a man dressed in a fringed and ornamented garment.<br /><br />The upper register is noteworthy, because the ritual scene, the anointing of a bare tree, carried out in this case by a man in military dress, on a small scale which can only be explained as showing the action takes place in the distance, is combined with dagger men, archers, and slingers arranged as if in a siege scene. It is possible that the soldiers are marching in a procession, but not probable in view of the actions of the bowmen and slingers.  <br /><br />     In the lower register, the king, Tiglath-pileser III, facing to the left, places his foot on the neck of an enemy. He wears his high crown decorated with the three bands, the ends of the lowest hanging down on his back, and a fringed garment. His wrists are ornamented with four-fold bracelets and round his neck hangs a necklace with the divine symbols of Sin (crescent), Istar (star), Samas (sun), Anu (horned cap), and Adad (trident).  <br /><br />         He holds a bow in his left hand; in his right hand he points a spear at the suppliant enemy upon whose neck he puts his right foot, apparently condemning him to death. The enemy has fallen to his knees, his face nearly touching the ground. He wears a long garment and a round cap, and has a close beard.  <br /><br />     Behind the king stands a beardless attendant, a fringed cloth over his left shoulder, his right hand holding a fan. The victim is introduced by the 'vizier', wearing a fringed garment and wrap, who raises his right hand. A  beardless attendant, following him and similarly dressed, wears sandals. This is curious, because the 'vizier' seems to be without them, at least they are no longer visible in the relief. The mutilation of the king's face may be due to the action of Sargon. The inscription is in two columns, the beginnings of the lines in column I and the ends of the lines in column II being lost.    <br /><br />  (&#8239;<i>  Note that the 'vizier' may be Tiglath-pileser III's son, Shalmaneser V, during his time as crown prince to his father&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)     <br /><br />An inscription note in cuneiform  describes some of the campaigns of Tiglath Pileser III in Iran in 744BC. The inscription on this slab was recorded by Layard, 'Inscriptions in the Cuneiform Character', pl.51 (= Rost, 'Die Keilschrifttexte Tiglat-Pilesers III', pls.IX-X); it deals with Tiglath-pileser III's campaigns against the provinces of Media. The Annals of the king report two campaigns against Media, one in his 2nd, the other in his 9th 'palû'. According to Rost, the part of the inscription preserved on this slab belongs to the campaign of the 2nd 'palû'.<br /><br /> Height 272 cm, length 239 cm.    <br /><br />       This wall panel forms one of a series with two disconnected scenes.   <br /><br /> Catalog: Nimrud, gypsum alabaster,   North West Palace (Nimrud), reused in the South West Palace (Nimrud), BM/Big number  118933 <br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <!-- Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum--></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images43/IMG_2251wallrelief.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2251wallreliefsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2251wallreliefsm" width="900" height="970" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b>   Neo-Assyrian, reign of Tiglath-pileser III, 744&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;727&nbsp;BC.   <br /><br /> Gypsum alabaster wall panel relief <br /><br /></b>    In the upper register a city, depicted in plan and in a series of three elevations, is attacked by the Assyrians. Of the three elevations, the uppermost, at the top of the slab, is now completely effaced. The middle one recedes from the lower on the left-hand side, but coincides on the right, a fact which precludes the interpretation as an upper storey, or even as a middle line of defence.<br /><br />The two walls might, in this kind of representation, be the two walls, of different length, meeting at the corner represented in plan; but this leaves the third wall unexplained. Apparently only women remain in this middle section of the defence, ready to surrender.<br /><br />In the lowest elevation archers are seen in embrasures, fighting behind a parapet which also serves as the outline of the plan of the city. In other embrasures there are round-topped objects which may represent doors, for inside the city plan, in the centre, two Assyrian soldiers, defending their heads with shields, cut through such an object with daggers, while on the left four others carry away the booty already seized, a couch and two sacks of goods.<br /><br />To the right lie enemy dead, and an Assyrian soldier is driving an ox away. The plan is used for yet another type of picture; two auxiliaries, wearing crested helmets and crossed bands, have advanced from behind a palisade to force a breach at the corner of the city wall, and are attacking the brickwork, represented in plan, with their lances, while defending themselves with their shields.<br /><br />The mixture of elevation and plan in this scene, though characteristic, is unusual in Assyrian work by reason of its complexity.<br /><br /> The inscription on the centre band gives 12 lines of one column, the commencement broken, and the beginnings of 11 lines of a second.<br /><br />Inscription translation: The 'erib-biti' priests of the temples of Esagila, Ezida, and Emeslam brought me the 'rihati' of Bel Nabu, and Nergal. ...

Written in 12 fines of one column, the commencement broken, and the beginnings of 11 lines of a second.<br /><br />In the lower register a procession of Assyrian soldiers carries away statues of the gods. It is very doubtful whether the head of the first deity was turned full-face, and the head-dress has completely disappeared.<br /><br />The honourable treatment accorded these gods and the types represented show that these were deities recognised by the Assyrians; the first two are forms of Ishtar, the fourth is the weather god, whether his name be Adad or some other form. It is not impossible that the scenes in both registers depict incidents in the campaign against the Chaldaeans to which the text on the centre band refers. It may be that the lower scene shows statues of Babylonian gods returned to their own cities by the Assyrians. <br /><br />Height  272 cm, length   254 cm. <br /><br /> Named in inscription & portrayed: Tiglath-pileser III, representation of Ishtar and Adad, named in inscription Bel, Nabu, Nergal, Temple of Nabu (Borsippa). <br /><br />    Catalog: Nimrud, gypsum alabaster,  Central Palace,  reused in the South West Palace (Nimrud), BM/Big number  118934 <br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <!-- Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum--></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images43/IMG_2253_BM_118882.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2253_BM_118882sm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2253_BM_118882sm" width="950" height="347" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b>   Neo-Assyrian, reign of Tiglath-pileser III,  744&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;727&nbsp;BC.   <br /><br /> Gypsum alabaster wall panel relief <br /><br /></b>  (&#8239;<i>there are two panels joined here, the join   may be identified by a vertical somewhat lighter colour&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br /> The relief on the left, BM 118882, shows a city captured, its inhabitants and animals being driven away. <br /><br />The city is surrounded by a double wall fortified with turrets and battlements.

The first and nearest soldier, an archer, is beardless and wears a long garment held at the waist by a broad fringed(?) girdle.  His sword-belt runs From his right shoulder to his left hip. The narrow object on his back is perhaps a bow-case, since the quivers in Tiglath-pileser's reliefs are broader and  usually have fringes attached to them. The second archer has a full beard, a long garment, and also a sword. The third soldier, with a full beard and dressed in a tunic, has a dagger in his right hand, while with the left he holds the tall shield. This full-size shield, used only in sieges, has the upper square return, characteristic of the time of Tiglath-pileser III. All three men wear round caps or helmets with earflaps.<br /><br />    The Assyrians are attacking a castle or small fortified city surrounded by water (lake or moat?); on its bank grow date-palms and a pomegranate tree, indicating some locality in southern Babylonia.

It stands on an artificial mound on which grows a date-palm, indicating a locality in Babylonia. Its walls are fortified with turrets and battlements. A square gateway on the left with double doors leads into it. A pair of archers stands on both the first and second wall. They wear tunics and have long curly hair and beards. Their arms consist of bows, swords, and quivers equipped with fringes. In front of the platform supporting the city lie two naked headless bodies; one of the defenders falls down from the wall, head first, his hair falling over his forehead.<br /><br />The Assyrians have built a ramp, up which they move their battering ram to the level of the city. The machine has four wheels and is covered with some kind of fringed cloth. A pair of archers stand in its small tower.  A third, wearing a fringed garment, kneels on its back. Behind it, a naked headless body falls to the ground.<br /><br />The upper right part of the relief shows an Assyrian soldier spearing a fallen enemy. He has a pointed beard and short curly hair, and wears a broad girdle held by two crossed bands with a small disc in the middle. His pointed helmet is crowned with a crescent-shaped feathered crest from which a band-like projection hangs down on the back of the helmet. He holds a round shield in his right hand, in his left, his spear. His victim, holding two arrows in his right, his bow in his left hand, falls against a date-palm which is breaking down. The object behind the soldier's feet is probably the trunk of another palm tree cut down by the Assyrians.<br /><br />The panel is peculiarly interesting because the two lower horizontal lines of the building slope upwards in the representation at different angles. This secures a counterbalance to the slope of the ramp, but is not necessarily due to the desire for balance. It seems clear that the three superimposed walls are not stories of a building, nor even three successive walls, for then the middle wall would not need defence at the same moment as the outermost wall. It seems possible that the three walls represent three sides of the whole fortification, with the object of showing that the defence continued active on two sides when the defence of the third side had ceased action. The location of the town in Babylonia seems to be marked by the palm-tree shown inside the lowest wall. This panel is one of a set showing Tiglath-Pileser III's campaigns in Southern Iraq. <br /><br />Height  99 cm, width 101 cm.  <br /><br />Catalog: Nimrud,  Central Palace, gypsum alabaster,   BM/Big number  118902    <br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <!-- Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum--></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <p>	<a href="images43/siege_tiglath.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/siege_tiglathsm.jpg" alt = "siege_tiglathsm" width="950" height="713" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	<b>   Neo-Assyrian, reign of Tiglath-pileser III, 744&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;727&nbsp;BC.   <br /><br /> Gypsum alabaster wall panel relief <br /><br /></b>Bas-relief of an attack on an enemy town during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III  from his palace at Kalhu (Nimrud), gypsum, now in the collections of the British Museum on loan to the Getty Villa.<br /><br />(&#8239;<i>Note that this siege engine is shown with two battering rams held together with a rope or leather strap. As noted above, these images were likely created by the sculptors from  siege engines in storage at the palace.

Though he successfully annexed some lands to the Assyrian Empire, his campaigns resulted in long and drawn-out sieges lasting several years, some being unresolved at the end of his reign. The circumstances of his deposition and death are not clear, though they were likely violent, and it is unlikely that Sargon II was his legitimate heir. It is possible that Sargon II was entirely unrelated, which would make Shalmaneser V the final king of the Adaside dynasty, which had ruled Assyria for almost a thousand years. <br /><br />Catalog: Nimrud, gypsum alabaster,   North West Palace (Nimrud), reused in the South West Palace (Nimrud), BM/Big number  118933 <br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />  <p>	<a href="images41/IMG_1455stela.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/IMG_1455stelasm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1455stelasm" width="347" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"> </a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Stele protecting a royal land grant of Marduk - apla - iddina II.<br /><br />Merodach-Baladan, King of Babylon, enfeoffs   (gives someone freehold property or land in exchange for their pledged service) a vassal.  <br /><br />Place of discovery unknown. <br /><br />Symbols of the gods on the upper register, below  the  enfeoffment scene. <br /><br />715 / 714 BC (seventh year of the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina II).<br /><br />The Babylonian king Marduk-apla-iddina II, named in the inscription, (and called Merodach-Baladan in the bible) is depicted on the left.

They were the reason for the donation of the land, which was to be protected by this stone monument. The text begins with an explanation of the divine legitimacy of the king and his deeds for the good of the Babylonian empire. The main part describes in cadastral form the location of the plots of land in the surrounding countryside in relation to canals, roads and other plots. <br /><br />It ends with a curse against the man who does something against the land donation, 'That man Anu, Ea and Bel, the great gods; as far as their names are mentioned in this tablet, may destroy his name, seed and offspring in the mouth of the people, cut off his further life. The tablet is sealed with the king's seal of decree, so that no action for change or recovery may be brought.'<br /><br />  Marduk-apla-iddina II,  in the Bible Merodach-Baladan,  was a Chaldean leader from the Bit-Yakin tribe, originally established in the territory of the Sealand in southern Babylonia. He seized the Babylonian throne in 722 BC from Assyrian control and reigned from 722 BC to 710 BC, and from 703 BC to 702 BC. His reign is defined by some historians as an illegitimate Third Dynasty of the Sealand, inside of the Xth Dynasty of Babylon, or Assyrian Dynasty. <br /><br />He was known as one of the kings who maintained Babylonian independence in the face of Assyrian military supremacy for more than a decade.<br /><br />Sargon of Assyria repressed the allies of Marduk-apla-iddina II in Elam, Aram and Israel and eventually drove (ca. 710 BC) him from Babylon. After the death of Sargon, Marduk-apla-iddina II briefly recaptured the throne from a native Babylonian nobleman. He reigned nine months (703 BC – 702 BC). He returned from Elam and ignited rebellion in Babylonia. He was able to enter Babylon and be declared king again. Nine months later he was defeated near Kish by the Assyrians, but managed to flee to Elam.  He died in exile a couple of years later.<br /><br />In the Bible He is mentioned as king of Babylon in the days of King Hezekiah, both in 2 Kings 20:12 (here called Berodach-baladan) and in Isaiah 39:1. In both passages he sends Hezekiah a letter, having heard of his illness and recovery. His messengers who have delivered the letter are lavishly entertained by Hezekiah, leading the prophet Isaiah to criticise Hezekiah for his excessive openness about the wealth he had amassed. <br /><br />Height: 460 mm, width 330 mm, thickness 105 mm, weight calculated as 27 kg. <br /><br /> Catalog: Limestone, Pergamon Museum, Level 1, Museum of the Ancient Near East, Room 6, VA 02663<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source and text: Pergamon Museum, Berlin,  recherche.smb.museum<br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />   <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br />       <a name="sargon"></a>             <h1>King Sargon II</h1>   <b>Sargon II</b>  was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from the downfall of his predecessor Shalmaneser V in 722 BC to his death in battle in 705 BC.  Sargon is recognised as one of the most important Neo-Assyrian kings due to his role in founding the Sargonid dynasty, which would rule the Neo-Assyrian Empire until its fall less than a century after Sargon's death.<br /><br />The king probably took the name Sargon from the legendary ruler Sargon of Akkad, who had founded the Akkadian Empire and ruled most of Mesopotamia almost two thousand years prior. Through his military campaigns aimed at world conquest, Sargon II aspired to follow in the footsteps of his ancient namesake. Sargon sought to project an image of piety, justice, energy, intelligence and strength and remains recognised as a great conqueror and tactician due to his many military accomplishments.<br /><br />His greatest campaigns were his 714 BC war against Urartu, Assyria's northern neighbor, and his 710–709 BC reconquest of Babylon, which had successfully re-established itself as an independent kingdom upon Shalmaneser V's death. In the war against Urartu, Sargon circumvented the series of Urartian fortifications alongside the border of the two kingdoms by marching around them along a longer route and he successfully seized and plundered Urartu's holiest city, Musasir. In the Babylonian campaign, Sargon also attacked from an unexpected front, first marching alongside the Tigris river and then attacking the kingdom from the southeast rather than the north.<br /><br />After the Babylonian conquest he resided at Babylon for three years, with his crown prince and heir Sennacherib serving as regent in Assyria, but he moved to Dur-Sharrukin upon its near completion in 706 BC.  <br /><br /> Text above: adapted from Wikipedia<br /><br />  <p>	<a href="images43/IMG_1329sargon_stele_cyprus.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1329sargon_stele_cyprussm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1329sargon_stele_cyprussm" width="338" height="800" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"> </a><br /> <b>King Sargon II<br /><br />Reigned 722&nbsp;BC&nbsp;–&nbsp;705&nbsp;BC</b><br /><br />The Sargon Stele shown at left was found in the autumn of 1845 in Cyprus on the site of the former city-kingdom of Kition, in present-day Larnaca to the west of the old harbour of Kition on the archaeological site of Bamboula. The language on the stele is Assyrian Akkadian.<br /><br />The basalt stele was placed there during the time Sargon II (reigned 722&nbsp;BC&nbsp;–&nbsp;705&nbsp;BC) ruled the Neo Assyrian Empire. It was offered for sale to the British Museum, which bid 20 pounds.  Ludwig Ross offered 50 pounds for the stele and it was shipped to  Berlin.<br /><br />Together with the stele was found a gilded silver plaquette, that today is located at the Louvre.   <br /><br /> It was erected by King Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire near Kition (modern Larnaca) and describes his conquests, and notes the voluntary submission of the Seven Kings of the Land of Ia (which has been identified as Cyprus) and Iatnana meaning the Islands of the Danaans, i.e., Greece. Likely this act of submission provided the Cypriot kings with a trade network and a source of stable markets for the exportation of copper and other trade goods.<br /><br /> The site of this royal monument in Cyprus impressively illustrates that the influence of the Assyrian Empire reached very far west in the late 8th century BC. <br /><br /> Height 210 cm, width 68 cm, thickness 35 cm. The stele shows King Sargon II in typical Assyrian royal costume with a long, fringed robe and royal headdress.

Behind the scribes are soldiers with large conical shields, as well as spears and short swords.<br /><br />    The middle row shows a column of deportees moving towards the right. As in the upper register, the males are either bound at the wrists or have their hands up ready to be bound, and two females carry sacks.  One of the females has a child of three or four years with her. Two soldiers accompany the file of prisoners, and they meet  soldiers with spears, wearing traditional conical helmets, and carrying spears, conical shields, and wearing short swords. <br /><br />The lower row depicts helmeted soldiers carrying spears and short swords in scabbards, leading richly caparisoned horses, moving towards the left through a mountain landscape.

The besieged defended themselves with arrows and stones, but their strongholds were captured, and a vast amount of spoil and captives fell into the hands of the conquerors. The men had short, bushy hair and beards, and wore an inner garment reaching to the knee, an outer cloak of skins or fur, and gaiters laced in front. The robes of the women were short; their hair hung low down their backs, and was then gathered up into one large curl'.

The right-hand end shows more cavalry and chariots waiting behind the king. It also shows an aerial view of the Assyrian camp with its oval wall and defensive towers at intervals shown flattened out.

The camp seems to have been methodically planned with a road running through the middle.<br /><br /> There are two pavilions, like the one behind the king, and five open tents in which various activities such as servants working in the tents can be seen, including the amusing scene of two men gossiping over a drink. The pair of chariots in one corner of the camp have a standard in each of them; these are the chariots of the gods, sometimes seen charging in battle. On this occasion two priests in tall hats are performing a ceremony; an incense burner stands higher than the priests, and a sacrificial leg of meat sits on an altar.<br /><br />  Catalog: Gypsum alabaster, 124913, 124914, 124915   <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br /> Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />  <p>	<a href="images43/IMG_2565assault_painting.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2565assault_paintingsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2565assault_paintingsm" width="950" height="620" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>		 <b>Reign of Sennacherib, 704 BC - 681 BC<br /><br />  Siege of Lachish<br /><br /></b> An imaginative reconstruction of the capture of Lachish by Alan Sorrell. <br /><br />    Painting: Alan Sorrell <br /> Rephotography: Don Hitchcock 2015<br /> Source: Poster, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p>	<a href="images43/IMG_2546_bm_124776.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2546_bm_124776sm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2546_bm_124776sm" width="950" height="611" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>		 <b>Reign of Sennacherib, 704 BC - 681 BC<br /><br />  Assyrian Warriors<br /><br /></b> Nineveh, South West Palace,   bas-relief.<br /><br />      Gypsum wall panel: showing three pairs of Assyrian warriors facing right, each archer protected by a siege-shield.

Assyrian cavalry are fighting archers in a wooded landscape. Above, deportees are led away towards the left.  <br /><br />       Layard's descriptions of the scenes depicted in Court VI (I):    'In this series of bas-reliefs the history of an Assyrian conquest was more fully portrayed than in any other yet discovered, from the going out of the monarch to battle, to his triumphal return after a complete victory... The king, accompanied by his chariots and horsemen, and leaving his capital in the Assyrian plains, passed through a mountainous and wooded district. He does not appear to have been delayed by the siege of many towns or castles, but to have carried the war at once into the high country. His troops, cavalry and infantry, are represented in close combat with their enemies, pursuing them over hills and through valleys, beside streams, and in the midst of vineyards.<br /><br />    The Assyrian horsemen are armed with the spear and the bow, using both weapons whilst at full speed: their opponents seem to be all archers. The vanquished turn to ask for quarter; or, wounded, fall under the feet of the advancing horses, raising their hands imploringly to ward off the impending deathblow. The triumph follows. The king standing in his chariot, beneath the royal parasol, followed by long lines of dismounted warriors leading richly caparisoned horses, and by foot soldiers variously armed and accoutred, is receiving the captives and spoil taken from the conquered people. <br /><br />First approach the victorious warriors, throwing the heads of the slain into heaps before the registering officers. They are followed by others leading, and urging onwards with staves, the prisoners - men chained together, or bound singly in fetters, and women, some on foot, carrying their children on their shoulders, and leading them by the hand, others riding on mules. The procession is finished by asses, mules, and flocks of sheep.<br /><br /> As on the bas-reliefs uncovered by Mr Ross, there is unfortunately no inscription by which the name of the conquered people can be determined. ... The mountains, valleys, and streams, the vines and dwarf oaks, probably indicate a region north of Assyria, in Armenia, Media, or Kurdistan, countries we know to have been invaded by the royal builder of the palace. The dress of the men consists of a short tunic; that of the women, of a shirt falling to the ankles, and cut low in front of the neck'.

They are found inscribed on a number of artefacts, and the final versions were found in three clay prisms inscribed with the same text: the Taylor Prism is in the British Museum, the Oriental Institute Prism in the Oriental Institute of Chicago, and the Jerusalem Prism is in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.<br /><br />The Taylor Prism is one of the earliest cuneiform artefacts analysed in modern Assyriology, having been found a few years before the modern deciphering of cuneiform.<br /><br />The annals themselves are notable for describing Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem during the reign of king Hezekiah. This event is recorded in several books contained in the Bible including Isaiah chapters 36 and 37; 2 Kings 18:17; 2 Chronicles 32:9. The invasion is mentioned by Herodotus, who does not refer to Judea and says the invasion ended at Pelusium on the edge of the Nile Delta.  <br /><br />The prisms contain six paragraphs of cuneiform written in Akkadian. They are hexagonal in shape, made of red baked clay, and stand 38.0 cm high by 14.0 cm wide. They were created during the reign of Sennacherib in 689 BC (Chicago) or 691 BC (London, Jerusalem).<br /><br />The Taylor prism is thought to have been found by Colonel Robert Taylor (1790–1852) in 1830 at Nineveh, which was the ancient capital of the Assyrian Empire under Sennacherib, before its initial excavation by Botta and Layard more than a decade later. Although the prism remained in Iraq until 1846, in 1835 a paper squeeze was made by the 25-year-old Henry Rawlinson, and a plaster cast was taken by Pierre-Victorien Lottin in circa 1845.  The original was later thought to have been lost, until it was purchased from Colonel Taylor's widow in 1855 by the British Museum.  (Colonel Taylor may have been the father of John George Taylor, who, himself, became a noted Assyrian explorer and archaeologist.)  <br /><br />Another version of this text is found on what is known as the Sennacherib Prism, now in the Oriental Institute. It was purchased by James Henry Breasted from a Baghdad antiques dealer in 1919 for the Oriental Institute. The Jerusalem prism was acquired by the Israel Museum at a Sotheby's auction in 1970. It was only published in 1990. <br /><br />The three known complete examples of this inscription are nearly identical, with only minor variants, although the dates on the prisms show that they were written sixteen months apart (the Taylor and Jerusalem Prisms in 691 BC and the Oriental Institute prism in 689 BC). There are also at least eight other fragmentary prisms preserving parts of this text, all in the British Museum, and most of them containing just a few lines.<br /><br />The Chicago text was translated by Daniel David Luckenbill and the Akkadian text, along with a translation into English, is available in his book The Annals of Sennacherib (University of Chicago Press, 1924).  <br /><br /></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	Translation:<br /><br />Column I<br /><br />Sennacherib, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the earth); the wise ruler (lit. shepherd, "pastor"), favorite of the great gods, guardian of the right, lover of justice; who lends support, who comes to the aid of the needy, who turns (his thoughts) to pious deeds; perfect hero, mighty man; first among all princes, the powerful one who consumes the insubmissive, who strikes the wicked with the thunderbolt; the god Assur, the great mountain, an unrivaled kingship has entrusted to me, and above all those who dwell in palaces, has made powerful my weapons; from the upper sea of the setting sun to the lower sea of the rising sun, all humankind (the black-headed race) he has brought in submission at my feet and mighty kings feared my warfare -- leaving their abodes and flying alone, like the sudinnu, the bird of the cave (? cliffs), to (some) inaccessible place.<br /><br />In my first campaign I accomplished the defeat of Merodach-baladan, king of Babylonia, together with the army of Elam, his ally, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he forsook his camp, and made his escape alone; (so) he saved his life. The chariots, horses, wagons, mules, which he left behind at the onset of battle, my hands seized. Into his palace, which is in Babylon, joyfully I entered. I opened his treasure-house:-gold, silver, vessels of gold and silver, precious stones of every kind (name) goods and property without limit (number), heavy tribute, his harem, (his) courtiers and officials, singers, male and female, all of his artisans, as many as there were, the servants of his palace, I brought out, I counted as spoil. In the might of Assur my lord, 75 of his strong walled cities, of Chaldea, and 420 small cities of their environs (within their borders), I surrounded, I conquered, their spoil I carried off. The Arabs, Aramaeans, and Chaldeans, who were in Erech, Nippur, Kish, Harsagkalamma, Kutha and Sippar, together with the citizens, the rebels (lit. sinners), I brought out, as booty I counted. On my return (march) the Tu'muna Rihihu, Yadakku, Ubudu Kibre, Malahu, Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu Hindaru, Ru'ua, Bukudu, Hamranu, Hagaranu, Nabatu, Li'tau, Aramaeans (who were) not submissive, all of them I conquered. 208,000 people, great and small, male and female, horses, mules, asses, camels, cattle and sheep, without number, a heavy booty, I carried off to Assyria. In the course of my campaign, I received from Nabu-belshumate, governor of the city of Hararate, gold, silver, great musukkani-trees, asses, camels, cattle and sheep, as his onerous contribution. The warriors of Hirimme, wicked enemies, I cut down with the sword. Not one escaped. Their corpses I hung on stakes, surrounding the city (with them). That district (province) I reorganized: One ox, 10 lambs, 10 homers of wine, 20 homers of dates, its choicest, (as gifts) for the gods of Assyria, my lords, I established for all time.<br /><br />In my second campaign, Assur my lord, encouraged me, and against the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallai, who from of old had not been submissive to the kings, my fathers, I marched. In the midst of the high mountains I rode on horseback where the terrain was difficult, and had my chariot drawn up with ropes: where it became too steep, I clambered up on foot like the wild-ox. The cities of Bit-Kilamzah, Hardishpi and Bit-Kubatti, their strong, walled cities, I besieged, I captured. People, horses, mules, asses, cattle and sheep, I brought out from their midst and counted as booty. And their small cities, which were numberless, I destroyed, I devastated, I turned into ruins. The houses of the steppe, (namely) the tents, wherein they dwelt, I set on fire and turned them into (a mass of) flames. I turned round, and made that Bit-Kilamzah into a fortress, I made its walls stronger than they had ever been before,<br /><br /><br /><br />Column II<br /><br />and settled therein people of the lands my hands had conquered. The people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallai, who had fled before my arms, I brought down out of the mountains and settled them in Hardishpi and Bit-Kubatti. Into the hand(s) of my official, the governor of Arrapha, I placed (lit. counted) them. I had a stela made, and the might of my conquering hand which I had established upon them, I had inscribed thereon. In the midst of the city I set it up. The front of my yoke I turned (that is, I turned about) and took the road to the land of the Elippi. Before me (my approach) Ispabara, their king, forsook his strong cities, his treasure-houses (cities), and fled to distant (parts). Over the whole of his wide land I swept like a hurricane. The cities Marubishti and Akkuddu, his royal residence-cities, together with 34 small cities of their environs, I besieged, I captured, I destroyed, I devastated, I burned with fire. The people, great and small, male and female, horses, mules, asses, camels, cattle and sheep, without number, I carried off. I brought him to naught, I diminished his land. Sisirtu and Kummahlum, strong cities, together with the small cities of their environs, the district (province) of Bit-Barrfi in its totality, I cut off from his land and added it to the territory (lit. border) of Assyria. Elenzash I turned into the royal city and stronghold of that district. I changed its former name, calling its (new) name Kar-Sennacherib. Peoples of the lands my hands had conquered I settled therein. To my official, the governor of Harhar, I handed it over (counted it). Thus I extended my land. On my return, I received the heavy tribute of the distant Medes, whose name no one among the kings, my fathers, had (ever) heard. To the yoke of my rule I made them submit.<br /><br />In my third campaign I went against the Hittite-land. Lule, king of Sidon, -the terrifying splendor (lit. terrors of splendors) of my sovereignty overcame him and far off into the midst of the sea he fled. (There) he died. Great Sidon, Little Sidon, Bit-Zitti, Zaribtu, Mahalliba, Ushu, Akzib, Akko, his strong, walled cities, where there were supplies (lit. fodder and drinking places), for his garrisons,-the terrors of the weapon of Assur, my lord, overpowered them and they bowed in submission at my feet. Tuba'lu I seated on the royal throne over them, and tribute, gifts) for my majesty, I imposed upon him for all time, without ceasing. From Menachem, the Shamsimurunite, Tuba'lu, the Sidonite, Abdi-liti, the Arvadite, Uru-milki, the Gublite, Mitinti, the Ashdodite, Budu-ilu, the Beth-Ammonite, Kammusu-nadbi, the Moabite, Malik-rammu, the Edomite, kings of Amurru, all of them, numerous presents, as their heavy tribute, they brought before me for the fourth time, and kissed my feet. But Sidka, king of Ashkelon, who had not submitted to my yoke,-the gods of his father-house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, the seed of his father-house, I tore away and brought to Assyria. Sharru-lu-dari, son of Rukibti, their former king, I set over the people of Ashkelon and I imposed upon him the payment of tribute (in the form of) presents to my majesty. He accepted (lit. bore) my yoke. In the course of my campaign, Beth-Dagon, Joppa, Banaibarka, Asuru, cities of Sidka, who had not speedily bowed in submission at my feet, I besieged, I conquered, I carried off their spoil. The officials,` nobles and people of Ekron, who had thrown Padi, their king, bound by (lit. lord of) oath and curse of Assyria, into fetters of iron and had given him over to Hezekiah, the Jew,-he kept him in confinement like an enemy, they (lit. their heart) became afraid, and called upon the Egyptian kings, the bowmen, chariots and horses of the king of Meluhha (Ethiopia), a countless host, and these came to their aid. In the neighborhood of Eltekeh, their ranks being drawn up before me,<br /><br /><br /><br />Column III<br /><br />they offered battle. (Trusting) in the aid of Assur, my lord, I fought with them and brought about their defeat. The Egyptian charioteers and princes, together with the charioteers of the Ethiopian king, my hands took alive in the midst of the battle. Eltekeh (and) Timnah I besieged, I captured and took away their spoil. I drew near to Ekron and slew the governors and nobles who had committed sin (that is, rebelled), and hung their bodies on stakes around the city. The citizens who sinned and treated (Assyria) lightly, I counted as spoil. The rest of them, who were not guilty (carriers) of sin and contempt, for whom there was no punishment, I spoke their pardon. Padi, their king, I brought out of Jerusalem, set him on the royal throne over them and imposed upon him my kingly tribute. As for Hezekiah, the Jew, who did not submit to my yoke, 46 of his strong, walled cities, as well as the small cities in their neighborhood, which were without number,-by levelling with battering-rams (?) and by bringing up siege-engines (?), by attacking and storming on foot, by mines, tunnels and breaches (?), I besieged and took (those cities). 200,150 people, great and small, male and female, horses, mules, asses, camels, cattle and sheep, without number, I brought away from them and counted as spoil. Himself, like a caged bird I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city. Earthworks I threw up against him, the one coming out of the city-gate, I turned back to his misery. The cities of his, which I had despoiled, I cut off from his land and to Mitinti, king of Ashdod, Padi, king of Ekron, and Silli-bel king of Gaza, I gave. And (thus) I diminished his land. I added to the former tribute, and laid upon him the giving (up) of their land, (as well as) imposts-gifts for my majesty. As for Hezekiah, the terrifying splendor of my majesty overcame him, and the Urbi (Arabs) and his mercenary (?) troops which he had brought in to strengthen Jerusalem, his royal city, deserted him (lit. took leave). In addition to the 30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, (there were) gems, antimony, jewels (?), large sandu-stones, couches of ivory, house-chairs of ivory, elephant hide, ivory (lit. elephant's "teeth") ebony (?), boxwood (?), all kinds of valuable (heavy) treasures, as well as his daughters, his harem, his male and female musicians, (which) he had (them) bring after me to Nineveh, my royal city. To pay tribute and to accept (lit. do) servitude, he dispatched his messengers.<br /><br />In my fourth campaign Assur, my lord, gave me courage, and I mustered my numerous armies and gave the command to proceed against Bit-Yakin. In the course of my campaign I accomplished the overthrow of Shuzubi, the Chaldean, -who sat in the midst of the swamps, - at Bitutu. That one,-the terror (lit. ague, chills) of my battle fell upon him, and broke his courage (lit. tore his heart); like a criminal (?) he fled alone, and his place was seen no more. The front of my yoke I turned and to Bit-Yakin I took the way. That (same) Merodach-baladan, whose defeat I had brought about in the course of my first campaign, and whose forces I had shattered, -the roar of my mighty arms and the onset of my terrible battle he feared and he gathered together the gods of his whole land in their shrines, and loaded them into ships and fled like a bird to Nagite-rakki, which is in the middle of the sea. His brothers, the seed of his father-house, whom he had left by the sea-shore, together with the rest of the people of his land, I brought out of Bit-Yakin, (from) the midst of the swamps and canebrakes, and counted as spoil. I turned about and ruined and devastated his cities: I made them like ruin-heaps. Upon his ally, the king of Elam, I poured out terror. On my return, I placed on his (Merodach-Baladan's) royal throne, Assur-nadin-shum, my oldest son, offspring of my loins (knees). I put him in charge of the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.<br /><br />Translation excerpted from The Annals of Sennacherib, Daniel David Luckenbill, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1924) pp. 23-35.  <br /><br /> Proximal source for the translation: www.u.arizona.edu/~afutrell/w%20civ%2008/prism.html <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br /> Catalog: Baked clay, 103000<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 <br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />  <!--   From Nineveh, South West Palace,    Room XXXVI, Panels 8-9After the capture of Lachish, Assyrian soldiers carry off plunder from the governor's palace: a bundle of scimitars, round shields, a chariot, a throne, and a pair of incense-burners.

The third king of the Sargonid dynasty, Esarhaddon is most famous for his conquest of Egypt in 671 BC,  which made his empire the largest the world had ever seen, and for his reconstruction of Babylon, which had been destroyed by his father. <br /><br />  After a very difficult ascension to the throne, Esarhaddon was plagued by paranoia and mistrust for his officials, governors and male family members until the end of his reign. As a result of this paranoia, most of the palaces used by Esarhaddon were high-security fortifications located outside of the major population centres of the cities. <br /><br />    Also perhaps resulting from his mistrust for his male relatives, Esarhaddon's female relatives, such as his mother Naqiʾa and his daughter Serua-eterat, were allowed to wield considerably more influence and political power during his reign than women had been allowed in any previous period of Assyrian history.<br /><br />Despite a relatively short and difficult reign, and being plagued by paranoia, depression and constant illness, Esarhaddon remains recognised as one of the greatest and most successful Assyrian kings. He quickly defeated his brothers in 680, completed ambitious and large-scale building projects in both Assyria and Babylonia, successfully campaigned in Media, the Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia, the Caucasus, and the Levant, defeated and conquered Lower Egypt, and ensured a peaceful transition of power to his two heirs Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin after his death. <br /><br />Photo: A.C.

The commemorative stele depicts asuper-human sized Esarhaddon with his right hand raised, worshipping his gods. The gods, in the upper right hand side, are shown in human form riding their associatedanimal or symbolically. The king wears the beribboned, decorated royal crown. In his left hand he holds both the mace and two ropes. <br /><br />The ropes end with rings through the lips of two  prisoners. The kneeling smallerfigure appears to depict the Egyptian crown prince. The supplicating, standing figure, is likely that of a Syrian city-state ruller. <br /><br /> On the left side of the stele is the figure of king Shamash-shum-ukin, later king of Babylon,  and on the right side, Assurbanipal,  the heir apparent of Assyria. A cuneiform inscription covering the lower half of the front of the stele and completely covering the reverse reports the victorious campaigns of king Esarhaddon.</p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>  Inscription: <br /><br />'Whoever removes this stela from its place, erases my written name, and writes his own name there, may his manhood feminize Ishtar, mistress of battle and combat, and make him sit down bound at the feet of his enemies." <br /><br />This curse formula ends the inscription that covers the front and back of the stele. The monument was commissioned by the Assyrian king Asarhaddon, who guided the destiny of Assyria at the beginning of the 7th century BC. His foreign policy was marked by the conflict with Egypt for supremacy in Syria-Palestine. Only the 2nd campaign against Taharka in 671 BC brought the hoped-for decision in his favour. <br /><br />This stele found in Sam'al, in southeastern Turkey, was to record this victory for posterity. After plundering the royal treasuries, Asarhaddon returned to Nineveh with most of his soldiers. While Taharka had managed to escape, his family and court were led into exile. It may be considered ironic that Asarhaddon did not survive a third campaign to the land along the Nile. In the long run this area could not be held anyway; already under Psammetich I Upper Egypt regained its independence in 655 BC.<br /><br />The front of the stele shows the ruler in monumental size with royal insignia and two conquered adversaries kneeling down before him. At head height are various deity symbols and cult images in a reduced scale. On the narrower sides, Asarhaddon's sons are depicted as a novelty: Assurbanipal, the last important ruler of the Assyrians, and Shamash-shum-ukin, who was to take the throne of Babylon.<br /><br />The subjugated enemies, bound hand and foot, are held by a rope leading to a ring drawn through the lower lip. Judging by the costume, it could be the Egyptian crown prince and a rebellious Syrian city prince. Baal of Tyre or Abdi-milkutti of Sidon, who had fallen from grace and been beheaded a few years earlier, could also be considered. <br /><br /> The good state of preservation of the stele, which was worked from a very hard stone, is to be owed to a  catastrophic fire, which destroyed the princely seat probably still in the 7th century BC completely.

Despite documents from Esarhaddon suggesting that the two brothers were intended to have equal power, Shamash-shum-ukin only acceded to the Babylonian throne months after Ashubanipal had become king and throughout his reign could only make decisions and issue orders if these were also approved and verified by Ashurbanipal.<br /><br />Shamash-shum-ukin assimilated well into Babylonia, despite being ethnically and culturally Assyrian. His royal inscriptions are far more 'quintessentially Babylonian' than those of other Assyrian rulers of southern Mesopotamia, using Babylonian imagery and rhetoric to an unprecedented extent. He participated in the Babylonian New Year's festival and is recorded as partaking in other Babylonian traditions. The Statue of Marduk, the main cult image of Babylon's patron deity Marduk, was returned to Babylon in 668 BC at Shamash-shum-ukin's coronation, having been stolen from the city by his grandfather Sennacherib twenty years prior.<br /><br />After resentment and hostility had grown between the brothers for some years, Shamash-shum-ukin rebelled against his younger brother in 652 BC. Despite successfully raising several allies, a coalition of enemies of Assyria, to his cause, Shamash-shum-ukin's rebellion proved disastrous. After enduring a two-year siege by Ashurbanipal of Babylon, the city fell in 684 BC and Shamash-shum-ukin died, and although the exact circumstances of his death are unclear,  it may be that Shamash-shum-ukin committed suicide by making a pyre of his palace, treasury, and concubines. After his defeat and death there is evidence of a large-scale damnatio memoriae campaign, with images of the king being mutilated, erasing his face.<br /><br /> Height  240 mm, width 145 mm, thickness 110 mm, weight calculated as 7 kg.  <br /><br /> Catalog: Limestone, Pergamon Museum, Level 1, Museum of the Ancient Near East, Room 6, VA 03614<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source and text: Pergamon Museum, Berlin,  recherche.smb.museum<br />Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <p>	<a href="images43/IMG_1467_68kudurru.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1467_68kudurrusm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1467_68kudurrusm" width="950" height="917" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"> </a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Stele protecting a royal land grant (kudurru).<br /><br />Nippur (?)<br /><br />Fragment of a document stone (Kudurru)<br /><br /> 13th/12th century BC.<br /><br />  Height  355 mm, width 420 mm, thickness 200 mm, weight calculated as 55 kg.  <br /><br /> Catalog: Limestone, Pergamon Museum, Level 1, Museum of the Ancient Near East, Room 6, VA 00213<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source and text: Pergamon Museum, Berlin,  recherche.smb.museum<br /> </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br />  <a name="ashurb"></a>          <h1>King Ashurbanipal</h1> <p><a href="images43/ashurbanipal_bronze.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/ashurbanipal_bronzesm.jpg" alt = "ashurbanipal_bronzesm" width="800" height="1167" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	<b>	Reign of King Ashurbanipal, 669 BC - 631 BC<br /><br />Modern sculpture of King Ashurbanipal<br /><br /></b>  Ashurbanipal, also known as the Ashurbanipal Monument or the Statue of Ashurbanipal, is a bronze sculpture by Fred Parhad, an artist of Assyrian descent.

They are inscribed on clay tablets and stones called kudurrus, which were used to record the boundaries of the land, the names of the recipients, and their duties and responsibilities. The kudurrus also depict images of the gods and symbols of authority, highlighting the religious and political context of these grants.One example of an Assyrian Royal Land Grant is the Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta kudurru, which dates back to the 12th century BCE. This kudurru was made by the king Tukulti-Ninurta I, who granted lands to his officials as a reward for their loyalty and service to the empire. The kudurru depicts a deity holding a bow, representing the god Ninurta, who was associated with warfare and fertility. The recipients of the grant were required to perform certain services for the temple and pay taxes to the king, illustrating the reciprocal relationship between the state and its subjects.Another significant kudurru is the Marduk-apla-iddina II kudurru, which dates back to the 8th century BCE. This kudurru was made by the king Marduk-apla-iddina II, who granted lands to a noblewoman named Bel-ta'assi. The kudurru depicts the goddess Ishtar, who was associated with love and war, and symbols of fertility, such as a plow and a bull. The grant also included provisions for the maintenance of irrigation systems, highlighting the importance of agriculture in the Assyrian economy.The Assyrian Royal Land Grants demonstrate the complex system of land ownership and resource management in the ancient Near East. They provide insights into the social, economic, and political structures of the Assyrian Empire, as well as the role of religion in legitimizing royal authority. The kudurrus also serve as valuable sources for historians and archaeologists studying the ancient world, offering glimpses into the daily lives and interactions of the people who lived during this period. --><!-- http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2017/07/indus-script-hieroglyphs-on-kassite.html	 Between 1206 and 1150 BCE, the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the New Kingdom of Egypt in Syria and Canaan interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy. From Greece to Egypt, the social and political system of the Bronze Age collapsed. Amid war and chaos, the great palaces of the ancient Greek kings and the strong fortress of Troy were destroyed. Hittite rule in Asia Minor was ended forever, and the Hittites disappeared from history. The cities of Cyprus and Syria (Mitanni) were destroyed. A mysterious group, the Sea Peoples were a confederacy of seafaring raiders of the second millennium BC who sailed around the eastern Mediterranean, causing political unrest, and attempted to enter or control Egyptian territory. Egypt fought against them for its very existence. The battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC was the first contact of Egypt with the Sea Peoples. Subsequently Ramesses III, the second king of the Egyptian 20th Dynasty, who reigned for most of the first half of the 12th century BC, was forced to deal with a later wave of invasions of the Sea Peoples, and by the way won. Ramses tells us that, having brought the imprisoned Sea Peoples to Egypt, he “settled them in strongholds, bound in my name. Some scholars suggest it is likely that these “strongholds” were fortified towns in southern Canaan, which would eventually become the five cities (the Pentapolis) of the Philistines.These were not typical invasions but rather a mass migration from places unknown. The invaders, that is, the replacement cultures, apparently made no attempt to retain the cities' wealth but instead built new settlements of a materially simpler cultural and less complex economic level on top of the ruins, particularly in Canaan. The fact that several civilizations around 1175 BCE collapsed has led suggestion that the Sea Peoples may have been involved in the end of the Hittite, Mycenaean and Mitanni kingdoms.--> <p><a href="images43/IMG_2411huntingwithanet.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2411huntingwithanetsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2411huntingwithanetsm" width="950" height="452" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	<b>	Reign of King Ashurbanipal, 669 BC - 631 BC<br /><br />Wall panel, relief<br /><br /></b> Circa 645 BC - 635 BC <br /><br /> Gypsum alabaster wall panel relief in two parts,  showing the netting of deer in partly wooded, hilly terrain.

In the middle row is a lion hunt on horseback; Ashurbanipal drives a spear into one lion's mouth (BM 124875) but another, which has been hit by arrows and left for dead, leaps up to maul the king's spare horse; attendants gallop to the rescue from the left (BM 124874).<br /><br /> On the top row, the king shoots an arrow (BM 124876), hitting a previously released lion in the head (BM 124877),  and then on the left dispatches it with a sword (BM 124875). <br /><br />  For over a millennium before these reliefs, it seems that the killing of lions was reserved in Mesopotamia for royalty, and kings were often shown in art doing so. There may have been a religious dimension to the activity. A surviving letter on a clay tablet records that when a lion entered a house in the provinces, it had to be trapped and taken by boat to the king. The Asiatic lion, today only surviving in a small population in India, is generally smaller than the African variety, and much later records show that their killing at close quarters, as depicted in the reliefs, was not an impossible feat. When the sword is used, it seems likely that, as in relatively recent times, the actual technique was that 'the lion-killer wrapped his left arm in a huge quantity of goats'-hair yarn or tent-cloth' and tempted the lion to attack this, while the sword in the right hand despatched him.

'The Dying Lion', Mansell & Co Photograph 1055'.<br /><br />This famous fragment of a relief, showing a lion pierced with an arrow facing right, is often said to be in The British Museum where, however, there is now no trace of it. It is in fact known only from a photograph taken by Messrs. Mansell and stated in their catalogue of 1880 then to be in The British Museum. According to Gadd, the photograph (‘The Stones of Assyria’, p.183) ‘shows the sculpture was then in a wooden packing case’. This is inexact. It showed it resting apparently on a twill tablecloth. Gadd adds that ‘doubtless it still exists, but I do not know where, possibly in some country house in England’. Unfortunately his suggestion that it was never in The British Museum is not supported by Perrot and Chipiez (‘Histoire de l’art dans l’antiquité’ II), whose artist St. Elme-Gautier drew it, annotating it ‘Musée Britannique’, even giving the approximate size as 0.54m high, adding that ‘nous ne pouvons indiquer que d’une manière approximative les dimensions d’un certain nombre de ces monuments à cause des glaces qui les recouvrent’. It was thus evidently one of those still exhibited in 1884. Gadd, overlooking St. Elme-Gautier’s indication of the size, erroneously attributed this fragment to the smaller lion hunt series, indeed as did Meissner and Opitz (‘Studien zum Bît Hilâni in Nordpalast Assurbanaplis zu Ninive’). The relief’s upper framing edge shows that this belching lion, represented on a standing-line, was placed close to the top of the relief. <br /><br /> -->     <br /><br />Catalog: Gypsum alabaster,  BM 124885 <br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <!-- Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum--></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images43/IMG_2480musicianslion.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2480musicianslionsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2480musicianslionsm" width="800" height="1135" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b>Reign of King Ashurbanipal, 669 BC - 631 BC<br /><br />Wall panel, relief<br /><br /></b> Gypsum wall panel in low relief.

Eight spoke wheels began to be used from the period of Tiglat-Pileser (745-727 BC) to the period of Ashurbanipal (669-631 BC).  <br /><br /> Thus, the endurance of the chariots when coping with high speeds on the battlefield, and their durability under conditions  of rough terrain had increased. In addition, the outer surface of the wooden circle in contact with the ground was often  covered with an iron protective ring. This particular example uses strengthening quadrilateral wooden inserts to the ring of the wheel, as well as the by then standard eight spokes.   Also, there appear to be iron rivets installed on the outer surface of the wheel, rather than the use of the superior method, an iron ring.  <br /><br />Catalog: Gypsum alabaster, 124858, 124859    <br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 <br />Additional text: Don Hitchcock, arkeonews.net/chariots-in-neo-assyrian-army/</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images43/IMG_2443_44_45.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2443_44_45smpanelnossm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2443_44_45smpanelnossm" width="950" height="283" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> </p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b>Reign of King Ashurbanipal, 669 BC - 631 BC<br /><br />Wall panel, relief<br /><br /></b>Circa 645 BC - 635 BC, Niniveh, North Palace, Room S. <br /><br /> Gypsum wall panel in low relief, circa   645 BC - 635 BC     <br /><br /> On the left, Assyrians rush up a wooded knoll, either in fright or to get a better view of the lion hunt.

His inscriptions are known from all the major cities, including Babylon, Dilbat, Sippar and Nippur. Too few inscriptions of Ashur-etil-ilani survive to make any certain assumptions about his character.<br /><br /> Excavations of his palace at Kalhu, one of the more important cities in the empire and a former capital, may indicate that he was less boastful than his father as it had no reliefs or statues similar to those that his predecessors had used to illustrate their strength and success. There are no records of Aššur-etil-ilāni ever conducting a military campaign or going on a hunt. His Kalhu palace was quite small with unusually small rooms by Assyrian royal standards.       <br /><br />   Catalog: Ceramic,  90188 Photo:  Original, British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <br />Text: Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <!-- Source: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Pergamonmuseum--></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br />   <a name="burn"></a>       <h1>King Sin-shar-ishkun </h1>   <p><a href="images43/letter_of_Sinsharraishkun.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/letter_of_Sinsharraishkunsm.jpg" alt = "burningofninevehbcsm" width="950" height="635" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b> Reign of King Sin-shar-ishkun, 622 BC - 612 BC<br /><br />Cuneiform tablet: letter of Sin-sharra-ishkun to Nabopolassar</b><br /><br />This tablet is a later copy of a letter from the last days of the Assyrian empire. In it, the last Assyrian king, Sin-sharra-ishkun, appears to reach out to the Babylonian king Nabopolassar, recognising the latter's rule and pleading to retain his own kingdom.<br /><br />The letter represents a great reversal in fortunes: despite frequent rebellions, Babylonia had for centuries been held under Assyrian rule, and at the beginning of his reign Sin-shar-ishkun himself seems to have had some success in suppressing a rebellion there. By the time this letter was written the tide had turned, and, incredibly, Sin-sharra-ishkun repeatedly addresses Nabopolassar as 'the king my lord.'<br /><br /> We do not have the Babylonian king’s answer in the form of a letter, but he must have rejected its terms: over the following years a coalition led by Babylonia and Media, a state in western Iran, destroyed the Assyrian capitals, and Nabopolassar, ruling from Babylon, came to inherit most of Assyria’s former empire. This letter may have been a response to another surviving piece of correspondence, in which Nabopolassar threatens (or perhaps declares) war, and a desperate attempt by Sin-sharra-ishkun to persuade Nabopolassar to switch allegiances, abandoning his alliance with Media for one with Assyria.<br /><br />The tablet itself is a copy dating to the second century B.C., but the original letter was written over four-hundred years earlier in the late seventh century B.C.; its preservation and copying show that it must have been regarded as historically important even in antiquity.<br /><br />The tablet is not complete and is made up of the following fragments in the Metropolitan's collection: 86.11.370a, c-e and 86.11.383c-e.<br /><br /> Dimensions: 10 × 15.3 × 3.6 cm <br /><br />    Seleucid Period, ca. 2nd century BCE<br /><br />Catalog: Clay, Mesopotamia, probably from Babylon (modern Hillah), Seleucid Period, 2nd Century BC, 86.11.370a, c–e<br /> Photo and text: metmuseum.org<br />Permission: Public Domain</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images43/burningofninevehbc.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/burningofninevehbcsm.jpg" alt = "burningofninevehbcsm" width="950" height="628" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b> Reign of Sin-shar-ishkun, 622 BC - 612 BC<br /><br />The Fall of Nineveh,  612 BC<br /><br /> </b>  Probably John Martin's Large Mezzotint 1829-30 colored by hand.

He was possibly the son of Sin-shar-ishkun and likely the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh in 626 and 623 BC. Over the course of Sin-shar-ishkun's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had been irreversibly weakened. However, Ashur-uballit rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at Harran where, bolstered by an alliance with Egypt, he ruled for three years. His identification as 'king of Assyria' comes from Babylonian sources. Contemporary Assyrian inscriptions suggest that the Assyrians saw Ashur-uballit as their legitimate ruler, but continued to refer to him as 'crown prince' seeing as he could not undergo the traditional Assyrian coronation ceremony at Assur and thus hadn't formally been bestowed with the kingship by the Assyrian chief deity, Ashur. His rule at Harran came to an end when the city was seized by Medo-Babylonian forces in 610 BC. Ashur-uballit's attempt at retaking it in 609 BC was repulsed whereafter he is no longer mentioned in contemporary chronicles, signalling the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy. <br /><br /> Photo of the Battle of Carchemish,  605 BC, above,  from <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Hutchinson (1915)</span></a><br />Permission: Public Domain<br /> <br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><b>The End of the Assyrian Empire<br /><br />The Battle of Carchemish  605 BC<br /><br /></b>Battle of Carchemish was fought about 605 BC between the armies of Egypt allied with the remnants of the army of the former Assyrian Empire against the armies of Babylonia, allied with the Medes, Persians, and Scythians. This was while Nebuchadnezzar was commander-in-chief and Nabopolassar was still king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar became king right after this battle. <br /><br />The  dominant event in world politics  at the time we are concerned with is the disappearance of Assyria.<br /><br />Thus our first task must be to ascertain in which year it was that the last Assyrian king, Ashur-uballit II, finally succumbed to the relentless onslaught of the Medes and Babylonians. What we do know is that Ashur-uballit was still in the field in 608, whereas three years later, at the time of the Battle of Carchemish, Assyria was no more. In 610 Ashur-uballit had to evacuate his capital Harran, and in 609 his attempt to retake it had failed disastrously, although he was reinforced by a strong contingent of Egyptian troops. <br /><br />The text is rather badly damaged at this point, but it seems that after the Battle of Harran the territories still under the control of Ashur-uballit were extensively ravaged by the Babylonians. The Babylonian king resumed the campaign at the very beginning of the year 608/7, but, unfortunately, with the statement to that effect the tablet comes to an end. Nevertheless, this much is clear, that after the disastrous events of 609 the position of Ashur-uballit must have been to such an extent critical that it would be somewhat surprising if he survived the campaign of 608.<br /><br />It so happens that a further argument can be adduced to render the date 608 for the downfall of Ashur-uballit, if not certain, at least very probable. We know that after the failure of the Assyro-Egyptian army to retake Harran in the preceding year, the Egyptian pharaoh, Necho II, resolved on a supreme effort and in 608 led an army in person to the rescue of his ally, Ashur-uballit II. But although this expedition is mentioned in several sources, nowhere is it said that it culminated in a battle between the Egyptians and the Assyrians on one side, the Medes and the Babylonians on the other. <br /><br /> Since this would have been a struggle between the four greatest military powers of the day, it would indeed be surprising that no mention of it had survived.  There is some reason to believe that Necho may never have reached the Euphrates.  <br /><br />Text: Jeremia  and the death of Josiah, by M. B.

The greatcity went up in flames, never to regain its former status. Three years later the same rebels razedAssyria's Western metropolis, Harran, crushing the last-ditch resistance of Assyria's lastking,Ashur-uballit II. This event sealed the fate of the Assyrian Empire, and that is where thestory of Assyria usually ends in history books.<br /><br />What happened to the Assyrians after the fall of Assyria? This is a question that is not easy toanswer for two reasons. Firstly, the issue has hardly been touched by Assyriologists. Most ofthem seem to tacitly agree with the idea of a more or less total wipe-out, as suggested by SidneySmith in 1925: 'The disappearance of the Assyrian people will always remain a unique andstriking phenomenon in ancient history. Other, similar kingdoms and empires have indeedpassed away but the people have lived on... No other land seems to have been sacked andpillaged so completely as was Assyria.'<br /><br />Secondly, in contrast to the abundance of information from the imperial period, information onpost-empire Assyria and Assyrians is scanty and scattered. The near-total lack of informationfrom Assyria itself would seem to support the idea of a genocide, which also seems to besupported by ancient eye-witness testimonies. When the Greek historian Xenophon 200 yearsafter Nineveh's fall passed through the Assyrian heartland and visited the sites of two greatAssyrian cities, he found nothing but ruin and could not retrieve much about them from thenearby villagers. The territory where these deserted cities lay was now Median, and the Greeksassumed that their former inhabitants had likewise been Medes.<br /><br />Yet it is clear that no such thing as a wholesale massacre of all Assyrians ever happened. It istrue that some of the great cities of Assyria were utterly destroyed and looted - archaeologyconfirms this - some deportations were certainly carried out, and a good part of the Assyrianaristocracy was probably massacred by the conquerors. However, Assyria was a vast anddensely populated country, and outside the few destroyed urban centres life went on as usual.<br /><br />This is proved by a recently discovered post-imperial archive from the Assyrian provincialcapital Dur-Katlimmu, on the Chabur river, which contains business documents drawn up inAssyrian cuneiform more than a decade after the fall of Nineveh. Apart from the fact that thesedocuments are dated by the regal years of a Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar II, nothing intheir formulation or external appearance would suggest that they were not written under theAssyrian Empire. Another small archive discovered in Assur, written in a previously unknown,presumably Mannean variety of cuneiform, proves that Assyrian goldsmiths still worked in thecity in post-empire times, though now under Median command.<br /><br />Moreover, over a hundred Assyrians with distinctively Assyrian names have recently beenidentified in economic documents from many Babylonian sites dated between 625 and 404 BC,and many more Assyrians undoubtedly remain to be identified in such documents. We do notknow whether these people were deportees or immigrants from Assyria; their families may havesettled in Babylonia already under the Assyrian rule. In any case, they unequivocally prove thesurvival of many Assyrians after the empire and the continuity of Assyrian identity, religion  and culture in post-empire times. Many of these names contain the divine name Ashur, and some ofthe individuals concerned occupied quite high positions: one Pan-Ashur-lumur was the secretaryof the crown prince Cambyses under Cyrus II in 530 BC.</blockquote>Text above:<br /><br /> Dr. Simo Parpola, University of Helsinki<br />The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project (State Archives of Assyria)<br />Presented at The Assyrian National Convention in Los Angeles, September 4, 1999<br />Published in the Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, Vol. XIII No. 2, 1999<br /><br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><!--  Illustration from 'Hutchinson's History of the Nations', 1915Date 	1915Source 	'Hutchinson's History of the Nations', 1915Author 	A.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 41 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/assyria.html responseCode 3 200

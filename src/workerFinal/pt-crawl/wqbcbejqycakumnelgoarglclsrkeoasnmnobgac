			Legal Notes Regarding Copyright in General </h2>
	<p>
		Below is a brief summary of US and International copyright law relevant to the ownership of drawings, writings 
		and other materials that are developed during the process of creating a 
		design, a sketch, a piece of writing, or basically any creative work. 
		The following wording is from Circular #1 published by the US Copyright Office, and is current to the best of my 
		knowledge.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>
		What is Copyright...?</h3>
	<p>
		Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United 
		States (Title 17, CFR), as well as <strong>
		<em>internationally</em></strong> by agreement with member nations to the Universal Copyright 
		Convention and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Copyright is a personal 
		property right, and is subject to the laws regarding ownership and transfer of personal property.
	</p>
	<p>
		Copyright law protects works both published and unpublished, including graphics and drawings, digital or 
		otherwise. Copyright protection exists <em>from the moment a work is created</em> in 
		fixed form. It is coincident with the process of authorship. The copyright to any created work 
		<em>immediately</em> 
		becomes the property of the author at the moment of authorship.
	</p>
	<p>
		A copyright need not be formally applied for, nor formally granted: <b>
		<em>Copyright</em><u><em> is automatic</em></u></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Proof of copyright ownership is <em>enhanced</em> by registering the copyright, but copyright ownership is not <i>created</i> 
		by registration. Copyright protection is also enhanced by giving "notice of copyright" on the work itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice of copyright consists of:  
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			1. The word "Copyright" or the symbol © (the letter C in a circle), followed by  <br />
			2. The date of creation, and <br />
			3. The author's name.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Only the <strong><em>author</em></strong> of a work can rightfully claim copyright. A work that is especially 
		commissioned, such as a painting, a drawing, a piece of writing, a design, a book, 
		or a graphic <em>is the copyrighted property of 
		the </em> <strong><em>author</em></strong>.  Among other kinds of work, copyright protects literary, pictorial, 
		graphic, and architectural works.
	</p>
	<p>
		Transfers of copyright ownership are made by contract. The parties may expressly agree in a written instrument 
		signed by them that the copyright is to be transferred to a party other than the author. Without such a 
		contract, a commissioned work <em>belongs entirely to the
		</em>
		<strong><em>autho</em></strong><strong><em>r.</em>
		<br />
			 </strong></p>
	<h3>
		How Long Does Copyright Endure...?</h3>
	<p>
		Copyright endures <strong><em>for the author's life, plus 50 years</em></strong><i>.</i> 
		</p>
	<p>
		However, in the case of works <em>"made for hire"</em> where ownership is transferred 
		<em>by contract</em> 
		to a party other than the author, copyright endures 
		<em>for 100 years from creation</em>, or 
		<em>for 75 years from the date 
		of publishing</em>, whichever is less.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>
		What are the Penalties...?</h3>
	<p>Per the copyright notice given on each of my web pages, <strong><u><em>I 
	have reserved all rights</em></u></strong> to the works I have published at
	<a href="http://www.kastenmarine.com">www.kastenmarine.com.</a></p>
	<p>Unauthorized use of that work is unlawful, pursuant to the US Federal 
	Copyright Act and International Copyright Law, and constitutes an 
	infringement of my rights under 17 USC 101, et seq. Such unauthorized use 
	could make the infringing party liable for statutory damages as high as USD 
	$150,000 <em>per violation</em>, as set 
	forth in Section 504(c)(2). Attorney’s fees and costs can also be recovered.
	</p>
	<p>Moreover, copyright infringement is a direct violation of International 
	Copyright Law and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Continued 
	infringement entitles me to seek an injunction, puts the infringing party at 
	risk for associated damages, and entitles me to contact the infringing 
	party's ISP or Web Hosting Provider along with each major search engine, 
	which could result in the infringing party's web site being shut down and 
	taken off-line.</p>
	<p>Briefly, the penalties are not worth the risk..!  If you have questions regarding the use of 
	the written or graphic content that I have put online,
	<a href="mailto:michael@kastenmarine.com?subject=Kasten%20Marine%20Copyright%20Inquiry">
	please inquire</a>. <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>Hot Link Policy</h3>
	<p>In the web design community, "hot-linking" refers to linking directly to
	<strong>non-html</strong> files on another web site, in other words linking to <strong>
	non-html</strong> files that are not located on 
	<em>one's own</em> web-site.  
	Typical examples of <strong>non-html</strong> content are GIF or JPEG 
	images, or PDF files etc.   </p>
	<p>I have actively tried to break 
	incoming hot-links because I view it as a form of  'bandwidth stealing' 
	or more bluntly, theft, whereby the 
	violator enjoys being able to deliver my images and / or PDF files without 
	having to pay their own ISP for that delivery, and without crediting the 
	source of that content.</p>
	<p>If you have landed at this page via a direct link at another web 
	site, blog, forum or newsgroup, please see our <a href="site_guide.htm">Site 
	Map</a> to find the local web page where you think the image may be located.  
	Alternately, you can easily search for the image or PDF by name or key word 
	on my <a href="search.htm">Site Search</a> page.</p>
	<p>If you are creating online content and you would like to directly link to 
	any of the web pages at
	<a href="http://www.kastenmarine.com">www.kastenmarine.com</a>, <strong>I 
	WELCOME AND I ENCOURAGE YOUR LINK..!! </strong>  
	However if you would like to create a link to a GIF or JPEG or PDF that I 
	have placed online, <em><strong>please instead create a link to the web page on 
	which you found the image or PDF...!</strong></em>  </p>
	<p>Thank you for visiting <a href="http://www.kastenmarine.com">
	www.kastenmarine.com</a>...  Please return soon...!</p>

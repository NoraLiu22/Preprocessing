This unique formula attracts many representatives of the media and so encourages a dialogue between the scientific community and the public so contributing effectively to the general understanding of science and technology.</p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><span class="bold_title">Links To Other Information:</span><p /><strong><a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/">The Lindau Website</a></strong><br />The official Lindau website<p /><strong><a href='65'>Lindau 2003 Documentary</a></strong><br />By The Vega Science Trust<br />&nbsp;</div>

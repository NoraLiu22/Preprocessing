	<h3>
		The Dhow in History
	</h3>
	<p>
		The 22 meter vessel shown here is modeled after the traditional Arabian 
		Dhow, most closely resembling the Baghala type.   The most 
		traditional rig for this kind of vessel is the Lateen rig (triangular 
		sails) or the Settee rig (trapezoidally shaped sails).  Both of 
		these are able to sail down wind like a square rig, but they are also 
		able to sail well to windward and tack into the wind like a fore and aft 
		rigged craft.</p>
	<p>
		Most seem to attribute the origins of the Dhow to India, where it 
		appears they were ordinarily built close to the supply of wood.  
		Originally Dhows and other craft in the region were built using 
		stitched-together planks, and on some smaller local craft that kind of 
		construction can still be found. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Dhow was developed over many centuries as a trading vessel, carrying 
		cargo east as far as China by way of Sri Lanka and the Straits of 
		Malacca, bringing goods to and from Alexandria via the Red Sea, thus 
		connecting the Roman Empire with the Han Dynasty in China. The Arab 
		trade routes also extended south to Zanzibar in Africa.  Some 
		sources claim that the very earliest craft were trading along similar 
		coastal routes in the Indian Ocean as early as 3,000 B.C.   
		These craft eventually developed into the Dhow as we know it today. 
	</p>
	<p>
		With the triangular Lateen sail, the Dhow could out-sail the square 
		rigged craft of the Mediterranean, and better navigate the contrary 
		winds of the Red Sea.  With knowledge of navigating by the stars 
		passed down from the Egyptians, the use of the magnetic compass learned 
		from the Chinese, and the stern mounted rudder of the Chinese 
		Junks, the Dhow was well equipped to dominate the Indian Ocean trade 
		routes during the last 2,000 years.</p>
	<p>
		Thus, the Arab merchants must be given due credit, having made longer 
		voyages than Columbus nearly fifteen hundred years before Columbus 
		sailed toward the new world.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The features that distinguish the Dhow are its Lateen or Settee rig, and 
		typically a double ended hull form.  Other features 
		that have come to characterize the Dhow are the long raked bow, and the 
		high and relatively upright stern.  In some forms such as the Baghala, 
		and the Shuw'i (or Shu Ai) the stern was widened into a massive 
		wide transom often carried right down to the waterline.  In other 
		types, the hull was more or less double ended, but often a platform 
		extended over the stern, much like the Indonesian sailing Pinisi (which 
		seems to have been derived from the Dhow in terms of its hull form and 
		structure).<br /> &nbsp;</p>

	<h3>
		The Dhow as a Yacht
	</h3>
	<p>
		The sailing Dhow that I've shown here has been created with a new 
		purpose... that of being a spacious and comfortable private yacht.   
		Thus, in the model shown here, we have struck a good compromise so that 
		while we do have a transom, we also have a fully double ended hull shape 
		at the waterline...  i.e. the best of both types.  As such, 
		this design most closely resembles the type of Dhow called the Baghala.
		</p>
		<p>
		The stern has ample width, and is tucked up high to stay out of trouble in a 
		following sea. The aft deck extends beyond the lower transom just enough to 
		house the rudder head, so that a tiller or wheel can be arranged easily.    
		It seems fairly common among traditional dhow types to have a slightly 
		rounded stem, which when finished off with the high curved stem timber seems 
		to resemble a scimitar…!    Balanced with “davit” boards that 
		extend from the stern, I think the concept design shown here is quite nice. </p>
	<p>
		In terms of its structure, the Dhow is very much the same as the 
		Indonesian sailing Pinisi types, which are outlined on our
		<a href="phinisi_history.htm">Pinisi History</a> web page.</p>
	<p>
		If tradition is to be followed faithfully, the rig for this vessel 
		should be designed in keeping with a typical sailing Dhow, in other 
		words having a Lateen or Settee type of rig. </p>
	<p>
		Many drawings of traditional sailing Dhows show the Lateen / Settee rig with 
		a tilted trapezoidally shaped topsail above the main sail.  It is not 
		such a far stretch then to imagine there being a few more yards in between, 
		with a single sail arranged in panels between the yards, thus becoming 
		essentially a junk sail having the rakish look and sailing qualities of the lateen rig… 
		For this design, two masts arranged this way would work out very well.</p>
	<p>
		An alternate way to arrange the traditional Lateen / Settee rig in order 
		to avoid having to dip the yard for tacking would be to arrange the 
		masts as "A" frames, with the yard hung just below the apex. Under sail, 
		the look and functionality would be exactly that of the Arabian Dhow, 
		but without the need to dip the yard in order to tack.&nbsp; This would 
		not allow the sails to be squared off for direct downwind sailing, but 
		would permit a nicely setting sail for windward sailing, reaching and 
		broad reaching...<br /> &nbsp;</p>

	<h3>
		Particulars
	</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>22 meters Length on Deck (70')</li>
		<li>15 meters Loaded WL Length (49')</li>
		<li>5.8 meters Moulded Beam (19')</li>

	<h3>
		The Interior Layout
	</h3>
	<p>
		At 22 meters of length over the range of the deck, the design is perfect 
		for a couple to live permanently aboard, and to also accommodate four 
		guests in two separate suites.  With that, the interior layout is 
		not at all crowded.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<p class="table_text_centered">
		<a href="_screenshots/22m_baghala_above_aft_1.png">
		<img alt="70' Sambuk or Baghala Dhow - Kasten Marine Design, Inc." class="auto-style1" height="377" src="_screenshots/22m_baghala_above_aft_1.png" width="900" />	</a><br /> Click for Larger Image</p>
		
	<p>
		To best understand the vessel's interior options, the 
		following walk-through should clarify the intended layout ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Right forward will be a forepeak for chain storage and a bosun's locker.	</li>
		<li>Just aft of that will be two guest cabins sharing a common head.<ul>
			<li><em>Alternately this space could be used as a self-contained 
			crew area.</em> </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Aft of the guest cabins will be the galley lowered halfway into the fore deck.  </li>
		<li>The galley and guest cabin <em>(or crew cabin) </em>top will be formed by a continuous raised fore deck, flush with the height of the bulwarks outboard.</li>
		<li>The raised fore deck is intended as a lounging area at anchor and 
		the galley top, a stage.</li>
		<li>At the forward end of the raised foredeck will be the anchor handling area. </li>
		<li>Amidships, the main deck will be at the height of the rub rail, and will extend from the galley, aft-ward to the master cabin.</li>
		<li>Below this 'midships deck forward will be the engine room<ul>
			<li><em>Alternately this space could be used as two large guest 
			suites.</em></li>
			<li><em>Yet another option would be that this space become a cargo 
			hold.</em></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Aft of the engine room<em> (or twin guest suites / cargo hold) </em>will be a storage / utility / laundry / shop space.  
			<ul>
				<li><em>Alternately, with the forward space used as a cargo hold 
				or for twin guest suites, the engine room would occupy this 
				utility space.</em></li>
				<li><em>In this case, the vessel would become slightly longer, 
				or the middle bulkhead would be moved forward some.</em></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Right aft will be the master sleeping cabin having a large 'Kahn Sized' double berth at the aft end. Ample closet space will be provided.</li>
		<li>Just forward of the sleeping cabin, a head and shower will be located to port, and a nav / office / reading nook area will be located to starb’d. </li>
		<li>The master suite house top will be formed by a raised aft deck, flush with the top of the main bulwarks outboard.</li>
		<li>As in the Arabian tradition, a shaded day-lounge / piloting area will be located on the raised aft deck.  </li>
		<li>Low seating will be arranged at the perimeter of the piloting area.</li>
		<li>An open sided cover will shade the aft part of the raised aft deck. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>  </p>

	<p>
		If this or a similar traditional sailing yacht is of interest, we offer a 
		complete design service from concept to launch.  
		Our preference is to use traditional methods and styling to the maximum extent possible; to 
		design the structure to classification society standards; and to assure that stability and 
		sea keeping are up to IMO standards for worldwide travel.   We can 
		accommodate a variety of requests, for example to change the size, to alter the 
		styling, or to modify the layout as needed.

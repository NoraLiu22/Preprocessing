<h2>Can pollinators generate differences between female &amp; male conebushes?</h2>

<hr>

<p><img src="logo2.gif" alt="Protea Atlas Logo" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="109">By Asa Hemborg, Botany Dept,
UCT</p>

<p>Why do male and female Conebushes <i>(Leucadendron)</i> often look different from each
other? What roles do the pollinators play in creating these differences? These are some of
the questions I am asking in a post-doc research project in collaboration with Prof.
William Bond.</p>

<p>In unisexual plants, <i>i.e.</i> those with separate sexes, pollen has to be
transferred from males to females for seeds to develop. There is no other way that these
plants can secure their seed production and the recruitment of new plants for future
generations. In some cases, pollen is carried by the wind to the female stigmas. Because
of the risk for the pollen to be lost on the way, the male plants of species relying on
wind for pollen transport often produce an excessive amount of pollen and a large amount
of tiny flowerheads. In wind-pollinated unisexual plants, males and females therefore
often look very different from each other. One such example is <i><a href="conebu4.htm#ldrubrf">Ld&nbsp;rubrum</a>, </i>where the size of the male flowerhead
is only a fraction of the female&#146;s.</p>

<p>If insects play the role of pollen carriers between males and females, it gets a bit
more complicated. Insects generally visit the flowers in search of something. This is
usually food, for example nectar or pollen, but it can also be to find mates and shelter.
If insects systematically visit flowers of a similar kind, and thereby transfer pollen
between flowers of the same species, we call them pollinators. The food they find in the
flowers is then also referred to as a reward, or payment, for their roles as messengers in
the sexual communication between plants. The pollinators usually act in response to plant
signals and to environmental factors, to find their rewards. Then, how does this type of
communication between plants work if the male and the female plants look different from
each other? How do the pollen carrying insects recognize them as the same <i>species?</i></p>

<p><img src="pria.gif" alt="Pria cinerascens - Drawing: Scholtz &amp; Holme 1985:  p246" align="right" WIDTH="308" HEIGHT="171">In my studies, I examine how a tiny (1.5&nbsp;mm) beetle pollinator <i>(</i>Conebush
Pollen Beetle<i> Pria cinerascens</i>, Family Nitidulidae - Sap Beetles) visits male and
female plants in the <a href="conebu2.htm#ldxantf">Sickle-leaf Sunshine Conebush <i>Ld&nbsp;xanthoconus</a>),
</i>and what plant signals and rewards are important for attracting the beetles. In this
Conebush, male plants in the age group of six to eight years produce on average six times
more flowerheads than the females. Because the number of flowerheads per plant increases
exponentially with age in males, but not in females, this difference between the two sexes
will increase as the plants grow older.</p>

<p>I found that the relationship between the <i>Pria </i>beetles<i> </i>and their host
plant <i>Ld&nbsp;xanthoconus </i>is very intimate. <i>Pria </i>belongs to a group of
beetles sometimes called Pollen Beetles, because their main food source is pollen. At the
onset of flowering, adult <i>Pria </i>arrive on the male flowerheads to feed, mate and to
place their eggs either at the base of the bracts or in old open flowers at the base of
the flowerhead. This happens when the male flowerheads still have a circle of undeveloped
flowers at the top. Within two to three weeks, the larvae will develop and (probably)
pupate. The larvae can easily be spotted on the flowerheads, especially on sunny days!
They have a brown head, white or yellowish body (0.5 - 1.5 mm long) and six legs. Nobody
really knows what happens next. Where do the beetles go when the flowering time of <i>Ld&nbsp;xanthoconus
</i>is over<i>? </i>What other plants do they feed on, if they are still active? We know
that they also visit and probably also pollinate some of the other species of Conebushes
such as <i><a href="conebu2.htm#ldlaurm">Ld&nbsp;laureolum</a> </i>and <i><a href="conebu2.htm#ldsgnmf">Ld&nbsp;salignum</a>.</i></p>

<p>Because the life-history of <i>Pria </i>is so closely connected to the plants they feed
on, it is easy to understand why the beetles visit the male plants. The question is then;
why do they bother with the females? Female flowerheads do not offer any food reward in
terms of pollen (or nectar). Last year, we studied how adult <i>Pria </i>beetles visited
male and female plants in response to flowerhead number, weather (sunny and dry <i>vs</i>
rainy and overcast) and time of day (morning <i>vs </i>evening). For all the plants we
examined (170 plants for each sex), we found at least one <i>Pria</i> on 95% of the male
and on 43% of the female flowerheads. However, as could be expected, the number of beetles
were always higher on the males. On sunny and dry days, male flowerheads had on average 15
times more beetles than the female flowerheads. But we discovered that for female
flowerheads, the chances of receiving a visit from a <i>Pria </i>beetle doubled if the
weather was colder, <i>i.e.</i> rainy and overcast. On those days, females had on average
1.2 beetles per flowerhead, as opposed to 0.6 on sunny and dry days. We found slightly
more beetles on the flowerheads in the evening than in the morning, but this was the same
for both sexes.</p>

<p>It appears from our studies that the beetles visit male and female plants for different
reasons. <i>Pria</i> uses the male flowerheads as a food source and mating ground. We
think that <i>Pria </i>uses the female flowerheads for protection, heat, and perhaps also
mating opportunities during bad weather. After all, these plants flower during a very wet
and cold period of the year! During the coldest and wettest days, we found no <i>Pria </i>on
the males, but on some of the females. We guess that the <i>Pria</i> then search for the
females. In female flowerheads, the bracts are often also less open than in the male
plants and form a cup around the cone &#150; a nice cozy shelter.</p>

<p>During this coming flowering season, we will focus on the following questions: 

<ul>
  <li>How did a pollination system like this evolve? </li>
  <li>Do the beetles go actively to the female flowerheads or do they have problem finding
    males on rainy days? </li>
</ul>

<p>If <i>Pria </i>actively visit males and females for different reasons, do they use
different visual cues for finding their respective flowerheads? If that is the case, it
may explain why sexual dimorphism in floral characters can be so exaggerated in this
species. There would be no need for the male and female plants to look similar to each
other. They can have different number of flowerheads, different colour flowerheads and
still get the visits they need for effective pollination. They would only have to look
attractive enough among the group of males and females, respectively, to make sure that <i>Pria</i>
would come and visit them. The future, and this field season, will hopefully let us know
more.</p>

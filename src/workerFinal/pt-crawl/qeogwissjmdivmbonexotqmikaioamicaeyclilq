      continued my efforts </b></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">to educate 
      myself. This was no easy task under the Russian government of Warsaw; yet 
      I found more opportunities than in the country. To my great joy, I was able, 
      for the first time in my life, to find access to a laboratory: a small municipal 
      physical laboratory directed by one of my cousins. I found little time to 
      work there, except in the evenings and on Sundays, and was generally left 
      to myself. I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics 
      and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times I would 
      be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success, at others I would be in the 
      deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience. 
      But on the whole, though I was taught that the way of progress is neither 
      swift nor easy, this first trial confirmed in me the taste for experimental 
      research in the fields of physics and chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Other means of instruction came to me through my being one of an enthusiastic 
      group of young men and women of Warsaw, who united in a common desire to 
      study, and whose activities were at the same time social and patriotic. 
      It was one of those groups of Polish youths who believed that the hope of 
      their country lay in a great effort to develop the intellectual and moral 
      strength of the nation, and that such an effort would lead to a better national 
      situation. The nearest purpose was to work at one&#146;s own instruction 
      and to provide means of instruction for workmen and peasants. In accordance 
      with this program we agreed among ourselves to give evening courses, each 
      one teaching what he knew best. There is no need to say that this was a 
      secret organization, which made everything extremely difficult. There were 
      in our group very devoted young people who, as I still believe today, could 
      do truly useful work.<br>
      <br>
      I have a bright remembrance of the sympathetic intellectual and social companionship 
      which I enjoyed at that time. Truly the means of action were poor and the 
      results obtained could not be considerable; yet I still believe that the 
      ideas which inspired us then are the only way to real social progress. You 
      cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To 
      that end each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time 
      share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being 
      to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful.<img src="../images/quotes/quotes-maroon-right.gif" width="19" height="13" vspace="3" hspace="1" alt="&quot;"><br>

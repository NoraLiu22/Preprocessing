NOT contagious and people with epilepsy are NOT "crazy."  The word 
"epilepsy" is derived from a Greek word meaning "to possess, seize or 
hold."  Changes in the way the brain processes electrical signals can 
cause result in abnormal functioning.  In people who have epilepsy, 
cerebral cortical neurons misfire and result in <font 
color=red>seizures</font>.  This is similar to an electrical brainstorm.  
The seizure prevents the brain from:<p>

<ul>
<li>interpreting and processing incoming sensory signals (like visual,
somatosensory and auditory information).
<li>controlling muscles.  That is why people with epilepsy may fall down
and twitch.

<table cellpadding =10 bgcolor="#ffffcc"><TR><TD><h2><a name = 
"types">Types</a> of Epilepsy</h2>

There are many types of epilepsy.  Each type of epilepsy has different
behavioral effects and is treated with different methods.  In some cases,
people know they are about to have a seizure because they see or hear
something, or feel dizzy, nauseous, or "strange."  This is called an
<font
color=red>aura</font>.  An aura can act as an "early warning system" 
telling a person that a seizure is about to happen.  The person
can therefore minimize a possible injury by taking precautions such as 
sitting down.<p>

<ol><li><img src = "./gif/epispr.gif" align = right hspace=20 vspace=20
width="112" height="125"> 
<font color=red size="+1">Generalized seizures</font> -
uncontrollable discharge of neurons on BOTH sides of the brain.  This is
the most common type of epilepsy.  The seizure starts in one area of the
brain and spreads across the brain.  These seizures produce muscle
twitches, convulsions and loss of consciousness.  People with this type of
epilepsy do not remember having a seizure.<p>  There are several types of
generalized seizures:<p>
<ul>

<li><font color=red>Tonic-clonic ("grand mal") seizure</font> - This
seizure occurs when there is a massive discharge of neurons on both
cerebral hemispheres. The body becomes rigid and there is also jerking of
the body. "Tonic-clonic" means "stiffness-violent."  "Grand mal" means
"great sickness."<p>

<li><font color=red>Absence ("petit mal") seizure</font> - This seizure is
nonconvulsive.  However, a person may become unaware of his or her
surroundings and may stare off in space or freeze.  This seizure lasts
only 5-30 seconds.<p>

<li><font color=red>Myoclonic seizure</font> - This seizure involves the
motor cortex and causes twitching or jerking of certain parts of the
body.<P>

<li><font color=red>Atonic seizure</font> - This seizure is characterized
by the loss of muscle tone and causes a person to fall down.<p>

<li><font color=red>Status epilepticus</font> - This seizure is
characterized by frequent, long-lasting seizures without regaining
consciousness between attacks.  This condition requires immediate medical
attention.<p>
 </ul><p>

<li><font color=red size="+1">Partial Seizures </font>- This type of
seizure is characterized by abnormal electrical activity involving only a
small part of the brain.  Sometimes a partial seizure can spread to the
whole brain.<p>  Two types of partial seizures are:<P>

<ul>
<li><font color=red>Simple partial seizures (also called "Jacksonian" or
"focal" seizures)</font>
- Short-lasting seizures without loss of consciousness.  People with these
kinds of seizures often see, hear or smell
something strange.  Also, only part of the body may jerk.<p>

<li><font color=red>Complex partial (psychomotor) seizures</font> - A
seizure with a <i>change</i>, not a loss, in consciousness.  People may
hear or see things or memories may resurface.  Feelings of <i>deja vu</i>
may also occur.

</ul>

<h2><a name = "cause">Causes</A></h2>
<img src = "./gif/epiq.gif" width="70" height="75" align=right hspace=10>
Many (50-70%) cases of epilepsy have no known cause. For the remaining
cases, there are many other events that may cause epileptic seizures:<p>
<ul>
<li>Head injuries, such as a car accident or a fall.
<li>Brain tumor
<li><a href = "vessel.html">Stroke</A>
<li>Arteriosclerosis (fatty plaque build-up in arteries)
<li>Brain injury before birth caused by infection or lack of oxygen to the
brain
<li>Infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis
</ul><p>

Brain damage resulting from these events may cause a "scar" on the brain.  
This is where an epileptic seizure starts.  At this time it is not known 
<i>why</i> a scar starts a seizure.  There <i>may</i> be a genetic
link for some types of epilepsy, but this is usually NOT the case.

Sometimes a seizure will be started ("triggered") by:<p>
<ul><li>stress
<li>lack of sleep
<li>flashing lights or sounds (like from a video game or TV)
<li>low blood sugar
</ul>

<h2><a name = "diag">Diagnosis</a></h2>

A doctor will want to find out several things before a diagnosis of
epilepsy is made.  The doctor may want to know the answers to the
following questions:<p>

<ul>
<li>How often do the seizures occur?
<li>When was the first seizure?
<li>Was there a head injury?
<li>What are the seizures like?
<li>Were there any unusual sensations (smells, sounds, lights)?
<li>Is there any memory of the seizures?
</ul>

<img src = "./gif/poly.jpg" width="100" height="100" align=right
hspace=20> An <a href = "1020.html">electroencephalogram
(EEG)</a> is often used to help in the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The EEG of
people with epilepsy often shows large spikes.  Sometimes the EEG must be
recorded for a whole day in the hospital or at home because a short test
does not always pick up the abnormal activity.  However, the EEG does not
always work because about 5% of people <b>without</b> epilepsy have
"abnormal" EEG activity and about 20% of people <b>with</b> epilepsy have
normal EEG activity.<p>

<a href = "image.html">Brain
imaging</A> methods (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computer
tomography [CT] scanning) may also be used to find the location of a scar
or damaged brain tissue.  Sometimes positron emission tomography [PET] is
used to examine brain blood flow.

<td>Sometimes seizures stop without treatment.  Many people take 
antiepileptic (also called "anticonvulsant") drugs to control
seizures.  These drugs, however, do not cure the disorder.  Rather, these
drugs control the symptoms and are effective in 60-80% of the cases.  
Antiepileptic drugs work by reducing the abnormal firing of cortical
neurons.  These drugs may change the activity of neurotransmitters
responsible for seizures or alter the way ions flow in and out of neurons.  
Unfortunately, many of these drugs have side effects such as drowsiness,
dizziness and nausea so doctors must balance these undesirable effects
with seizure control.  It is also important to remember that different
drugs are used to treat different types of seizures.</td> <td><img src =

<h3>Surgery</h3>
When medication fails and the area of the brain where the seizure occurs
is known, surgery may be performed to treat epilepsy.  There are several
types
of surgery that have been used:<p><ul>
<li>Temporal Lobe Surgery - This is performed to remove brain tissue where
the epileptic seizure starts.  This type of surgery often removes part of
the cortex of the temporal lobe, hippocampus and amygdala. <a href =
"http://faculty.washington.edu/wcalvin/bk7/bk7ch17.htm"> [Brain
mapping during surgery]</a><p> <li>Corpus Callosotomy (<a href =
"split.html">"Split Brain"</a>
operation) - The corpus callosum is cut to separate the right and left
cerebral hemispheres.  This procedure is done to prevent the spread of the
seizure from one side of the brain to the other.<p>
<li>Hemispherectomy - One cerebral hemisphere is removed.  The procedure
is not performed very often.  Children who have this surgery CAN function
quite well although they often have trouble using their arm on the side of
the body opposite to the surgery.   In some
surgeries, only specific lobes of the brain are removed. </ul><p>

    Tony Rebelo</strong> is the Scientific Officer for the Protea Atlas Project. He obtained
    his PhD in Zoology at UCT in 1992 on the topic of the Preservation of the Cape Flora. <p>He
    has co-authored books on Pollination Ecology, Proteas and Vegetation types of South
    Africa, as well as numerous scientific publications on these topics.</p>
    <p>His special interests are conservation planning, protea ecology and encouraging
    amateurs to get involved in scientific research. To this end he has championed the design
    of user-friendly field guides, the use of common names for plants and also the Protea
    Atlas Project.</td>

<p align="left"><strong>Ismail Ebrahim</strong> is the Technical Assistant. He completed a
diploma in horticulture at Peninsula Technikon in 1997. He was initially introduced to the
Protea Atlas Project through the &#145;starfish&#146; internship program and spent 6
months gaining vital work experience . His passion for proteas first sparked while doing
his in-service training at ARC &#150; Fynbos. Working for the Protea Atlas Project has
further solidified this passion. His main function in the office is assisting the
Scientific Officer, checking Sight Record Sheets for any errors and maintaining Protea
Atlas vehicles. With the full support of the Protea Atlas Project Ismail has also
endeavored to propagate rare Proteaceae species in the nursery at Kirstenbosch.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Luthfia Cader</strong> is the Protea Atlas Secretary. She joined
the project as a &#145;Starfish intern&#146; in September 1998 and was later employed. She
maintains the smooth operation of the Protea Atlas Office as well as the capturing of data
in the additional remarks box on the SRS&#146;s to be included into the database. She
mentors new &#145;Starfish interns&#146;, facilitating their search for work experience.
She liaises with farmers to allow the Protea Atlas Project to have access to their land
for field trips. Her alliance with the Project has instilled in her the true sense of the
need for conserving of our natural flora. Since July 2001, Luthfia has been working
part-time for Ukuvuka.</p>

<p><strong>478 volunteers</strong> have collected data for the Protea Atlas Project. Apart
from regular feedback on their achievements, the Silver Tree, Golden Pagoda and Marsh Rose
are awarded to outstanding atlassers.</p>

<h3><a name="sukann"></a><a name="4X4"></a><b>Another Protea Atlas Project Staff Member</b></h3>

<p><img src="4X4.jpg" alt="Protea Atlas 4X4 - Photograph: Tony Rebelo" align="right" hspace="0" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="220">&quot;Reliable, strong and works hard&quot; would be an adequate description
for this staff member, but it could not tell of the contribution she has made to our
project! Kindly donated by WWF-SA, our vehicle has, with very little complaint, taken us
&quot;where no Atlasser has gone before&quot; - and often &quot;where no sane car has gone
before&quot; enabling us to atlas large areas in a day. Her distinctive red blush, with
appropriate signage, has given us co-operation from landowners and access to places with
very little explanation.</p>

<p>When she joined the NBI fleet, aware of our obligations to our sponsors, she was
touched up, buffed to a high shine and given new decals. Three months down the line, our
maintenance manager, Deryck, has declared her the hardest working vehicle in the fleet
[...but he has despaired on keeping her mud free!]</p>

<p><img src="fire2.jpg" alt="fire2.jpg (28201 bytes)" align="left" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="273">Roadside Atlassing
conjures up a picture of us stopping at the side of a reasonably normal road, getting out,
notebooks and pencils in hand, for a demure saunter into the nearby bush to see what we
can find. Anyone who has come on a Weekday or Weekend Atlassing Jol will know that this is
far from the truth! Frequently squeezed like sardines into the red and white tin, with
little room to rattle around, we are ferried through boulder-strewn gullies, muddy fords
and up to the top of precipitous slopes. Ruth Smart commented last week that she had no
need to go to gym - she reckoned the bouncing around on the back seat was doing wonders
for her posterior and Helen Campbell has been known to close her eyes on occasion. <i>Suikerkannetjie</i>
and Tony work as a finely tuned team. Dropping us singly or in pairs, they carefully
negotiate the terrain and keep track of plot sizes. We are left in the middle of nowhere
to do our plot and watch out for a red flag, our pick-up point. Along the way, we often
catch a glimpse or hear them zipping to and fro as they crisscross the area, to return for
us 8 minutes and 500&nbsp;m later, to hear what we have found and to start the procedure
all over again.</p>

<p>Though she can be rather a heavy drinker, depending on the pressure we put on her, and
she is rather inclined to lose things when the going gets tough, she is absolutely
indispensable to the Project and we couldn't imagine coping without her!</p>

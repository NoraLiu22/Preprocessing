<FONT SIZE=4>The UIUC DLI project will be able to provide to fellow          
members of the Digital Library Initiative access to its Testbed,          
which currently holds the full text of SGML documents from selected          
engineering journals. These journals, which number 20 at the present          
time, are being furnished by the American Institute of Physics          
(AIP), the American Physical Society (APS), the American Society          
of Civil Engineers (ASCE), IEE (Institution of Electrical Engineers),          
IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), IEEE          
Computer Society, and the American Society of Agricultural Engineers          
(ASAE). Over the next year, journals from the American Association          
for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Institute          
of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and John Wiley &amp; Sons          
will be added to the Testbed.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>The UIUC DLI is utilizing   
<A HREF = "http://www.opentext.com">OpenText Corporation's</a>          
OpenText Index Search engine. The search engine, which indexes          
and accesses DLI project documents, is an extremely robust and          
expandable system that allows phrase, Boolean, and proximity searching,          
and is tailored to SGML processing and retrieval. One of the cornerstones          
of the distributed repository model is the separation of metadata          
and index data from the full-text articles themselves, which allows          
efficient retrieval from subsets of the full-text repositories.          
To this end, the UIUC is working towards identifying the optimum          
bibliographic metadata to assist in full-text retrieval. The metadata          
elements presently being specified include: URL, basic bibliographic          
information, author information (including affiliation), abstract,          
figure and table information, and bibliography information (including          
all citations).  
<p>          
The UIUC DLI is collaborating with the University of Michigan          
DLI Interface team to incorporate Search Tree retrieval techniques          
first developed by Karen Drabenstott for the ASTUTE Project into          
the UIUC Testbed interface design. These techniques serve as search          
navigation aids, by suggesting to the user various modifications          
that will broaden or narrow search results, addressing the frequent          
problems users encounter with too few or too many retrievals.          
This collaboration will provide a means for testing the efficacy          
of various interface designs across several DLI projects.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>Semantic concept space technology, which utilizes          
co-ocurrence term matrices, will be transferred to the University          
of California at Santa Barbara DLI. The UIUC DLI focuses on methods          
that interactively provide the user with conceptual maps that          
offer alternative search terms. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>Due to the nature of the legal agreement between          
the UIUC DLI and our partners, the UIUC Testbed will not be available          
for experimentation among other groups outside of the DLI until          
the 3rd and 4th years of the grant (1997-1998), at which time          
access will be provided to the CIC (Committee on Institutional          
Cooperation) community, which is comprised of: the University          
of Chicago, The University of Illinois, Indiana University, the          
University of Iowa, The University of Michigan, Michigan State

with the group at Rutgers University. The large collections generated          
by supercomputers are available as well, e.g. concept spaces across          
1,000 areas of engineering.

<FONT SIZE=4>The UIUC DLI project is emphasizing the collaborative          
effort needed between university researchers and our publishing          
partners. A large part of the project will be to look at the future          
roles of publishers, libraries, A &amp; I services, and authors,          
and to extend the model of distributed publisher repositories          
developed in the DLI project. We now have a viable retrieval system          
and are in the process of setting up a framework for a system          
of federated repositories The DLI will be in a position to advise          
our publishing partners in setting up their own repositories and          
we will continue to work on the research needed for effective          
indexing, retrieval and display of the full-text of scientific          
and engineering journals.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4><a href = "http://www.grainger.uiuc.edu/">The University Library at the University of   
Illinois</a> is developing an industrial partnership program to augment the          
research and development work going on in the DLI project, and          
to extend the Testbed past the four year NSF/ARPA/NASA grant period.          
In addition to continuing in the collection and maintenance of          
large-scale digital collections, we hope to expand the scope and          
breadth of the Testbed to include other full-text journals, preprints,          
and conference papers. The UIUC Library hopes to establish a collaborative          
environment with DLI publishing partners in order to more fully          
explore the potential of SGML retrieval and display and the distributed          
repository model, linking to other digital projects, including          
image databases, numerical databases, and A &amp; I service databases.

<FONT SIZE=4>We expect that during the course of the DLI project          
many of our publisher partners will create their own repositories.          
The DLI role will continue to emphasize the gateway or front-end          
access to multiple information repositories, including full-text          
repositories. This will help the Testbed evolve into a multiple-view          
reference system to a federated collection of distributed repositories.          
The repository management package will let other organizations          
and individuals make their organized collections searchable via          
a multiple-view interface.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4>The UIUC DLI project is providing major input to          
the next-generation server that   
<A HREF = "http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</a> is building. The server will          
move from a WWW document server using HTTP to a distributed repository          
host using multiple protocols. The server version 2.0, due the          
summer of 1996, will feature a modular protocol design and integrated          
security. We will later incorporate the work on stateful gateways          
into the server on the output end. The input end will incorporate          
the work on collection development, so that the new server will          
eventually support session history and metadata checking. Later          
versions will also support security measures such as token passing.

<FONT SIZE=4>Industrial technology transfer between DLI partners          
and other companies is key to the advancement of information retrieval          
for large collections. The structure of the DLI projects, with          
large testbeds and many partners, is set up to encourage technology          
transfer of new developments. For effective search of multimedia          
objects across multiple repositories on the Web, software developed          
by the research teams must be shared with companies with the means          
to advance research. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4>To expand and continue the research efforts, such          
as the scalable semantics research, additional funding for research          
must be available. This might take the form, for example, of a          
follow-on initiative to the DLI in another area of information          
management, such as analysis environments.</FONT>

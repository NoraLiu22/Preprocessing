        Trying to find accurate information about green iguanas is often like 
        trying to discover whether UFOs really exist. But, as the saying goes, 
        the truth is out there - if you look carefully enough. Here are my opinions 
        on the controversial matter of whether green iguanas should be fed animal 
        protein in their diets - and that includes high plant protein sources 
        such as soybean or tofu.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
        I'm a zoologist, and I've been doing some research on iguana diets in 
        recent years. One thing you realise when you look at the literature and 
        talk to animal nutritionists is that we still know so little about iguana 
        physiology that we're basically drawing our conclusions from other animal 
        physiology, filling in gaps ourselves, and coming up with a good guess. 
        Here are some of the main pros and cons as far as I see the whole issue.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>IGUANA EVOLUTION</b><br>
        Iguanas have evolved to fill a certain niche - that is, herbivory in arboreal 
        tropical environments. They are successful, because there are few competitors 
        (especially reptilian ones). This pressure to efficiently digest plant 
        matter has led to a longer, more sophisticated digestive system to enable 
        fermentation and breakdown of otherwise quite hard to deal with matter. 
        However, the pressure has been there because of the abundance of food, 
        and perhaps the lower energy requirements necessary to locate and acquire 
        food sources. Take a pinch of salt, add several hundred thousand years, 
        and you have a digestive system nicely adapted for herbivory (I won't 
        say perfectly adapted, because perfection is a very subjective quality!).</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESEARCH ON WILD 
        IGUANAS</b><br>
        None of the published scientific field research on green iguana diets 
        in the wild suggests that they take animal protein, but it does show that 
        they derive all their protein (and other) requirements from plant materials 
        in the diet. Anecdotal reports which seem to have made it into the literature 
        suggest that juveniles have an increased propensity to take insects. There 
        is the odd report that iguanas also take bird eggs and carrion - there's 
        even less evidence for either of these. The nutritional research which 
        has been done (examining wild iguana gut contents) shows no evidence of 
        animal protein, although if it were present it would be in such low amounts 
        so as not to be detected by such a study. So, the natural diet of green 
        iguanas does not include any animal protein. This doesn't discount the 
        notion that they might accidentally ingest the odd insect together with 
        a flower head, or whatever, but I hardly consider this to be anything 
        significant... in the same way that cows don't eat animal protein, but 
        they're not going to wrinkle their nose and lightly brush stray bugs from 
        their juicy grass stems. My conclusion here is that they are strict herbivores 
        under normal circumstances.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ADAPTATIONS TO HERBIVORY</b><br>
        Take a look at iguana morphology and physiology. Iguanas are not equipped 
        to hunt down and digest animal prey. Their digestive system employs a 
        hindgut fermentation process, which is to break down plant matter, cell 
        walls and carbohydrate. This isn't to say they couldn't digest animal 
        protein, but just that they're optimised for plant matter. They also spend 
        their entire time in the wild living on their food plants. Why spend time 
        and energy hunting animals when plant food is all around them? So, my 
        conclusion that they are strict herbivores still stands.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>EXCEPTIONS TO THE 
        RULE?</b><br>
        Feral green iguanas (e.g. Puerto Rico) have been reported to take insects 
        more frequently that &quot;incidental&quot; would imply. Captive iguanas 
        will also readily take insects, mice and other sources of animal protein 
        if offered them (mice are often taken by iguanas that would happily remove 
        your finger at the same time - almost giving the impression that they 
        would eat anything presented to them). Some people seem to have almost 
        converted their iguanas into carnivores. However, iguanas are nothing 
        if not opportunistic. It seems that under conditions of stress and poor 
        food availability (and that includes feral populations, which are mal-adapted 
        to the local flora), they will resort to using additional food sources 
        until the situation improves. This suggests that even in their native 
        habitat they might resort to limited omnivory if that becomes necessary 
        for survival. Iguanas in captivity are nothing if not stressed, and offered 
        poor quality diets on the whole. Therefore, eating insects, mice or whatever 
        doesn't seem unreasonable. Iguanas will happily eat their substrate if 
        nothing else presents itself. Herbivorous animals have been known to eat 
        carrion, including their own kind, when presented with no other food sources 
        (e.g. cows and sheep have been reported to do this). Given this evidence, 
        though, it seems that eating animal protein is a &quot;last resort&quot; 
        - i.e. it's a poorer choice of diet. Also, in the wild, if a normally 
        herbivorous iguana is forced to resort to eating some animal protein, 
        the change will be temporary until better food options present themselves. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONSEQUENCES OF 
        HIGH PROTEIN INTAKE</b><br>
        Iguanas, and any animals for that matter, grow very quickly with increased 
        amounts of protein. If you're interested in fast growth rates, usually 
        when the animals are harvested for food, then increase their protein intake. 
        As animal protein is better than plant protein for this, then feeding 
        herbivorous animals animal protein will increase growth rate. This is 
        why there is so much controversy over BSE in cows in the UK - beef cattle 
        are pumped full of animal protein (including spinal tissue, in this case) 
        so they grow quickly. However, the farmer is not interested in long-term 
        health - the animals are culled at an early age, with the exception of 
        breeding animals which receive a different diet anyway. Dairy cattle are 
        fed lower amounts of animal protein. Long term health is affected by excess 
        protein, however. Veterinary evidence shows that excess animal protein 
        in iguanas leads to gout, dehydration, metabolic bone disease, renal failure, 
        kidney stones etc... and is one of the biggest causes of relatively young 
        iguana mortality. The reason these poor diets (i.e. high percentages of 
        animal protein) exist in the older literature is that they were formulated 
        from farm-raising practises of green iguanas. So, iguanas show good growth 
        rates, but the longterm effects severely shorten longevity.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SPECIFIC EFFECTS 
        OF ANIMAL PROTEIN ON IGUANAS</b><br>
        Animal protein contains components which iguana digestive physiology can't 
        deal with in large amounts (e.g. fats, different purine/pyramidine ratios, 
        different amino acid ratios). This also very likely unbalances the natural 
        gut fauna the iguana possesses in the hindgut (as has been shown in studies 
        on other herbivores), reducing digestion efficiency of plant matter which 
        should make up the majority of the diet anyway. Iguanas, being herbivores, 
        are physiologically adapted to process specific kinds of dietary protein 
        - i.e. those found in plant materials. While animal protein can be metabolised, 
        it literally overwhelms the system in excess (and it doesn't take much 
        to cause an excess - although we don't know exactly how much). Nucleic 
        acids in the foods are degraded to nucleotides and ultimately pyrimidine 
        and purine bases - more are synthesised from amino acids in the liver. 
        Any of these which are not used by the body are broken down into uric 
        acid (or allantoin in some mammals, reptiles, fish). With animal proteins, 
        green iguanas end up with an excess of uric acid in the body fluids, and 
        over time this crystallises out - so uric acid crystals form in tissues 
        throughout the body, impairing their function and leading to serious problems.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>DO SAFE LEVELS EXIST?</b><br>
        There's no doubt that excess animal protein kills iguanas in the longterm. 
        However, that's not the question. The question is, is there a certain 
        amount of animal protein (very low percentage of daily intake) which will 
        either not harm the animal, or perhaps even be beneficial because of its 
        high protein content? Hindgut fermentation works best in larger animals 
        (more efficient per unit volume of food), but what about hatchling iguanas 
        which are much smaller? Would perhaps the odd insect lead to increased 
        growth with no obvious health problems until the hindgut area grew large 
        enough to be able to reach a greater operating efficiency? (i.e. they're 
        not utilising all the purines/pyramidines in their diet, so animal protein 
        doesn't cause uric acid concentrations in the blood to go up significantly 
        because not all the purines/pyramidines are being utilised)</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>BUT ISN'T ANIMAL 
        PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR...?</b><br>
        It is quite commonly believed that animal protein is the only way an iguana 
        can get any or enough calcium in it's diet (because animal bones contain 
        calcium). This is incorrect - calcium is present in varying quantities 
        in most plants, but still many iguanas suffer from calcium deficiency 
        which leads to metabolic bone disease. In order to prevent these symptoms, 
        a balanced diet needs to be created which contains sufficient calcium 
        and sufficient vitamin D3 (which may be present in the diet, supplements, 
        or more usefully through synthesis in the skin by the action of UVB wavelengths 
        in sunlight). At the same time, the inhibiting effects on calcium metabolism 
        of phytates, oxalates, acid and fat must be minimised. Powdered calcium 
        powder helps to supplement a diet which might otherwise be low in this 
        important element. It is also sometimes believed that animal protein is 
        the only way an iguana can get any protein, period! This simply isn't 
        true - plants also contain proteins, but with different ratios of amino 
        acids to animal tissue (the former of which the iguana digestive system 
        has evolved to cope with). </font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>FURTHER SPECULATION 
        ON NATURAL VARIATION</b><br>
        Ranging from Mexico to Brazil as they do, iguanas come from a diverse 
        array of habitat types and it's very likely, given the morphological and 
        behavioural variations that exist, that similar variations in dietary 
        preferences also exist. Perhaps some populations do select limited amounts 
        of animal protein, and perhaps these animals do have lower life expectancies. 
        We simply don't know this yet. There are clues: some iguanas appear to 
        reach much smaller adult sizes than their counterparts. It's one of my 
        speculations that these animals may be adapted to a poorer diet (caused 
        by adaptation to the different foods available in another habitat), and 
        even if presented with a richer diet don't grow as quickly as those from 
        other populations. Although Iguana iguana is one species, there are many 
        different races which can often become available in the pet trade. Remember, 
        though, that captive farmed iguanas (which make up by far the majority 
        of animals available) are coming from a limited number of breeding operations, 
        which are harvesting eggs/raising animals from the same area, and therefore 
        diversity in captive populations may be more limited. I'm a little wary, 
        though, of suggesting a perfect diet for all iguanas (from Mexico to Brazil) 
        - it doesn't make any sense that they would all benefit equally from exactly 
        the same diet given that they don't live in the same environments, but 
        until we learn more (and we haven't yet) the best we can do it provide 
        diets which we know are beneficial to the widest number of animals.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>GENERAL CONCLUSIONS</b><br>
        Iguanas are herbivores. However, like adding leaded fuel to an unleaded 
        car, you can still throw other things through the digestive system, and 
        it will still try and do what digestive systems are good at - digest it! 
        A small amount of leaded in an unleaded car might make it hiccup at little, 
        but no lasting harm. In captivity, though, people put too much leaded 
        fuel in and destroy the engine of their iguana over time. The whole digestive 
        system can cope with much of the contents of animal protein, but because 
        the rest of the body isn't used to dealing with this kind of food source 
        (inc. high protein, fat etc...), things get thrown out of balance if there's 
        too much of it (this doesn't normally happen under natural conditions, 
        otherwise selection pressure would tend to lead to more omnivorous animals).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Those who think that 
        green iguanas should for some reason be fed animal protein are not considering 
        their natural physiology or behaviour. They know that animal protein (i.e. 
        large amounts of protein) will result in additional growth. They're right 
        - just look at beef cattle. However, much of this information has come 
        from captive farming operations where animals were intentionally grown 
        quickly for either reintroduction programs or for food purposes. In the 
        former, the longterm negative effects were not known, although if it was 
        enough to allow several breeding generations of wild animals then its 
        purpose would have been satisfied. In the latter, who cares if an animal 
        will die at 5 years if it's slaughtered for lots of meat at 3 years?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Interestingly, many 
        of those formulating diets for captive iguanas for the pet industry still 
        include animal protein, because there's a belief that there must be some 
        level at which animal protein benefits growth without significantly affecting 
        longterm health. I think this view is erroneous, particularly as they 
        still have little idea what kind of protein levels are harmful - taking 
        a chance, if you like, but if the food makes your ig grow, people are 
        going to buy it, right? Perhaps this is a factor - if someone buys product 
        A that includes animal protein, their iguana will appear to grow faster. 
        But, if they try product B because they hear it has no animal protein, 
        but their iguana's growth slows down a little, they might go back to product 
        A. Cynical, but probably not without merit! If someone does decent longterm 
        research and proves my view wrong, then fine, but until they do my opinion 
        stands. After all, a good artificial diet is theoretically possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> My overall conclusion 
        to this is that no, we don't know it all. Far from it. However, everything 
        that we do know so far tells us to be very cautious. I'm sure the odd 
        bit of chicken, insect or whatever on very rare occasions will do the 
        iguana no harm. However, I really don't see why this should be necessary, 
        and I can't understand the hangups about missing it out altogether. It's 
        almost as though people feel that iguanas must have a little animal protein 
        every so often, otherwise they might be missing out on something. I get 
        the impression others tout animal protein just because everyone else says 
        don't bother with it. When the idea of using animal protein is so entwined 
        within the literature of even fairly modern books, it's hard to avoid 
        this question - it keeps coming up time and time again. This is good, 
        because every time it comes up, we hopefully know a little more about 
        how the processes work. At the moment, however, we don't know enough, 
        and so my advice to people is always not to include it - not because a 
        tiny bit might not be beneficial, but because too much is definitely bad, 
        and we don't know how much is too much! People who use animal protein 
        are, in my opinion, playing dice with the health of their iguana (longterm), 
        and I don't think it's worth it - given that we know a totally herbivorous 
        diet is very healthy - but a good totally herbivorous diet, that is! A 
        bad diet, period, will kill your iguana. But I think the best diet is 
        totally herbivorous, until I see any convincing evidence to the contrary, 
        or firm data to show how much animal protein can be safely utilised (if 
        any).</font></p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Introduction</b><br>
        Anyone who keeps green iguanas (Iguana iguana) cannot fail to be impressed 
        by the way they look. Their dorsal spines, dewlap, tail and long claw-tipped 
        toes all contribute to their unique appearance. In their natural habitat, 
        these physical characteristics play important roles in their social displays, 
        their natural behaviour, and in their camouflage and defence. When we 
        keep one of these demanding reptiles in captivity, however, we need to 
        be aware of what iguanas use these morphological adaptations for, because 
        it will influence the ways in which we house them and care for them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> One of the most obvious 
        of these physical adaptations is the presence of the powerful legs, the 
        long toes, and the sharp, curved claws. In the wild, the iguana uses these 
        superbly when walking, running, climbing and leaping. The legs can propel 
        them at surprising speed both along the ground and up trees - something 
        of which you need to be aware if you want to give your iguana a little 
        more freedom. The long toes and sharp claws are used primarily in climbing 
        both up and down branches and trees - they act almost like grappling hooks, 
        or spiked climbing shoes, providing a strong grip on otherwise potentially 
        slippery surfaces. A fall from a great height could result in disaster 
        for an iguana.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Claws in Captivity</b><br>
        The problem with an animal which possesses sharp claws will become apparent 
        to anyone who tries to pick one up. Whether intentionally or not, a swift 
        and determined movement of the foot can result in quite deep scratches 
        along your arm. In the wild, this is part of an iguana's defence mechanism. 
        An animal bitten, scratched and whipped will be much more likely to look 
        for an easier item to add to its menu. If you're keeping an iguana in 
        captivity, however, you need to consider the potential effects of their 
        sharp claws. Handling your iguana on a regular basis is an important part 
        of interacting with it if your intentions are to tame it. In addition, 
        regular handling is also important if you want to move the animal around 
        - for example, when you need to clean the enclosure. In such a situation, 
        you don't want to receive deep scratches each time you attempt to pick 
        the iguana up. Apart from their unsightly appearance, cuts and scratches 
        are a potential source of infection, especially if the claws harbour dirt 
        on the underside - not unusual, as the underside of the claw tip is grooved. 
        There are other disadvantages to your iguana having long claws, and these 
        will be discussed later.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> What about age? Should 
        small juveniles have their claws trimmed? It's certainly a good idea to 
        start early - that way you have more chance of getting the iguana used 
        to the routine of claw trimming. More care must be exercised, however. 
        Juveniles have much smaller claws which are less well-defined than those 
        of older iguanas, and otiose easier to make a mistake. In this case, it 
        may be easier to use a smooth file on the claws, as this minimises any 
        risk of injury, and very little actual claw tip needs to be removed. Once 
        they get used to you messing with their claws (which also gives you the 
        opportunity to check for unshed scales or caught fibres), they're more 
        likely to co-operate when they get larger - and they do get larger very 
        quickly if you're looking after them properly!</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Trimming Iguana 
        Claws</b><br>
        The important thing to remember when trimming (and I use this word instead 
        of cutting for a good reason) claws is not to overdo it. The word trimming 
        implies removing just a small amount of claw, and this is exactly what 
        you need to do. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="images/igclaw.jpg"><img src="images/igclaw.jpg" width="461" height="240" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="Diagram of iguana claw, by Adam Britton" border="0"></a></font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Figure 1 shows a drawing 
        of an iguana claw viewed from the side. If you hold your iguana's claws 
        up to the light, you should be able to see this. You can see that the 
        claw is composed of two main sections. Where the claw meets the scales 
        of the toes, it contains blood vessels and nerves - this is the growing 
        part of the claw, and should definitely not be cut. Doing so will cause 
        a lot of pain to the iguana, together with a lot of blood, and will become 
        a potential site for infection. Imagine cutting your nails right down 
        into the quick - even removing the tip of your finger! This is what it 
        would be like for the iguana if you cut this section of the claw.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The second part of 
        the claw is the sharp, curved tip. The top of the claw grows at a faster 
        rate than the lower part, which is why it curves downwards. The claw tip 
        contains no blood vessels or nerves - it is dead, just like the tips of 
        your fingernails. This is the part of the claw you need to cut. It's best 
        to use a pair of small dog claw trimmers for this - human nail scissors 
        or clippers are not designed for cylindrical claws like an iguana's, and 
        tend to crush and damage the claw. But how much do you cut off? It's a 
        good idea to cut no more than half of the claw tip off (see dotted line 
        on diagram). Not only does this reduce the chance of you making a mistake 
        and cutting into the living part of the claw, but it's also better for 
        your iguana. If you remove too much, your iguana will have very blunt 
        claws, particularly if you file and smooth the end. While this may seem 
        better for you, with less chance of being scratched, it's a poor deal 
        for the iguana which uses its claws during climbing and may therefore 
        be unable to move around in its enclosure properly. Blunt claws increase 
        the chance of the iguana slipping, especially on branches, and therefore 
        injuring itself. Cutting off no more than half of the tip will ensure 
        that its claws are still sharp enough to be effective, but not so sharp 
        that it makes handling your iguana a hazardous experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Iguanas often don't 
        like having their claws trimmed, although they get used to regular routines 
        - once every two to three weeks if you trim less than half of the claw 
        tip. My iguana has come to accept it as &quot;one of those things&quot; 
        and looks at me as if to say &quot;Go on then, if you really must.&quot; 
        An irregular routine will only be stressful for the animal. If you can, 
        try and get someone else to hold the iguana, preferably in a soft towel, 
        while you do the trimming. Holding the appropriate leg is also a good 
        idea, otherwise sudden movements increase the risk of you making a mistake. 
        If you simply can't get someone else to help, then there are other solutions, 
        such as trimming claws after the iguana has fallen asleep each night. 
        Don't try and rush through the job - be slow and methodical, dealing with 
        claws in the same order each time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Once the claw has been 
        trimmed, make sure the end is clean and tidy. Split claws will trap dirt, 
        which may be transferred to your skin if you're scratched. If you do make 
        a mistake and cut into the living claw, make sure you clean the tip of 
        the claw with a sterile swab. The wound should stop bleeding quickly, 
        but specific products available from your vet can be used to stem the 
        flow of blood more rapidly.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Is Trimming Really 
        Necessary?</b><br>
        Trimming claws on a regular basis is a necessary care requirement when 
        keeping a green iguana in captivity for a number of reasons. I've already 
        mentioned the disadvantages to the handler if the iguana's claws are very 
        sharp. One of the commonest reasons people &quot;give up&quot;on their 
        green iguanas is because they become vicious and aggressive when handled. 
        Taming iguanas requires regular handling, and this can be achieved much 
        more easily if the claws don't inflict painful and visible wounds every 
        time the animal is picked up. Wearing gloves and long-sleeved tops can 
        overcome this, but gloves should not be necessary from a handling standpoint 
        - in fact, gloves can make it difficult to determine how hard an iguana 
        is being held, which could result in injuries to the iguana through over-enthusiastic 
        handling. Injuries through scratches can also lead to secondary infections 
        in some cases, and claw trimming will help to avoid this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Another reason for 
        trimming is to benefit the iguanas. In the wild, iguanas tend to do more 
        climbing, running and leaping over a variety of different surfaces than 
        they do in captivity. This provides plenty of opportunities for the claws 
        to be worn down naturally. Captive iguanas which do not have their claws 
        trimmed can eventually develop problems, whereby claws can become too 
        long and curve back on themselves, even injuring the iguana or others 
        in the same habitat as they climb about. As the iguana's caretaker, it 
        should be your responsibility to keep your iguana in peak condition, and 
        regular claw trimming should be one of the many ways in which you achieve 
        this.</font></p>

It mayeven be that the ancestry of birds lies within this group, which would makethem dromaeosaurs too, but this is not at all established.</p><h3>The &#147;raptors&#148;</h3><p>The dromaeosaurs were what are popularly known as (especially in <ahref="../buzz/popular.html">Jurassic Park</a>) the "raptors"; agroup of fascinating creatures. "Raptor" is not a technical term favored byscientists to describe these animals; there is already a group of birdscalled the raptors (it includes the eagles and other hunters). The nameof the clade, Dromaeosauridae, is favored over "raptors."The dromaeosaurs were small (wolf-sized) to large (up to 30 feet long!)theropods which had specialized features such as a well-developed slashing talon ontheir second pedal phalanx (toe) (pictured below), a stiffened tail which possibly functioned asa dynamic stabilizer, and large grasping manus (hands). They were well-equipped withclaws, muscular toothy jaws, and agile bodies. These dromaeosaurs have been assumed to have been active, fierce predators since theirdiscovery, and have been influential in the revolution in modern paleontologists' views ofdinosaur <a href="../metabolism.html">metabolism</a>and <a href="../avians.html">bird origins</a>.</p><p><img src="velociraptor2_skrep.jpg" width="640" height="296" border="0" vspace="4" alt="Velociraptor skeleton by Michael Skrepnick"><br><span class="style2">The skeleton of <i>Velociraptor</i>. &copy; <a href="http://www.dinosaursinart.com/" target="_blank">Michael Skrepnick</a>.</span></p><p>Who were they? What were they like? Let's look at a few interestingspecimens:</p><img src="deinon_tenont1_skrep.jpg" width="640" height="175" border="1" alt="Two Deinonychus approach a Tenontosaurus herd, by Michael Skrepnick"><br><table width="415" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="left">  <tr>    <td class="style2"><img src="deinon_tenont2_skrep.jpg" width="400" height="266" border="1" vspace="4" alt="Deinonychus attack a tenontosaur, by Michael Skrepnick"><br>At top, two <i>Deinonychus</i> approach a herd of tenontosaurs.

Ostrom's (of Yale University) 1969 and 1976 descriptionsof <i>Deinonychus</i> ("terrible claw") were a major contributor to the re-evaluation ofdinosaur activity levels. Ostrom saw the strikingly specialized adaptations present in<i>Deinonychus</i> and proposed that this was no "sluggish lizard,"but an active, agilepredator that used all four limbs and its jaws to subdue prey. He also saw similaritiesbetween it and modern birds, and has today continued to be a leading proponent forthe dromaeosaurian kinship with birds. One of his outstanding students, Dr. R.T. Bakker, wenton to become the most ardent supporter of Ostrom's ideas, and has been one of the mostcontroversial figures in paleontology; making great strides to revitalize the study ofdinosaurs and stimulating conversation among such researchers. <i>Deinonychus</i> alsohas been found as fossils in small groups which seem to have been killed while attacking<i>Tenontosaurus tilletti</i>, a larger<a href="../ornithischia/ornithischia.html">ornithischiandinosaur</a>. This is considered possible evidence of pack-oriented predatory behavior; leading tospeculation that these dinosaurs were fairly intelligent,social animals as well.</p><p><i>Deinonychus antirrhopus</i> was about 10 feet (3 m) long and weighed maybe 180 pounds (80kg); about the size of a jaguar or mountain lion. It has been found in Early Cretaceousdeposits in North America.</p><p><b><i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i>:</b> <I>Velociraptor</i> ("swift seizer") isknown from a few well-preserved remains from Late Cretaceous formations fromMongolia; one of which was fossilized in the act of killing <i>Protoceratops andrewsi</i>,a small <a href="../ornithischia/ceratopsia.html">ceratopsiandinosaur</a> (pictured at the bottom of the <a href"theropoda.html">theropod exhibit</a>).It appears that a freak sandstorm in the Mongolian desert buried the two dinosaurs; the<i>Velociraptor</i> had killed the <i>Protoceratops</i> with its slashing talons, but itsforelimb was trapped in the latter's beaked jaws, so it could not escape and was suffocated.One of the most amazing and dramatic fossil finds ever discovered.</p><p>Contrary to <a href="../buzz/popular.html">JurassicPark</a>, <i>Velociraptor</i> was not a large animal; it was about 6 feet (1.8 m) long andweighed maybe 100 pounds (45 kg); about the size of a large dog or wolf.</p><p><b><i>Utahraptor kirklandi</i>:</b> However, during the filming of the movie<i>Jurassic Park</i>, fragments of a large dromaeosaur skeleton were found in Utah. A study proclaimed that the giantraptor from the movie had been found; this animal seemed to be the perfect size for such a creature.Giant dromaeosaurs have been recently found in Argentina, Japan, and elsewhere in Asia, so we know that there were probably several types of dromaeosaurs aboutthe size of the <i>Jurassic Park</i> villains, and even larger!</p><h3>The Terrible Claw</h3>    <table width="415" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">      <tr>        <td class="style2"><img src="deinon_pes_skrep.jpg" width="400" height="163" border="0" vspace="5" alt="Comparison of Deinonychus foot with that of a modern pigeon, by Michael Skrepnick"><br>The foot of <i>Deinonychus</i> compared with that of a modern pigeon (not to scale). &copy; <a href="http://www.dinosaursinart.com/" target="_blank">Michael Skrepnick</a>.</td>        <td><img src="/images/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""></td>      </tr>    </table><p>The "killing claw" of dromaeosaurs is an incredible structure useful for just that: killing. Itwas normally held off of the ground during locomotion, but when the muscles of  the toewere contracted, the claw swept down quickly. The claw base-to-tip angle maximized thetransmission of forces from the leg to the tip of the claw, providing for a powerful slashthat may have been able to disembowel prey swiftly. The stiffened tail would have beengood to stabilize the body while the grasping arms and jaws held onto the prey for balance.Although there is no conclusive evidence for this, it has been suggestedthat dromaeosaurs could have performedleaps onto large prey and used all four limbs to rip wounds in them. Truly an example ofevolution producing a killing machine. Dromaeosaurs were probably not the fastest ofdinosaurs since dromaeosaurs have fairly large femora (thigh bones); <ahref="ornithomimidae.html">ornithomimids</a> probably were fastest (see our <ahref="../buzz/locomotion.html">dinosaur speeds exhibit</a> for more information), butpersuasive evidence in any case is lacking. It has been argued thatdromaeosaurs were similar to lions in predatory behavior, preferring ambushes, quickchases using their high maneuverability, and pack tactics. This is speculation ofcourse; we can't really know what dromaeosaurs were like, but we can haveloads of fun speculating. New finds of dromaeosaur specimens in the last few years willhopefully tell us more about these strange and exciting dinosaurs.</p><p>Let's take a look at <a href="../birds/birdintro.html">birds</a>.</p><!--#include virtual="/weblift.html"--><p align="center"><a href="audrom.html"><img src="/images/authors.gif" width="68" height="23" hspace="3" alt="Authors"></a><a href="/copyright.html"><img src="/images/copyright.gif" width="23" height="23" hspace="3" alt="Copyright"></a></p></td>  </tr></table><!--#include virtual="/footer1.html"--><!--#include virtual="/sitesearch.html"--></body></html> contentType 9 text/html url 70 https://ucmp.berkeley.edu:443/diapsids/saurischia/dromaeosauridae.html responseCode 3 200

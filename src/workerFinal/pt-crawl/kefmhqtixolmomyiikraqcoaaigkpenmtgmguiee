/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: This essay, in some respects 
        an extension of the arguments presented in S427, was printed in the January 
        1892 number of <u>The Arena</u> (Boston). Original pagination indicated

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 145]]</font> The word 
        progress, as used above, has two distinct meanings, not always recognized, 
        whence has arisen some confusion of ideas. It may mean either an advance 
        in material civilization, or in the mental and moral nature of man, and 
        these are far from being synonymous. Material civilization is essentially 
        cumulative. Each generation benefits by the trials and failures of the 
        preceding generation; and since the discovery of printing has facilitated 
        the preservation and circulation of all new knowledge, progress of this 
        kind has gone on at an ever accelerated pace. But this does not imply 
        any general increase of mental power. Step by step the science of mathematics 
        has advanced immensely since the time of Newton, but the advance does 
        not prove that the mathematicians of to-day have a greater genius for 
        mathematics--are really greater mathematicians--than Newton and his contemporaries, 
        or even than the Greeks of the time of Euclid and Archimedes. Our modern 
        steam engines and locomotives far surpass those of Watt and Robert Stephenson, 
        but of the hundreds who have labored to improve them perhaps none have 
        surpassed those great men in mechanical genius. And so it is with every 
        item which goes to form that which we term our civilization. We have risen, 
        step by step, on the ladders and scaffolds erected by our predecessors, 
        and if we can now mount higher and see further than they could it does 
        not in the least prove that we are, on the average, greater men, intellectually, 
        than they were. The <font color="990000">[[p. 146]]</font> question I 
        propose to discuss is one quite apart from that of civilization as usually 
        understood. It is, whether mankind have advanced as intellectual and moral 
        beings; and, if so, by what agencies and under what laws have they so 
        advanced in the past, and what are the conditions under which that advance 
        may be continued in the future.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, first, to inquire whether there is 
        any evidence of such an advance in human nature during historic times; 
        and this is by no means so simple a problem and one so easily answered 
        as is sometimes supposed. If there has been any cause constantly at work 
        tending to elevate human nature, we should expect it to manifest itself 
        by a perceptible rise in the culminating points reached by mankind, in 
        the intellectual and moral spheres, at successive periods. But no such 
        continuous rise of the high-water mark of humanity is perceptible. The 
        earliest known architectural work, the great pyramid of Egypt, in the 
        mathematical accuracy of its form and dimensions, in its precise orientation, 
        and in the perfect workmanship shown by its internal structure, indicates 
        an amount of astronomical, mathematical, and mechanical knowledge, and 
        an amount of experience and practical skill, which could only have been 
        attained at that early period of man's history by the exertion of mental 
        ability no way inferior to that of our best modern engineers. In purely 
        intellectual achievements the Vedas of ancient India, the Iliad of Homer, 
        the book of Job, and the writings of Plato, will rank with the noblest 
        works of modern authors. In sculpture and in architecture the ancient 
        Greeks attained to a height of beauty, harmony, and dignity, that has 
        never been equalled in modern times; and taking account also of the great 
        statesmen, commanders, philosophers, and poets of the age of Pericles, 
        Mr. Francis Galton is of opinion &quot;that the average ability of the Athenian 
        race was, on the lowest possible estimate, very nearly two grades higher 
        than our own--that is, about as much as our race is above that of the 
        African negro.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, some reason to think that 
        the intellectual high-water level of humanity has sunk rather than risen 
        during the last two thousand years; but this is not incompatible with 
        the elevation of the mean level of the human ocean both intellectually 
        and morally. We must, <font color="990000">[[p. 147]]</font> therefore, 
        briefly consider the various agencies that have been at work, some tending 
        to raise others to depress this level; and by balancing the one against 
        the other, and taking account of certain modern developments of human 
        nature in civilized societies, we may be able to arrive at some probable 
        conclusion as to the final result.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the whole course of human history the 
        struggle of tribe with tribe and race with race has inevitably caused 
        the destruction of the weaker and lower, leaving the stronger and higher, 
        whether physically or mentally stronger, to survive. Another and perhaps 
        not less potent cause of the destruction of lower tribes is the greater 
        vital energy and more rapid increase of the higher races, which crowds 
        the lower out of existence even when no violent destruction of life takes 
        place. To this latter cause quite as much as to actual warfare must we 
        ascribe the total disappearance of the Tasmanians, and the continuous 
        diminution of population among the Maoris of New Zealand and the inhabitants 
        of the Eastern Pacific Islands, as well as of the red Indians of the North 
        American continent. Here we see survival of the fittest among competing 
        peoples necessarily leading to a continuous elevation of the human race 
        as a whole, even though the higher portion of the higher races may remain 
        stationary or may even deteriorate.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a similar and even more complex process 
        is ever going on within each race, by the survival of the more fit and 
        the elimination of the less fit under the actual conditions of society. 
        On the whole we cannot doubt that the prudent, the sober, the healthy, 
        and the virtuous, live longer lives than the reckless, the drunkards, 
        the unhealthy, and the vicious; and also that the former, on the average, 
        leave more descendants than the latter. It is true that the latter not 
        unfrequently marry earlier and have larger families; but many of these 
        die young, and as, on the whole, children resemble their parents, fewer 
        of them will survive and leave offspring. Thus accidents, violence, and 
        the effects of a reckless and vicious life, are natural checks to the 
        increase of population among these classes, and this inevitably gives 
        an advantage to the more intellectual, the more prudent, and the more 
        moral portion of each race. The latter will, therefore, increase at the 
        expense of the former, and thus again tend to raise the mean level of 
        humanity.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 148]]</font> But society 
        has always, in one way or another, interfered with these beneficent processes, 
        and has thus retarded the general advance. The celibacy of the clergy 
        and the refuge offered by monasteries and nunneries to many to whom the 
        rude struggle of the world was distasteful, and whose gentle natures fitted 
        them for deeds of charity or to excel in literature or art, prevented 
        the increase of these nobler individuals, and thus, as Mr. Galton well 
        remarks, &quot;the Church, by a policy singularly unwise and suicidal, brutalized 
        the breed of our forefathers.&quot; By a still more deplorable policy, independent 
        thought, and that true nobility which refuses to purchase life by a lifelong 
        lie, was almost exterminated in Europe by religious persecution. It is 
        calculated that for the three centuries between 1471 and 1781, a thousand 
        persons annually were either executed or imprisoned by the Inquisition 
        in Spain alone. In Italy it was even worse; while in France during the 
        seventeenth century three or four hundred thousand Protestants perished 
        in prison, at the galleys, or on the scaffold.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause which has had a prejudicial effect 
        at all times, and which continues in action in the civilized societies 
        of to-day, is the system of inherited wealth, which gives to the weak 
        and vicious an undue advantage both in the certainty of subsistence without 
        labor, and in the greater opportunity for early marriage and leaving a 
        numerous offspring. We also interfere with the course of nature by preserving 
        the weak, the sickly, or the malformed infants; but in this, probably, 
        humanity gains rather than loses, since many who are in infancy weak or 
        distorted exhibit superior mental or moral qualities which are a gain 
        to civilization, while the cultivation of humane and sympathetic feelings 
        in their care and nurture is itself of the greatest value.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balancing, as well as we are able, these various 
        opposing influences, it seems probable that there has been, on the whole, 
        a decided gain. Health, perseverance, self-restraint, and intelligence 
        have increased by slowly weeding out the unhealthy, the idle, the grossly 
        vicious, the cruel, and the weak-minded, and it may be in part owing to 
        the increased numbers of the higher and gentler natures thus brought about 
        that we may impute the undoubted growth of humanity,--of sympathy with 
        the sufferings of men and animals, which is perhaps the most marked and 
        most cheering of the characteristics of our age.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 149]]</font> But although 
        the natural process of elimination does actually raise the mean level 
        of humanity by the destruction of the worst and most degraded individuals, 
        it can have little or no tendency to develop higher types in each successive 
        age; and this agrees with the undoubted fact that the great men who appeared 
        at the dawn of history and at the culminating epochs of the various ancient 
        civilizations, were not, on the whole, inferior to those of our own age. 
        It remains, therefore, a mystery how and why mankind reached to such lofty 
        pinnacles of greatness in early times, when there seems to be no agency 
        at work, then or now, calculated to do more than weed out the lower types. 
        Leaving this great problem as, for the present, an insoluble one, we may 
        turn to that aspect of the question which is of the most vital present 
        day interest,--whether any agencies are now at work or can be suggested 
        as practicable, which will produce a steady advance, not only in the average 
        of human nature, but in those higher developments which now, as in former 
        ages, are the exceptions rather than the rule.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till quite recently the answer to this question 
        would have been an unhesitating affirmative. Education, it would have 
        been said, is such an agency; and although hitherto it has done comparatively 
        little, owing to the very partial and extremely unscientific way in which 
        it has been applied, we have now acquired such a sound knowledge of its 
        philosophy and have so greatly improved its methods, that it has become 
        a power by which human nature may be indefinitely modified and improved. 
        When every child is really well educated, when its moral as well as its 
        intellectual faculties are trained and developed, some portion of the 
        improvement effected in each generation will be transmitted to the next, 
        and thus a continual advance both in the intellectual and moral nature 
        will be brought about.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all who have discussed the subject have 
        held that this is the true and only method of improving human nature, 
        because they believe that in the analogous case of the bodily structure 
        the modification and improvement of all organisms has been effected by 
        a similar process. Lamarck taught that the effects produced by use and 
        exertion on the body of the individual animal was, wholly or in part, 
        transmitted to the offspring; and although Darwin's theory of natural 
        selection rendered this agency almost if not altogether unnecessary, yet 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 150]]</font> it was so universally held to be 
        a fact of nature that Darwin himself adopted it as playing a subsidiary 
        but not unimportant part in the modification of species. So little doubt 
        had he of this &quot;transmission of acquired characters&quot; that his celebrated 
        theory of Pangenesis was framed so as to account for it. In order to explain, 
        hypothetically, how it was that the increased size or strength given to 
        a limb or an organ by constant exercise was transmitted to the progeny, 
        he supposed that the male and female germ-cells were formed by the aggregation 
        of inconceivably minute gemmules from every tissue and cell of every part 
        of the body, that these gemmules were continually renewed and continually 
        flowing towards the reproductive organs, and that they had the property 
        of developing into cells and structures in the offspring which more or 
        less closely resembled the corresponding cells and structures in the parents 
        at that particular epoch of their lives. Thus was explained the transmission 
        of disease, and the supposed transmission of the changes produced in the 
        parents by use or disuse of organs or by other external conditions. For 
        example, if two brothers, equally strong and healthy, became, one a city 
        clerk the other a farmer, land-surveyor, or rural postman, living much 
        in the open air and walking many miles every day of his life, and if they 
        married two sisters equally alike in constitution, then the children of 
        these two couples, especially those born when their parents approached 
        middle age and the different conditions of their existence had had time 
        to produce its full effect on their bodily structure, ought to show a 
        decided difference, the one family being undergrown, pale, and rather 
        weak in the lower limbs, the other the reverse, and this difference should 
        be observable even if the children of the two families were brought up 
        together under identical conditions. It may be here stated that no trustworthy 
        observations have ever been made showing that such effects are really 
        produced, but it has always been believed that they must be produced.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Darwin's theory of Pangenesis led to considerable 
        discussion, Mr. Francis Galton, who had at first accepted it provisionally, 
        endeavored to put it to the test of experiment. He obtained a number of 
        specimens of two distinct varieties of domestic rabbits which breed true, 
        and by an ingenious and painless arrangement caused a large quantity of 
        the blood of one variety to be transfused into the blood-vessels <font color="990000">[[p. 
        151]]</font> of the other variety. This having been effected with a number 
        of individuals without in any way injuring their health, they were separated 
        and bred from. It was found that in every case the offspring resembled 
        their parents and showed no trace of intermixture of the two varieties. 
        It was also pointed out by another critic that if the theory of Pangenesis 
        were true, the stock on which a fruit is grafted ought to change the character 
        of the fruit produced by the graft, which, as a rule, it does not do.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt being thus thrown on the validity of the 
        theory, Mr. Galton suggested another, in which the germs in the reproductive 
        organs of each individual were supposed to be derived directly from the 
        parental germs and not at all from the body itself during its growth and 
        development. A very similar theory was proposed some years later by Professor 
        Weismann under the now well-known term &quot;the continuity of the germ plasm.&quot; 
        Both these theories imply that, except among the lower single-celled animals 
        and in certain exceptional cases among the higher animals, no change produced 
        in the individual during life by exercise or other external conditions, 
        can be transmitted to its offspring. What is transmitted is the capacity 
        to develop into a form more or less closely resembling that of the parents 
        or their direct ancestors, the characteristics of these appearing in the 
        offspring in varying degrees and compounded in various ways, leading to 
        that wonderful variety in details while preserving a certain unmistakable 
        family resemblance. Thus are explained not only bodily but mental characteristics, 
        even those peculiar tricks of motion or habits which are often adduced 
        as proofs of the transmission of an acquired character, but which are 
        really only the transmission of the minute peculiarities of physical structure 
        and nervous or cerebral co-ordination, which led to the habit in question 
        being acquired by the parent or ancestor, and, under similar conditions, 
        by his descendant.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding that his theory, if true, did not allow 
        of the hereditary transmission of the majority of individually <em>acquired</em> 
        characters, Weismann was led to examine the evidence for such transmission, 
        and found that hardly any real evidence existed, and that in most cases 
        which appeared to prove it, either the facts were not accurately stated, 
        or another interpretation could be given to them. The transmission <font color="990000">[[p. 
        152]]</font> had been assumed because it appeared so natural and probable; 
        but in science we require as the foundation of our reasoning not probability 
        only, but proof; or if we cannot get direct proof, then the probability 
        which arises from <em>all</em> the phenomena being such as would occur 
        if the theory in question were true, and this so completely as to give 
        us the power of predicting what will occur under new and hitherto untried 
        conditions. Such is the probability in favor of the existence of an ethereal 
        medium whose undulations produce light and heat, of atoms which combine 
        to form the molecules of the various elements, and of the molecular theory 
        of gases. The biologists of Europe, though usually slow to accept new 
        theories in the place of old ones, have given to the theories of Weismann 
        and Galton an amount of acceptance which was never accorded to Darwin's 
        theory of Pangenesis, notwithstanding the weight of his great reputation; 
        and they are now seeking earnestly for facts which shall serve as crucial 
        tests of the rival theories, just as the phenomena of interference served 
        as a test of the rival theories of light.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here only to deal with the theory of 
        the non-inheritance of acquired characters as it affects mental and moral 
        qualities; and in this department it has to encounter great opposition, 
        because it seems to bar the way against any improvement of the race by 
        means of education. If the theory is a true one, it certainly proves that 
        it is not by the direct road of education, as usually understood, that 
        humanity has advanced and must advance, although education may, in an 
        indirect manner, be an important factor of progress. Let us, however, 
        look at the problem as presented by the rival theories, and see what light 
        is thrown upon it by the history of those great men who have most contributed 
        to the advance of civilization, and who serve well to illustrate the successive 
        high-water marks attained by human genius.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If progress is in any important degree dependent 
        on the hereditary transmission of the effects of culture, as distinguished 
        from the transmission of innate genius, or of the various talents and 
        aptitudes with which men and women are born, then we should expect to 
        see indications of such transmission in the continuous increase of mental 
        power wherever any family or group of families have for several generations 
        been subjected to culture or training of any <font color="990000">[[p. 
        153]]</font> particular kind. It has, in fact, been claimed that this 
        is the case, for in his presidential address to the Biological Society 
        of Washington, in January, 1891, Mr. Lester F. Ward argues that not only 
        is Professor Weismann's great ability a result of the rigid methods of 
        training in the German universities, but that &quot;those rigid methods themselves 
        have been the product of a series of generations of such training, transmitted 
        in small increments and diffused in increasing effectiveness to the whole 
        German people . . . And the fact, that out of the barbaric German hordes 
        of the Middle Ages there has been developed the great modern race of German 
        specialists is one of the most convincing proofs of the transmission of 
        acquired characters, as well as of the far-reaching value to the future 
        development of the race of such an educational system as that which Germany 
        has had for the last two or three centuries.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, I think, be admitted that, if this is 
        &quot;one of the most convincing proofs&quot; of the transmission of the effects 
        of culture, the theory of its transmissibility has but a weak foundation; 
        for not only may the facts be explained in another way, but there is another 
        body of facts which point with at least equal clearness in an exactly 
        opposite direction. It may be said, for instance, that the eminence of 
        German specialists in science is due primarily to special mental qualities 
        which have always been characteristic of the German race, and to the facilities 
        afforded for the culture of those faculties throughout life, by the very 
        numerous professorships in their numerous universities, and by the comparative 
        simplicity of German habits which renders the position of professor attractive 
        to the highest intellects. And when we turn to other countries we find 
        facts which tend in the opposite direction. In England, for example, during 
        many centuries, Oxford and Cambridge Universities were closed to non-conformists, 
        and their honors and rewards were reserved for members of the Established 
        Church, and very largely for the families of the landed aristocracy. Yet 
        in the short period that has elapsed since they were opened to dissenters, 
        these latter have shown themselves fully equal to the hereditarily trained 
        churchmen, and have carried off the highest honors in as great, and perhaps 
        even in greater proportion than their comparative numbers in the universities.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it is a remarkable fact, that almost 
        all our <font color="990000">[[p. 154]]</font> greatest inventors and 
        scientific discoverers, the men whose originality and mental power have 
        created landmarks in the history of human progress, have been self-taught, 
        and have certainly derived nothing from the training of their ancestors 
        in their several departments of knowledge. Brindley, one of the earliest 
        of our modern engineers, was the son of a dissipated small freeholder; 
        Telford, our greatest road and bridge builder, was the son of a shepherd, 
        and apprenticed to a rough country mason; George Stephenson, the inventor 
        of the locomotive engine, was a self-taught collier; Bramah, the inventor 
        of the hydraulic press, of improved locks, and almost the originator of 
        machine tools, was the son of a farmer, and at seventeen years of age 
        was apprenticed to the village carpenter; Smeaton, who designed and built 
        the Eddystone lighthouse, was the son of a lawyer, and a wholly self-taught 
        engineer; Harrison, the inventor of the modern chronometer, was a joiner 
        and the son of a joiner; the elder Brunel was the son of a French peasant 
        farmer, and was educated for a priest, yet he became a great self-taught 
        engineer, designed and executed the first Thames tunnel, and at the beginning 
        of this century designed the block-making machinery in Portsmouth dock-yard 
        which was so complete both in plan and execution that it is still in use.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to higher departments of industry, 
        science, and art, we find that Dollond, the inventor of the achromatic 
        telescope, was a working silk weaver, and a wholly self-taught optician; 
        Faraday was the son of a blacksmith, and apprenticed to a bookbinder at 
        the age of thirteen; Sir Christopher Wren, the son of a clergyman and 
        educated at Oxford, was a self-taught architect, yet he designed and executed 
        St. Paul's Cathedral, which will certainly rank among the finest modern 
        buildings in the world; Ray, the son of a blacksmith, became a good mathematician, 
        and one of the greatest of our early naturalists; John Hunter, the great 
        anatomist, was the son of a small Scotch land-owner; Sir William Herschel 
        was the son of a German musician; Rembrandt was the son of a miller; the 
        great linguists and oriental scholars, Alexander Murray and Dr. Leyden, 
        were both sons of poor Scotch shepherds; while Shelley, whose poetic genius 
        has rarely been surpassed, was the son of an altogether unpoetic and unsympathetic 
        country squire.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These few examples, which might be easily increased 
        so <font color="990000">[[p. 155]]</font> as to fill a volume, serve to 
        show, what is indeed seldom denied, that genius or superexcellence in 
        any department of human faculty tends to be sporadic, that is, it appears 
        suddenly without any proportionate development in the parents or immediate 
        ancestors of the gifted individual. No doubt there is usually, or perhaps 
        always, a considerable amount of the same mental qualities dispersed through 
        the diverging ancestral line of all these men of genius, and their appearance 
        seems to be well explained by a fortunate intermingling of the germ-plasms 
        of several ancestors calculated to produce or to intensify the various 
        mental peculiarities on which the exceptional faculties depend. This is 
        rendered probable, also, by the fact that, although genius is often inherited 
        it rarely or never intensifies after its first appearance, which it certainly 
        should do if not only the genius itself, but the increased mental power 
        due to its exercise were also inherited. Brunel, Stephenson, Dollond, 
        and Herschel, all had sons who followed in the steps of their fathers, 
        but it will be generally admitted that in no case did the sons exceed 
        or even equal their parents in originality and mental power. So, if we 
        look through the copious roll of names of great poets, and painters, sculptors, 
        architects, engineers, or scientific discoverers, we shall hardly ever 
        find even two of the same name and profession, and never three or four, 
        rising progressively to loftier heights of genius and fame. Yet this is 
        what we ought to find if not only the innate faculty, but the increased 
        development given to that faculty by continuous exercise, tends to be 
        inherited.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is thought that this non-inheritance of 
        the results of education and training is prejudicial to human progress, 
        we must remember that, on the other hand, it also prevents the continuous 
        degradation of humanity by the inheritance of those vicious practices 
        and degrading habits which the deplorable conditions of our modern social 
        system undoubtedly foster in the bulk of mankind. Throughout all trade 
        and commerce lying and deceit abound to such an extent that it has come 
        to be considered essential to success. No <font color="990000">[[p. 156]]</font> 
        dealer ever tells the exact truth about the goods he advertises or offers 
        for sale, and the grossly absurd misrepresentations of material and quality 
        we everywhere meet with have, from their very commonness, ceased to shock 
        us. Now it is surely a great blessing if we can believe that this widespread 
        system of fraud and falsehood does not produce any inherited deterioration 
        in the next generation. And it is equally satisfactory to believe that 
        the physical deterioration produced on the thousands who annually exchange 
        country for town life will have no permanent effect on their offspring 
        if they return at any time to more healthy conditions. And we have direct 
        evidence that this is so in the fact that the street arabs of our great 
        cities, when brought up under healthy and elevating conditions in the 
        colonies, usually improve both physically, intellectually, and morally, 
        so as to be fully equal to the average of their fellow-countrymen.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears, then, that the non-inheritance of 
        the effects of training, of habits, and of general surroundings, whether 
        these be good or bad, is by no means a hindrance to human progress, if, 
        as seems not improbable, the results on the individual of our present 
        social arrangements are, on the whole, evil. It may be fairly argued that 
        the rich suffer, morally and intellectually, from these conditions quite 
        as much as do the poor; and that the lives of idleness, of pleasure, of 
        excitement, or of debauchery, which so many of the wealthy lead, is as 
        soul-deadening and degrading in its effects as the sordid struggle for 
        existence to which the bulk of the workers are condemned. It is, therefore, 
        a relief to feel that all this evil and degradation will leave no permanent 
        effects whenever a more rational and more elevating system of social organization 
        is brought about.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, then, education, training, and surrounding 
        conditions can do nothing to affect permanently the march of human progress, 
        how, it may be asked, is that progress to be brought about; or are we 
        to be condemned to remain stationary in that average condition which, 
        in some unknown way, the civilized nations of the world have now reached? 
        We reply, that progress is still possible, nay, is certain, by the continuous 
        and perhaps increasing action of two general principles, both forms of 
        selection. The one is that process of elimination already referred to, 
        by which vice, violence, and recklessness so often bring about the early 
        destruction <font color="990000">[[p. 157]]</font> of those addicted to 
        them. The other, and by far the more important for the future, is that 
        mode of selection which will inevitably come into action through the ever-increasing 
        freedom, joined with the higher education of women.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have already been ample indications in 
        the pages of <em>The Arena</em> that the women of America, no less than 
        those of other civilized countries, are determined to secure their personal, 
        social, and political freedom, and are beginning to see the great part 
        they have to play in the future of humanity. When such social changes 
        have been effected that no woman will be compelled, either by hunger, 
        isolation, or social compulsion, to sell herself whether in or out of 
        wedlock, and when all women alike shall feel the refining influence of 
        a true humanizing education, of beautiful and elevating surroundings, 
        and of a public opinion which shall be founded on the highest aspirations 
        of their age and country, the result will be a form of human selection 
        which will bring about a continuous advance in the average status of the 
        race. Under such conditions, all who are deformed either in body or mind, 
        though they may be able to lead happy and contented lives, will, as a 
        rule, leave no children to inherit their deformity. Even now we find many 
        women who never marry because they have never found the man of their ideal. 
        When no woman will be compelled to marry for a bare living or for a comfortable 
        home, those who remain unmarried from their own free choice will certainly 
        increase, while many others, having no inducement to an early marriage, 
        will wait till they meet with a partner who is really congenial to them.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a reformed society the vicious man, 
        the man of degraded taste or of feeble intellect, will have little chance 
        of finding a wife, and his bad qualities will die out with himself. The 
        most perfect and beautiful in body and mind will, on the other hand, be 
        most sought and therefore be most likely to marry early, the less highly 
        endowed later, and the least gifted in anyway the latest of all, and this 
        will be the case with both sexes. From this varying age of marriage, as 
        Mr. Galton has shown, there will result a more rapid increase of the former 
        than of the latter, and this cause continuing at work for successive generations 
        will at length bring the average man to be the equal of those who are 
        now among the more advanced of the race.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 158]]</font> When 
        this average rise has been brought about there must result a corresponding 
        rise in the high-water mark of humanity; in other words, the great men 
        of that era will be as much above those of the last two thousand years 
        at the average man will have risen above the average of that period. For, 
        those fortunate combinations of germs which, on the theory we are discussing, 
        have brought into existence the great men of our day will have a far higher 
        average of material to work with, and we may reasonably expect the most 
        distinguished among the poets and philosophers of the future will decidedly 
        surpass the Homers and Shakespeares, the Newtons, the Goethes, and the 
        Humboldts of our era.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lester F. Ward has indeed urged, in his article 
        on &quot;The Transmission of Culture&quot; (<em>Forum</em>, May, 1891), that, if 
        Weismann's theory is true, then &quot;education has no value for the future 
        of mankind, and its benefits are confined exclusively to the generation 
        receiving it.&quot; Another eminent scientist, Professor Joseph Le Conte, in 
        his article on &quot;The Factors of Evolution&quot; (<em>The Monist</em>, Vol. I. 
        p. 334), is still more desponding. He says,--&quot;If it be true that reason 
        must direct the course of human evolution, and if it be also true that 
        selection of the fittest is the only method available for that purpose; 
        then, if we are to have any race-improvement at all, the dreadful law 
        of <em>destruction of the weak and helpless</em> must with Spartan firmness 
        be carried out voluntarily and deliberately. Against such a course all 
        that is best in us revolts.&quot; These passages show that the supposed consequences 
        of the theories of Weismann and Galton, have, very naturally, excited 
        some antagonism, because they appear, if true, to limit or even to destroy 
        all power of further evolution of mankind, except by methods which are 
        revolting to our higher nature.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have endeavored to show, in the present 
        article, that we are not limited to the depressing alternatives above 
        set forth,--that education <em>has</em> the greatest value for the improvement 
        of mankind,--and that selection of the fittest may be ensured by power 
        and more effective agencies than the destruction of the weak and helpless. 
        From a consideration of historical facts bearing upon the origin and development 
        of human faculty I have shown reason for believing that it is only by 
        a true and perfect system of education and the public opinion which such 
        a system will create, that the <font color="990000">[[p. 159]]</font> 
        special mode of selection on which the future of humanity depends can 
        be brought into general action. Education and environment, which have 
        so often stunted and debased human nature instead of improving it, are 
        powerless to transmit by heredity either their good or their evil effects; 
        and for this limitation of their power we ought to be thankful. It follows, 
        that when we are wise enough to reform our social economy and give to 
        our youth a truer, a broader, and a more philosophical training, we shall 
        find their minds free from any hereditary taint derived from the evil 
        customs and mistaken teaching of the past, and ready to respond at once 
        to that higher ideal of life and of the responsibilities of marriage which 
        will, indirectly, become the greatest factor in human progress.</p>

      <p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="1" id="1"></a>1</sup>&quot;Hereditary

<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="2" id="2"></a>2</sup>The only prominent example that looks like 
        a progressive increase of faculty for three generations is that of Dr. 
        Erasmus Darwin and his grandson Charles Darwin. But in this case the special 
        faculties displayed by the grandson were quite distinct from those of 
        the grandfather and father; while if we consider the different state of 
        knowledge at the time when Erasmus Darwin lived, his occupation in a laborious 
        profession, and the absence of that stimulus to thought which the five 
        years' voyage round the world gave to his grandson, it is not at all certain 
        that in originality and mental powers, the former was not fully the equal 
        of the latter. <font color="990000">[[on p. 155]]</font></font></p>

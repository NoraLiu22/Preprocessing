It represents the very best of what Tarantino can do as a director, enveloping the viewer in a world filled with unique characters and thrilling scenarios. Serving as a highlight for a very exciting time in American filmmaking, despite the many influences on display there has been nothing quite like this before or since. </p></p><h3>The Godfather</h3><div>1972<!-- --> <!-- -->USA</div><p><p>A synonym for greatness in cinema. For all of the cultural celebrations of Marlon Brando&#x27;s Don Corleone, it&#x27;s easy to forget that the bulk of this first film was about a man trying to escape the Don&#x27;s world. We share Kay&#x27;s (Dianne Keaton) despair as we see the fresh-faced soldier slowly slide into darkness through breathtaking scenes such as the restaurant assassination, or his final, loaded request: &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me about my business.&quot; Wonderful storytelling from start to finish. </p></p><h3>The Third Man</h3><div>1949<!-- --> <!-- -->United Kingdom</div><p><p>The greatest British film of all time, and a masterclass in telling a story off-screen as well as on it. So often in cinema it&#x27;s more thrilling to follow the bad guy, and while Graham Greene&#x27;s script leaves you in no doubt as to who the villain of the piece is, Orson Welles&#x27; performance means you are as obsessed by Harry Lime as every character in the story. There&#x27;s no greater example of this than Lime&#x27;s introduction, lit by a lone window light and smiling as if knew the secrets of the world. </p></p><h3>Psycho</h3><div>1960<!-- --> <!-- -->USA</div><p><p>“There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it” – Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s famous quote about scaring audiences is vindicated in this 109-minute masterclass. By breaking so many preconceived notions of Hollywood, he created a new standard of horror that had its roots in the ordinary. America is a country of highways, of journeys, of possibilities; and Hitchcock placed unimaginable terror in a mundane setting most of us would be familiar with. As summed up brilliantly in the final chilling voiceover, the threat of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is not that he had supernatural powers, but that he was so normal he could be waiting for you, undetected, at the next rest stop…</p></p><h3>Jaws</h3><div>1975<!-- --> <!-- -->USA</div><p><p>Steven Spielberg&#x27;s breakthrough influenced the blockbuster, but that legacy often overshadows the story itself. A morality tale of public panic, from an infamously troubled shoot came a film that is perfect in its execution – the direction, performances, soundtrack all combine to make a wonder of a movie. </p></p><h3>Singin&#x27; in the Rain</h3><div>1951<!-- --> <!-- -->USA</div><p><p>Happiness distilled. The genius of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O&#x27;Connor means that a much more intelligent film lies beneath the happy-go-lucky packaging. Capturing the contrast between the vanity of stardom and the earnest desire to perform (or &quot;make &#x27;em laugh&quot;), this post-war pick-me-up shows all the great qualities of the Golden Age of Hollywood. </p></p><h3>GoodFellas</h3><div>1990<!-- --> <!-- -->USA</div><p><p>With the grace of an opera and the brutality of a boxing match, Goodfellas is one of the great American crime stories. Funnier than you remember, it&#x27;s an affectionate ode to wise guys that birthed so many tropes but is still feels fresh and original more than 30 years on. </p></p><h3>Blade Runner</h3><div>1982<!-- --> <!-- -->USA, Hong Kong</div><p><p>A sci-fi film like no other. I&#x27;ve never quite understood the theory that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a replicant, because to me this is a story about a man taught to value life by those who need more of it. Refined over the years by re-edits, it&#x27;s the perfect example of the wonder of the genre. </p></p><h3>A Matter of Life and Death</h3><div>1946<!-- --> <!-- -->United Kingdom</div><p><p>Sometimes the highest concepts are driven by very simple values. David Niven&#x27;s pilot is not simply fighting for a few more years on Earth, but for love. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, just a year after the end of the second world war, it sent a message that made sense of the darkness in such a simple way. I also can&#x27;t think of a better opening for a film, as Niven&#x27;s character celebrates all that is worth living for even as he faces death. </p></p><h3>Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth</h3><div>2006<!-- --> <!-- -->Spain, Mexico, USA</div><p><p>Despite what Disney will tell you, fairytales have their origin in some very frightening places. Here, Guillermo Del Toro transports us to a magical underworld as a way of dealing with very adult themes. Mixing the best of modern and traditional filmmaking techniques, it leaves me in floods of tears every time. </p></p><h3>Further remarks</h3><p>I&#x27;ve always found the process of &#x27;ranking&#x27; films a little bit difficult – as Barry Norman once remarked, it&#x27;s like saying &quot;chalk is good, but cheese is better&quot;. Nevertheless, my choices reflect what I value in cinema, and films that have opened new doors for me as a film lover. Pulp Fiction will always hold a special place in my heart as it found me at the right place and the right time, telling its story in a way that has felt just right for me. Being a film fan who has found something of value in thousands of movies over my lifetime, it can be a little bit painful to boil it down to just 10. However, I hope these choices highlight what I value most about big-screen storytelling. </p></div></div></main><footer class="Footer__Outer-sc-1m4hj7x-0 fXLRdY"><section

Its unprecedented success changed the face of ‘independent’ cinema in America, helping establish distributor Miramax as a major player and ushering in a wave of exciting filmmakers, many of whom still hold sway in Hollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presented as three interconnected stories which unfold in a nonlinear melange, Tarantino’s sophisticatedly structured saga prefigured the rise of multi-stranded ‘hyperlink’ cinema in the 2000s. And its smorgasbord of pop culture references also introduced a new generation of fans to the likes of Dick Dale, MacGuffins and Ezekiel 25:17. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1994, Pulp Fiction holds up as one of the most riotously entertaining nineties pictures, strewn with endlessly quotable dialogue and an array of career-defining performances from its ensemble cast, with Samuel L Jackson stealing the show as Biblical badass Jules Winnfield.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Quentin Tarantino","producer":"Lawrence Bender","writer":"Quentin Tarantino","featuring":"John Travolta, Samuel L.

The Godfather is all of the above and more – an unimaginably dark story that begins with the hopeful sentence “I believe in America,” a fat, full saga that, two years after its release, revealed itself to be merely the middle of a fatter, fuller saga, and a work the creation of which has generated its own mythic origin stories, from the director who wouldn’t compromise to the leading man nobody was sure could pull it off. It is enduring and defining art, alchemically transmuted from the pages of an OK bestseller and the imaginations of everyone involved, first among them its great co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola. As James Caan’s Sonny Corleone says in one of the film’s most enduring scenes, “This is business, and this man is takin’ it very, very personal.” So much of the most brilliant work from Hollywood emerged from the conviction that a movie could be both. Every scene of The Godfather makes the case for that belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie exists on countless timelines – it was an early peak for its director, given his big studio shot at the unimaginable age of 32; a mind-blowing return to form for Marlon Brando; a stunning launch for Al Pacino; a benchmark achievement of New Hollywood; and a gauntlet thrown down by its cinematographer Gordon Willis, whose brown-black-and-blacker lighting and compositions changed the look of movies. Its most experienced actor made his debut in the 1930s; its newcomers are still working today. While no movie can be said to gather both the past and the future of filmmaking into itself, The Godfather comes thrillingly close. It’s a crime story, a family story that plunders the word ‘family’ for comedy, emotion and profound horror, an immigrant story and a cautionary tale about the American hunger for power; it contains multitudes. Were the screen suddenly to triple in size, as it does in Abel Gance’s 1927 epic Napoléon (a film Coppola reveres), you sense that a teeming world would reveal itself as always having been there. But the world within Coppola’s frame is big enough; half a century later, we can still walk around in it and discover something new about moviemaking and life with every visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mark Harris</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Francis Ford Coppola","producer":"Albert S.

The film’s ascent almost feels like a given, due to the effervescence that may be its defining characteristic and the scarcity of that quality in our trying times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, typically for anything that seems so effortless, Kelly and Donen’s achievement was in fact the product of an enormous amount of toil and trouble. At the project’s outset, the legendary writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green tried and failed to get out of the gig when MGM musical head Arthur Freed ordered them to build a new movie on top of a batch of tunes by Freed and his partner Nacio Herb Brown that were gathering dust. (Indeed, ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ itself had made its screen debut in The Hollywood Revue of 1929.) Debbie Reynolds’ ordeal filming the ‘Good Morning’ tap-dance number famously left her with bloody feet. As for the title song, six months of rehearsal culminated in Gene Kelly gamely splashing about while running a high fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of that suffering is discernible on screen, which is one of the many delightful ironies about Hollywood’s most deeply cherished movie about the making of a Hollywood movie. Pulling back the curtain to show yet more dazzling drapery, Comden and Green celebrate an earlier era of Tinseltown chancers and hustlers with a tale of a production caught between the silent and sound eras. Kelly’s plucky hoofer and stuntman-turned-star Don Lockwood leads the charge to retrofit a swashbuckler picture named The Duelling Cavalier to take advantage of the new vogue for sound, with his new sweetie Kathy (Reynolds) being his best means of disguising the squawky voice of his leading lady Lina (a hilarious Jean Hagen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several movies besides Don’s latest somehow contained within the text of Singin’ in the Rain (including, if we are to believe the deliciously meta billboard in the final shot, Singin’ in the Rain). Cheekily purporting to reveal its own means of production while still delivering one unabashedly theatrical showstopper after another, Kelly and Donen’s masterwork anticipates the brassy postmodernism of Moulin Rouge! (2001). But like such fellow homage-payers as The Artist (2011) and La La Land (2016), Baz Luhrmann’s rendition feels meagre compared to the original and its seemingly inexhaustible bounty of ingenuity, bravado and sheer unabashed joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jason Anderson</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen","producer":"Arthur Freed","writer":"Adolph Green, Betty Comden","featuring":"Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds"},"year":"1951","nameAndYear":"Singin' in the Rain (1951)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14090","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":102,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":10,"tied":false,"category":"critics"},{"position":52,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":null},"products":[{"sku":"5051892082150","name":"Singin' in the Rain (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/singin-in-the-rain-dvd.html","price":"5.99"},{"sku":"5051892074391","name":"Singin' in the Rain (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/singin-in-the-rain-blu-ray.html","price":"12.99"}]},{"uuid":"b573c997-0970-5531-8f89-b193e2f8b143","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-05/goodfellas-1990-ray-liotta-with-two-men-side-by-side.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-05/goodfellas-1990-ray-liotta-with-two-men-side-by-side.jpeg/1920x1080-cropped/goodfellas-1990-ray-liotta-with-two-men-side-by-side.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-05/goodfellas-1990-ray-liotta-with-two-men-side-by-side.jpeg/960x540-cropped/goodfellas-1990-ray-liotta-with-two-men-side-by-side.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-05/goodfellas-1990-ray-liotta-with-two-men-side-by-side.jpeg/96x54-cropped/goodfellas-1990-ray-liotta-with-two-men-side-by-side.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"GoodFellas","url":"/film/b573c997-0970-5531-8f89-b193e2f8b143/goodfellas","summary":{"text":"The dizzying story of wiseguy Henry Hill, from his seduction into a life of crime to his paranoid, cocaine-fuelled departure.","html":"<p>The dizzying story of wiseguy Henry Hill, from his seduction into a life of crime to his paranoid, cocaine-fuelled departure.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>“Martin Scorsese is at his best when he indulges the dark side of his artistic sensibilities.

Three years after the deep-space horror of Alien (1979), Ridley Scott imagined an urban future to rival Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. The ghost of Raymond Chandler’s bygone LA haunts its story of a Marlowe-like former detective (Harrison Ford) assigned to track down escaped ‘replicants’ – biologically engineered beings employed as slaves by their human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially a critical and commercial flop, Blade Runner developed a huge cult following.

Hollywood movies are an artform and a mass entertainment, the product of a singular vision and of a ruthless industry, the work of great directors and the alchemical result of a thousand collaborations, coincidences and backsagainst- the-wall snap decisions. The Godfather is all of the above and more – an unimaginably dark story that begins with the hopeful sentence “I believe in America,” a fat, full saga that, two years after its release, revealed itself to be merely the middle of a fatter, fuller saga, and a work the creation of which has generated its own mythic origin stories, from the director who wouldn’t compromise to the leading man nobody was sure could pull it off. It is enduring and defining art, alchemically transmuted from the pages of an OK bestseller and the imaginations of everyone involved, first among them its great co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola. As James Caan’s Sonny Corleone says in one of the film’s most enduring scenes, “This is business, and this man is takin’ it very, very personal.” So much of the most brilliant work from Hollywood emerged from the conviction that a movie could be both. Every scene of The Godfather makes the case for that belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie exists on countless timelines – it was an early peak for its director, given his big studio shot at the unimaginable age of 32; a mind-blowing return to form for Marlon Brando; a stunning launch for Al Pacino; a benchmark achievement of New Hollywood; and a gauntlet thrown down by its cinematographer Gordon Willis, whose brown-black-and-blacker lighting and compositions changed the look of movies. Its most experienced actor made his debut in the 1930s; its newcomers are still working today. While no movie can be said to gather both the past and the future of filmmaking into itself, The Godfather comes thrillingly close. It’s a crime story, a family story that plunders the word ‘family’ for comedy, emotion and profound horror, an immigrant story and a cautionary tale about the American hunger for power; it contains multitudes. Were the screen suddenly to triple in size, as it does in Abel Gance’s 1927 epic Napoléon (a film Coppola reveres), you sense that a teeming world would reveal itself as always having been there. But the world within Coppola’s frame is big enough; half a century later, we can still walk around in it and discover something new about moviemaking and life with every visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mark Harris</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Francis Ford Coppola","producer":"Albert S.

The film’s ascent almost feels like a given, due to the effervescence that may be its defining characteristic and the scarcity of that quality in our trying times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, typically for anything that seems so effortless, Kelly and Donen’s achievement was in fact the product of an enormous amount of toil and trouble. At the project’s outset, the legendary writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green tried and failed to get out of the gig when MGM musical head Arthur Freed ordered them to build a new movie on top of a batch of tunes by Freed and his partner Nacio Herb Brown that were gathering dust. (Indeed, ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ itself had made its screen debut in The Hollywood Revue of 1929.) Debbie Reynolds’ ordeal filming the ‘Good Morning’ tap-dance number famously left her with bloody feet. As for the title song, six months of rehearsal culminated in Gene Kelly gamely splashing about while running a high fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of that suffering is discernible on screen, which is one of the many delightful ironies about Hollywood’s most deeply cherished movie about the making of a Hollywood movie. Pulling back the curtain to show yet more dazzling drapery, Comden and Green celebrate an earlier era of Tinseltown chancers and hustlers with a tale of a production caught between the silent and sound eras. Kelly’s plucky hoofer and stuntman-turned-star Don Lockwood leads the charge to retrofit a swashbuckler picture named The Duelling Cavalier to take advantage of the new vogue for sound, with his new sweetie Kathy (Reynolds) being his best means of disguising the squawky voice of his leading lady Lina (a hilarious Jean Hagen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several movies besides Don’s latest somehow contained within the text of Singin’ in the Rain (including, if we are to believe the deliciously meta billboard in the final shot, Singin’ in the Rain). Cheekily purporting to reveal its own means of production while still delivering one unabashedly theatrical showstopper after another, Kelly and Donen’s masterwork anticipates the brassy postmodernism of Moulin Rouge! (2001). But like such fellow homage-payers as The Artist (2011) and La La Land (2016), Baz Luhrmann’s rendition feels meagre compared to the original and its seemingly inexhaustible bounty of ingenuity, bravado and sheer unabashed joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jason Anderson</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen","producer":"Arthur Freed","writer":"Adolph Green, Betty Comden","featuring":"Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds"},"year":"1951","nameAndYear":"Singin' in the Rain (1951)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14090","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":102,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":10,"tied":false,"category":"critics"},{"position":52,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":null},"products":[{"sku":"5051892082150","name":"Singin' in the Rain (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/singin-in-the-rain-dvd.html","price":"5.99"},{"sku":"5051892074391","name":"Singin' in the Rain (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/singin-in-the-rain-blu-ray.html","price":"12.99"}]},"comments":[{"type":"p","key":"Happiness distilled.

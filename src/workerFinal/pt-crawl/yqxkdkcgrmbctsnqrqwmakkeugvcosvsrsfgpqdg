      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><strong>What causes 
        kidney failure in iguanas? Are there any signs when an iguana's kidneys 
        are failing? Are they especially prone to this?</strong></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><strong><br>
        </strong></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Iguanas 
        in captivity are prone to this in a large part because people keep feeding 
        them animal protein and do not give them enough access to water or humidity. 
        Books that say to feed animal protein and only put down water once a week 
        have not increased iguana longevity - quite the contrary: since the new 
        iguana books came out in the early 1990's, it appears that kidney failure 
        is striking at younger ages, with iguanas dying at 3-5 years rather that 
        7-9 years from it...and even that was far short of the 15-20+ years they 
        should be living.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Fed a proper plant-based 
        diet, with regular access to water and spraying, iguana kidneys generally 
        do just fine. With insufficient water, however, the kidneys have to strain 
        to work. Add animal protein to such a 'dry' system, and the kidneys don't 
        have a chance. The commercial food products of dry pellets or powders 
        whose instructions state to feed dry are also likely to contribute to 
        kidney problems, whether or not they have, as some do, animal protein 
        in them.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many antibiotics are 
        hard on the kidneys, and need to be administered in conjunction with additional 
        fluids (by injection) to try to prevent harmful effects on the kidneys. 
        Since there have been no widespread pharmacokinetic studies on green iguanas 
        or other reptiles (although, at this time, some are now underway) all 
        drugs and dosages have been extrapolated from those used on mammals. While 
        we will eventually know what is safe to use at what dosages, etc., for 
        now it is still part guess, part experience, and part luck. In the meantime, 
        antibiotics remain a potential cause of kidney problems.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When kidney failure 
        occurs, its external signs--what <em>you</em> see--happens suddenly and 
        the animal usually dies soon thereafter. Signs include anorexia, weight 
        loss despite eating, lethargy, swollen or distended abdomen, frequent 
        drinking or voiding, grossly swollen neck (<em>not</em> the normal jowls 
        of the sexually mature male) and/or dewlap. Upon x-rays, kidneys, not 
        normally visible due to their position in the pelvic area, may be seen 
        protruding up into the coelomic cavity; they may also be felt. Many blood 
        levels (BUN, creatinine, uric acid) may be within normal ranges, but phosphorous 
        levels may be elevated and the calcium:phosphorous ratio may be way off, 
        with calcium less than 1:1. Some iguanas may be mildly hypocalcemic (calcium 
        deficient) while others may be hypercalcemic (excessive levels of calcium; 
        see the article on <a href="../hypercal.html">hypercalcemia</a>). Some 
        may exhibit mineralization of the tissues due to the buildup of uric acid 
        crystals (due to animal protein or lack of sufficient hydration to effect 
        proper digestion and waste removal), which may be visible or felt as hard 
        lumpy clusters around the joints of the legs and feet. Kidney biopsies 
        and ultrasound may be beneficial in diagnosing the condition.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Treatment, <i>if the 
        condition is caught early enough</i>, includes complete diet and environment 
        overhaul, phosphate binders and hydration via IV or IO (intraosseous--in 
        the bone) lines. Igs who survive one bout of renal disease will always 
        be susceptible to it and must be watched carefully in the future.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong><font size="3">&quot;But, 
        my iguana was so healthy.&quot;</font><font ><br>
        </font></strong><em>I cannot stress the following too strongly.</em> Generally 
        speaking, right up until 1-2 weeks before they start to die--before their 
        kidneys give out for good--they are healthy looking, exhibiting normal 
        behaviors, thermoregulation, feeding, and defecating with normal looking 
        urates and feces. The symptoms of renal failure can come on so suddenly, 
        and overlap those of many other conditions, that most owners don't even 
        do anything about it until their iguana lapses into final shock. It is 
        in this last one-to-two week period that things start to happen, the altered 
        behavior; acting increasingly lethargic; the loss of appetite; rapid dehydration; 
        constipation; thickened and yellowing urates; reduced thermoregulation 
        or complete failure to thermoregulate (as they get too weak to move); 
        increased sleep time; extremely rapid weight loss (inconsistent with past 
        periods of reduced or no food intake); loss of muscle tone; lack of deep 
        pain responses; and gross reduction in interactive [animal/animal and 
        animal/human] responses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><strong><b>&quot;But 
        he's eaten animal protein for years and has been just fine.&quot;</b></strong></font><font ><br>
        </font> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">You may have 
        been feeding your iguana animal protein for several years and it may be 
        looking and acting just great. So have all the iguanas who came to me 
        from such backgrounds, right up until they &quot;crashed and burned&quot; 
        within the week or two before their kidneys failed. My advice is to get 
        blood work done annually to monitor their kidney function and related 
        serum indicators on iguanas who have animal protein histories or to whom 
        you continue to feed protein if you insist on doing so.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, there are a few 
        iguanas out there who live into their 'teens cheerfully chowing down on 
        animal protein every day. There are also a few three-pack a day cigarette 
        smokers who live to a ripe old age and die of a disease unrelated to their 
        smoking. Just as the latter is hardly justification for ignoring the deaths 
        each year caused by smoking in primary and secondhand smokers, so too 
        can iguana owners not ignore the findings in the recent reptile veterinary 
        and biological literature. At least a smoker has a choice as to whether 
        to risk his life and health. Iguanas in captivity do not truly have a 
        choice, being at the mercy of their owners, and their owners' common sense 
        and concern for them.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong><font size="3">But 
        I've never fed him protein, dry food or monkey biscuits and still his 
        kidneys failed</font><font >.<br>
        </font></strong>While iguanas have been kept in captivity for several 
        decades, it is only in the past handful of years that veterinarians even 
        started specializing in reptile and amphibian medicine, and so it is only 
        relatively recently that documentation has begun on iguana care and survival. 
        While being fed animal protein and chronic low levels of dehydration are 
        continuing problems facing iguanas. Reptile vets also recognize that other 
        factors may come into play. That these factors exist is brought home in 
        the cases of iguanas who have apparently been raised properly - no animal 
        protein, low fat diet, proper selection of plant foods, regular bathing 
        and humidified air - also develop and die from kidney failure.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A case in point is 
        a marvelous 10 year old iguana belonging to a friend of mine. Hood had 
        been raised on a healthy vegetable diet, got daily baths, proper heat, 
        annual checkups by a top reptile vet, vet visits when he acted the least 
        bit strange. Hood was highly tamed and socialized, relaxed when he was 
        involved in education events. His owner had to leave town for a month, 
        but left Hood at home with proper care by caretakers he knew. Shortly 
        after the owner's return from his month away, he went away for a long 
        weekend. Upon his return from that weekend he found Hood lethargic and 
        saw that he had lost a great deal of weight since the last saw him three 
        days before. The owner called his vet, who turned out to be out of the 
        country. The vets to whom he was referred by that office were also unavailable. 
        The owner began calling vet offices around town, but the vets were either 
        out or the offices couldn't fit him in (which indicates vet staff need 
        to be trained to recognize the possible signs of kidney failure and to 
        treat these calls as emergencies and work them in!). He finally got into 
        a vet 24 hours later. By that time Hood was extremely weak, had lost even 
        more weight, was severely dehydrated, and not responsive. Despite aggressive 
        fluid and antibiotic therapy, Hood did not respond, and did not survive 
        the next 24 hours.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">So, what happened? 
        The necropsy showed that he was very healthy other than the kidneys. Could 
        it have been his age? Maybe, but 10 years old really isn't that old in 
        a species whose life span can range from 15-20+ years. Could the stress 
        of the last couple of months, with the prolonged owner absence, have caused 
        immune failure or some other systemic malfunction? It is well known that 
        iguanas, even if cared for at home by a known caretaker (including the 
        parent, spouse or live-in partner of the owner), react to their owner's 
        absence, often getting depressed (lethargic, reduced appetite, significant 
        alteration of regular daily routine) and acting out when the owner returns 
        (breaking potty training, aggressive, snappy or whippy behavior). Might 
        he not have been hydrated enough? Vet recommendations for humidity levels 
        range from 60-100% humidity for several hours during the day (Hood was 
        maintained at 60%).</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">What this tells us 
        is that even if you do everything apparently right, the kidneys might 
        still go. Rather than say, &quot;what the heck&quot; and go ahead and 
        give our iguanas animal protein and keep them in desert-like environments, 
        however, we must still provide the best diet and environment we can. In 
        addition, we must be observant and proactive when they begin to show signs 
        of illness, and whenever possible, have necropsies done in order to try 
        to find out what happened.</font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        </font></p>
      <hr width="25%" align="left">
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">I encourage everyone 
        to do some research on their own. The research should not include pet 
        trade books published before 1995 or so but should be focused on iguana 
        biology and research, and care books reflecting such research. Veterinary 
        and biological references may be found in my bibliography on iguanas, 
        including John Iverson's <em>Adaptation to Herbivory in Iguinine Lizards</em> 
        in the book by Burghardt and Rand, Iguanas of the World: Their Behavior, 
        Ecology, and Conservation; the chapter on reptile nutrition by reptile 
        vet and nutritionists Susan Donoghue in Douglas Mader's book Reptile Medicine 
        and Surgery, and Jim Hatfield's book on iguana care. These sources also 
        contain numerous citations that can be investigated as well. The Association 
        of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarian's quarterly bulletin may also be 
        a useful source of information as new findings are published.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Captive iguanas, like 
        all captive animals, should be living long and healthy lives, their age 
        at death equaling or greater than the number of years they are expected 
        to live in the wild. Theoretically, in captivity, the common causes of 
        early death in wild animals are obviated as they are protected from predation, 
        disease, and cyclical fluctuations in harsh weather conditions and scarce 
        food resources. The fact that relatively young iguanas are dying by the 
        tens of thousands every year is a clear signal that we haven't been doing 
        it right, that we have been making some gross blunders in our understanding 
        of their needs and functions. Continuing to rely on out-of-date pet trade 
        resources, like the many TFH iguana books, pet store and outdated veterinary 
        caresheets, and even many zoo diets out there, does a great disservice 
        to your green iguana, a pet that should be a companion animal for many, 
        many years...</font></p>

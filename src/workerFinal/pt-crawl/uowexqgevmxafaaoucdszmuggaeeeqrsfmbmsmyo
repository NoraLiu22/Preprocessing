/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 121]]</font> This month 
        Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace enters upon his seventy-sixth year. He was born 
        at Usk, Monmouthshire, on January 8th, 1823. His father, Thomas Vere Wallace, 
        who died when the future scientist was eleven years old,<sup><a href="#1">1</a> 
        </sup> was of Scottish descent, and when young had uncles living at Stirling, 
        which seems to directly connect the family with the ancient Wallace clan. 
        A. R. Wallace was educated at Hertford Grammar School, which he left when 
        fourteen years old. Up to the age of twenty-one he worked in various parts 
        of England and Wales, with an elder brother (William), a land surveyor 
        and architect. On coming of age he left his brother and became English 
        master in the Collegiate School, Leicester; about a year later his brother 
        died and he succeeded to his business at Neath, Glamorganshire. Although 
        enjoying the railway surveying and other work on which he was engaged, 
        some difficulties in getting payment for a tithe-commutation survey, which 
        he was obliged to collect from the farmers, so disgusted him with business 
        life, that he proposed to the late H. W. Bates, whose acquaintance he 
        had made at Leicester, to undertake an expedition to the Amazons, being 
        induced thereto by reading Edwards' &quot;Voyage up the Amazon&quot; and Humboldt's 
        Personal Narrative. His object was to collect natural history specimens 
        and gather facts &quot;towards solving the problem of the origin of species.&quot; 
        After four years in South America, he returned home, and in 1853 published 
        &quot;Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro.&quot; The next year he set out on a second 
        expedition, and spent eight years in the region between Malacca and New 
        Guinea; the literary result being &quot;The Malay Archipelago, the Land of 
        the Orang-Utan and the Bird of Paradise: A Narrative of Travel, with Studies 
        of Man and Nature&quot; (published in 1869). It was from Ternate, in 1858, 
        that Mr. Wallace sent home, addressed to Darwin, with the request that 
        he would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, a paper setting forth the theory 
        of natural selection, which Darwin had also arrived at and was then working 
        out in detail.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning from abroad Dr. Wallace resided in 
        London for a few years. In 1866 he married the eldest daughter of Mr. 
        William Mitten, a well-known botanist and specialist in mosses. A few 
        years later he built a house at Grays, Essex, where Dr. and Mrs. Wallace 
        resided for about five years (1871-6). The next two years were spent at 
        Dorking, and the following five at Croydon. Then Dr. Wallace built a cottage 
        at the top of Frith Hill, Godalming. In 1886 he went for a nine months' 
        lecturing tour in America; on his return, desiring a milder climate, they 
        searched through the South of England, and finally settled at Parkstone, 
        three miles west of Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although quite close to the railway station, the spot 
        where Dr. and Mrs. Wallace have had their home for the last eight years 
        is secluded and picturesque. Standing on sloping ground, and surrounded 
        by a garden, the pretty creeper-covered cottage commands a fine view across 
        Poole Harbour to the Purbeck Hills; Corfe Castle is discernible in clear 
        weather, hence the name of the house--&quot;Corfe View.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Wallace's travels and adventures in early life 
        seem to have hardened his physique. No symptom of feebleness, physical 
        or mental, is perceptible. With his tall substantial figure, still erect 
        but for slight &quot;scholar's stoop,&quot; his head thickly covered with smooth 
        white hair, Dr. Wallace's appearance is at once robust and dignified. 
        When a young man his height was six feet one and a half inches; it is 
        now about six feet. One is charmed by the native simplicity and modesty 
        of his speech and demeanour; he seems never to regard himself as one of 
        the notable men of the century. Despite some bronchial trouble and a slight 
        tendency to asthma, Dr. Wallace's general health is good; he says he now 
        feels as well as he has done any time during the last twenty years. He 
        rarely takes alcohol, and has never smoked. Although he has not forsworn 
        meat, he believes that vegetarianism is sound in principle, and will ultimately 
        become universal.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the November afternoon I had the 
        privilege of spending in Dr. Wallace's cosy little study, which is in 
        the lower part of the house, the garden sloping down to it, I asked him 
        whether present-day science is supporting Darwin. &quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied, 
        &quot;Darwin is supported by competent judges, but latterly so-called naturalists 
        and biologists have rapidly increased, and among the less clear-thinking 
        of these there is a great tendency to quibble and make difficulties where 
        really there are none. Darwin's fundamental principles have never been 
        shaken. For myself, I have complete confidence in them, and in the permanent 
        influence of his work.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But you reject some of his conclusions?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes. Sexual selection resulting from the fighting 
        of males is indisputable, but, differing from Darwin, I do not believe 
        there is any selection through the choice of the <font color="990000">[[p. 
        122]]</font> females, and the drift of scientific opinion is towards my 
        view. Again, I do not believe in the transmission of acquired characters, 
        the evidence seeming to me to be against it, and this is the chief point 
        on which there is a growth of scientific opinion against Darwin. The discussion 
        is still proceeding, naturalists now being about equally divided. Herbert 
        Spencer takes the same view as Darwin, but Mr. Francis Galton and Weismann<sup><a href="#2">2</a> 
        </sup> between them have almost certainly proved the non-heredity of acquired 
        variations. But neither of these questions affects Darwin's fundamental 
        principles.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only other material point on which Dr. Wallace 
        differs from Darwin is that which separates him from nine-tenths of modern 
        biologists. &quot;I am not able to believe that the mental and moral nature 
        of man has been developed out of the lower animals wholly and solely by 
        the same natural processes that developed his physical structure. That 
        arises from the fact that I am a spiritualist, believing that there is 
        something in man differing in nature as well as in degree from the lower 
        animals. At a certain epoch, when the body was sufficiently developed 
        to receive it, there was a spiritual influx. I believe there were three 
        stages in the development of the living universe, at each of which there 
        was an influx of something that was not there before. First, the change 
        from the inorganic, whose highest development is the crystal, to the organic. 
        The advance represented by the plant, even supposing it has no sensation, 
        seems to me too great to have been brought about merely by increased complexity 
        of molecules. Second, from the plant to the animal, which has sensation, 
        consciousness is a still greater step. The third stage is the development 
        of the soul or noblest faculties of man. The enormous difference between 
        man and the lower animals must have a cause, and I cannot find that cause 
        in the ordinary processes of evolution.&quot; Dr. Wallace has expounded his 
        views on this point in the closing chapter of his popular account of &quot;Darwinism&quot; 
        (Macmillan).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverting to the question of heredity, I said it would 
        seem at first thought that if acquired characters are not transmitted 
        humanity cannot influence its own development, which would be fatalism.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;is the mistake nearly everybody 
        makes. The fact is non-heredity of acquired characteristics allows greater 
        scope for development, and inspires more hope for the future of the race 
        than heredity. Think of the overwhelming influences for evil that have 
        been constantly operating from the earliest times. All the despotisms 
        of the world have tended to cultivate the bad in man. If the accumulated 
        badness had been handed down, humanity would never have reached its present 
        level. But if only that which is inherent in man is inherited, the moment 
        the pressure of bad conditions is lifted he is able to spring up again 
        and develop all the good qualities that have been latent merely because 
        of want of opportunity.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace's hope for the upward development of the 
        race is in free human selection. &quot;When women are thoroughly educated and 
        free, and have not to struggle for a bare existence, or to sell themselves 
        either in marriage or out of it, there will be real sexual selection, 
        and the result will be most beneficial to the race, for the great majority 
        of men and women, especially women, admire what is good, great, and benevolent, 
        and dislike what is mean and bad.&quot; This subject is dealt with by Dr. Wallace 
        in an article on &quot;Human Selection&quot; in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> 
        for September, 1890 <i>[S427 --Ed.]</i>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About his religious standpoint he said, &quot;I have always 
        felt, like Herbert Spencer, that God is unknowable and unthinkable; but 
        directly we get the idea of a life beyond ours we can conceive the scale 
        of being rising higher and higher. Whether it culminates in one personality 
        or goes on endlessly we cannot tell, and it does not matter. For thirty 
        years before I became convinced of the truth of spiritualism I was an 
        agnostic. My only religion is that which I get out of spiritualism. The 
        world is the means <font color="990000">[[p. 123]]</font> of developing 
        human souls, and our future depends upon our use of present opportunities. 
        When we leave this world, having thrown aside the body, our development 
        goes on from the exact point we have reached here.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What is your attitude to the doctrines of Christianity?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I do not hold any Christian doctrines whatever. I 
        consider that Christ was a great man, with very exceptional spiritual 
        gifts, a great medium, and probably the man most nearly associated with 
        the spiritual world in all history. We spiritualists have no difficulty 
        in accepting the whole story of His life and miracles.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Including His miraculous entry into and departure 
        from the world?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They are not subjects of evidence; they are not related 
        by eye-witnesses, and really they are not essential. The same things have 
        been said of the founders of other religions. But natural miracles, such 
        as healing the sick and producing food, are done to-day.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How did you become a spiritualist?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When I returned from abroad in 1862 I read about 
        spiritualism, and, like most people, thought it all imposture, delusion, 
        idiocy. I met people, apparently intelligent and sane, who assured me 
        they had experienced wonderful things. Mrs. Marshall was at that time 
        a celebrated medium in London, and after close examination I became convinced 
        that the phenomena associated with her were perfectly genuine. But it 
        took three years' further investigation to satisfy me that they were produced 
        by spirits.&quot; For further discussion of spiritualism Dr. Wallace referred 
        me to his book, &quot;Miracles and Modern Spiritualism,&quot;<i></i> which appeared 
        in 1874.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I inquired of Dr. Wallace whether, like Mr. Gerald 
        Massey, he holds direct communication with the spirit-world.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;Mr. Massey is mediumistic; I am not. 
        I have never received any communications, or had anything happen to me, 
        except when I have gone to a professor or friendly medium.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do you think the religion of the future will be based 
        on spiritualism?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Certainly. There is nothing else to base it upon. 
        When on the one side you have facts and phenomena that are happening to-day, 
        and on the other you have something that is alleged to have happened two 
        or three thousand years ago, and the first can be tested and the other 
        cannot, it is absurd to expect people to accept the one that comes to 
        them through ancient manuscripts and faulty translations and to reject 
        the evidence that is now before their eyes, especially when the ancient 
        and modern phenomena are pretty much of the same kind.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Speaking of tests, is it not alleged that that is 
        precisely the point at which spiritualism breaks down?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The allegation is only partially true. Usually those 
        who at the very beginning demand tests are the wrong kind of people to 
        get any satisfactory result. Those who experiment in the proper spirit 
        don't fail. Professor William Crookes, F.R.S.,<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
        experimented in his laboratory for years with the greatest success. Professor 
        Oliver Lodge, Professor W. F. Barrett, of Dublin,<sup><a href="#4">4</a> </sup>and 
        others have been more or less successful.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some time past Dr. Wallace has been working at 
        a new book. In 1896 he lectured at Davos for Dr. Lunn, who suggested the 
        topic, &quot;Personal Recollections of the Scientific Discoveries of the Century.&quot; 
        Dr. Wallace became so interested in the subject that he decided to write 
        a book upon it; it is nearly finished, and will be published in the spring. 
        The title he chose was &quot;A Century of Progress,&quot; but hearing that a series 
        of articles had appeared in England or America under that heading, he 
        has changed it to &quot;The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and its Failures.&quot; 
        &quot;I have sketched,&quot; said the author, &quot;the material and scientific progress 
        of the century, and also the progress in ideas and principles. The distinctive 
        feature of the book is that while I make more of the successes of the 
        century than I believe any other writer has done, yet I show that the 
        failures have been quite as great as the successes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have a great many heresies,&quot; Dr. Wallace continued, 
        smiling. &quot;For example, I have been a strong anti-vaccinator for the last 
        twenty-five years.&quot; Dr. Wallace showed me the manuscript of a work on 
        this subject, which after separate publication is to be included in &quot;The 
        Wonderful Century.&quot; It is entitled, &quot;Vaccination a Delusion, and its Penal 
        Enforcement a Crime; Proved by the Official Evidence in the Reports of 
        the Royal Commission.&quot; One chapter of &quot;The Wonderful Century&quot; is a defence 
        of phrenology, in which Dr. Wallace has all his life been an ardent believer.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace continues to contribute occasionally to 
        the reviews and magazines. He usually does his writing in the forenoon. 
        He believes in taking plenty of recreation, and has several hobbies, gardening 
        among others. For many years he has cultivated every plant that he can 
        get to grow in his garden. In his conservatory he has a great variety 
        of orchids. His indoor hobby is chess. He likes music, but only very grand 
        music. To a remark that evidently the faculty of appreciation has not 
        died out at all in him, as it did to some extent in Darwin, Dr. Wallace 
        responded, &quot;Darwin was a continuous worker at his one great subject; I 
        am not. I should not be happy without some work, but I vary it with gardening, 
        walking, or novel reading. Even when in the midst of writing a book I 
        never cease to read light literature.&quot; He spoke of Miss Jane Barlow, who 
        was recently in Parkstone, as &quot;one of the most delightful writers of the 
        day.&quot; He particularly enjoyed &quot;Irish Idylls.&quot; He said that H. Seton Merriman's 
        &quot;Sowers&quot; was one of the most striking, vivid pictures of Russia he had 
        ever read. Meredith Dr. Wallace can't read. He admired Hardy's earlier 
        stories, but he does not care for his later books. &quot;I dislike,&quot; he says, 
        &quot;the whole pessimist school of writers. I have read two of Hall Caine's 
        books, 'The Manxman' and 'Son of Hagar,' and they are full of misery, 
        horror, pain, trouble. I hate it; that is not human nature.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He is a great genius,&quot; was Dr. Wallace's response 
        when I mentioned R. D. Blackmore. &quot;Last year I again read 'Lorna Doone'; 
        this year we went to explore the Doone Valley. Of course we had been told 
        there was no such place, but we could not believe that; all the surrounding 
        places are so accurately described. Now,&quot; genially, &quot;I don't think a writer 
        ought to mislead one like that.&quot; He has an immense admiration for Dickens, 
        and is glad that so many competent writers and critics still uphold him. 
        Dr. Wallace does not read much poetry, though he appreciates good verse, 
        and has great admiration for Tennyson and Kipling.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 124]]</font> When residing 
        in London, Dr. Wallace knew intimately Huxley, Tyndall, Herbert Spencer, 
        and Sir Charles Lyell. At the request of Tennyson, Dr. Wallace once called, 
        with Mr. Allingham, at Aldworth. &quot;After lunch we spent the afternoon in 
        the study, Tennyson smoking all the time. He wanted to talk of spiritualism 
        chiefly, about which he was very sympathetic. At that time I don't think 
        he had 'seen anything'; he talked of having a medium. Tennyson was a born 
        spiritualist, like Longfellow.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darwin occasionally came up to London to visit libraries 
        and museums; he stayed with his brother in Queen Anne Street, and Dr. 
        Wallace was usually asked to lunch. &quot;Darwin was so extremely delicate 
        and sensitive that he had to limit his conversation and the number of 
        people he saw at one time. We conferred and discussed more by letter than 
        personally.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The opinions expressed on landlordism in the last 
        two pages of my 'Malay Archipelago' attracted the attention of John Stuart 
        Mill, and procured me the honour of his acquaintance.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conspicuous in Dr. Wallace's study is a portrait of 
        Mr. Robert Blatchford. He considers the author of &quot;Merrie England&quot; &quot;in 
        many respects the very first writer of English at this day. I have been 
        a Socialist for twelve or fifteen years,&quot; he said; &quot;I want to write a 
        book on Socialism, answering the common foolish objections, and showing 
        what Socialism really is.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace approves of the programme of the Independent 
        Labour Party--&quot;the nationalisation of the whole means of production, distribution, 
        and exchange&quot;--regarding this as the essence of Socialism. He thinks that 
        even in a Socialist state for a long time wages will be necessary, and 
        that they must vary somewhat with ability, but the difference need not 
        be nearly so great as it is now. &quot;One man ought not to get ten or a hundred 
        times as much as another simply because he is cleverer or quicker with 
        his fingers--twice as much would be ample.&quot; Since 1881, Dr. Wallace has 
        been President of the Land Nationalisation Society, and until three years 
        ago he gave the annual address.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace is the last of a family of nine. A younger 
        brother, Herbert Edward, joined him on the Amazons, and died of yellow 
        fever at Para in 1851; an older brother, John, went to California in 1850, 
        and died there in 1895, his only sister living since his boyhood having 
        died in London two years earlier. Dr. and Mrs. Wallace have a son and 
        a daughter. Mr. William Greenell Wallace, twenty-five years of age, has 
        been trained as an electrical engineer. An enthusiastic Socialist, he 
        and a like-minded friend recently went to America to study electrical 
        science and the conditions of life in the United States, whilst earning 
        their living. Miss Wallace is a kindergarten teacher in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few men of his own generation have had a more rich 
        and varied experience than Dr. Wallace, and none more deserves a happy, 
        peaceful eventide such as he is now enjoying. I asked him whether he did 
        not intend to employ part of his leisure in writing his reminiscences.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If I live long enough,&quot; he replied, &quot;I may write 
        an autobiography. But I am not very good at that sort of thing.&quot;</p>

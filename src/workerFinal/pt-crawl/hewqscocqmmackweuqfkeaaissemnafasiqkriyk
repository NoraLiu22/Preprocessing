 &gt;&gt;THE FATAL FLAWS UNDERLYING NATO'S INTERVENTION IN YUGOSLAVIA
 &gt;&gt;By
 &gt;&gt;Lt Gen Satish Nambiar (Retd.)
 &gt;&gt;(First Force Commander and Head of Mission of the United Nations Forces
 &gt;&gt;deployed in the former Yugoslavia  03 Mar92 to 02 Mar 93. Former Deputy
 &gt;&gt;Chief of Staff, Indian Army. Currently, Director of the United Services
 &gt;&gt;Institution of India.)
 &gt;&gt;My year long experience as the Force Commander and Head of Mission of the
 &gt;&gt;United Nations Forces deployed in the former Yugoslavia has given me an
 &gt;&gt;understanding of the fatal flaws of US/NATO policies in the troubled
 &gt;region.
 &gt;&gt;It was obvious to most people following events in the Balkans since the
 &gt;&gt;beginning of the decade, and particularly after the fighting that resulted
 &gt;&gt;in the emergence of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former
 &gt;&gt;Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, that Kosovo was a 'powder keg' waiting to
 &gt;&gt;explode. The West appears to have learnt all the wrong lessons from the
 &gt;&gt;previous wars and applied it to Kosovo.
 &gt;&gt;(1) Portraying the Serbs as evil and everybody else as good was not only
 &gt;&gt;counterproductive but also dishonest. According to my experience all sides
 &gt;&gt;were guilty but only the Serbs would admit that they were no angels while
 &gt;&gt;the others would insist that they were. With 28, 000 forces under me and
 &gt;&gt;with constant contacts with UNHCR and the International Red Cross
 &gt;officials,
 &gt;&gt;we did not witness any genocide beyond killings and massacres on all sides
 &gt;&gt;that are typical of such conflict conditions. I believe none of my
 &gt;&gt;successors and their forces saw anything on the scale claimed by the
 media.
 &gt;&gt;(2) It was obvious to me that if Slovenians, Croatians and Bosniaks had
 the
 &gt;&gt;right to secede from Yugoslavia, then the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia had
 &gt;an
 &gt;&gt;equal right to secede.  The experience of partitions in Ireland and India
 &gt;&gt;has not be pleasant but in the Yugoslavia case, the state had already been
 &gt;&gt;taken apart anyway.  It made little sense to me that if multiethnic
 &gt;&gt;Yugoslavia was not tenable that multiethnic Bosnia could be made tenable.
 &gt;&gt;The former internal boundaries of Yugoslavia which had no validity under
 &gt;&gt;international law should have been redrawn when it was taken apart by the
 &gt;&gt;West, just as it was in the case of Ireland in 1921 and Punjab and Bengal
 &gt;in
 &gt;&gt;India in 1947.  Failure to acknowledge this has led to the problem of
 &gt;Kosovo
 &gt;&gt;as an integral part of Serbia.
 &gt;&gt;(3) It is ironic that the Dayton Agreement on Bosnia was not fundamentally
 &gt;&gt;different from the Lisbon Plan drawn up by Portuguese Foreign Minister
 &gt;&gt;Cuteliero and British representative Lord Carrington to which all three
 &gt;&gt;sides had agreed before any killings had taken place, or even the
 &gt;Vance-Owen
 &gt;&gt;Plan which Karadzic was willing to sign.  One of the main problems was
 that
 &gt;&gt;there was an unwillingness on the part of the American administration to
 &gt;&gt;concede that Serbs had legitimate grievances and rights.  I recall State
 &gt;&gt;Department official George Kenny turning up like all other American
 &gt;&gt;officials, spewing condemnations of the Serbs for aggression and genocide.
 &gt;&gt;I offered to give him an escort and to go see for himself that none of
 what
 &gt;&gt;he proclaimed was true.  He accepted my offer and thereafter he made a
 &gt;&gt;radical turnaround..  Other Americans continued to see and hear what they
 &gt;&gt;wanted to see and hear from one side, while ignoring the other side.  Such
 &gt;&gt;behaviour does not produce peace but more conflict.
 &gt;&gt;(4) I felt that Yugoslavia was a media-generated tragedy.  The Western
 &gt;media
 &gt;&gt;sees international crises in black and white, sensationalizing incidents
 &gt;for
 &gt;&gt;public consumption.  From what I can see now, all Serbs have been driven
 &gt;out
 &gt;&gt;of Croatia and the Muslim-Croat Federation, I believe almost 850,000 of
 &gt;&gt;them.  And yet the focus is on 500,000 Albanians (at last count) who have
 &gt;&gt;been driven out of Kosovo.  Western policies have led to an ethnically
 pure
 &gt;&gt;Greater Croatia, and an ethnically pure Muslim statelet in Bosnia.
 &gt;&gt;Therefore, why not an ethnically pure Serbia?  Failure to address these
 &gt;&gt;double standards has led to the current one.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;As I watched the ugly tragedy unfold in the case of Kosovo while visiting
 &gt;&gt;the US in early to mid March 1999, I could see the same pattern emerging.
 &gt;&gt;In my experience with similar situations in India in such places as
 &gt;Kashmir,
 &gt;&gt;Punjab, Assam, Nagaland, and elsewhere, it is the essential strategy of
 &gt;&gt;those ethnic groups who wish to secede to provoke the state authorities.
 &gt;&gt;Killings of policemen is usually a standard operating procedure by
 &gt;&gt;terrorists since that usually invites overwhelming state retaliation, just
 &gt;&gt;as I am sure it does in the United States.
 &gt;&gt;I do not believe the Belgrade government had prior intention of driving
 out
 &gt;&gt;all Albanians from Kosovo.  It may have decided to implement Washington's
 &gt;&gt;own "Krajina Plan" only if NATO bombed, or these expulsions could be
 &gt;&gt;spontaneous acts of revenge and retaliation by Serb forces in the field
 &gt;&gt;because of the bombing.  The OSCE Monitors were not doing too badly, and
 &gt;the
 &gt;&gt;Yugoslav Government had, after all, indicated its willingness to abide by
 &gt;&gt;nearly all the provisions of  the Rambouillet "Agreement" on aspects like
 &gt;&gt;cease-fire, greater autonomy to the Albanians, and so on.  But they
 &gt;insisted
 &gt;&gt;that the status of Kosovo as part of Serbia was not negotiable, and they
 &gt;&gt;would not agree to station NATO forces on the soil of Yugoslavia.  This is
 &gt;&gt;precisely what India would have done under the same circumstances.  It was
 &gt;&gt;the West that proceeded to escalate the situation into the current
 &gt;senseless
 &gt;&gt;bombing campaign that smacks more of hurt egos, and revenge and
 &gt;retaliation.
 &gt;&gt;NATO's massive bombing intended to terrorize Serbia into submission
 appears
 &gt;&gt;no different from the morality of actions of Serb forces in Kosovo.
 &gt;&gt;Ultimatums were issued to Yugoslavia that unless the terms of an agreement
 &gt;&gt;drawn up at Rambouillet were signed, NATO would undertake bombing.
 &gt;&gt;Ultimatums do not constitute diplomacy. They are acts of war.  The
 &gt;Albanians
 &gt;&gt;of Kosovo who want independence, were coaxed and cajoled into putting
 their
 &gt;&gt;signatures to a document motivated with the hope of NATO bombing of Serbs
 &gt;&gt;and independence later.  With this signature, NATO assumed all the legal
 &gt;and
 &gt;&gt;moral authority to undertake military operations against a country that
 &gt;had,
 &gt;&gt;at worst, been harsh on its own people.  On 24th March 1999, NATO launched
 &gt;&gt;attacks with cruise missiles and bombs, on Yugoslavia, a sovereign state,
 a
 &gt;&gt;founding member of the United Nations and the Non Aligned Movement; and
 &gt;&gt;against a people who were at the forefront of the fight against Nazi
 &gt;Germany
 &gt;&gt;and other fascist forces during World War Two.  I consider these current
 &gt;&gt;actions unbecoming of great powers.
 &gt;&gt;It is appropriate to touch on the humanitarian dimension for it is the
 &gt;&gt;innocent who are being subjected to displacement, pain and misery.
 &gt;&gt;Unfortunately, this is the tragic and inevitable outcome of all such
 &gt;&gt;situations  of civil war, insurgencies, rebel movements, and terrorist
 &gt;&gt;activity.  History is replete with examples of such suffering; whether it
 &gt;be
 &gt;&gt;the American Civil War, Northern Ireland, the Basque movement in Spain,
 &gt;&gt;Chechnya, Angola, Cambodia, and so many other cases; the indiscriminate
 &gt;&gt;bombing of civilian centres during World War Two; Hiroshima and Nagasaki;
 &gt;&gt;Vietnam.  The list is endless. I feel that this tragedy could have been
 &gt;&gt;prevented if NATO's ego and credibility had not been given the highest
 &gt;&gt;priority instead of the genuine grievances of Serbs in addition to
 &gt;&gt;Albanians.
 &gt;&gt;Notwithstanding all that one hears and sees on CNN and BBC, and other
 &gt;&gt;Western agencies, and in the daily briefings of the NATO authorities, the
 &gt;&gt;blame for the humanitarian crisis that has arisen cannot be placed at the
 &gt;&gt;door of the Yugoslav authorities alone.  The responsibility rests mainly
 at
 &gt;&gt;NATO's doors.  In fact, if I am to go by my own experience as the First
 &gt;&gt;Force Commander and Head of Mission of the United Nations forces in the
 &gt;&gt;former Yugoslavia, from March 1992 to March 1993, handling operations in
 &gt;&gt;Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia, I would say that reports put
 &gt;out
 &gt;&gt;in the electronic media are largely responsible for provoking this
 tragedy.
 &gt;&gt;Where does all this leave the international community which for the record
 &gt;&gt;does not comprise of the US, the West and its newfound Muslim allies ? The
 &gt;&gt;portents for the future, at least in the short term, are bleak indeed.
 The
 &gt;&gt;United Nations has been made totally redundant, ineffective, and impotent.
 &gt;&gt;The Western world, led by the USA, will lay down the moral values that the
 &gt;&gt;rest of the world must adhere to; it does not matter that they themselves
 &gt;do
 &gt;&gt;not adhere to the same values when it does not suit them.  National
 &gt;&gt;sovereignty and territorial integrity have no sanctity.  And finally,
 &gt;&gt;secessionist movements, which often start with terrorist activity, will
 get
 &gt;&gt;greater encouragement.  One can only hope that good sense will prevail,
 &gt;&gt;hopefully sooner rather than later.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;Lt. General Satish Nambiar
 &gt;&gt;Director, USI, New Delhi

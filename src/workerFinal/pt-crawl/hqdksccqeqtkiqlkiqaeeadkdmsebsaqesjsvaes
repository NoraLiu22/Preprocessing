              <ul>
              <li>The player provides air at a pressure above that of the atmosphere 



                (technically, from less than a kilopascal (< 1kPa) to perhaps as much as ten or so kPa: from less than a 



                percent to about a tenth of an atmosphere). This pressure and the steady flow that results are the source 



                of power input to the instrument, but this is a source of continuous 



                power. In a useful analogy with electricity, it is like DC electrical 



                power. Sound is produced by an oscillating motion or air flow 



                (like AC electricity). 
              (We have a separate page on <a href="air-speed.html" target="_blank">air speed, air flow, pressure and power</a> in woodwind and brass instruments.)              </li><li>In the lip reed instruments, the lips act as a vibrating valve that modulates the air flow into the instrument: 



                technically we say that they form a control oscillator that, in 



                cooperation with the resonances in the air in the instrument, 



                produces an oscillating component of both flow and pressure: it converts some of the DC power of the breath into AC sound power. 
              </li><li>Once the air in the instrument is vibrating, some of the energy 



                is radiated as sound out of the bell. A much greater amount of 



                energy is lost in a sort of 'friction' (viscous and thermal loss) 



                with the wall. In a sustained note, both of these losses are replaced by 



                energy put in by the player. 
              </li><li>The column of air in the instrument vibrates much more easily 



                at some frequencies than at others (i.e. it resonates at certain 



                frequencies). These resonances largely determine the playing frequency 



                and thus the pitch. For a given configuration of the instrument, the player chooses which of these resonances will determine the pitch. Further, the player can change the resonance frequencies by changing the operating length 



                of the instrument by 



                inserting extra lengths of pipe using valves, or by changing the length of the slide in the case of 



                the trombone. 
			  </li></ul>Let us now look at these components in turn  and in detail.



  <p>  </p></td></tr></TABLE>

<ul>

        <a name="sound"></a> <h3>Sound</h3>



        First something about sound. If you put your finger gently on a loudspeaker 



        you will feel it vibrate – if it is playing a low note loudly you can 



        see it moving. (More about <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/HSCmotors.html#loudspeakers" target="_blank">loudspeakers</a>.) 



        When it moves forwards, it compresses the air next to it, which raises 



        its pressure. Some of this air flows outwards, compressing the next layer 



        of air. The disturbance in the air spreads out as a travelling sound wave. 



        Ultimately this sound wave causes a very tiny vibration in your eardrum – but 



        that's <a href="w.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/waves-sound/human-sound/index.html" target="_blank">another story</a>.



        <p>        </p><ul>



          <img src="graphics/travelling.gif" ALT=" " ALIGN=middle /> 
        </ul>



        <p>        </p><h3>Frequency and sound waves</h3>



        At any point in the air near the source of sound, the molecules are, on average, moving 



        backwards and forwards, and the air pressure varies up and down by very 



        small amounts. The number of vibrations per second is called the frequency 



        (f). It is measured in cycles per second or Hertz (Hz). The pitch of a 



        note is almost entirely determined by the frequency: high frequency for 



        high pitch and low for low. 440 vibrations per second (440 Hz) is heard 



        as the note A in the treble clef, a vibration of 220 Hz is heard as the 



        A one octave below, 110 Hz as the A one octave below that and so on. We 



        can hear sounds from about 15 Hz to 20 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). A contrabassoon 



        can play Bb0 at 29 Hz. When this note is played loudly, you may be able 



        to hear the individual pulses of high pressure emitted as the reed opens 



        and closes 29 times per second. Human hearing sensitivity varies strongly with frequency  but is greatest between 1 and 4 kHz - about two to four octaves above middle C (Check your <a href="hearing.html">hearing 



        sensitivity</a>). That is why piccolo players don't have to work as hard as 



        tuba players in order to be heard. To convert from notes to frequencies 



        and back again, see <a href="notes.html">notes</a>.

        <p>        </p><a name="lips"><h3>The lips control the air flow</h3>
        </a> 
    <p>Brass players can make musical sounds with just their lips, as you'll hear in the sound files below. This is one of the first things a brass player learns: you close your mouth, pull your lips back in a strange smile, and blow. The result may be anywhere between a low pitched 'raspberry' or a high pitched musical note, depending on the tension and the geometry of your lips (how hard you pull them backwards in that smile), how hard you blow and other parameters. (It's easier to play with an instrument connected, but you can play with only a mouthpiece, or even without that: the resonator is not strictly necessary.)        </p>
    <ul><audio controls> <source src="brass/lips.mp3" type="audio/wav">
   <a href="brass/lips.mp3"> <img src="../music/graphics/speaker.mp3.gif" alt="wav" /></a></audio> <a href="brass/lips.wav"><img src="graphics/speaker.wav.gif" width="54" height="25" border="0" alt="wav" /></a> &nbsp; 
      'Buzzing' with the lips alone, and varying the tension. 
    </ul>
        <p>How does that work? Here is a considerably simplified description. Lips are springy: if you form your embouchure then pull your top lip forward (horizontally) with your fingers and let it go, it will spring back to its original position. If you pull the top lip up (vertically), it will spring down. So lips are springy in (at least) two directions. Lips also have mass, and a mass and a spring together can oscillate. Lip vibrations are more complicated than the linear <a href="http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/oscillations.htm" target="_blank">mass-and-spring oscillator</a> that one finds in introductory physics books. (<font size=-1>Nevertheless, simple models with one degree of freedom show some of the important features in lip-bore interactions.</font>) First, let's think of two different oscillations here: the vertical and the horizontal motion, with their different springs. What happens here is a cycle of horizontal and vertical motion that converts the DC flow of air at high pressure out of your lungs into an oscillating air pressure and air current. (When an instrument is present, this leads to a <a href="http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/waves-sound/standing-waves/index.html" target="_blank">standing sound wave</a> in the bore of the instrument, and the fluctuating pressure in the mouthpiece can help move the lips, as we'll see below.) </p>
        <p>The simplified schematic shown below represents a cross section of the lips, viewed from the side. Consider state (1), with the lips closed. At this point, the air pressure in your mouth is (and has been) higher than that in the mouthpiece: this has accelerated the lips forwards, so in (1) they are moving forwards. A short time later (2), they are open and air flows out between the lips (2-3-4), as indicated by the arrow. The lips then close (4 to 1) and the cycle then repeats. </p>
        <ul><IMG SRC="brass/graphics/lipsalone.gif" ALT="cycle of lip vibration" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom />
        </ul>
                <p>The phase of the motion is important to the energetics of oscillation. The pressure in the mouth is always at least a little higher than in the mouthpiece (much higher when the lips are closed — see below). The pressure between the lips is approximately the same as that in the mouthpiece (though this depends on the downstream turbulence). This means that the pressure difference can do work on the lips around a cycle. The lips move forward (picture 1 to 2) while closed or only slightly open; they retract (3 to 4) while open. So the volume swept in the horizontal direction is larger going foward than back. Because the pressure between the lips is low, this means that the pressure drop across the lips can do positive work on the lips around a complete cycle. In <a href="publications/lipping.pdf">our measurements</a>, this 'sweeping work' done around one cycle is comparable with the maximum kinetic energy of the lips and so it can replace the energy lost in the lip collisions.</p>

        <ul><IMG SRC="brass/graphics/Fig6.png" ALT="graphs of Lip motion, pressures and flows" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom />
        <p>
        <font size=-1>On the main graphs, the numbers 1-6 correspond to numbered frames from the high speed video side and front views shown in the two bottom lines. The trombonist plays a relatively low note: Bb2. For reference, each graph shows the area of the lip aperture as a function of time. The top graph shows the mouth pressure, the mouthpiece pressure, and the Bernoulli term (&rho;v<sup>2</sup>/2, the pressure reduction due to the <a href="http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au//jw/work.htm#bernouilli" target="_blank">moving air</a> between the lips, where &rho; is the density of the air and v its speed). The large pulse of negative pressure in the mouthpiece (time 1) accelerates the lips forwards. The middle graph shows the total flow of air into the mouthpiece (dark continuous line) and the component of flow due to the sweeping motion of the lips (positive when the are moving forward into the mouthpiece). The bottom graph shows the forward or <em>x</em> motion of the lips, the vertical separation <em>z</em> between them and the fluctuating volume of lip inside the mouthpiece.</font> <font size=-1>See this <a href="reprints/lipping.pdf" target="_blank">scientific paper</a> for a more detailed explanation. </font>        </p>
    </ul>

    <p> The explanations above are simplified. We have mentioned the different phases of the motion of the lips (forward motion leads the verical motion). Also very important is the phase of the air flow (out of the mouth and into the instrument) and the phases of the pressure in the mouth and the mouthpiece. In normal playing, the flow out of the mouth is a little ahead in phase of the pressure in the mouthpiece (however, players can vary this relatively easily). We discuss these (and give extended versions of the figure above) in  <a href="reprints/lipping.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>. (<font size=-1>Another complication is that the channel between the lips may change shape during a vibration. In one reported mode of vibration the back (teeth side) of the lip channel has a bigger cross section than the front while the lips are opening and smaller while they are shutting. This can be modelled with two masses and two vertical springs in each lip, the masses vibrating with different phases.</font>)</p>
        <p><strong>Playing frequency and pitch. </strong>The more tension you apply to your lips (the harder you pull your 
          
          
          
          lips backwards in a smile), the more quickly they spring back 
          
          
          
          into position. If the whole cycle of vibration takes a time T (called the <b>period</b>), 
          
          
          
          then there are {(one&nbsp;second)/T} cycles in a second. So the <b>frequency</b> f, in cycles per second, is just f = 1/T. All else equal, high lip tension 
          
          
          
          gives high frequency and so high pitch. In the sound files above (play 
          
          
          
          them again), the lip tension is increased and decreased smoothly. Without the instrument, you can easily vary f smoothly.</p>
        <p>This frequency of the lip vibration is the fundamental frequency of the note. For a high trumpet note, the lips may vibrate at more than 1000 vibrations per second. This is fast, but remember that the muscles are not contracting at that rate:  the muscles in the brass player's lips exert almost constant tension, and it is the elastic and aerodynamic forces on the lips that produce the vibration. </p>
        <p> The film clip below was made using a transparent pipe played as a didjeridu, at a frequency of about 80&nbsp;Hz. 



          On the left you see a high speed video of the lips, on the right schlieren 



          images of the air jet from the lips. More details on our <a href="didjeridu.html">didjeridu

        <p> Adding (only) a mouthpiece changes the situation: the mouthpiece rim



          reduces the amount of the lips that move, and it allows the pressure 



          outside the lips to be a little different from atmospheric, especially at high frequency. We'll discuss 



          mouthpieces in detail later, but for now here is a sketch of the lips 



          and a horn mouthpiece. Many players position the mouthpiece asymmetrically, 



          so that it covers more of the upper lip than the lower lip, as is shown 



          here.
        More about lip position below.        </p><p>

        <P> <a name="pff"></a>        </p><h3>Playing softly and loudly</h3>



        This simple picture already allows us to explain something about how the 



        timbre changes when we go from playing softly to loudly. If we play softly, 



        and especially if we play a high note softly, the lips don't move fast 



        enough and don't have enough time to close completely. In this case we 



        observe approximately sinusoidal vibrations: the system is behaving almost like the linear 



        mass-and-spring oscillator of physics texts. This means that the fundamental 



        in the <a href="sound.spectrum.html">sound 



        spectrum</a> is strong, but that the higher harmonics are weak. This gives 



        rise to a mellow timbre. Playing loudly, the lips do close, and may close abruptly. This gives what physicists call clipping and strongly nonlinear 



        behaviour, which produce more high harmonics. As well as making the timbre 



        brighter, adding more harmonics makes the sound louder as well, because 



        the higher harmonics fall in the frequency range where our hearing is 



        most sensitive (See <a href="hearing.html">hearing 



        curves</a> for details).

ALT="spectra and spectrogram of a crescendo" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom />        </p><P> In this figure, the two upper figures are spectra that were taken 
          over the first and last 0.3 seconds of the sound file. The spectrogram 
          (lower figure) shows time on the x axis, frequency on the vertical axis, 
          and sound level (on a decibel scale) in false colour (blue is weak, 
          red is strong). In the spectra, note the harmonics, which appear as 
          equally spaced components (vertical lines). In the spectrogram, the 
          harmonics appear as horizontal lines. Note that the pitch doesn't change, 
          so the frequencies of the spectral lines are constant. However the power 



          of every harmonic increases with time, so the sound becomes louder. 



          The higher harmonics increase more than do the lower, which makes the 



          timbre 'brassier' or brighter, and also makes it louder. (To re-emphasise 



          our point about loudness: over this crescendo, the fundamental increases by only 8 dB, but the ninth and some higher harmonics &mdash; in the sensitive range of your ear &mdash; increase by more than 45 dB.)
        </p><p>





An interesting point about loudness in brass instruments. In acoustics, we are usually interested in cases in which the amplitude of the sound pressure wave is only a tiny fraction of atmospheric pressure. Consequently, the medium (air) behaves linearly for such waves, which simplifies the mathematics considerably. For example, a sound of 120 dB is painfully loud, but it corresponds to a sound pressure of only 20 Pa, or 0.0002 atmospheres. At the position where the viola player is complaining about the pain in her ears from the trumpets behind her, the sound level is probably (hopefully!) still below 120 dB.</p>
    <p>However, inside the narrow bore of the instrument, the sound pressure is much higher, for two reasons. First, it is concentrated in a small cross sectional area, instead of spread out over a much larger area outside the instrument. Second, most of the sound inside the instrument is reflected at the ends to provide the standing waves we have discussed above. So the pressure inside a brass instrument can be a substantial fraction of atmospheric pressure, and so the medium can behave in a non-linear way. This can produce a <b>shock wave</b> in the instrument, which results not only in the conversion of power from low frequency to high, but also in the production of frequencies that are not harmonic. This phenomenon was analysed formally by Mico Hirschberg and colleagues (1996, JASA, 99, 1754-58). It is stronger in instruments with long, narrow sections of bore (trumpets and trombones) than in others (flugelhorn or  tuba). Some scientists associate the onset of the shock wave with what some brass players refer to as cuivr&eacute; or the sizzle point.
      
      (Here is a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13574197" target="_blank">video</a> showing the emergence of the shock wave.)
</p><p> While talking about decibels, we should mention that <a href="sound.spectrum.html">spectra</a> 



        are usually shown on a decibel scale. (See <a href="dB.html">What 



          is a decibel?</a>) This means that one notices easily on the spectrum 



          a harmonic that is say 20 dB weaker than the fundamental, even though 



          it has 10 times less pressure and 100 times less power. What is important 



          is that your ear notices it too, because of the frequency dependence 



          referred to above. However, it is much more difficult to notice the 



          presence of harmonics if you look at the waveform: for this reason, 



          an oscilloscope is only of limited use.
    </p><p> <a name="pipe"></a> </p>
    <h3>The brass instrument is a 'closed' pipe</h3>



        The instrument is open at the far end or bell. But it is (almost) closed 



        at the other end. For a sound wave, the tiny aperture between the lips – which 



        is on average a much smaller cross section than the bore of the instrument – is 



        enough to cause a reflection approximately like that from a completely closed 



        end.



        (At an open end, the flow is large but the pressure is small. At a closed end, the pressure is large and the flow is small.) The difference between closed and open pipes is explained in <a href="http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/flutes.v.clarinets.html">Open 



          vs closed pipes</a>, which has more explanation of the animation below.

        <p> The shape of the pipe varies widely among instruments. For the modern 



          instruments, there is a section of tubing with constant diameter (this 



          includes the slide of the trombone and the section containing the valves 



          of other instruments). On the upstream end is a mouthpiece, which has 



          a little cup-shaped section and a constriction. At the other is a flaring section ending in a bell (the flare is longer in a tuba than in a trombone, and longer in a flugel horn than in a trumpet). In the diagram below, the vertical 



          and horizontal scales are different: the ratio of width to length has 



  been greatly exaggerated to show the variation in diameter more clearly.</p></ul>

          The older lip reed instruments had rather simpler shapes. The cornetto 



          or cornett is a wooden instrument, about the length of a tenor recorder 



          and having similar finger holes, but is played with an embouchure much 



          like that of a piccolo trumpet. The cornetto has a nearly conical bore. 



          So too do the serpent (photo at right) and the ophicleide. Going back 



          to the earliest lip reed instruments we find very roughly conical bores 



          in conch shells and animal horns and the nearly cylindrical or slightly 



          tapered bores in the didjeridu or yidaki. The didjeridu may seem like 



          the simplest lip reed instrument, but its acoustics and sounds are 



          among the most interesting, because of the relatively strong coupling 



          among the player's larynx, vocal tract and lips and the waves in the bore. See <a href="didjeridu.html">Didjeridu 



          Acoustics</a> for details.



          <p> The shapes whose acoustical properties are easiest to understand are 



          the simple conical bore (rather like the cornetto) or the cylinder (rather 



          like the didjeridu). We devote a whole page to the acoustics and harmonics 



          of <a href="http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/pipes.html">cylindrical 



          and conical bores, open and closed</a> because the oboe, saxophone and 



          bassoon are closed, approximately conical bores, the clarinet is nearly 



          a closed cylindrical bore and the flute is well approximated as an open 



          cylinder. If you are interested in what finger holes do on the older 



          lip reeds, go to the section on <a href="saxacoustics.html#toneholes">tone 



          holes</a> on saxophones, because a saxophone can be considered approximately 



          as just an ophicleide with a clarinet mouthpiece.        </p><p> In fact, we shall see that several of the resonances (often called 'harmonics' by brass players) of the modern 



          brass instruments are not very different from those of a cone. Exceptions 



          are the fundamental or pedal note, and the very highest notes. To understand 



          why, we shall 'build up' a brass instrument, starting with a simple 



          piece of pipe.

        Most of the bore of trumpet, trombone and horn is cylindrical, with a flare and bell at one end and a mouthpiece at the other. So we'll begin with a simple, cylindrical pipe and add a flare and bell, then a mouthpiece and see what they do. So, to begin, here are the sounds 



        we can make playing just a cylindrical piece of PVC pipe:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounding the resonances of a pipe.
        </ul>
        <p> In these cases, the lips and the pipe were in a sense cooperating 



          to form the vibration that gives rise to the sound. The lips may have 



          their own natural vibrating frequency, which the player can control 



          with lip tension. The pipe has also its own resonances and natural frequencies, which 



          are due to standing waves. We have a page devoted to <a href="pipes.html">pipes 



          and harmonics</a>, and another on <a href="strings.html">standing 



          waves</a>. We briefly review the results here.        </p>
        <p> At the far end, the pipe is open to the air, so the pressure there 



          must be close to atmospheric at all times: in other words, the varying 



          part of the pressure (what we call the <b>acoustic pressure</b>) is 



          relatively small. We call this a <b>pressure node</b>. At the other 



          end, the pipe is sealed from the atmosphere by the player's lips, and 



          the pressure can vary maximally as the lips open (admitting a pulse of high pressure air from the mouth) and close: at this end 



          we have a pressure <b>antinode</b>. If we look for the simple waves 



          that satisfy these constraints – maximum at the mouthpiece, minimum 



          at the bell – we obtain the set shown in continuous lines below. </p><p> 
        </p><p><center>



          <IMG SRC="brass/graphics/pipeharmonics.gif" 



ALT="sketch of resonances in a cylindrical pipe" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom />
          </center>
        </p><P> These frequencies are in the ratio 1:3:5:7 etc. They constitute the 



          <b>odd</b> members of the harmonic series, and they are what we heard 



          in the sound file <a href="brassacoustics.html#harmonics">above</a>. 



          The even harmonics (dashed in the figure) don't fit the conditions in 



          a closed, cylindrical pipe because they have a node at the mouthpiece. 



          (More detail in <a href="http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/flutes.v.clarinets.html">Open 



          vs closed pipes</a>.)
        </p><p> (Before we go further, we should note that the resonances of a simple 



          pipe are only exactly harmonic if the pipe is very thin. As the pipe 



          diameter increases, the higher resonances are successively flatter. 



          This is quite noticeable in a cylindrical didjeridu.)
        </p><p> <a name="bells"></a> </p><h3>The effects of the bell.</h3>



        Now there are (at least) two problems with a cylindrical pipe like this: 



        first, the low notes are too far apart to be musically useful. Second, it's 



        not loud enough (and what's a brass instrument for, eh?). Adding a flare 



        and a bell reduces both of these problems. The flared section of the bore 



        in many instruments is almost conical. First let's look at what this 



        does to the spacing of the frequencies. In the page about <a href="pipes.html">pipes 



        and harmonics</a>, we saw that closed <b>conical pipes</b> have resonances 



        whose frequencies are both higher and more closely spaced than those of 



        a closed <b>cylindrical pipe</b> of the same length. So one can think of replacing a cylindrical section with a conical 



        or flared section of the pipe as raising the frequencies of the standing 



        waves, and raising the frequencies of the low pitched resonances most 



        of all. The bell also contributes to this effect: in the rapidly flaring 



        bell, the long waves (with the low pitches) could be said to be 'least able to follow' the 



        curve of the bell and so are effectively reflected earlier than are the 



        shorter waves. (This is because their wavelengths are very much longer 



        than the radius of curvature of the bell.) One might say therefore that 



        the long waves 'see' an effectively shorter pipe.



        <p> The short waves, on the other hand, are better able to travel into 



          the rapidly widening bell. The further they go into the bell, the easier 



          it is for them to escape into the outside air. So the higher frequency 



          waves are more efficiently radiated as sound outside the instrument. 



          This is a characteristic of the sound of brass instruments: the 



          bell radiates several of the higher harmonics well. This also makes brass instruments loud, because these 



          strongly radiated moderately high frequencies begin to fall into the range where 



          our ears are most sensitive. To hear the effect of the flare and bell, 



          listen to the sound files below. Notice how the bell raises the pitches 



          of the first three resonances, and also brings them closer together. We'll discuss that in detail <a href="#pedal">below</a>. We still haven't added a mouthpiece, but notice that the bell has made it sound more like a brass instrument.       </p><p>

        Good radiation of high frequencies has a disadvantage, however, as we shall see shortly:
	high transmission means low reflection and low reflection means weaker standing 
	waves, weaker resonances and more flexible notes in the high range. (The mouthpiece has an even stronger effect.) One final point about 
        bells: they make the high frequency radiation from brass instruments rather 
        directional. Unlike most instruments, a brass instrument is substantially 
        louder if it is pointing at you. Just ask the violists or bassoonists in an orchestra, 
        who usually sit in front of them!<p>
			 <b>The bell also works in the other direction</b>. The bell has another interesting effect: 
            the pressure of waves coming from outside the instrument can be considerably increased as they enter the instrument through the bell. (It <a href="musFAQ.html#horns">works in both directions</a>, like an ear trumpet and a gramophone horn.) A practical consequence is that timpani strokes can disrupt playing if the horns are seated too close to the timpani. <a href="timpani-horn/timpani-horn.html" target="_blank">More details about this effect.</a></p>
<p> Finally, let's add a mouthpiece. Now we can play the normal harmonic 



          series (see <a href="strings.html">standing 



          waves</a> to revise about harmonics), including the notes used for bugle 



          calls. We'll see why in the next section.        </p><p>

          </ul>
       








        The mouthpieces of brass instruments have a rounded section that fits 



        comfortably against the lips, an enclosed volume of air, a narrow constriction, 



        and a taper that widens out to meet the bore of the body of the instrument. 



        The enclosed volume may be approximately conical, as in many horn mouthpieces 



        (left), or cup shaped, as in most other brass instruments (right).

ALT="sketch of brass mouthpieces" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom />
        </ul>



        <p> When placed against the player's lips, the enclosed volume is sealed 



          at one end by the lips, and has the constricted part of the pipe at 



          the other end. You might imagine it as a tiny bottle, with your lips 



          at the base of the bottle, and the constriction representing the neck 



          of the bottle. Now, just as the bottle has a resonance that you can 



          excite by blowing over the top, the mouthpiece has a resonance that 



          you can excite by slapping the wide end to close against the palm of your hand. 



          When shopping for mouthpieces, brass players sometimes do this to compare what they call the '<strong>pop tone</strong>'. It is much easier to hear the pitch if you compare two: say a trumpet and a trombone mouthpiece. As you might expect, the larger the volume (all else equal), the lower the pitch of the pop tone. Reducing the diameter of the constriction also lowers the pop tone. This is an example of a <a href="Helmholtz.html">Helmholtz resonator</a>, whose frequency depends on the enclosed volume and the geometry of the constriction. THis resonance is changed when it is installed on the instrument, but it has an important effect on the resonances and, as we shall see, on the impedance spectrum.       </p>

It is much easier to hear the pitch if you compare two: say a trumpet and a trombone mouthpiece. As you might expect, the larger the volume (all else equal), the lower the pitch of the pop tone. Reducing the diameter of the constriction also lowers the pop tone. This is an example of a <a href="Helmholtz.html">Helmholtz resonator</a>, whose frequency depends on the enclosed volume and the geometry of the constriction. THis resonance is changed when it is installed on the instrument, but it has an important effect on the resonances and, as we shall see, on the impedance spectrum.       </p>
        <p>The volume of the air in the mouthpiece depends a little on how far your lips protrude into it, and that varies among people. If your lips protrude further in, then it's tempting to suggest that you should try a larger volume mouthpiece, and <i>vice versa</i>. However, I know of no formal study of this.</p>
        <p> The mouthpiece does a few things. First, it allows you to connect 



          the pipe to a comfortably large section of lips. Then there are the 



          acoustic effects of the enclosed volume and constriction. One effect 



          is to lower the frequency of the very highest resonances (roughly speaking: 



          those above the pop tone). So in this regard it opposes the effect of 



          the flare and bell, which tend to raise all the resonances. Another 



          is to strengthen some of the resonances. We'll return to this when 



          we discuss the <a href="#spectrum">spectrum of brass instruments</a>. 



          But first, let's look at the combined effect of the mouthpiece, pipe, 



       flare and bell.       </p></ul>

            <TD VALIGN=top> <ul><h3>Resonances and pedal notes.</h3>



              In this diagram we show at left the resonances of a simple cylindrical 



              pipe, like a very narrow didjeridu. It is 130 cm long, and its lowest 



              note is C2. As a closed, cylindrical pipe, its resonances are the 



              odd harmonics of its fundamental frequency F (careful: here F is 



              a symbol for frequency, not the note above E). We now add a mouthpiece 



              at one end, and at the other we replace a long section of cylindrical 



              pipe with a flare and a bell, to obtain a bore much like that of 



              a C trumpet. The resonances all rise in frequency and pitch (flare 



              and bell effect), although the upper resonances rise proportionately 



              less (flare, bell and mouthpiece effects together).



              <p> The shape of the trumpet is so designed so that the second and 



                all higher resonances have risen so that they have frequencies 



                in the ratios 2:3:4:5 etc. In other words, the resonances are 



                <b>a complete harmonic series, except for the fundamental</b>. The lowest resonance of the trumpet is not a member of this series. 



                Further, it is weak and rather difficult to play (try playing a note below the bass clef on a Bb trumpet). Instead, however, 



                good players can play the <b>pedal note</b>, whose fundamental 



                frequency does not correspond to a resonance of the instrument! 



                Further, the spectrum of a pedal note has hardly any power at 



                the fundamental frequency.



              (We show this quantitatively below in <a href="#acousticimpedance">Frequency response and acoustic impedance</a>.)              </p><p> What happens in the pedal note is that the higher resonances (2f, 3f, 4f 



                etc) combine to help the lips establish a nonlinear vibration 



                at the frequency of the missing fundamental f. (<font size=-1>Technically, this 



                is the process that physicists and engineers call mode locking, and is an effect characteristic of nonlinear oscillators. When oscillations at two frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> 
                are input to an non-linear system, they produce what we call sum 
                and difference terms: vibration components with a range of frequencies 
                including f<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;f<sub>2</sub> and f<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;f<sub>2</sub>. 



                In the pedal note vibration, there are lots of vibration components whose difference is f: any two adjacent resonances have that difference.</font>)

          <p><b>Twe little exercises</b>. The frequency equals the wave speed divided 



        by the wavelength (we write f = c/&lambda;), so the 



        longest wave corresponds to the lowest note on the instrument. (See <a href="notes.html">standard 



        note names</a>, and remember that some brass are transposing instruments, 



        so that the written C4 is actually Bb3 for a trumpet in Bb.) You might want to measure the length 



        of tubing in your instrument (not including the little tubes of the valves 



        for the moment), take v = 345 m/s for sound in warm, moist air, and calculate 



        the expected frequencies of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th resonances. Do you get 



        a better answer if you pretend it is a cylinder or a cone? (To convert 



        notes to frequency, see <a href="notes.html">notes</a>.) For instance, with no valves depressed on a trumpet, you can play 



          the lowest note: (written) C4. You may also be able to play the pedal 



          note at (written) C3 (but remember that there is no resonance at this frequency).
        (If you're a trombonist, shift these instructions down an octave.)        </p>
          <p>If you have a trombone, find a note (like D4, two spaces above the bass clef) that you can play with the slide in two different positions (first and fourth for this case). Using 345 m/s for the speed of sound, calculate the wavelength (the nominal frequency of an equally tempered for D4 is 294 Hz.) Measure the distance between these two positions, calculate the change in the instrument length and compare with a wavelength. Is this what you would expect for a cylindrical tube?</p>

        Depending on the shape of the bell, the resonances of a brass instrument 



        can go up to rather high frequencies. Provided the instrument is well 



        designed, their playing frequencies will be close to those of a complete 



        harmonic series (provided we accept the <a href="#pedal">pedal note</a> 



        with its nonexistent fundamental). Let's write the first twelve notes 



        in the series for a C trumpet. This series will be familiar to almost 



        any player in a brass band, where the music is transposed so that it reads 



        as though you were playing a C trumpet, in the treble clef, whether you 



        are playing Eb cornet or BBb tuba.

    </TABLE>



        <ul>In the sound file above, there are several things to notice, which we'll 



        look at in turn:



        <ul>



          <li>The pitch difference between harmonics becomes smaller as we go 



            up.          </li><li>Some harmonics are 'out of tune', meaning that they don't lie close 



            to notes on the familiar, equal-tempered scale. Note the symbol for 



            A and F half sharp: the seventh and eleventh harmonics lie roughly midway between 



            adjacent notes on the piano. 
          </li><li>The highest resonances are weak and easy to bend.</li></ul>






        <a name="intervals"></a> <h4>Intervals in the natural harmonic series.</h4>



        The decreasing sizes of the musical intervals arise because our sense of pitch depends geometrically 



        or logarithmically on the frequency. In this example, the frequency <i>difference</i> 



        between each pair of notes is 131&nbsp;Hz, but this produces a smaller 



        <i>proportional difference</i> as we ascend. The fundamental is 131&nbsp;Hz: 



        adding 131&nbsp;Hz to that doubles the frequency (262&nbsp;Hz). Doubling the frequency 



        is what we call an octave. The fourth harmonic is two octaves higher (double again: 524&nbsp;Hz). 



        Adding 131&nbsp;Hz to 524 Hz only increases it by 25%, which we call a major third. 



        Starting at the eighth harmonic, it is possible to play scales using the high harmonics, without 



        the use of valves or slides, but subject however to considerable adjustment of the 



        intonation.



        <p> The natural trumpet and natural horn use this. The natural or 



          baroque trumpet came in a variety of tunings, but was usually rather 



          longer than the modern trumpet. This transposes the harmonic series 



          down, which brings the high harmonics into a more easily playable 



          range. Here is Paul Plunkett, professor of trumpet at the Conservatorium 



          of Winterthur, playing the Prince of Denmark March on a baroque trumpet 



          in D, whose harmonic series we see here, followed by the first two bars

       <ul> All done with the lips: there are no valves on a baroque trumpet. (This 



        instrument plays in the baroque tuning of A = 415 Hz, so the pedal note 



        or fundamental is, in modern tuning, Db below the bass clef, so the series 



        is nearly an octave lower than that of the C trumpet discussed above.



        <p> <a name="intonation"></a> </p><h4>Intonation in the natural harmonic series.</h4>



        Some of the pairs of harmonics in the series produce natural harmonies 



        (technically the Pythagorean consonances). The octave (1st to 2nd harmonic) 



        is the most obvious example. The interval between the 2nd and 3rd harmonics 



        has the frequency ratio 3:2, which is called a perfect fifth: C to G in 



        our example. Continuing up the series we get 4:3 (a perfect fourth: G 



        to C), 5:4 (a just major third: C to E) and 6:5 (a just minor third: E 



        to G). Musicians play in scales with a variety of different internal tunings. 



        Usually, these scales have notes that produce intervals very close to 



        perfect fifths and fourths, and reasonably close to the just thirds. 



        The equal tempered scale is such a tuning, but the agreement is only approximate. 



        See <a href="notes.html">notes</a> and 



        check it out.



        <p> Many of the intervals between pairs of the higher harmonics are, shall 



          we say, less usual harmonies. In our example, the seventh lies about 



          half way between A and A# (note the half sharp symbol on this and the 



          preceding graphic) in the equal tempered scale. Similarly, the eleventh 



          harmonic is approximately a half sharp fourth on the scale. On baroque 



          trumpets and horns, the player adjusts the intonation to bring these 



          'out of tune' notes into more familiar scales, as Paul Plunkett does 



          in the example above.        </p><ul> <font size=-1>Another way to deal with this is to get used to it. One midsummer's  night, in a little village in the French alps, a natural horn ensemble had gathered for the <i>f&ecirc;te de la musique</i>. Their scales and chords had half-sharpened fourths and sixths. Very strange &ndash; at first. However, after they had played for an hour or so, the natural harmonies on these natural horns started to sound pretty natural to me. Or perhaps it was the wine. Anyhow, such music is not common, but still alive. Benjamin Britten, in the opening  and closing passages of his 'Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings', asks the player of the modern horn to forego the use of valves and to play using justthe natural harmonics.</font>

        <p> <a name="high"></a> </p><h4>Weakness of the high harmonics.</h4>



        We heard in the sound file <a href="#natural">above</a> that the notes 



        became less clear, less stable in pitch and less brassy as we went into 



        the extreme high range. Part of this is explained by one of the <a href="#bells">effects 



        of the bell</a> discussed previously: the bell radiates the high frequency 



        (short wavelength) waves so well that we get relatively little reflection. 



        This contributes to the weakening the resonances as we ascend the altissimo region. 



        Of course no reflection would give no standing wave at all, and that happens 



        when the wavelength becomes comparable with the radius of curvature of 



        the bell. In this dangerously high range, the trumpet acts just like a 



        megaphone for the player's lips. (Technically: the bell is a transformer 



        of <a href="z.html">acoustic impedance</a>.) 



        Let's hear that in these sound files.

          of the high resonances.
        </ul>



        <a name="together"></a> <h3>How the embouchure and bore work together.</h3>



        We saw above that a modern brass instrument has about a dozen resonances, 



        of which all but the lowest are approximately in the ratios of the simple 



        harmonics, 2:3:4:5. (See under <a href="#natural">natural horn</a>.) We'll 



        see more about this below under <a href="#acousticimpedance">frequency 



        response</a>. The player's lips also have their own resonant frequency 



        and the player can play a musical note without an instrument, and change 



        that note by changing the lip tension and other embouchure effects. (See under <a href="#lips">lips</a>.)



        <p> However, the resonances of the bore are, for low frequencies at least, 



          narrower in frequency and 'stronger' than those of the lips: this allows 



          the resonances of the bore to 'take control'. To oversimplify somewhat, 



          a lip reed instrument <i>usually</i> plays very close to a strong bore resonance; which one is determined largely by the lips. (If you are interested, we have a technical paper on the physics of <a href="reprints/lipping.pdf" target="_blank">lip mechanics</a>.)       </p>
        <p> The 'taking control' is never complete, however: it is always a compromise. 



          So the player can adjust the pitch of a note by changing lip tension, 



          even if the frequency of the resonance of the instrument does not change. 



          Trombonists may play vibrato by moving the slide slightly, but players 



          of other brass instruments do it by 'lipping' or rocking the instrument.        </p><p> 
        </p><ul>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'lipping' notes up and down with lip tension.
        </ul>



        <p> Finally, we should mention here that the player's lips actually interact 



          with <b>two</b> resonators: those of the bore of the instrument, and 



          those of the vocal tract. The instrument's resonances are usually much 'stronger' 



          than those of the tract, but the latter are not negligible. This is 



          an area of great interest to us, and we studied it first on the 



          <a href="didjeridu.html">didjeridu</a>, where 



          it is most important. We have also studied it on trombone and trumpet, and have 



          published some of the results: see <a href="#tract">below</a>.        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <a name="spectrum"></a> </p><h3>Spectra of brass instruments.</h3>



        When the player and instrument are playing a particular note, the lips 



        are vibrating at one particular frequency. But, especially if the vibration 



        is large, as it is when playing loudly, it generates harmonics in the 



        sound (see <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/sound.spectrum.html">What 



        is a sound spectrum?</a>). These harmonics in the lip vibration set up, 



        and are usually in turn reinforced by, standing waves, because the instrument 



        is designed to produce standing waves with harmonic frequency ratios. 



        Let's listen to a chromatic scale played on a modern Bb trumpet, and look 



        at the spectra.



        <p>        </p><ul>

          <p> <IMG SRC="brass/graphics/trumpet.jpg" ALT="trumpet spectra" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom />        </p></ul>
 <P> The three individual spectra are for the lowest note played herre (written 
C4 = sounding Bb3), and the notes one and two octaves higher. The fourth 
spectrum is the average over time for the whole scale. Why do the spectra 
have their characteristic shapes?        </p>
 <p> In all wind instruments, the higher frequency harmonics are relatively 
inefficient because they lose energy in viscous and thermal losses – a sort of friction 



          with the walls, so this explains (in part) the shape at high frequencies. 



          However, for brass instruments, the radiated power sometimes increases 



          with frequency over the low part of the range, as here. This means that 



          one tends to get maximum radiation at a moderately high frequency (typically 



          around several hundred Hz, although it has a different value in each 



          lip reed instrument), and less power at lower and higher frequencies. Further, the 



          enclosed air in the mouthpiece and the constriction beyond it also tend 



          to drive the lips most efficiently near this frequency, further contributing 



          to the peak.
        (We should add that this is complicated by the fact that the standing wave in the bore also affects the lip vibration, so a strong standing wave in the bore could affect the component of the lip motion at that frequency. I don't know of a formal study of this.)</p><p> Remember, however, that the spectrum depends strongly on how loudly 



          you play. The larger the vibration of the lips, the more non-linear 



          the vibration, so the more strong high harmonics present in the sound. 



          (See <a href="#pff">Playing softly and loudly</a> above.) Indeed, if 



          a trombone plays very loudly, the acoustic pressure in that relatively 



          narrow pipe ceases to be tiny in comparison with atmospheric pressure. 



          When this happens, the linear wave equation for air no longer applies, 



          and the spectrum itself begins to contain non-harmonic elements. You'll

        </p><p> One simple way of changing the spectrum of a brass instrument is to 



          modify the performance of the bell with a mute, which is our next topic.
        </p><p> <a name="mutes"></a> </p><h3>Mutes.</h3>



        We saw above some of the <a href="#bells">effects of the bell</a>: apart 



        from its effect on tuning, it radiates the high harmonics well and it 



        is these strong, high harmonics in the output sound that make brass instruments 



        sound 'brassy'. When we put a mute in the bell, we reduce this radiating 



        effectiveness for most frequencies, and so we make the overall timbre 



        less brassy. However, there is usually a band of frequencies that the 



        mute transmits well, giving rise to what we call a formant in the output 



        sound – a broad band of strong harmonics. For trumpet and cornet mutes, 



        standard mutes produce strong formants at various frequencies in the 1-3 



        kHz range. The human voice also has formants in a similar range, and we 



        are very good at detecting these because this is how we recognise speech 



        (see <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/PHYSICS_!/SPEECH_HELIUM/speech.html">Introduction 



        to the physics of speech</a> for details). So the mute makes the instrument 



        softer, but in a very real sense it also changes the instrument's voice.

       <ul> Indeed, when we change from one vowel to another in speech, e.g. singing 



        ooo-aaa, we change the formants (in the ooo-aaa case, going from nearly 



        closed mouth to wide open mouth raises the frequency of the first formant 



        greatly). When you move your hand over the end of an open mute, you are 



        changing the frequency of the instrument's formant, and so removing your 



        hand from over such a mute can sound a little like ooo-aaa, ooo-aaa, which 



        (say it quickly) is probably the origin of the name wah-wah.



        <p> Almost anything that occludes a substantial fraction of the bell will 



          act as a mute. The real difficulty in designing a mute is to arrange 



          the reflections at the bell so that, even though the resonances are shifted, the tuning of the playing frequencies is little affected. (There's a paper including this subtle problem in <a href="https://acousticstoday.org/2021/" target="_blank">this magazine</a>.) One 



          exception is the hand stopping of the french horn. In this case, not 



          only is the timbre changed, but the pitch may be altered by about a semitone or so.



        <a name="valves"></a> </p><h3>Valves and slides.</h3>



        Using the harmonics of the natural horn posed several problems to the 



        clarino trumpeters of Bach's time. Remember, the bore is long so that 



        the high harmonics are brought close enough to approximate a scale in 



        the comfortable trumpet range. First, it is not easy to select the correct 



        harmonic with lip tension when they are so close together. Second, they 



        have to be 'lipped' into correct pitch (see <a href="#natural">natural 



        trumpet and horn</a> above). Third, it still doesn't give you a chromatic 



        scale. To play in another key, the clarino trumpeters changed the lengths 



        of their instruments (putting in a crook of different length), and then 



        had to pitch a whole new series of harmonics. No wonder these musicians 



        were paid extra!



        <p> The trombone of course solves this problem by having a continually 



          variable length using the <b>slide</b>. The other brass instruments 



          use rotary or piston <b>valves</b>.        </p><p> <IMG SRC="brass/graphics/piston.gif"

         On most brass instruments, the 'second' valve, the one operated by the 



        middle finger, lowers the pitch by a semitone. The 'first' valve, operated 



        by the index finger, lowers the pitch by a tone, the 'second' valve', 



        operated by the middle finger, lowers the pitch by one semitone and the 



        'third' valve, operated by the ring finger, lowers the pitch by a three 



        semitones. Thus with three valves one can <i>approximately</i> fill 



        the chromatic notes between the third harmonic (a written G4 on a trumpet) 



        and the second harmonic (a written C4), as shown in this fingering chart for a descending chromatic passage: OOO, OXO, XOO, XXO, OXX, XOX, XXX. For the higher harmonics, we do not need to lower the pitch 



        so far, but the principle is the same. We can show that this scheme works 



        (at least approximately) with a chromatic scale on a modern trumpet.

        Slides have the advantage/disadvantage that the player's ear is required 



        to help him/her find the position to play the correct pitch. Valves produce 



        a different intonation problem, which we introduce with a numerical example.



        <p> <b>How long should the second valve pipe be?</b> To make the calculation 



          simple, let's imagine that we are designing valves to make a narrow 



          bore, chromatic didjeridu (ie we are going to add valves to a simple 



          cylindrical pipe), whose natural length is 100.0&nbsp;cm. If the second 



          valve lowers the pitch of the natural pipe by an equal tempered semitone, 



          then it must decrease the frequency by 5.9% and thus increase the effective length 



          of the instrument by 5.9&nbsp;cm. So the difference in frequency between 



          &minus;&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&minus; and &minus;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&minus; is now 5.9%.        </p><p> However, if we are to use the fingering scheme above, we also want 



          the second valve to lower the pitch from 5 to 6 semitones below the 



          natural frequency. Suppose that the first and third valves do lower 



          it by 5 equal tempered, in other words they decrease the pitch by 33.5% 



          and so must together add a length of 33.5 cm. So fingering 1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3 



          has pipe of length 133.5&nbsp;cm. If we add our 5.9&nbsp;cm, we increase 



          this to 139.4&nbsp;cm. This is an increase of 5.9&nbsp;cm/133.5&nbsp;cm, 



          which is only 4.4%, which is only three quarters of an equal tempered 



          semitone. The standard way to fix this problem is to use a slide. The 



          problem is worst when the third valve is used, so many trumpets have 



          a slide on the added pipe for this valve that allows the player to increase 



          the length to solve problems such the one we have just discussed. On 



          the larger instruments, this would require a lot of work for the finger 



          operating that slide, so one or more extra valves is added.

        We have already mentioned the oldest lip reed instruments: the conch shell, 



        the animal horn and the didjeridu. We have also mentioned the instruments 



        with tone holes: the cornetto and serpent, in which the holes are covered 



        by the fingers, and the keyed bugle and ophicleide, in which keys are 



        used to cover the holes, in the same way as is done for woodwinds. Here we compare just the orchestral brass.

        <p> <b>Scaling up</b>. The Italian for trumpet is <i>tromba</i>, and the suffix for 'big' is <i>-one</i>. So a <i>trombone</i> is a etymologically a big trumpet. We have seen that the method of changing the length is different for the two but, apart from that, they are not very different from being scale models, at least in the acoustical sense. The tenor 



          trombone is twice as long as the Bb trumpet (though less than



          twice the cross sectional area).        </p><p> This scaling allows us to do an interesting demonstration. In the 



          first pair of sound files, we hear the Prince of Denmark march played 



          again by Paul Plunkett. So that we do not get the acoustical clues from 



          the slide, he is playing it as though it were a very low pitched baroque 



          trumpet: he plays using the high harmonics and does not use the slide. 



          (He also plays slowly, so that we can later increase the playback speed.)

        The next sound files have the same recording, but played back at twice

        from a trumpet. The modern Bb trumpet is half as long as a tenor trombone. 



        Here Paul plays the same tune on a modern trumpet (again, no valves: starting 



        on the 8th harmonic and just using the lips). Listen to this and decide

        <b>Different bore shapes</b>. The trumpet, trombone and french horn have relatively long lengths of narrow cylindrical pipe, and a relatively short 
flared section. Another family of brass instruments have much longer flares   and shorter cylindrical pipes. These include the bugle, the cornet, the   euphonium and the tuba.


<a name="acousticimpedance"></a> <h3>Frequency response and acoustic impedance.</h3>
 <p>Acousticians characterise many of the properties of musical instruments by their <a href="z.html">acoustic impedance spectrum</a>. This is a measure of how much sound pressure is generated by a sound wave of a given frequency at the mouthpiece of the instrument. For a brass instrument, the lips require a strong pressure signal to help the lips vibrate, so brass instruments tend to play notes near the peaks in the graph of acoustic impedance as a function of frequency. The graph below (measured by Jer Ming Chen, a PhD student in our lab) shows such a graph for a bass trombone, with the slide in and the trigger not depressed. The lowest normal note for this position is Bb2 at about 116&nbsp;Hz &ndash; the second peak on the graph. </p>
<ul>

ALT="measured impedance spectrum for a bass trombone on Bb2" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom /></a></ul>
		
		<p>This graph shows several of the features discussed above. Of the first several resonances, all but the first form a nearly harmonic series – they are nearly equally spaced in frequency. The notes that they play are labelled on the graph. (The first is far too flat, as explained above in <a href="#pedal">Resonances and pedal notes</a>, and is difficult to play. It does not correspond to the pedal note, which is played at about Bb1, half the frequency of the second peak and indicated by a dotted line.) Again, the seventh harmonic corresponds to a note absent in standard Western scales, hence the half sharp symbol. Note too that the resonances become successively weaker at high frequency. This is partly because the bell effectively radiates high frequencies rather than reflecting them, but a larger effect is due to the frequency response of the mouthpiece as discussed above. The resonances disappear altogether at high frequency, and the trombone begins to function as a megaphone, rather than a resonator, above about 700 or 800 Hz.</p>
		<p>
							The way in which these measurements were made is given in this <a href="https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/reprints/lipping.pdf">paper</a>. More recent impedance measurements of Z(f) by Henri Boutin are available here: <a href="https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/brass/ZTbn_dry_26_3degC.xls" download>Download file</a> and <a href="https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/brass/ZTbn_Dry_26_3degC.pdf">graph</a>.</p>
<a name="comparison"></a> <h3>Comparisons of different instruments </h3>
		
        <p>Below, we compare the impedance curves for a Bb bass trombone (first position, valve not depressed), a Bb trumpet (no valves depressed) and a horn in the open Bb and F states (no finger valves depressed). The trumpet is shown on a frequency scale that is twice that of all the others. This facilitates comparison with the trombone, and shows that the trumpet is rather like a one-half scale model of the trombone. (Etymologically, the reverse is true: trombone means big trumpet.) The narrower bore and especially the narrower mouthpiece constriction in the trumpet and horn give them, overall, higher values of impedance than those of the trombone. (<font size=-1>These impedance spectra were made by Jer Ming Chen, a student in our lab, using a technique described in <a href="reprints/DickensSmithWolfe.pdf" target="_blank">this scientific paper</a>.

<ul>
		 <p>The third graph shows Z(f) for a horn playing open Bb. As with the trombone and trumpet, the bell radiates high frequencies well, rather than reflecting them, so the resonances become weak at high frequencies. However, the horn is played with the hand positioned in the bell. This increases reflection at high frequency and the stronger peaks in Z make high notes easier to play. The hand also lowers the frequencies of each resonance. Before the introduction of valves, and occasionally still, different extents of hand stopping were used to vary the pitch. 
			 
			 <p><strong>Illustration of bell effect</strong>. The insertion of the hand reduces the good radiation of the bell: this gives the player a few more clear high resonances but reduces the loudness and brightness of the sound. So, when the composer asks for 'pavillons en l'air' (bells up), the sound is loud and bright, please don't write high passages with this instruction!</p>
		
		 <p>Most horns are double horns: the player has a valve for the thumb that introduces extra tubing to convert between a Bb horn (lowest playable resonance Bb2 and pedal Bb1, like the trombone) and an F horn (lowest playable resonance F2 and pedal F1, like the bass trombone with the valve depressed.) The horn also has three keys, each of which is connected to two valves, one in the F and one in the Bb horn. As usual, the finger keys add appropriate lengths of tubing to lower the pitch by about 2, 1 and 3 semitones respectively.</p>

		 <p>Horns are occasionally required to play pitches above 500 Hz. The increase sharpness of the impedance peaks provided by the hand make this easier to do. Comparing the last two curves, we can see why horn players often prefer to play the Bb horn for the high range. The player must select which impedance peak will determine the note by adjusting his/her embouchure. On the Bb horn, the peaks are further apart and one is less likely either to select the wrong one, or to crack a note by involving two neighbouring peaks. (Another interesting reason for cracked horn notes is <a href="timpani-horn.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
		 <p>Comparing the Z(f) curves with and without the hand in place shows clearly the compromise involved in the shape of the bell. A smoothly flaring bell radiates well and makes a bright, brassy sound. But the impedance peaks get weaker with incresing frequency, making it difficult to play high notes. (See the 'no hand' curve.) Putting the hand in the bell deforms the smooth shape of the air that conducts the sound. Reflections at the bell are stronger, so the high resonances are stronger and there are more of them. However, the bell radiates less well at high frequency, so it works less well as a megaphone, and the sound is darker and less loud.</p>
		 <p>Note again that the seventh and eleventh peaks are not very close to a note in the equal tempered scale, but are quite close to the natural harmonics of the pedal. We discussed this above in <a href="#intonation">Intonation in the natural harmonic series</a>.</p>
		 <a name="tract"></a>
         <h3>How the vocal tract and bore work together.</h3>
         <p> As mentioned above, the player's lips are loaded by two resonators: downstream is the bore of the instrument, while upstream is the vocal tract. If we consider the longitudinal motion of the lips to be driven largely by the pressure difference between the mouth and the mouthpiece, the vocal tract is in series with the bore: their acoustic impedances just add up (<font size="-1">This follows from the continuity of air flow. And remember, however, that the sum of complex numbers must include the phase</font>). Further, in a simple model, the series combination is approximately in parallel with the passive impedance of the lips themselves. Because the impedance of the bore is very large at resonant frequencies, one would expect that different vocal tract configurations have relatively small effects on a given playing regime. The graph below (from <a href="reprints/WolfePlenaryICA2010.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>) shows the frequency of notes 'played' by a simple mass-on-spring cantilever valve instead of lips. Downstream from the valve, there was a trombone. Upstream, there were two different geometries acting as artificial vocal tracts. The 'high tongue' configuration (with a constriction upstream from the valve) played a somewhat higher pitch for most slide positions. However, it also caused the register transition to occur at a higher pitch.		  </p>
    <center>
<IMG SRC="graphics/trombonevalve.gif" ALT="trombone experiment results" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom /></center> 
         <p>Players are aware that tongue placement and other changes in the mouth configuration affect the intonation and also the transition between registers, and these measurements on an artificial playing system support such observations (as do some experiments we've done with live players). The details of how this works are subtle and not yet understood.</p>
         <p>Now, as we've seen <a href="#acousticimpedance">above</a>, the resonances peaks for brass instruments are very strong at low frequencies, but less strong at high frequencies. So, in a series combination, the vocal tract impedance becomes more significant for high pitches. Is it possible, we wondered, that trombone and trumpet players 'tune' the vocal tract to the desired note when they played in the high range? (We had previously demonstrated such an effect in the saxophone. Like the trumpet, the high register &ndash; called altissimo &ndash; has rather weak impedance peaks and these notes are therefore hard to play. On <a href="SaxTract.html" target="_blank">this page</a>, we show how experienced saxophonists tune the resonances of the vocal tract to select these high notes, and in other techniques as well.)         </p>
    <p>

In measurements of the impedance spectra in the mouths of trumpet players, we find that the peaks in impedance have magnitudes that are sometimes comparable with those of the higher resonances of the instruments. However, we saw no consistent tuning. The plots below (from <a href="reprints/WolfePlenaryICA2010.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>) show the acoustic impedance measured just inside the mouth of a trumpet player playing a medium and a reasonably high note. They show strong impedance peaks, but their frequencies are not related to those of the note being played.

The same is true of trombone players: the peaks in the vocal tract impedance do not seem to be tuned to the notes being played.
<center><IMG SRC="graphics/TrumpetExample.gif" ALT="trumpet experiment results" BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom /></center>		
</p>
    <p>These results show that trumpet players play very high notes
         without tuning the vocal tract. Our studies showed no evidence of vocal resonance tuning on either trumpet or trombone. (See Chen et al (2012) and Boutin et al. (2015), both papers available on our <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">publications list</a>).</p>
    <p>Brass players are able to vary the pitch substantially by 'lipping up and down', so that they play above and below (respectively) the resonance of the instrument. Their range of playing is approximately symmetrical about the resonance (in both magnitude and phase). However, their normal playing frequency is above the resonance so, with respect to normal pitch, they can lip down rather further than they can lip up. Above the resonance, air flow into the instrument is ahead in phase of the mouthpiece pressure (a compliant* load); below the resonance, pressure leads flow (inertive* load). The range over which players can do this can tell us something about the mechanics of the valve and we have studied it in <a href="reprints/lipping.pdf">this research paper</a>. (* <font size=-1>These terms explained <a href="https://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/compliance-inertance-impedance.htm#C" target="_blank">here</a></font>.)</p>

    <h3>Singing into the instrument</h3>
    <p>A modern and relatively exotic performance technique asks players to sing into the instrument, while also playing a different note. In this situation, both the vocal folds and the lips are modulating the air flow. The result is not just two pitches, but a complicated set of frequencies corresponding to the sum and difference of the two frequencies, and others as well. For instance, playing the note C3 and singing G3 produces the low note C2. (Caution: sometimes this can cause discomfort to the vocal folds, because the relatively powerful pressure wave from the lips affects the vocal fold motion.) We discuss the physics involved in this <a href="reprints/WolfeSmithAA.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a>.  </p>

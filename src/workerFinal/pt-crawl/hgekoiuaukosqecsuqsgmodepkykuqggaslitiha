<h2>
<a name="Heading9"></a><b>I	INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
<p>The introduction of 'no-fault divorce' in Australia in 1976 promised unhappy
spouses a 'dignified' way to end their marriage without
the need to assign
responsibility for the relationship's
demise.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[1]</a></sup> But in 1989, Richard
Ingleby's study of matrimonial breakdown hinted that the reformers of the 1970s
had failed to appreciate the
non-mutuality of the uncoupling process, and that
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</i> <i>1975</a></i> (Cth) ('<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i>') had not
been 'able to prevent divorcing parties feeling the need to consider issues of
fault'.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[2]</a></sup> Since that time a growing
body of research evidence has revealed that blame and recrimination remain
salient issues for divorcing
couples, and academic commentators have suggested
that battles over children and property are often proxies for unresolved
relationship
grievances.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[3]</a></sup> In this
climate, legal scholarship has witnessed a renewed interest in the issue of
spousal conduct, with radical proposals to construct
'disloyalty' in marriage as
a legally relevant matter in divorce
settlements,<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[4]</a></sup> and consumers of the
family law system have called for the law to pay greater heed to the moral
dimensions of intimate
relationships.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[5]</a></sup> These developments
are not unique to Australia &#8212; fathers' groups across different countries
have railed against the law's 'fault-free'
approach to decision
making,<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[6]</a></sup> and the Canadian Supreme
Court has recently ruled that 'adulterous conduct' which causes 'emotional
trauma' may be relevant to awards
of spousal
maintenance.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In light of these challenges to the no-fault principle, it seems timely to
revisit the role of conduct in marital property law. Like
the law governing
parenting orders,<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[8]</a></sup> the framework
for adjusting property interests on divorce is a discretionary one, providing
judges with considerable scope to have
regard to evidence of a spouse's
behaviour if this appears
relevant.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[9]</a></sup> However, until the Full
Court's decision in <i>In the Marriage of CK and JW Kennon</i> ('<i>Kennon</i>')
in 1997, the authorised approach was heavily influenced by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law
Act</a></i>'s no-fault
underpinnings,<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[10]</a></sup> and judges were
strongly discouraged from investigating allegations of misconduct unless it had
affected the family's finances.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[11]</a></sup>
<i>Kennon</i> signalled a change of direction, permitting judges to adjust
property entitlements where a 'course of conduct' by one spouse (such
as
domestic violence), has had a 'significant adverse impact' upon their partner's
contributions.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[12]</a></sup> Despite this
opening, there have been few subsequent published decisions invoking its
principles<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[13]</a></sup> &#8212; much to the
frustration of advocates for the victims of domestic
violence<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[14]</a></sup> &#8212; suggesting the
no-fault philosophy continues to exert a substantial hold over judicial
practices. But as recent empirical
studies have shown, the images conveyed by
appellate cases can be seriously
misleading.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>This article seeks to explore the ways in which judges have approached claims
of marital misconduct in property hearings on a day
to day basis, both before
and since the decision in <i>Kennon</i>, by looking at a sample of unreported
cases decided in the Melbourne registry of the Family Court. Reflecting the
recent debates,
the focus of this exploration is broader than the issue of
family violence. Although there are compelling policy reasons to separate
spousal abuse from other kinds of
conduct,<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[16]</a></sup> the jurisprudence has
tended not to do this,<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[17]</a></sup> and the
notion of a continuum of relevant behaviour, with domestic violence at one end,
is inherent in the <i>Kennon</i> ruling. </p>
<p>The cases in this article were drawn from a larger sample of unreported
judgments (n = 260) that was collected for a study of judicial
and 'everyday'
attitudes to property ownership and division of labour in intimate
relationships.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[18]</a></sup> The principal aim
of the first stage of this project, which examined judicial decision making
patterns, was to track the shifts (if
any) in evaluating financial and
non-financial contributions between 1976 and 2002. The sample of judgments,
which represents 27
per cent of the relevant unreported property adjustment
cases available in the Melbourne
registry,<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[19]</a></sup> was selected to ensure
a range of variables was represented, including both domestic and business asset
cases and a spread of property
values, relationship lengths, and judicial
officers. As this suggests, investigation of marital fault was not part of the
design
for our project. However, in light of its re-emergence as a potential
policy issue in modern family law debates, and given its appearance
in a
significant number of the judgments in our sample (n = 54/260), we considered
these cases were worthy of examination. </p>
<p>The first part of the article describes some of the recent literature which
touches on issues of fault and blame in post-separation
disputes. The next
sections look at the background to Australia's no-fault divorce reforms and
outline the historical development
of the Family Court's jurisprudence on this
issue in property matters. The article then goes on to discuss the unreported
cases from
our sample and the shifts and continuities of practice they reveal.
The article concludes by contemplating the future of fault as
a decisional
factor in property decision making, in light of its apparent re-emergence since
<i>Kennon</i>, and its adequacy as a basis for addressing the effects of
violence in marriage.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading34"></a><b>II	RECENT CRITIQUES OF THE NO-FAULT APPROACH</b></h2>
<p>Among the latest proponents of a fault-based approach to divorce settlements
are Eithne Mills and Mirko Bagaric from Deakin Law School.
In a 2004 article
published in the <i>Australian Journal of Family Law</i>, they drew on equitable
principles to propose a principle of 'loyalty' be incorporated into the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i>, and that breaches of this principle be penalised by way
of a decreased share of property on divorce where the innocent party has
suffered harm as a result of the
'betrayal'.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[20]</a></sup> Underpinning this
proposal is a claim to moral consensus &#8212; that 'the community normally
regards a lack of loyalty with considerable
distaste'.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[21]</a></sup> Mills and Bagaric do
not propose a return to no-fault divorce. In fact, they argue there are 'good
reasons' for dissolving a marriage
without reference to fault, and that the law
should not stand in the way of people 'moving
on'.<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[22]</a></sup> But they suggest, as
Patrick Parkinson has done,<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[23]</a></sup> that
there should be financial consequences for marital misbehaviour where it leads
to the breakdown of the relationship and causes
harm.<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Not long after this article was published, John Hirst, a history academic
from La Trobe University, echoed some of its sentiments,
using a <i>Quarterly
Essay</i> to launch an attack on the Family
Court.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[25]</a></sup> Hirst argued that the
reforms of the 1970s were premised on an understanding of partners who shared a
common desire for their marriage
to end, and that a requirement to prove fault
in such circumstances was unnecessarily onerous. He proposed that different
rules should
apply where one partner's conduct is responsible for ending the
marriage. This view, he claimed, has widespread community
support.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[26]</a></sup> Describing marriage as
'a moral act', Hirst suggests that the no-fault approach to divorce only
increases the 'sense of injury' felt
by a spouse who has been betrayed, and that
this injury triggers legal battles over children and
property.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[27]</a></sup> His main concern is
for fathers, his primary argument being that men who have been 'faithful
husbands' and 'good providers' &#8212;
who 'did nothing wrong' &#8212; feel
justifiably outraged when these attributes 'count for absolutely nothing' in
legal settlements.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Springing from the conservative side of politics, these critiques are
unlikely to represent the views of the broader family law community
in
Australia. Yet their claims to reflect the ways that divorcing couples operate
in practice have growing empirical support, and
similar sounds of disquiet about
the law's refusal to allow separated spouses to vent their grievances about the
past have also emanated
from scholars with solid feminist credentials. Shelley
Day Sclater, for example, sounds not unlike Hirst in her criticism of the
legal
system's failure to acknowledge the 'psychological realities' of
divorce.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[29]</a></sup> Based on her study of
separating couples, Day Sclater suggests that the divorce transition is an
interpretative process in which
people 'strive to make sense of what went
wrong', and that a degree of 'imputation of blame' and a 'need to revisit the
past of the
marriage' are necessary for 'true psychological
separation'.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[30]</a></sup> This research
indicates that it is not uncommon for former partners to 'feel mortally wounded
by the hurt inflicted by the other',
and that expressing anger in these
circumstances may well be a 'dignified' response, and can be 'vital if any sense
of self is to
be preserved'.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other empirical studies in recent years have supported the view that
litigation over children and property may often be a proxy for
unresolved
feelings about the breakdown of the relationship, and that former partners
appear to want an official attribution of guilt
from the
courts.<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[32]</a></sup> These findings go
further than Day Sclater's work, suggesting that the need for vindication and
validation &#8212; what Carol Smart
and Vanessa May call legally 'illegitimate'
issues &#8212; is part of the reason many separated spouses resort to legal
processes,
and that the law needs to find some way to acknowledge this
reality.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[33]</a></sup> Similar messages about
the continuing role of fault in post-divorce disputes have come from Australian
and English studies of negotiated
property settlements, which suggest that
feelings of responsibility for instigating the break-up can influence the way
couples approach
their financial
arrangements,<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[34]</a></sup> and that the
person who initiates the separation often relinquishes a portion of the
matrimonial property to their former spouse
'as a form of compensation in
exchange for peace of mind'.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus a number of recent critiques emanating from quite different political
positions suggest that fault-talk remains a recognisable
and perhaps elemental
attribute of post-divorce conflict, despite its technical irrelevance to divorce
law, and that such talk is
likely to find its way into legal disputes and
negotiations over the distribution of property. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading56"></a><b>III	FAULT AND THE </b><b><i>FAMILY LAW ACT</i>
</b></h2>
<p>A reading of the parliamentary debates that preceded the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law
Act</a></i>'s passage reveals that the potential for fault discourses to survive
their legal prohibition was not much considered at the time
the legislation was
introduced. The forerunner to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i> was the <i>Matrimonial
Causes Act 1959</i> (Cth) ('<i>MCA'</i>), the Commonwealth Parliament's first
major exercise of its powers over 'divorce and matrimonial
causes'.<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[36]</a></sup> The <i>MCA</i> provided
14 predominantly fault-based grounds for obtaining a divorce, including the
traditional matrimonial offences of adultery,
desertion and cruelty (including
mental cruelty),<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[37]</a></sup> as well as
several no fault-grounds such as
insanity<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[38]</a></sup> and five years
separation.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[39]</a></sup> Parties who sought
to rely on its provisions were called 'petitioners', a term which reinforced the
suggestion that a judicial favour
was being bestowed on the unhappily married.
Petitioners were required to come to court 'with clean hands', and any acts of
adultery
by the petitioner had to be disclosed to the judge in a sealed
discretion statement.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[40]</a></sup> Adultery
was in many states the ground most commonly relied upon, with proof of the
offence often resting on 'hotel evidence' to
suggest the respondent had spent
the night with a 'third party'.<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>The genesis of a more liberal attitude to divorce can be found in the
demographic and attitudinal changes that occurred in the 1960s
and 1970s in
Australia. The high marriage rates of the post-war period proved unsustainable
as traditional gender roles were challenged
by the rise of feminism and women's
increased workforce participation
rates.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[42]</a></sup> A more assertive,
anti-authoritarian, individualistic and secular approach to social issues
contributed to a growing level of resentment
towards the costs associated with
obtaining a divorce, the lack of privacy, the humiliation of having to prove the
existence of matrimonial
fault and, as divorce became more common, court
delays.<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[43]</a></sup> By the early 1970s 90
per cent of applications were
undefended,<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[44]</a></sup> and the vast
majority invoked grounds such as adultery that would provide an immediate
divorce, with partners often colluding to
secure their freedom by agreeing to
admit to infidelity.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[45]</a></sup> Moreover,
its fault-based underpinnings had lent divorce law a rather seedy reputation,
with divorce cases &#8212; particularly between
prominent people in the
community &#8212; regularly featuring in the tabloid
press.<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[46]</a></sup> Together these forces
contributed to the government's decision to abolish the <i>MCA</i>
framework.<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Family Law Bill was first introduced by Attorney-General Lionel Murphy in
December 1973.<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[48]</a></sup> In his second
reading speech, the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam described the no-fault
provision as a response to public
demand.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[49]</a></sup> The parliamentary
debates preceding its passage were lengthy and passionate, long on rhetoric and
short on analysis. Supporters of
the Bill questioned the relevance of fault to
relationship breakdown and criticised the need for 'sordid procedures' to prove
it,
describing the search for a 'guilty' party as a 'charade' and suggesting
that the reality was typically 'not a matter of some person
being at fault' but
'a matter of some sort of incompatibility that has led to the breakdown of the
marriage'.<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[50]</a></sup> The government's
motivation for reform then was to provide Australian couples with a 'more
dignified' form of divorce,<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[51]</a></sup>
which would overcome the 'embarrassment and distress' of having to 'parade
faults in public'.<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[52]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Family Law Bill finally passed in December 1975 on a free vote, following
the fall of the Whitlam government. It came into operation
on 5 January 1976,
substituting the <i>MCA</i>'s grounds for divorce with a single 'no fault'
ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage as established by a period of
at
least 12 months' separation.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[53]</a></sup>
But little had been mentioned during the debates about the relevance of fault to
custody and property matters. The Attorney-General
had made a clear statement
about its abolition in relation to maintenance
applications,<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[54]</a></sup> but left the
position of property settlements ambiguous. Apart from several Senators who
raised the potential for fault to be applicable
to ancillary
proceedings,<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[55]</a></sup> it seems that few
parliamentarians thought it necessary to address the possibility of
recriminations about the past re-emerging in
this way.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading81"></a><b>IV	FAULT AND PROPERTY ADJUSTMENT: THE CASE LAW
</b></h2>
<p>The primary provisions governing the division of property on marriage
breakdown are located in Part VIII of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law
Act</a></i>,<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[56]</a></sup> and give the Family
Court a wide discretion to 'make such order as it considers appropriate'
altering the parties' interests in their
property where 'it is just and
equitable' to do so.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[57]</a></sup> In
exercising this discretion, judges are required to take into account a list of
relevant matters, including both past contributions
and future needs and
resources. Contributions may include direct and indirect financial or
non-financial contributions made 'by or
on behalf of' the parties to the
'acquisition, conservation or improvement' of their property, as well as
contributions made 'to
the welfare of the family&#8230; in the capacity of
homemaker or parent'.<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[58]</a></sup> Factors
dealing with the parties' post-separation circumstances include consideration of
their capacity for 'gainful
employment',<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[59]</a></sup> their state of
health, and their responsibilities to
dependents,<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[60]</a></sup> while a 'catch all'
provision, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 75(2)(o)</a>, allows the Court to consider 'any other fact or
circumstance' which the justice of the case requires to be taken into account.
On
the face of it, therefore, the legislative framework provides a number of
possibilities for considering the impact of a spouse's
pre-separation behaviour
if the justice of the case requires it. </p>
<p>Whether or not, as one commentator has
argued,<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[61]</a></sup> the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law
Act</a></i> was meant to have 'eradicated' allegations of fault from property
matters, the reported case law from the Family Court's earliest
years suggests
that parties continued to raise it. In the 1976 case of <i>Issom</i>, evidence
was adduced about the wife's affair and subsequent pregnancy to her Finnish
lover, attracting the ire of the trial judge
and resulting in denial of her
claim for spousal maintenance. The reported judgment describes the wife's
behaviour as so 'gross'
and wilfully calculated to destroy the marriage
relationship that her right to maintenance had been
forfeited.<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[62]</a></sup> But within months of
this decision, its reasoning was rejected by the Full Court in the case of
<i>Soblusky</i>,<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[63]</a> </sup>a ruling which
affected Family Court decision making for the next 20 years. In <i>Soblusky</i>,
the Full Court noted the omission from the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i> of any
reference to the conduct of the parties, describing this as 'a striking feature
which cannot be ignored', and declared that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 75(2)(o)</a> considerations
should be restricted to matters of a 'broadly financial
nature'.<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[64]</a></sup> </p>
<p>From that time on, as Juliet Behrens noted in her 1993 critique, the reported
cases consistently stated that conduct per se was
irrelevant,<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[65]</a></sup> and this held true
even when there was compelling evidence of domestic violence during the
marriage. For example, in the case of
<i>Hack</i>, decided the year after
<i>Soblusky</i> was handed down, the wife<i> </i>had been rendered<i>
</i>quadriplegic following what Bell J described as 'an incident' involving an
attack by her husband. Drawing a clear distinction between
the husband's conduct
and its financial effects, his Honour held that:</p>

evidence relating to the marital conduct of the parties is irrelevant and
inadmissible, but that, evidence of conduct affecting broadly
financial matters
may in some circumstances be admissible and highly
relevant.<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[66]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>In
accordance with this approach, Bell J took into account the wife's needs that
had been created by the husband's conduct but not
the conduct
itself.<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[67]</a></sup> As this suggests,
reported cases in which the behaviour complained of amounted to economic rather
than physical misconduct, and where
the consequences had an easily understood
monetary value, elicited different treatment to those where no evidence of
economic impact
was shown.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[68]</a></sup> As
late as 1990, the appropriateness of this distinction continued to be reaffirmed
by the Full Court.<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[69]</a></sup> By the
mid-1990s, however, there was a growing body of social science research on the
issue of family violence, which detailed its
consequences for women and
children,<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[70]</a></sup> including its economic
impact.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[71]</a></sup> Around this time,
academic commentators began to criticise the Court's no-fault discourse,
accusing judges of failing women by refusing
to consider the effects of violence
in property hearings.<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[72]</a></sup> Behrens
argued that both contribution and needs based arguments could be adopted by the
court to this end when determining financial
orders, by considering the impact
of violence on a woman's ability to carry out parenting and homemaking roles and
its impact on
her present and future financial position, including her capacity
for gainful employment.<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[73]</a></sup> Behrens
described as 'unjustified' the 'leap' that had occurred: </p>
<blockquote>
from the position that the cause of marriage breakdown should not be examined in
determining whether a dissolution should be granted
or not &#8230; to the idea
that we should prevent detailing of conduct in any other related
proceedings.<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[74]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>In
a series of cases commencing in 1994, Family Court judges responded to this
challenge and began to distance themselves from the
earlier practice of
disregarding evidence of violence in both custody and financial
matters,<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[75]</a></sup> including a number of
cases involving cross-vested actions for trespass to the person where the Court
awarded substantial damages
to the
claimant.<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[76]</a></sup> In this new policy
climate judgments in property cases started to recognise that violent behaviour
may have a detrimental impact
on the contributions made to the marriage by a
victim spouse. In <i>Doherty</i>, a reported decision from 1995, the trial judge
accepted that the wife's homemaker contributions had been affected by her
husband's
violence. On appeal, the Full Court supported this reasoning and held
that the trial judge was: </p>
<blockquote>
entitled to have found that because of the appellant's conduct, the respondent's
contribution as a homemaker was increased and the
appellant's similar
contribution diminished as a consequence, leading to the overall weighting based
upon contribution in favour
of the wife being
increased.<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[77]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
development of this approach culminated in 1997 in <i>Kennon</i>, in which the
Full Court declared that the earlier authorities that purported to preclude
evidence of domestic violence were no longer
binding.<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[78]</a></sup> <i>Kennon </i>involved
a wife's cross-vested claim for damages for assault and battery, together with
her <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 79</a> application.<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[79]</a></sup> At
trial, the wife's treating psychiatrist had provided evidence of the physical
and psychological impact of the husband's violence
during the marriage,
including her 'marked change' in personality. The trial judge accepted the
evidence of two individual assaults
and awarded damages for these, but found
that the husband's conduct had not affected the wife's contributions. The wife
did not challenge
this finding on appeal, and the Full Court's comments are thus
strictly obiter. Nevertheless, Fogarty and Lindenmayer JJ (with Baker
J
concurring) noted the increasing social science evidence of the 'destructiveness
of domestic violence',<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[80]</a> </sup>and
held:</p>
<blockquote>
where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during
the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a
significant adverse impact upon
that party's contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made
his or her contributions
significantly more arduous than they ought to have
been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in
assessing
the parties' respective contributions within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
79.</a><sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[81]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The judgment
in <i>Kennon</i> makes it clear that this ruling is not confined to the issue of
domestic violence and that the relevant criteria are potentially
applicable to a
'wider and more general category of
conduct'.<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[82]</a></sup> On the other hand,
Fogarty and Lindenmayer JJ<b> </b>expressed concern about allegations of
fault becoming 'common coinage' in litigation, as they were in the days prior to
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i>, and suggested its principles should be limited to a
'relatively narrow band of
cases'.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[83]</a></sup> In the next section we
look at the kinds of conduct that have been raised in property hearings over the
years and the reach of the
Full Court's ruling in <i>Kennon</i> since that
decision was handed down.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading121"></a><b>V	FAULT AND JUDICIAL PRACTICES: THE UNREPORTED
CASES</b></h2>
<p>In her 1993 article, Behrens speculated that the convention against hearing
evidence of fault had been 'so strongly stated in the
reported case law' that it
was likely to have been 'consistently carried into judicial decision
making'.<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[84]</a></sup> In this part of the
article we look at how the case law conventions have played out in day to day
decision making, drawing on the
cases in our sample of unreported judgments from
the Melbourne registry in which an allegation of marital misconduct was
discussed.
The sub-sample of judgments here comprises those in which the
relevance of alleged conduct to the adjustment of property interests
was
addressed (n = 43), as well as those where an appraisal of a spouse's behaviour
formed part of the discursive background of the
judgment but was not explicitly
factored into the outcome (n =
14).<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[85]</a></sup> Three of these judgments
contained discussion of the relevance of one party's conduct, or one form of
conduct, to the adjustment
of property as well as a critique of the other
party's conduct, or another form of conduct, and are thus relevant to both
categories.
Together these cases reflect the decisions of 24 judges, including
20 Melbourne-based and four interstate judges. Of the 43 cases
in the first
category (where the judge discussed the relevance of alleged conduct to the
adjustment exercise), 30 were decided prior
to the decision in <i>Kennon</i> and
13 were heard after <i>Kennon</i> was handed
down.<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[86]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There is, of course, no way of knowing how many of the disputes in our sample
<i>actually</i> involved issues of marital misbehaviour. There were a number of
additional cases in our sample which contained indications that a
party had
raised a matter of conduct &#8212; a suggestion of violence for example &#8212;
that was not mentioned further in the
judgment.<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[87]</a></sup> Given the effective
prohibition on adducing evidence of spousal abuse prior to <i>Kennon</i>, and
the now well-known pressures on women who have experienced violence which
militate against them using the legal system to obtain
a property
settlement,<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[88]</a></sup> it is not surprising
that this issue appears to have been raised (as far as we can tell) relatively
rarely in our sample, especially
in the early
years.<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[89]</a></sup> As our sample was not
selected to include allegations of fault, we do not know whether the cases
discussed here are over- or under-representative
of its incidence in property
hearings. Our aim in this article, however, is to be descriptive rather than
quantitative, to illustrate
and reflect on the ways in which the judges in our
sample approached evidence of marital misconduct when it was put before the
court
and the extent to which their apparent (un)willingness to consider fault
complied with or went beyond the case law guidelines of
the time. </p>
<p>The kinds of conduct described in these cases include domestic violence,
child sexual abuse and abusive parenting by fathers, alcohol
and drug abuse,
gambling, neglect or abandonment of the home and family by the wife, wasting or
dissipation of assets, fraud, and
extra-marital affairs. While the approach to
some of these behaviours &#8212; such as dissipation of assets and fraud
&#8212; changed
little over the years, the cases reveal that other forms of
conduct &#8212; such as domestic violence, men's parenting of children,
and
infidelity &#8212; have attracted quite different judicial responses at
different times in the Court's history, in ways which
suggest that <i>Kennon</i>
was both an expression of shifts in social attitudes to marriage and family life
and a trigger for changes in judicial treatment
of spousal and parental
behaviour. For the most part, judges approached the issue of conduct as one
affecting past contributions,
not future needs. The extent of adjustment they
made for fault, however, was not always clear on the face of the judgments, and
our
analysis is therefore necessarily more concerned with the features of the
evidence which appear to have rendered conduct relevant
than with its impact on
the outcome.<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[90]</a></sup> </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading132"></a><b>A	The pre-</b><b><i>Kennon</i> cases</b></h3>
<p>As Behrens predicted, the early cases in our sample largely conformed to the
dictates of the prevailing case law. Where allegations
of domestic violence were
raised prior to <i>Kennon</i>, these were generally dismissed as being
irrelevant to the adjustment exercise. A good illustration is the very first
case in our
sample, Case 1.1 (1976), where the judge divided the couple's assets
equally between them after finding the wife's greater earnings
were balanced by
the husband's ownership of an unencumbered home at the commencement of the
relationship.<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[91]</a></sup> In the course of
the judgment, his Honour noted that two issues of conduct had been raised by the
parties. The first concerned the
husband's allegation that the wife's spending
habits during the marriage had been 'extravagant'; the second related to
allegations
of violence. After considering the evidence, the judge found the
former complaint was not made out, and that the wife had spent most
of her
earnings on the family. Evidence adduced in support of the latter claim,
however, met with the following judicial response:
</p>
<blockquote>
The relationship between the parties seems to have deteriorated gravely from
about 1972 onwards and there were some unfortunate and
violent disputes between
them. There is no necessity to allocate praise or blame. It has no relevance to
the question of ancillary
relief in this case.</blockquote><p>Other judgments
from this era involving a claim of violent conduct exhibited a similar lack of
enthusiasm for investigating its effects
and a suggestion that the behaviour was
likely mutual. In Case 2.18, decided in 1981, the wife led evidence that she was
suffering
from a back injury which had been exacerbated by the husband's
assaults on her, and raised this as an issue calling for a needs-based
adjustment in her favour. The wife had been a widow with two young children at
the time of the marriage. The judge found that, despite
the impact of this
injury on her earning capacity, she had reaped financial benefits from the
marriage and 'was rather better off
than she would have been if she had
continued to live in her own house and had to live on social services'. As to
the allegations
of violence, his Honour concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
I think it is likely that there were some physical altercations between the
husband and wife. It is common ground that on one occasion
in January 1977 the
wife struck the husband on the head with a brass ornament. I think it is likely
that he resorted to violence
at times. However, I believe that objectively those
assaults were not as severe as the wife paints them. I am certainly not
satisfied
he deliberately tried to cause her back injury as the wife would
suggest.</blockquote><p>Case 1.39 from 1980 is also instructive. In this case
the trial judge was critical of the wife's neglect of the family, but unwilling
to investigate the allegations of abuse which may have explained it. The judge
accepted that the marriage had been characterised
by violence, but also that the
wife had left the home from time to time, placing a 'heavy burden' of
responsibility on the husband
for the couple's seven children. The wife's
absences from the home, which were described as 'flighty and irresponsible',
were considered
to have reduced the value of her homemaker contributions. In
contrast with this treatment, the judgment displays a distinct disinterest
in
investigating the issue of violence, which was dismissed with the following
speculation about its cause: </p>
<blockquote>
It is quite apparent that there was violence between them, whether that violence
was precipitated by drinking by either or both parties
or by extra-marital
conduct by either or both of the parties, I am unable to
say.</blockquote><p>There were, however, two early cases in our sample in which
evidence of violence did have an impact on the division of property. In
each of
these, the judge accepted the evidence of abuse &#8212; including the husband's
constant 'denigration' and 'vicious assault'
on the wife in the first
case,<sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[92]</a></sup> and 'threats on the lives
of the wife and the children' in the second<sup>
<a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[93]</a></sup> &#8212; and concluded that the
wife's neglect of 'her mothering and household duties' (in the first case) and
abandonment of the
home (in the second) was justified on this basis. The
consequence of these findings, however, was not to increase the value of the
woman's homemaker contributions but to prevent them from being diminished, as
had happened to the wife in Case 1.39. The following
comments from the judgment
in the second of these cases illustrate this point:</p>
<blockquote>
It seems to me that there was a great deal of abuse on the part of the husband
towards her. She alleges some violence in her affidavits.
There were threats
made after they separated; threats on the lives of the wife and the children
according to her affidavit material.
I mention these things because insofar as
reliance is placed on the fact that the wife left the home, I do nothing in the
circumstances
of this case that can result in a deduction of what should be
justly due to her in this case.</blockquote><p>A number of the early 'fault'
judgments in our sample dealt with issues of 'excessive drinking' or gambling.
Unlike the domestic violence
cases, evidence of this kind of behaviour was not
peremptorily dismissed, but, in accordance with principle, prompted
consideration
of its relevance to the parties' property entitlements. In some
cases, a significant economic impact was found, affecting adjustment
of the
property. In Case 2.27 (1983), the wife was awarded the entire equity in the
matrimonial home after the judge found that her
husband's 'considerable'
drinking had been 'a drain on the family resources which was of a serious
nature', while the husband in
Case 3.22 (1989) received 75 per cent of the
couple's assets after a 21 year marriage because his wife's gambling habit had
severely
diminished the family's income. At other times, no adjustment was made
because there had been little or no impact on the family
finances.<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[94]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Not all the cases we included in our survey of fault involved an assessment
of its relevance to the property division. We also found
cases in which the
judgment included criticism of a spouse's behaviour which suggested this may
nevertheless have been influential
in shaping the outcome of the case. This
occurred particularly (although not exclusively) in the first years of the
Court's history,
suggesting perhaps that while fault was no longer legally
relevant, its capacity to excite decision makers, and the inclination to
judge
the conduct of married partners, took longer to fade away. In a 1978
case,<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[95]</a></sup> the court heard evidence
of the wife's gambling habit. Although the judge in this case 'excused' the
wife's behaviour because of
the difficulties she had faced in 'adjusting to a
strange environment' (the wife was a Malaysian national), he proceeded to
condemn
her lack of 'dedication to the marriage' and admonish the husband for
his 'ill-advised' decision to marry a 'vivacious type of woman'
who was 22 years
his junior. This kind of 'judgement passing' was noticeable in a number of the
early cases, where, for example,
wives were criticised for being 'pre-occupied'
with paid work,<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[96]</a></sup> and for
providing their husband with 'little society in the
home',<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[97]</a></sup> or for establishing a
'friendship with another
man'.<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[98]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the last-mentioned critique suggests, the issue of infidelity was not
entirely absent from the early cases, and several of the
judgments contained
criticism of one party for abandoning the marriage for a new partner and, on
occasion, a suggestion that the
judge may have factored this into the assessment
of contributions. In Case 2.44, the wife had left the family home (and the
family
farm) to live with another man. Despite the fact that the husband had not
raised this as a matter affecting her contributions, the
judgment includes the
following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
It would be open for the husband to argue that, during the later months of the
marriage when the wife was pursuing an affair with
Mr S, she became unavailable
to assist him with the property and the greater burden fell on him. He has not
alleged that, but it
would not achieve justice and equity between the parties
were I to place the husband's financial contribution on a lower plane than
the
wife's contribution as a homemaker and mother and towards the farm which the
parties conducted.</blockquote><p>As the preceding discussion indicates, there
were a number of cases in the pre-<i>Kennon</i> cohort which revealed
interesting resistances by judges to the <i>Soblusky</i> approach. Indeed,
several pre-<i>Kennon</i> judgments suggest that the decision maker had
considered a party's conduct to be sufficiently reprehensible, and the impact on
the
other partner sufficiently grievous, that it warranted an adjustment of
assets regardless of the absence of economic impact. One
of these, Case 3.9 from
1986, involved a 17 year marriage and parties who had run a small business
together. At some point during
the marriage the husband acquired a 'mistress',
with whom he set up another business &#8212; a massage parlour &#8212; and
during
the final five years of the marriage this woman lived with him and the
wife in the matrimonial home. In assessing the wife's contributions,
the judge
had regard to the fact that she had been 'the unwilling hostess to her husband's
mistress', and concluded that her homemaker
contributions should be 'given more
weight than normal here, by reason of the unusual circumstances under which the
wife was forced
to live'. </p>
<p>Another of these cases, Case 4.44, was decided in 1995, the same year that
the Full Court handed down its judgment in <i>Doherty</i>, and is thus perhaps
less a resistance to the <i>Soblusky</i> doctrine than a reflection of the
transition that was taking place in the Court which culminated in <i>Kennon</i>.
This case involved extreme, long term violence by the husband against his wife,
culminating in his being jailed for hiring a hit-man
to kill her. The case also
involved fraud, the husband having transferred the matrimonial home to his
brother without the wife's
knowledge. In this case, the judge found that the
husband had made a 'negative contribution' &#8212; an argument suggested by
Behrens<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[99]</a></sup> &#8212; and that the
wife's contributions were more than usually 'significant': </p>
<blockquote>
On all the evidence the wife has also been the overwhelming contributor to the
welfare of the family. That contribution has been
even more significant since
June, 1993 because she has had to live with the terrible knowledge that the
husband wished her dead and
took very active steps to achieve that. It is an
enormous burden for her to carry and the fact that she has managed to continue
in
those circumstances is a matter of great credit to her.</blockquote><p>The
parties' contributions were assessed as being 65/35 in the wife's favour and she
was given an additional adjustment of 15 per
cent under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(2)</a> to allow her to
relocate away from the husband, of whom she was found to be understandably
afraid.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading158"></a><b>B	The post-</b><b><i>Kennon</i> decisions</b></h3>
<p>The ruling in <i>Kennon</i> was welcomed by many, while others saw it as a
'risky' decision that harboured the potential to reintroduce the pre-<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Law Act</a></i> approach to property
settlements.<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[100]</a></sup> In the first
years after it<i> </i>was handed down, Sarah Middleton conducted a small study
of unreported cases in which its principles had been invoked in relation
to
allegations of domestic
violence.<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[101]</a></sup> Her analysis showed
that the Family Court was 'having little apparent difficulty' in accommodating
the <i>Kennon</i> considerations when violence was
raised.<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[102]</a></sup> The relevant cases
from our sample exhibited a similar profile on this issue.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading163"></a><b>(i)	Domestic violence</b></h3>
<p>There were six cases involving domestic violence among our post-<i>Kennon</i>
judgments in which its principles were raised by wives and applied by the
court.<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[103]</a></sup> In five of these, the
woman's contributions received a modest increase in recognition of the effects
of the husband's conduct, and
in one of these five, a further adjustment was
made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 75(2).</a><sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[104]</a></sup> In
the sixth case, Case 5.46 (2001), the wife led evidence of multiple sexual
assaults upon her by the husband, but the judge found
that these had occurred in
the months leading up to separation and thus fell outside the <i>Kennon</i>
ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
Part of the wife's case was that the husband was violent to her and belittled
and demeaned her and that this made the contributions
which she made more
difficult in the circumstances and thus should result in a further adjustment in
her favour&#8230; In my view,
<i>Kennon</i> does not assist the wife in this
case. The Full Court said the considerations would apply only in a relatively
narrow band of cases
and that it was necessary to show that the conduct occurred
during the course of the marriage and had a discernible impact on the
contributions of the other party. It is not directed to conduct which does not
have that effect nor to conduct in relation to the
breakdown of the marriage.
The allegations of the wife, which were denied by the husband, clearly fall
within that embargo. </blockquote><p>Where adjustments were made for domestic
violence, as occurred in the other five cases in this group, the abuse had been
a long term
feature of the relationship and the impact on the wife considerable.
The judge in Case 5.30, for example, found the husband 'throughout
the marriage,
has been a controlling and abusive man'. His Honour made detailed findings that
the husband had physically assaulted
his wife, used intimidation, threats and
other emotional abuse against her and the children, and had 'exerted control
over the members
of the household in financial matters'. His Honour also
accepted evidence that this conduct had left the wife with significant health
problems &#8212; including vertigo, tinnitus, headaches, depression, insomnia,
mood variations, lethargy, loss of concentration,
anxiety, and loss of self
esteem &#8212; and concluded that both the wife's financial and homemaker
contributions should be given
additional weight 'because of the difficult
circumstances under which she laboured to perform
them'.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[105]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Similarly, the judge in Case 5.60 described the husband's 'high level of
emotional and verbal abuse' of the wife as having 'persisted'
throughout the
couple's 19 year marriage, rendering the wife's financial and homemaker
contributions 'all the more difficult' and
justifying an adjustment of 10 per
cent in her favour 'by virtue of the pressures which he put on her'. The judge
in this case noted
that the wife's claim of violence was well supported, not
only by the evidence but by his assessment of the parties in the witness
box:</p>
<blockquote>
My observations of both parties lead me to the inescapable conclusion that those
allegations [of abuse] are correct. In the first
place, I observed [the wife] to
be highly traumatised. Nothing in her affect created the slightest concern in me
that there was anything
artificial or made up with respect to either the
allegations or the effect. Secondly, [the husband's] attitudes, emotional makeup
and readily conceded actions since the parties' separation are all entirely
consistent with the allegations made by [the wife]. I
accordingly find that that
behaviour by [the husband] persisted throughout the parties' cohabitation. I
make that finding on the
highest degree of probability and indicate that I would
have no hesitation in finding beyond reasonable doubt if it were necessary
for
me to do so.</blockquote><p>Case 5.22 provides a further example of the kind of
evidence which attracted an adjustment for domestic violence in our sample
cases.
Here the judge accepted the wife's claim that she had 'suffered physical
abuse from the husband commencing from about four to five
years after the
marriage', and that she been 'subjected to repeated verbal abuse and
belittlement' since that time. The marriage
had lasted 25 years. The wife's
evidence, which was supported by the parties' eldest son, included accounts of
physical assaults
requiring medical treatment, of being 'dragged around the
house by her hair' and having a knife held to her throat, of attacks on
the son
who had tried to protect her, and the husband's eventual conviction for assault.
The judge concluded that this was 'an obvious
example of a case where the
effects of family violence should be considered on the issue of contribution',
and the husband's counsel
appears to have conceded the point, albeit arguing
that the adjustment should be 'slight'. In the end, the wife was awarded an
additional
10 per cent of the assets because the husband's conduct had made her
contributions 'significantly more arduous than they ought to
have been'. </p>
<p>Apart from Case 5.46, these judgments dealt squarely with the issues that had
been raised in <i>Kennon</i> itself &#8212; a 'course of violent conduct' by the
husband which had a 'discernible impact' on the wife's contributions &#8212;
and
saw the wife receive a modest adjustment of property on this account. However,
as the judge in one of our early post-1997 cases
noted, the Full Court's ruling
had provided decision makers with considerable scope for a broad interpretation
of its applicability.<sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[106]</a></sup>
Middleton's study found the application of the <i>Kennon</i> criteria had
quickly extended to conduct other than domestic
violence.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[107]</a></sup> Our sample, too,
revealed an extended practice. In addition to the well-established categories of
substance abuse and dissipation
of assets, judges were asked to examine
behaviour of a more interpersonal nature, including conduct affecting the
children and allegations
of 'discernible impact' caused by infidelity. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading176"></a><b>(ii)	Other conduct</b></h3>
<p>Evidence of substance abuse continued to trigger a judicial response in
property hearings, but because of <i>Kennon</i>, its relevance was not confined
to the impact on the family finances. In Case 5.18 (1998), a husband's addiction
to heroin during
the marriage attracted an adjustment in the wife's favour, not
only because the family would have been in 'a significantly improved
financial
position' if not for his habit, but also because of its 'vast effect' on the
wife's contributions. The later cases in our
sample also revealed some novel
fault issues. In Case 5.13, the assessment of contributions centred on the
husband's sexual abuse
of the wife's daughter, conduct which brought about the
end of the marriage and led to the husband being imprisoned following his
conviction for rape. The trial judge found that the wife's 'discovery' of the
husband's abuse, and 'the consequences which flowed
from it', had been
'devastating' for her, and that this was 'the very sort of factor' envisaged by
the <i>Kennon</i> ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
[The] factor which is of a compelling nature in this case is the additional
contributions which the wife made to the family arising
out of the discovery of
the sexual abuse by the husband of [the child] &#8230; and the consequences
which flowed from it. It seems
clear that that is the very sort of factor which
was contemplated by the Full Court in <i>Kennon </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FamCA/1997/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FamCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20FLC%2092%2d757" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) FLC 92-757.</a> This was
a devastating circumstance, striking at the very essence of the marriage and
imposing upon the wife enormous additional
responsibilities, both emotional and
financial.</blockquote><p>In another 1999 case, the <i>Kennon</i> principle
resulted in the wife obtaining an increased share of the property because of the
husband's 'dysfunctional'
parenting.<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[108]</a></sup> Although there was
also conduct in this case that could fall within the definition of spousal
abuse, the judge ultimately rejected
this characterisation and focused on the
husband's behaviour as a parent. The wife led evidence that the husband had been
abusive
towards her over a long period, but the extent of his physical abuse was
conceded to be 'minor' and the judge concluded it had not
affected her
contributions. However, his Honour did accept evidence that the husband had been
an emotionally abusive parent, including
neglecting his daughters and spending
'a great deal of his time in seclusion with his computer': </p>
<blockquote>
As time went by I am satisfied that he withdrew from the role of providing
parental guidance and control and adopted a critical and
non-constructive role
which was resented by the children.</blockquote><p>The judge found that as a
result of the husband's behaviour, the couple's two children were suffering from
severe psychological health
problems &#8212; including self-harming behaviour
&#8212; and this finding attracted a <i>Kennon</i> adjustment. Contributions
were assessed as being 65/35 in the wife's favour because the husband's
parenting behaviour had placed
'an increased load' upon her in this respect and
rendered her 'task of looking after the family considerably more difficult than
if he had not been there at all'. A further adjustment of 10 per cent under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 75(2)</a> recognised her ongoing responsibility for the girls' high care
needs:</p>
<blockquote>
I also attach weight to the wife's future responsibilities for the financial and
moral support which she will be obliged to give
to [the children] and the lack
of the same from the husband. I do this because of the special circumstances of
this case wherein
both of these daughters have suffered from the dysfunctional
family life which they have had to endure principally through the husband's
conduct towards them and the results of which the wife is now left to cope
with.</blockquote><p>Another illustration of the potential reach of the<b>
</b><i>Kennon</i> ruling is provided by two recent cases involving claims of
infidelity.<b> </b>The husband and wife in<b> </b>Case 5.41, decided in 2001,
had spent several periods of their marriage apart while the husband was away on
business. During this
time the wife had an affair with another man. The husband
argued that this conduct amounted to a negative contribution by her, and
that it
had affected his own contributions and commitment to the marriage. After
considering the evidence, including that the parties
had reconciled and had a
child after the affair became known, the judge ruled that the husband's claimed
impact was not made out.
Unlike the judgments discussed above where the evidence
revealed significant emotional damage to a spouse or child, the judgment
here
suggests that the husband's argument had been a cynical attempt to offset his
own negative contributions in dissipating assets
at the time of separation.
Although this case did not raise <i>Kennon</i>
directly,<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[109]</a></sup> the husband's overt
reliance on his wife's affair here seems to reflect a revived assumption about
the relevance of fault to property
division, in which <i>Kennon </i>is clearly
implicated. Indeed, the second 'infidelity' case in our sample illustrates the
potential for <i>Kennon</i> to be used to address (or exploit) such
behaviour.</p>
<p>The parties in Case 5.58 had been married 20 years, during which time five
children were born. The couple separated when the husband
became aware that he
was not the biological father of the three youngest children &#8212; their
biological father being a man with
whom the wife had had a longstanding affair.
By contrast with Case 5.41 above, the judge was highly critical of the wife's
behaviour
here, and greatly concerned by the effect it had had on the husband.
Like the cases involving the sexual abuse of the wife's daughter
and the
husband's emotional abuse of his children, the judgment constructs him as the
innocent victim of intentional abuse. He was
a man whose 'whole focus was the
family unit he perceived as his', who was now 'grappling with the emotional
consequences' of his
wife's conduct. The judge found that the wife's behaviour
had implications for the assessment of contributions, both because she
had
depleted the family income by maintaining an apartment with her lover and
because of its 'profound' effect on the husband's contributions,
and that this
warranted an adjustment of 15 per cent in his favour. The wife's counsel argued
that this conduct fell outside the
kind envisaged by the Full Court in
<i>Kennon</i>, but the judge in this case disagreed:</p>
<blockquote>
I do not accept that to be the law, the Full Court making it clear in
<i>Kennon</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FamCA/1997/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FamCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20FLC%2092%2d757" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) FLC 92-757</a> that conduct could be relevant within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79.</a> In
that case the Court was considering the issue of domestic violence, although it
made it clear that it was one example of a category
of conduct which might be
relevant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> findings. </blockquote><p>Noting that the Full Court had been
well 'aware of the dangers of inappropriate use of allegations of misconduct in
property cases'
when handing down its judgment in <i>Kennon</i>, the judge
concluded that the present scenario more than met its criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
It is difficult to imagine a situation which impacted more upon the
contributions of a party than that in which [the husband] found
himself. I am
satisfied that [the wife] introduced into the household three children whom she
knew were not children of her husband,
with the intention that she and he would
bear equally their financial, physical and emotional support. Finding herself
pregnant with
[the first of the three younger children] one might be able to
argue that she acquiesced in a potentially destructive deception without
any
real consideration of the consequences. However, she then intentionally bore two
more children and, following a pre-arranged
plan, introduced them into the
[parties'] household as children for whom [the husband] was financially and
personally responsible.</blockquote><p>The wife's behaviour loomed large in the
property division process in this case. The conduct in question involved a
mixture of financial
impact and emotional fallout. By 'keeping house' with her
lover the wife had deprived the family of income and this was taken into
account, just as it presumably would have been under <i>Soblusky</i>. But the
debilitating effect of her behaviour on the husband's sense of family, and the
impact of this on his contributions, were
also taken into account, a practice
that was not sanctioned prior to <i>Kennon</i>. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading191"></a><b>VI	CONCLUSION: A RETURN TO FAULT?</b></h2>
<p>While the passage of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i> in 1975 ushered in an era of
no-fault divorce, it also created a requirement to assess non-financial
contributions, such as homemaker
and parenting contributions, when determining
property interests. Despite this recognition of the value of care work in
families
(typically performed by women), the potential for these contributions
to be affected by a spouse's abuse was not acknowledged until
the 1990s. Not
until <i>Kennon</i> in 1997 were judges officially permitted to have regard to
evidence of violence when assessing contributions where no financial impact
was
identified. The ruling in <i>Kennon</i> was the product of the Court's (and the
community's) growing awareness of the effects of violence against women in
intimate relationships.
At the same time, other important social changes were
taking place, including increasing expectations of men as
parents,<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[110]</a></sup> and mounting
consumer demand for the legal system to be more responsive to the emotional
impact of divorce, and <i>Kennon</i> also provided scope for these shifts to
play out in property cases.</p>
<p>The evolutionary picture of the Court's approach to family violence in our
unreported judgments largely reflects the concerns and
findings of other family
law researchers.<sup><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[111]</a></sup> As Behrens
surmised it would, the case law discouragement of claims about spousal abuse was
also evident in our sample, with decision
makers dismissing allegations of
violence (and suggesting the conduct was likely to have been mutual) and failing
to comprehend its
effects (for example, as an explanation for a woman's flight
from the home). Women who experienced significant violence prior to
<i>Kennon
</i>could thus be doubly disadvantaged. Not only was no additional weight given
to contributions performed under 'arduous' circumstances,
but a victim might
also find her contributions devalued for reduced attention to the home and
family. On the other hand, we also
found pre-<i>Kennon</i> cases where decision
makers had been sensitive to these issues, and had accepted and used evidence of
the husband's violence to prevent
diminution of the wife's contributions on this
account. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly there were no early cases where infidelity was explicitly
argued, but there were some where the decision maker had
been critical of a
wife's 'affair' or 'friendship' with another man, and intimations that this
might have affected the outcome. By
contrast, Cases 5.41 and 5.58 suggest that
modern litigants feel less inhibited about making claims for property adjustment
based
on a spouse's betrayal, and that judges have been prepared to entertain
these. There has also been an interesting journey regarding
contributions to
parenting and the welfare of the family, judging by our sample of judgments. The
cases that attracted criticism
for poor parenting in the pre-<i>Kennon</i>
cohort were concerned with mothers who neglected their children and left a
'heavy burden' of care on their husband, and wives who
lacked 'dedication to the
marriage' or provided 'little society in the home'. By comparison, our
post-<i>Kennon</i> example involved a father who had withdrawn from 'providing
parental guidance' to his children, and whose 'critical and non-constructive'
parenting behaviour justified an increased property award to his wife.</p>
<p>The shift of judicial narrative from disinterest in allocating 'praise or
blame' in Case 1.1 to passionate concern for the husband's
wellbeing and rebuke
of the wife's 'destructive deception' in Case 5.58, suggests a revival of
fault-based decision making in marital
property cases, one that seems to have
travelled well beyond the kind of conduct envisaged in <i>Kennon</i>. On closer
examination, however, the judgments in our sample reveal both continuity and
change, and perhaps more of the former than
the latter. A common thread running
through the post-<i>Kennon</i> cases where adjustments were made for conduct
&#8212; whether the conduct was characterised as domestic violence,
dysfunctional parenting,
or infidelity &#8212; is evidence of abusive behaviour
on the one hand, and emotional or psychological damage (to a partner or child)
on the other. Moreover, the willingness of the decision maker in Case 3.9 to
compensate the wife for being 'the unwilling hostess
to her husband's
mistress' &#8212; despite there being no evidence of financial impact
&#8212; suggests that these 'abuse and harm'
factors may have triggered a
similar judicial response well before the Full Court authorised
it.<sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[112]</a></sup> Some judges, it seems,
have always been prepared to provide official vindication for hurt and
humiliation if the evidence is sufficiently
compelling. </p>
<p>Since <i>Kennon</i>, adjustments of homemaker (and sometimes financial)
contributions where a pattern of violence by one partner during the marriage
has
rendered the performance of these contributions 'significantly more arduous than
they ought to have been' have become normative.
The adjustments for violence in
our sample, as Middleton found in her survey, were modest and arbitrary (around
10 per cent) and,
with one exception, not supplemented for recognition of the
victim's needs via <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 75(2)</a>, even when there was evidence of serious health
problems.<sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[113]</a></sup> An added problem
for victims of violence is the 'course of conduct' requirement, which rules out
evidence of assaults in the period
leading up to separation (as in Case 5.46).
Interestingly, the same restriction appears to have been side-stepped in cases
where
a spouse's 'discovery' of their partner's abuse (of the stepdaughter in
Case 5.13) or deception (in Case 5.58), which was the basis
of the harm,
triggered the separation. But the larger issue here, of course, is the problem
of how to assign a value to non-financial
contributions in the first place,
whether or not they are performed in arduous
circumstances.<sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[114]</a></sup> The cases in
our sample lend support to Behrens' arguments for a dedicated legal response to
violence against women,<sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[115]</a></sup> and
Middleton's suggestion that this be the subject of explicit direction in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i>, preferably as a needs-based
factor.<sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[116]</a></sup> </p>
<p>We are conscious of the need to be careful about drawing conclusions from
such a small group of cases, which may reflect little more
than differences in
values between individual
judges.<sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[117]</a></sup> With that rider,
however, it seems arguable from the decisional approaches reflected in these
judgments that<i> Kennon</i>, rather than triggering a shift in judicial
practices, may have simply provided authoritative support for an always present
willingness
by some judges to rebuke reprobate spouses and that, as Berns and
others have suggested, property litigation is not immune from the
airing of
claims about spousal conduct. As one divorce lawyer noted rather presciently in
1975: </p>
<blockquote>
No doubt Courts under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a></i> will still, from time to time,
be urged to find that one party has acted correctly throughout [the marriage]
while the actions of
the other have been characterised by great
irresponsibility.<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[118]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
the end, then, these cases do not signal a comeback for fault in property
decision making, or that it ought to be reinstated. Rather
they support the
argument that blaming never really went away.</p>

but the exact nature of the noxiousagent, and the circumstances on which its formation and extrication depend,are even at the present day not altogether established.&nbsp;<p>It is clearly neither heat nor moisture, for the crews of clean ships,when cruising in the tropics at a distance from land, are usually veryhealthy; nor is it any known gas extricated from the marsh, for the gasescollected by stirring up marshes ... may be inspired without giving riseto any symptoms resembling those produced by malaria.&nbsp;<p>It may be regarded as an established fact that the noxious agent isa product of vegetable decomposition occurring under certain conditionsof heat and moisture....<p>Although moisture is necessary to the evolution of miasmata, an excessof it often acts as a preventive, and by impeding the access of atmosphericair retards or prevents decomposition.&nbsp; This explains the apparentanomaly of an uncommonly rainy season producing opposite effects in differentlocalities, sometimes not far distant from one another....<p>Chemistry has hitherto failed in detecting any special ingredient towhich the air evolved by marshes owes its poisonous qualities.&nbsp; Theair collected in the most poisonous districts gives, on analysis, the samegases existing in the same proportions as normal air, nor ... does it giveevidence of the presence of any organic body....<p>[I]t is found by experience that those who go out of their houses onlyduring the day, after the morning fogs have dispersed, and before the eveningmists appear, often escape the bad effects; and a full meal, with a fewgrains of quinine, should be taken before exposure to the morning air bytravelers in a malarious district....<p>Dr. Wood of Philadelphia has pointed out the extraordinary and veryimportant fact, that miasmata are neutralized, decomposed, or in some otherway rendered innocuous by the air of large cities....<p>What it is in the air of the city which is thus incompatible with malaria,is unknown, but very probably it is connected with the results of combustion,for the fire and smoke of camps are asserted to have had the same effects.</td></tr></table></center><table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">  <tr>    <td bgcolor="#339999"><p align="center"><b><font size=+1>Tropical Disease and the Spanish-American War (1898)</font></b></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td bgcolor="#CCFFFF"><p>Casualties:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

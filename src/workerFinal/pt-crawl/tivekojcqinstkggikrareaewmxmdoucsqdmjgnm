<h2>The Man</h2>
<p><img src="gif/ein1.gif" width="100" height="105" class="flr" alt="" />
On April 18, 1955, the great mathematician and physicist Albert Einstein
died.  He was 76 years old.  Although Einstein's body was cremated, his
brain was saved. Dr.  Thomas S. Harvey, a pathologist at Princeton
Hospital, removed Einstein's brain on the morning of Einstein's death.  
What happened to the brain for years after this is somewhat of a
mystery.</p>

<h2>The Search</h2>
<p><img src="gif/levycar.gif" width="109" height="94" class="flr" 
alt="" />

In the mid 1970s, Steven Levy, a reporter for the <i>New Jersey 
Monthly</i>, hopped into his car and set out to find Einstein's brain.  
Mr. Levy published his story in 1978.  Mr. Levy discovered that Einstein's 
brain was still with Dr. Harvey who was now in Wichita, Kansas.  The brain 
was in two mason jars in a cardboard box that was marked with the words 
"Costa Cider." Most of the brain, except for the cerebellum and parts of 
the cerebral cortex, had been sectioned (sliced).</p>

<h2>The Paper</h2>
<p><img src="books.gif" class="flr" alt="" />
There are several published scientific studies that have examined 
Einstein's brain.  One of the first papers, titled "<a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3979509">On the Brain of a 
Scientist:  Albert Einstein</a>" was published in 1985 in the journal
<i>Experimental Neurology</i> (vol. 88, pages 198-204, 1985) and written
by <a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/faculty/diamondm.html">Marian C.
Diamond</a>, Arnold B. Scheibel, Greer M. Murphy and ...<strong>Thomas 
Harvey</strong>!</p>

<p>These scientists counted the number of <a href="cells.html">neurons
(nerve cells)</a> and <a href="glia.html">glial cells</a> in four areas
of Einstein's brain:  area 9 of the cerebral cortex on the right and left
hemisphere and area 39 of the cerebral cortex on the right and left
hemisphere.  Area 9 is located in the frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex) and
is thought to be important for planning behavior, attention and memory.  
Area 39 is located in the parietal lobe and is part of the "association
cortex."  Area 39 is thought to be involved with language and several
other complex functions.  The ratios of neurons to glial cells in
Einstein's brain were compared to those from the brains of 11 men who died
at the average age of 64.</p>

<p class="don">Approximate locations of cortical area 9 
and area 39<br /> 
<img src="gif/brod.jpg" width="200" height="164" alt="" /></p>

<h2>The Data</h2>
<p><img src="gif/einmath.gif" alt="" class="flr" />
The ratios of neurons to glial cells in Einstein's brain, as compared to
those in the 11 normal brains, were smaller in all four areas studied.
However, when the numbers were examined more closely with statistics, only
one area showed a significant difference - the ratio in the left area 39.  
In the left area 39, therefore, Einstein's brain had fewer neurons to
glial cells than the normal brains.  In other words, there were more glial
cells for every neuron in Einstein's brain.</p>

<h2><img src="gif/litbulb2.gif" class="flr" alt="" />
The Conclusion</h2>
<p>The authors concluded that the greater number of glial cells per neuron
might indicate the neurons in Einstein's brain had an increased "metabolic
need" - they needed and used more energy.  More recently, <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16675021">other 
researchers</a> have noticed differences in glial cells (e.g., larger 
astrocytic process) in Einstein's brain.  In this way, perhaps 
Einstein had better thinking abilities and conceptual skills.  </p>

<h2>The Problems</h2>
<p><img src="gif/ein2.gif" class="flr" alt="" />
Scientists are trained to read published papers carefully and to evaluate
the methods, results and conclusions of experiments.  Although it is
intriguing to use the results of this paper as an indication that
Einstein's genius was related to a particular brain region, it is perhaps
a bit too early for such a statement.</p>

<ol><li>First, the "normal" brains that were compared to Einstein's may 
not have been the best group for comparison.  In the 
comparison group, the average age of participants was 12 years younger 
than Einstein.  In fact, the youngest brain in this group was 
only 47 years old.  It is possible that the neuron to glial ratio seen 
in Einstein's brain was quite normal for his age and that the younger 
comparison group just did not show these changes yet. Also, the paper 
did not describe the background of the comparison group. What was their 
intelligence and cause of death?  Would these factors have anything to 
do with the observed brain differences?</li>

<li>Second, Einstein was the only subject in the experimental group. 
Additional studies are needed to see if these anatomical differences are 
found in other people with conceptual and mathematical skills like 
Einstein.</li>

<li>Third, it appears that only a very small portion of the four areas of
each brain was studied.  The paper states that "Four to six sections were
cut from each block, Einstein's and the controls?." However, after
staining, only <b>ONE</b> section from each block was studied!  There is
no indication that this single thin section was obtained from similar
regions of area 39 and area 9 from the different brains.  It is even
unclear how much of each section was counted.  Moreover, only the ratio of
neurons to glial cells was published.  The total number of cells that were
counted is not given in the paper.  This is important to get an idea of
how the experimenters came to their conclusions.</li></ol>

<p>It is important to remember that the areas 9 and 39 make important
connections with many other areas of the brain. To assign a particular
behavior or personality to a single brain area is too simple.  Parts of
the brain do not act by themselves.  Rather, complex behavior is the
result of many areas acting together.</p>

<h2>A Second Paper</h2>
<p><img src="gif/1020br.gif" class="flr" alt="" />
A second paper (<a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8805120">Neuroscience 
Letters</a>, 1996) describing Einstein's
brain was published in 1996. Einstein's brain weighed only 1,230 grams,
which is less than the average adult male brain (about 1,400 grams).  The
authors also reported that the thickness of Einstein's cerebral cortex
(area 9) was <strong>thinner</strong> than that of five 
control brains.  However, the DENSITY of neurons in Einstein's brain was 
greater.  In other words, Einstein was able to pack more neurons in a given area of
cortex.</p>

<h2>More Papers and The Future</h2> 

<p> Another study concerning Einstein's brain was published in the British 
medical journal <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10382713">The 
Lancet</a> (vol. 353, pages 2149-2153) on June 19, 1999.  In this paper, 
the external surface characteristics of Einstein's brain were compared to 
those from the brains of 35 men (average age, 57 years old). Unlike the 
brain of these 35 men, Einstein's brain had an unusual pattern of grooves 
(called <strong>sulci</strong>) on both right and left parietal lobes. 
This particular area of the parietal lobe is thought to be important for 
mathematical abilities and spatial reasoning.  Einstein's brain had a much 
shorter lateral sulcus that was partially missing.  His brain was also 15% 
wider than the other brains.  The researchers think that these unique 
brain characteristics may have allowed better connections between neurons 
important for math and spatial reasoning.</p>

<p>In 2012, photographs of the external surface of Einstein's brain were 
analzyed and published in the journal <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23161163">Brain</a>.  Scientists 
who studied these photographs noted that compared to other brains, 
Einstein's brain had a larger prefrontal cortex and expanded primary 
somatosensory and motor cortices especially in the face and tongue areas 
on the left hemisphere.  In 2013, photographs through the middle 
(midsagittal section) of Einstein's brain were used to <a 
href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/09/24/brain.awt252">compared 
the size of Einstein's corpus callosum</a> to that of right-handed, 
age-matched men and to a younger group of right-handed men.  In this 
study, Einstein's corpus callosum was found to be thicker in most areas 
compared to the corpus callosum of age-matched men and thicker in a few 
areas compared to the corpus callosum in younger men.</p>

<p>Although these results are interesting, it must be remembered that this
study had only ONE brain in the experimental group...Albert Einstein's
brain. It remains to be seen if other mathematical geniuses also show
these distinguishing brain characteristics.  Moreover, the study did not
investigate the brain at a microscopic level.  In other words, the study
says nothing about how neurons in these brains were connected and of
course, could not tell if there were differences in the way the neurons
functioned.</p>

<p>The importance of these differences is still unknown.  There are still
many questions about how the brain constructs personality, builds
intelligence and forms creativity.  Further research using modern <a 
href="image.html">brain imaging techniques (MRI/PET)</a> that look at the
anatomy and function of the brain in living geniuses may reveal what makes
these people such giants. </p>

Lenin was also studied by scientists.<br />
Lenin, who was leader of the Russian revolution in 1917, died in 1924.  
His brain was removed before his body was laid to rest in a mausoleum in
Moscow.  The Soviet government commissioned the well-known German
neuroscientist Oskar Vogt (born 1870, died 1959) to study Lenin's brain.
Vogt spent two and a half years preparing and studying Lenin's brain.  He
finally published a paper on the brain in 1929 where he reported that some
neurons (pyramidal neurons) in layer III of the cerebral cortex of Lenin's
brain were very numerous and large.  For more information about Lenin's 
brain, see:

Einstein died at 1:15 am on April 18, 1955, at Princeton Hospital in New 
Jersey. Later that day, Princeton Hospital pathologist Dr. Thomas Harvey 
performed an autopsy on Einstein and removed Einstein's brain. Harvey cut 
the brain into 240 pieces. He was very protective of the brain and kept it 
jars at his house. Over the years, Harvey gave several pieces of the brain 
to different researchers including Dr. Marian Diamond (UC Berkeley), Dr. 
Britt Anderson (University of Alabama) and Dr. Sandra Witelson (McMaster 
University, Hamilton, Ontario). Harvey moved around the country and he 
always brought the brain with him. Eventually, Harvey moved back to New 
Jersey. In 1996, Harvey brought the remaining pieces of Einstein's brain 
to Dr. Elliot Krauss, chief pathologist at Princeton Hospital. (Reference:

Einstein did not object to the study of his brain.  However, he did 
<strong>not</strong> want any of the resulting findings publicized.

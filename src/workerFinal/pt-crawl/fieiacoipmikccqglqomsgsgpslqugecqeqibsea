It is a linguistically complete, natural language. Itis the native language of many Deaf men and women, as well as somehearing children born into Deaf families.</p><p>ASL shares no grammatical similarities to English and should notbe considered in any way to be a broken, mimed, or gestural form ofEnglish. In terms of syntax, for example, ASL has a topic-commentsyntax, while English uses Subject-Object-Verb. In fact, in terms ofsyntax, ASL shares more with spoken Japanese than it does withEnglish. I have some information on <a href="jsl.html" class="slink">JapaneseSign Language</a> as well.</p><p>Some people have described ASL and other sign languages as "gestural" languages. This is not absolutely correct because handgestures are only one component of ASL. Facial features such aseyebrow motion and lip-mouth movements as well as other factors such as body orientation are also significant inASL as they form a crucial part of the grammatical system. In addition,ASL makes use of the space surrounding the signer to describe placesand persons that are not present.</p> <p>Sign languages develop specific to their communities and is notuniversal. For example, ASL is totally different from British Sign Language eventhough both countries speak English. Many people consider it a shame that there isn't a universal sign language (see below), however it's also a shamethat there isn't a universal spoken language, right? I personally enjoy seeingthe great variety and diversity of languages and the first topic of conversationwhen I meet a Deaf person from another country is an exchange of vocabulary: "How do you sign this? How do you sign that?"<p>Interesting, however, American Sign Language shares manyvocabulary terms with Old French Sign Language (LSF) because a French Deaf man, LaurentClerc, was one of the first teachers of the Deaf in the U.S. inthe nineteenth century.  So if you know ASL, you're better offtaking a vacation in France than in England!  But the French connection to America is rare, most sign languages develop independently and each country (and in some cases, each city)has their own sign language. </p><hr width=50%><h4>"International" Sign Language?</h4><p>There is no "universal sign language" or real "international sign language." There is a sign form called Gestuno that was developedby a committee of the World Federation of the Deaf. It's not reallya language, more a vocabulary of signs that they all agree touse at international meetings. But no one really signs Gestunoas a native language, just as no one really uses Esperanto astheir native spoken language*. In Europe, because of the increasingtrade and mobility, there is a lingua franca being developed, a creolesign language that some have taken to calling International SignLanguage. But neither Gestuno or the new European creole are truenatural languages from the linguistic perspective. Perhaps as a newgeneration of Deaf Euro-kids grows up, they will develop a new, natural    Euro-sign language.</p><p><font size=-2>* OK, some people have e-mailed vociferous complaints (see below)that Esperanto is indeed alive and kicking in some small, isolated communities (Berkeley, CA being one). </font> <h4>ASL Grammar and Linguistic Studies</h4><p>As mentioned above, ASL has a very complex grammar. Unlike spokenlanguages where there is just one serial stream of phonemes, signlanguages can have multiple things going on at the same time. Thismultiple segmentation makes it an exciting language for linguists to studyand a frustrating language for Deaf-impaired (aka, hearing) peopleto learn. ASL has its own morphology (rules for the creation of words),phonetics (rules for handshapes), and grammar that are very unlike thosefound in spoken languages. ASL and other sign languagespromise to be a rich source of analysis for future linguists to come.<p>If you're interested in sign language linguistics, one of the bestjournals to get started on is the journal <i>Sign Language Studies</i>, published by T.J. Publishers in Silverspring, MD.  Many university librariessubscribe to it as well, if yours doesn't, give them a little prodding.There have been few textbooks describing ASL grammar (because it's socomplex and hearing people still know so little of it), but the GallaudetGreen Book series (especially the teacher's edition) is quite useful.You can get it from <a href="companies.html#harris" class="slink">Harris Communications</a>or other <a href=companies.html class="slink">deaf bookstores</a>.<hr width=50%><a name="programs"><h2>How to learn ASL</h2></a><p>By far, the best way to learn ASLis through a course taught by a Deaf person. Snobby, self-righteous, pig-headed universitiessuch as the one I go to (no names mentioned.... Yale) often do not offerASL because "it is not an academic language" -- even though ASLis often said to be the fourth most commonly used language in the U.S.A. </p><p>Polemics aside, many community colleges do offer ASL courses, justphone them up and ask for their "extension" programs. I foundseveral in my local (New Haven) area that offered them. They usuallylast around a semester and the ones I found costed in the $300range for a once or twice a week course. People have toldme that it's much cheaper in other areas.<p> If you live in the vicinity of a school for the Deaf, they also usuallyoffer classes for learning ASL, often geared to the friendsand family of Deaf people. For example, the American Schoolfor the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford offers several.</p><p><b>Please do not e-mail me asking for schools that teach ASL in yourneighborhood.</b> I don't know all of the schools that teach ASL or evena small portion in the U.S. The best wayto start is to pick up your yellow pages and call your local community collegesor look in the blue pages for associations of and for the deaf.<p>Alysse Rasmussen has an excellent page of <a href=http://members.aol.com/alysser/aslpgs.htm class="slink">ASL resources</a></p>Finally, several places offer intensive summer ASL courses. GallaudetUniversity in Washington DC is one of them. Please see below undersummer ASL programs. I have one or two <a href="companies.html#asled" class="slink">commercialorganizations</a> that teach ASL listed in my <a href="companies.html" class="slink">Deaf Companies</a> page.<p><h4>Programs for ASL Study</h4><P>The summer program at Gallaudet is thought by many to be one of the bestdue to its intensity and almost total "immersion" intoDeaf culture while you are there.  The summer program consistsof 3 two-week intensive classes scheduled between mid-Juneand mid-August. Each one costs about $500 ($1000 if you areCanadian/foreign). You would typically take two courses duringthe summer, which would... including room and board and tuition,cost you about $2000 for four weeks ($3000 foreign/Canada).<p>This is the course that I took myself in the summer of 1995for four weeks (two sessions). All of the courses are taughtby Deaf people (of course) and are excellent. Being in DC andGallaudet is the closest to total immersion that you can get.Highly recommended.<pre>	Gallaudet University	800 Florida Ave., N.E.	Washington, DC 20002 USA	(202)651-5551 v/tty</pre><p>Aaron Laird writes to me about the program at the Universityof Tennessee: "The University of Tennesse has a wonderful program for anyone interested in Deaf Education.  A student majoring in this subject will spend an extra year to finish, but will receive a Masters Degree for the effort.  They offer classes in ASL from beginner to advanced in a four semester program.  The degree program also offers many classes in Education, Holistic Learning and Speech and Hearing Pathology.  The final year of the program is spent with a few lecture classes, but also entails an intership at Tennessee School for the Deaf.  TSD , like most specialized schools, houses students from all over the state.  It ranges from K-12 grades or the age of 21 (I believe).  I am bringing this to your attention because I didn't see any references for either of these two institutions on your WWW site.  So, I thought I would submit the URL's for both sites in case you wanted to add them."<p>Univ of Tenn: <a href="http://www.utk.edu" class="slink">http://www.utk.edu</a>and Tennessee School for the Deaf: <a href="http://mamclaus.opup.org/~tsd/" class="slink">http://mamclaus.opup.org/~tsd/</a><hr width=75%><a name="foreign"><h2>ASL as a foreign language:</h2></a><p>If you are trying to get your university or college to recognizeASL as a "foreign language," you might be interested in this articlein the journal <i>Sign Language Studies</i>:<pre>Armstrong, David F.	1988	Some Notes on ASL as a 'Foreign' Language.

They have a copyon   the web at their   <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/1997/12/18/feat/learning.1.html" class="slink">website</A>.It's a very nicely written piece and you can easily print out a copy to give to your school's administration.<hr width=50%><h2>ASL in Japan</h2><p>If you're interested in learning ASL and are in Japan, I highly recommend theJapan ASL Signer's Society (JASS). They're located in Iidabashi, Tokyo and teach ASL commercially.All of the teachers are quite good. I think at least 40% of the students are deaf themselves, socome to the classes with some understanding of JSL before trying to learn ASL:<pre>	JASS	Ponpian heights #702	4-4-5 lidabashi, Chiyoda-ku	Tokyo,  102-0072 Japan	Tel Fax 03-3264-8977	Email <script type="text/javascript" inserter="Spam Vaccine 1.3"><!--spam_vaccine( new Array("\&#74;\&#65;\&#83;\&#83;\&#74;\&#80;", "", "\&#97;\&#111;\&#108;", "", "\&#99;\&#111;\&#109;", " class=\"slink\""), new Array(), "../spam_vaccine/" ) ;//--></script><noscript>&#74;&#65;&#83;&#83;&#74;&#80;<img width="11" height="12" align="absmiddle" border="0" alt=" -at- " src="../spam_vaccine/at_medium.gif">&#97;&#111;&#108;.&#99;&#111;&#109;</noscript></pre><hr width=50%><a name="dictionaries"><h2>ASL Dictionaries and other learning material</h2></a><p>It cannot be stressed enough that ASL is not the same thingas looking up English words in an English-ASL dictionary andsigning them. This is like trying to speak French withonly a English-French dictionary.</p><p>The proper terminology for words signed using englishgrammar and word order is SEE (Signed Exact English), MCE(Manually Coded English) or simply signed english. These systemsare not the same as ASL, which has its own (beautiful) grammar appropriatefor a visual-spatial language. From a linguistic perspective, theseare only language systems and not natural languages in their own right.For further information on SEE/MCE, see Omer Zak's somewhat misnamed<a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/deaf-info/methods.html" class="slink">Methods of communicating with the deaf.</a><p> Many hearing people, interpreters,and Deaf people when signing to a hearing person use whatis commonly called Pidgin Sign English (PSE). There is a rangefrom very English-like PSE (more like sign supported english) to a very ASL-like PSE, which uses mostly ASL grammar and words, butmay not use the finer ASL grammatical points.<p>That all being said, none of these resources will "teach" you ASL,although the Lou Fant book might help you get an inkling ofwhat the grammar is like. Don't buy the ASL CD-ROM thinkingthat the QuickTime movies (which are arguably very nice) willteach you ASL, it only has individual signs and does notdeal with the grammar in any way. Heck, it doesn't evenbother teaching you how to count to ten....<p><h3>Online</h3><ul>   <li><a href=http://signserver.univ-lyon2.fr/ class="slink">CyberSigns Project -- online sign language dictionary!</a> -- and a link for frames compatible viewers <a href=http://signserver.univ-lyon2.fr/home/lsf-univ-lyonII.html class="slink">here</a></ul><h3>Physical Books</h3><dl><dt>Baker-Shenk, Charlotte and Dennis Cokely. 1991 [1981].<dd><cite>American Sign Language: a student text units 10-18.</cite>  Washington, DC: Gallaudet University Press.<p><dt>Fant, Lou. 1994.<dd><cite>The American sign language phrase book.</cite>  Chicago: Contemporary Books.<p><dt>Humphries, Tom. 1991.<dd>An introduction to the culture of Deaf people in the United States: content notes & reference materials for teachers. <cite>Sign Language Studies</cite>  (72): 209-240.<p><dt>Sternberg, Martin L.

In a lot of communities there are deaf and hearing impaired groups that have numerous functions that they encourage people who would like hearing people to come and learn sign language and more about the deaf community.  Learning in classes only helps so much but actually going to these functions help a lot.  I never took a sign language class but just growing up and talking to my parents and their friends taught me all I needed and made me very proficient.    --- Daniel Krpata <script type="text/javascript" inserter="Spam Vaccine 1.3"><!--spam_vaccine( new Array("\&#100;\&#107;\&#114;\&#112;\&#97;\&#116;\&#97;", "", "\&#118;\&#116;", "", "\&#101;\&#100;\&#117;", " class=\"slink\""), new Array("\&#100;\&#107;\&#114;\&#112;\&#97;\&#116;\&#97;", "\(", "\&#118;\&#116;", "\)", "\&#101;\&#100;\&#117;"), "../spam_vaccine/" ) ;//--></script><noscript>(&#100;&#107;&#114;&#112;&#97;&#116;&#97;<img width="11" height="12" align="absmiddle" border="0" src="../spam_vaccine/at_medium.gif">&#118;&#116;.&#101;&#100;&#117;)</noscript></pre><p><i>Editor's note:</i> I'd agree, hanging around and socializing withDeaf people is a great way to learn sign language. I've met many peoplewho first became interested when their college roommate (D) or friendtaught them and brought them into the community. HOWEVER, I shouldalso note that ASL has a very complex grammatical system that is VERYdifficult to pick without formal classes. If you just engage in conversationalpractice with Deaf people, often they will make amends for your badsigning (just as we, when dealing with foreigners or people who we thinkare hard of hearing,  SPEAK / SO / YOU / UNDERSTAND / YES ? -- a phenomenaknown as "foreigner speak"). <p>As a Japanese person, I get "foreign speak" from (hearing) Americans all the time,it trips me up. (grin) Anyway, the point of this editorial divergenceis to say that as well as socializing with Deaf people, you should alsoconsider taking a higher level ASL class at some point so as to be attuned topoints of ASL grammar that would never be apparent in just conversationaluse. At the very least, pick up Gallaudet's "Green Book" -- teacher'sedition and look over the grammatical notes. This is of specialnote of you want to become a terp. But if you're content to justengage in conversation, this might not be absolutely necessary.

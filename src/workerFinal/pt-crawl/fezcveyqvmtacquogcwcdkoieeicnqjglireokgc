<hr>
<p>There are a number of confusing changes of place name to be 
aware of in Botswana history. In much of Southern Africa, place names 
have changed when settler-given names are replaced by African ones; 
as for example when Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, 
became Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. In Botswana, however, 
this sort of change is less common: changes are more subtle and more confusing.</p>
<p>An example can be found outside Botswana, in the place once known as 
<strong>Mafeking</strong>. Although outside Botswana, Mafeking was 
the capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and is thus very much 
part of Botswana's history. (It is, incidentally, much more interesting 
for the historically-minded visitor than most of the guide-books suggest: 
start with the Mafikeng Museum which sells an excellent map of historic sites.)</p>
<p>The original settlement was the capital of the Barolong, known as
 <strong>Mafikeng</strong> (Setswana, = 
 "place of stones"<!--  [<a href="#mafikeng-note">see note</a>] -->) - note 
the order of "i" and "e". In 1885 Warren established a settler town 
nearby, which was known as 
<b>Maf<font color="#FF0000">e</font>k<font color="#FF0000">i</font>ng</b>. 
In some sources (e.g. Sol 
Plaatje, <cite>Mafeking Diary</cite>, ed. J. Comaroff, 3rd ed., 
1999) <strong> Mafeking</strong> is used for the settler town and 
<strong> Mafikeng</strong> for the Barolong capital. However, 
contemporary written sources more often use "Montsioa's town" or 
"the Barolong Stadt". When I visited in 1999, I found that in the 
kgotla, an old sign on the Barolong administrative building reads 
"The Mafeking Stad".</p>

<p>In the apartheid era, a "Tswana homeland" called Bophuthatswana 
(generally shortened to "Bop") was established. South Africa 
described it as an independent state, but no-one else did. Its 
capital was a new town, near Mafeking, named <strong> 
Mmabatho</strong>. In 1980 the settler town of Mafeking was 
transferred to Bophuthatswana, and renamed Mafikeng as a sign of its 
new Tswana-homeland identity.</p>

<p>In 1994, the Bophuthatswana homeland came to a rather violent end 
and was reincorporated into South Africa in time for the elections. 
Mmabatho, with its extensive government buildings, became the 
capital of the new North-West Province. The name Mmabatho, however, 
had unhappy connotations by now, and so the entire connurbation 
became <strong>Mafikeng</strong>.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of the use of Mafikeng for the settler town, the 
Barolong town is now often referred to as <strong>Mahikeng</strong> 
- the same word, but written according to the SeRolong dialect.</p>

<hr>
<p>A basic point to note is that Setswana, like other Bantu 
(now sometimes "Sintu") languages, uses <em>prefixes</em> to 
indicate singular and plural nouns. Nouns belong to a <em>noun 
class</em> 
which Indo-European speakers can think of as rather like a 
grammatical gender, but with 
prefixes instead of suffixes. Whereas Indo-European genders are 
"masculine", "feminine" etc., however, Bantu noun-classes have no 
relation to sex. Instead they relate to conceptual categories. Thus 
kinship terms tend to belong to 
one noun class, inanimate objects to another, abstract concepts to another, etc.
This correspondence is not however always consistent (just as in 
Indo-European
languages gender does not necessarily equate to sex).</p>

<p>Noun classes are indicated by prefixes which are added to a noun stem.
Sometimes with proper nouns the stem is 
written with a capital initial to clarify the construction; thus:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MoNgwato</strong>: member of the Ngwato morafe</li>

<li><strong>BaNgwato</strong>: plural of MoNgwato</li>

<li><strong>SeNgwato</strong>: Ngwato dialect</li>
</ul>

<p>It is useful to have some idea of these, even if one does not know
any other Setswana. The noun classes in Setswana are as follows:</p>

<p>Often you will recognize stems recurring with different
prefixes: the noun classes often have particular connotations which
indicate the meaning, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>kgosi (king) -&gt; bogosi (kingship)</li>

<li>lekgoa (white person) -&gt; Sekgoa (English language)</li>

<li>leburu (Boer) -&gt; Seburu (Afrikaans language)</li>
</ul>

<p>In these examples, bo- tends to indicate abstraction;
while se- can indicate a language.</p>

<p>Generally, the mo/ba- class includes terms for people, and kinship
terms for the "in" group. Thus Tswana merafe are BaNgwato, BaKwena etc.
The le/ma- noun class tends to include terms for people who are
not thus accepted, and in modern Setswana often sounds less polite.
Thus the forms "Lesarwa" and "Masarwa" (Bushman) sound uncomplimentary, and 
are in modern usage replaced by "Mosarwa" and "Basarwa".</p>

<p><a name="cole-note-mo-ma-nouns">Note</a> however that 
older usage, in "out-group" terminology, was less consistent:</p>
<blockquote>
The tribal names of certain peoples who have been in close
contact with the Tswana for a considerable period may have
the prefix <i>mo-</i>... or <i>le-</i>... in the singular
but almost invariably the prefix <i>ma-</i>... in the plural....

<p><u><a name="mafikeng-note">Note</a> on "Mafikeng</u>": having seen how 
Setswana noun classes work,
its formation as meaning "place of rocks" can now be understood.
"Rock" is <i>lefika</i>, le- being the prefix (singular) and -fika 
the root. In the plural it becomes <i>mafika</i>. (See table above).
The suffix -ng indicates a location, and causes the final vowel to
change to "e", hence:  Mafikeng.  Incidentally, "Lefika"
was used to translate "Peter" in the New Testament and is thus now a 
common personal name in Setswana.</p>

<p>The Ngwato state which the British encountered in the 19th century
was a multi-ethnic one. Its core group was the Ngwato clan whose totem
was <em>phuti</em> (duiker). However it also included a variety of
other groups, including other Tswana groups, Kalanga, BaKgalagari, and
Basarwa. Perhaps about one-fifth of the population were Ngwato in the strict
sense. (The 1942 census counted 17,850 Ngwato in a total African
population of 100,987 in the Bamangwato Reserve: Schapera 
<i>Ethnic Composition of Tswana Tribes</i> (1952) p. 65.)
According to the linguist Desmond Cole, writing in 1955,
the simple form <i>BaNgwato</i> is more recent than 
the forms which became <i>Bamangwato</i>:</p> 

<blockquote>
... in some of the cases where the tribal name derives from the 
name of a former chief, as most of them do, possessive forms are used, 
thus: <i>(batho) bagammaNgwato</i> ((people) of the mother of Ngwato), 
<i>(batho) bagaMalete</i> ((people) of Malete), <i>(batho) bagaMotlhware</i> 
((people) of Motlhware. 
<span class="x1">{Footnote&nbsp;2:&nbsp;Sometimes, but less typically, 
<i>bammaNgwato</i> (hence the popular "Bamangwato"),
<i> baMalete</i> and <i>baMotlhware</i>. 
Why <i>bagammaNgwato</i> should incorporate mma- (mother of) is not clear, 
though this occurs often in names of men in the Eastern dialects...}</span> 
Even in these cases, nevertheless, the modern tendency is to follow 
the practice elsewhere and to use the simple nouns <i>Bangwato</i>, 
<i>Balete</i>, <i>Batlhware</i>...

<p><small>(As regards the <i>-ga-</i> particle, Cole notes:</small></p>
<blockquote><small>In typical Tswana dialects, possessives formed from singular personal 
nouns of class 1a require the insertion of the element <i>-ga-</i>

<p>The term 'Bamangwato' seems to have been used, in the 19th and early 20th century,
for the <i>morafe</i> as a whole, including Tswana of other totems and
non-Tswana. It is unclear what usage was before this; the core group 
may possibly originally have been known as BaPhuti. Some writers have
used the terms Bamangwato and Ngwato to make a distinction:</p>

<blockquote>Without its prefix, 'Ngwato' implies a stricter ethnic distinction - 
the nuclear group which can trace its descent back to its founder called 
Ngwato. The term 'Bamangwato', on the other hand, is used by groups of 
other descent to identify themselves as nationals of the Ngwato state.  
We are faced with the paradox that only one-fifth of the 
'BamaNgwato' are in fact 'Ngwato'.
<br>
[Q. N. Parsons, "Khama III, the Bamangwato, and the British, 
with Special Reference to 1895-1923", (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, 
University of Edinburgh, 1973), Note on spelling and abbreviations.]</blockquote>

<p>By this usage, the term <em>Bamangwato</em> was used for the people as a whole. Hence 
the "Bamangwato tribe" was the kingdom ruled by Sekgoma&nbsp;I and Khama&nbsp;III.
The term "Bamangwato" is no longer current, having been replaced by the shorter 
"BaNgwato", and younger Batswana often do not 
even understand it. Some have the impression that it was an inaccurate 
colonial form like "Gaberones". 
(However, the form <i>GammaNgwato</i> has survived as a term for the Ngwato state 
or territory.) "BaNgwato" has the effect of replacing MmaNgwato with Ngwato
as the eponym. 
BaNgwato is now the only current form. Many of the
people who would in the old days have been "Bamangwato", however, do not
identify as BaNgwato, but as Kalanga (etc.) who live in the Central District
(the local government district which replaced the old Bamangwato Reserve).
The probable cause of this development is that, after Independence, the chiefs 
lost most (though not all) of their former direct authority and the concept of a
polity subject to a chief is no longer applicable. Instead, BaNgwato identity
tends to be now more ethnic in nature.</p> 

<p>The traditional origin of the <i>phuti</i> totem is that Ngwato, the 
founder of the <i>morafe</i>, escaped his pursuers thanks to the unusual
behaviour of a duiker which misled them. This story has parallels in the
traditions of some other <i>merafe</i> and it has been suggested that
the phuti totem may in fact be much older than Ngwato. On the other hand
it should be noted that there are definite historical examples of 
totems being changed to mark some major change such as a split.
Interestingly, in current oral tradition Ngwato is sometimes replaced by
a more recent figure, Khama&nbsp;I, with the pursuers becoming Matebele.

<big><strong>Bantu</strong></big></dt>
<dd>
<p>The "Bantu" languages are the members of a very large langauge-family
stretching across central, Eastern and Southern Africa. (It is 
a part of the larger Niger-Congo group.) The name is 
taken from the word for "people" which appears (in various forms)
in most. (In Setswana the word is "batho".) The term was sometimes
used to refer to a supposed cultural group who spoke these
languages, but academic opinion is that this is a mistake, and that
the term should be restricted to languages. In the apartheid era, 
the South African government used "Bantu" as a racial term, postulating
a supposed Bantu <em>racial</em> group.
The term "Sintu" has been proposed
as an alternative - using the "Si-" (in Setswana, "Se-") prefix
which indicates languages rather than groups of people, to
avoid the confusing implication of the "Ba-" in "Bantu". However,
this is not yet established as common.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<a name="Basarwa" href="#contents">Back to contents</a><br><br>
<big><strong>Basarwa</strong></big></dt>

<dd>

<p>Setswana term used in Botswana to refer to members of the Khoisan-speaking 
communities. Singular: Mosarwa; language: Sesarwa. In an earlier draft of 
this page, I wrote "The terms Mosarwa and Basarwa are of recent origin, 
and were formed by the modification of the older terms Lesarwa (singular) 
and <a href="#Masarwa">Masarwa</a> (plural). 
The le/ma- prefixes are often considered to be 
derogatory in modern Setswana, whereas the mo/ba- prefixes are used for 
Tswana groups and sound more polite." Since then, Dr Jeff Ramsay has 
pointed out to me that the form "Basarwa" in fact appears to be older 
than "Masarwa", at least in SeKgalagari. This could indicate 
that the "Basarwa" were demoted to "Masarwa" as their subjugation 
progressed. See also note above on 
<a href="#cole-note-mo-ma-nouns">the older <i>mo/ma</i> usage</a>.</p>

<p>Anthropologists generally use the terms San and Khoe (the latter in 
several variants), and Khoesan for the language group as a whole. 
"Khoe" is a more accurate representation of pronumciation and is thus 
increasingly replacingly the older "Khoi" etc. Khoe and San are 
linguistic terms, not ethnic terms, and hence
"Khoe-speaking" is sometimes preferred as more precise.</p>


<p>Neil Parsons comments: <small>(H-SAFRICA, 13 May 2005)</small></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Khoe [is] one of three major linguistic divisions of the Khoesan languages: Khoe in and around
the Kalahari middle (though later also spread to the Cape), with Northern  San to the north and Southern San to the south.</p>
<p>The great majority of so-called "Bushmen" or "Basarwa" in 
Botswana and probably Namibia are Khoe-speakers. The word <i>khoe</i> meaning "person" in
Khoe languages, while San means something like "them others" or worse in
Khoe languages. Hence Khoe people who are told that they are sometimes
called San in the outside world can be quite virulent in their rejection
of the term.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The people themselves have not as yet agreed on a single terminology.
Some activists and organizations prefer "San", which is probably
the most "politically correct" usage. However, in many places this
term is not recognized (or is actively disliked, see above) 
by the people concerned, who often use either
"Basarwa" or "Bushmen". Unfortunately both of these are also disliked
by some. "Basarwa" seems to some merely a euphemism for "Masarwa",
a name given by the oppressors.
"Bushmen" sounds somewhat derogatory to many Southern Africans,
though to western ears its connotations seem more positive. (This
may be connected with the fact that while to westerners "bush"
evokes nature in a positive/romantic sense, to Southern Africans
"bush" indicates the opposite of civilized.)</p>

<p>An example: the Dqae Qare project, a venture in cultural tourism
owned and operated by the Ncoakhoe people near Ghanzi (see 
<a href="../about/tour/hctour0.htm">page on historical/cultural tourism</a>)
is described on the publicity leaflet as "A community based tourism
project of the Bushmen of D'Kar, Ghanzi District, Botswana". Inside a 
note reads: "We are called San, or Bushmen. We call ourselves Ncoakhoe, the 
'red people'."</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kuela Kiema writes: "We are known by many names, most
of them imposed by our oppressors. We are called San, Bushmen, Khoisan
and/or Basarwa.... [In this book] I use the name Kua to refer to all
the San or Basarwa as perceived by the Dcuikhoe and the Dxanakhoe."

<a name="Batswana" href="#contents">Back to contents</a><br><br>
<big><strong>Batswana</strong></big></dt>

<dd>
<p>Plural of Motswana, i.e. Tswana people (plural). However, in modern
use the words Motswana and Batswana are also used to mean "citizen(s)
of Botswana". A Kalanga-speaking citizen of Botswana is not a Tswana person, 
but is a Motswana in the sense of citizen. This leads to some confusion;
for example in a recent local newspaper report a writer expressed puzzlement
about a statement in which San were distinguished from "Batswana". To avoid
this confusion, it is useful to use the form "Tswana" (even when 
<a href="#Prefixes">prefixes</a> are
being used for other Bantu names) to indicate Tswana ethnicity, since "Tswana"
is only used in the ethnic sense and not in the sense of "citizen of Botswana".</p>

<p>This usage is supported to some extent by Oxford's <cite>A Dictionary
of South African English</cite> (Oxford: OUP, 1996), which notes 
under "Tswana" that
"'Bechuana' has been replaced in <i>S. Afr. Eng.</i> by
'Tswana' (usually meaning a seTswana-speaking South African) and
'Batswana' (often meaning the citizens of Botswana, but see 
<small>MOTSWANA</small>." (p.&nbsp;749).
Under "Motswana" it gives (1) a member of the western Sotho 
[Tswana] ethnic/linguistic group (2) citizen of Botswana.

independence from South Africa was not recognized by the rest of

<p>This adjective from Botswana

Use "<a href="#Batswana">Motswana/Batswana</a>"

reference to the state, e.g. "the Botswana government"

The OED 
correctly notes "Motswana/Batswana" but
states that "<a href="#Batswana">Tswana</a>"

sometimes found, but "the Tswana government"

<dd>
<p>In the 19th century the term "<b>British South Africa</b>" meant a much wider
area than the modern Republic of South Africa. Firstly, "South Africa" 
meant "Southern Africa" until the creation of the Union of South Africa
in 1910 gave the term a more limited sense. Secondly, the term "British 
South Africa"  meant not only the territory directly controlled by the 
British government, but also the whole region under its dominance to a greater

overlord.</p>

<big><strong>Colony</strong></big></dt>
<dd>
<p>This term is slightly ambiguous. In the technical sense, a 
Colony in the British Empire was a territory which had become
"British soil" (in Africa, usually by annexation), with its
inhabitants being British subjects, as opposed to a 
<a href="#Protectorate">Protectorate</a>,
which was theoretically "foreign" land under British control.
In this sense, Basutoland (Lesotho) was a Colony while the B.P.
and Northern Rhodesia (after 1924) were Protectorates. 
However, the term "colony" is also used in a generic 
sense for all colonized dependent territories; in this 
sense all three would be "colonies". The technical
difference in status was not usually of great importance
in how colonies were treated.
(There were also other types of British dependency which
would mostly be "colonies" in this sense.)
The technicalities of colonies are very complicated, due to the rather random
way in which Britain set up colonial governments. One common misconception
is that colonies were part of the United Kingdom. They were <i>dependencies</i>
of the United Kingdom, but had a separate legal status and their own laws.</p>
<p><a href="#British-Bechuanaland">British Bechuanaland</a>, 
not to be confused with the Bechuanaland Protectorate, was a 
Colony in the technical sense. In fact the "British" in the
name indicated this distinction (this is found in several
colony names).</p>

<dd>
<p>In nineteenth-century practice, Tswana capitals were often
referred to by Europeans by the name of the <i>kgosi</i> (king or
chief). This was partly because of the fact that these settlements
relocated fairly frequently (see Neil Parsons, <a href="oldp.htm">
"The Abandonment of Phalatswe"</a>) and so place names were less
stable than names of <i>dikgosi</i>. Thus, the BaNgwato capital, at
Soshong, Phalatswe or Serowe, could be referred to as "Khama's
village" or simply "Khama's". The village of the BaTlokwa was in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries therefore known as
"Gaberone's" after the wily and extraordinarily long-lived Kgosi
Gaborone. Just across the Notwane from this village was a major
colonial base (or "Camp"): this became known as Gaberones, the
apostrophe somehow being lost. At Independence, Gaberones was
selected as the site for a new capital to replace Mafeking (which
was not even in the country). This was named <b>Gaborone</b>, the
correct spelling of the late kgosi's name. The traditional village
of the BaTlokwa is now known as Tlokweng.</p>

<p>A fairly common convention in Botswana historical writing is to
use "Gaberones" for the government base, and "Gaborone" for the
modern city. As well as avoiding anachronism, this has the advantage
of reminding the reader of the difference between a government Camp
and a city.</p>

came under the High Commissioner for South Africa. This was a somewhat
accidental hang-over from the nineteenth century; the three being the

<dd>
<p>The "Kalahari desert" in the centre and west of Botswana
is not a true sand desert, and is sometimes called a "thirstland". 
The original significance of the word is disputed. In modern
Setswana the word is "Kgalagadi", and this has sometimes been described as
"more correct". However, the older (Sotho-Tswana) populations of the area 
are not Setswana speakers, but a group known as BaKgalagari  (or BaKgalagadi,
or BaKalahari), and in their 
langauge the word is closer to "Kalahari" than to "Kgalagadi". The BaKgalagari
have remained a marginalized group, and the language is not yet well-established
in a written form. I have seen "SheKgalagari" in a recent multi-lingual church
publication. The Setswana forms "BaKgalagadi" and "SeKgalagadi" are probably
still the most common in academic use.</p>
<p>It is notable that early European visitors (even in areas now regarded as
Setswana) recorded a number of words in forms which look more like modern 
SeKgalagari than modern Setswana. (E.g. <em>Morimo</em> = modern Setswana 
<em>Modimo</em>, God.)</p>

<p>Setswana word often translated "tribe" or "nation".
Plural <i>merafe</i>. Pre-colonial Batswana were organized in a number of
relatively small independent kingdoms or chiefdoms, showing a
definite fissiparous tendency, but also showing an ability to absorb
and recoalesce. Refugees etc. joined as junior partners. This pattern
assisted the merafe in the north and west to successfully integrate
large numbers of non-Tswana during the 19th C. in conditions of varying
levels of subordination. By the later 19th C. the largest merafe,
such as GammaNgwato under Khama&nbsp;III were
emerging as multi-ethnic but Tswana-dominated states.
Thus as applied to the Tswana-ruled precolonial
states of the Bamangwato, BaTawana etc. and their colonial-era
successors "morafe" is perhaps better rendered "polity" since they were
essentially political rather than ethnic units.</p>

<p>The grammatical difference between English and the Bantu/Sintu

<ol type="i">
<li>Prefix omitted: This style is the most common in English

Thus "Sotho" is used without prefixes. "They spoke Sotho." 
"They were Sotho." This is probably the style most often 
used in most historical work published in the west.
However, it is sometimes disliked by speakers of the
languages, on the grounds that the form is spurious - 
that is, there is no word "Sotho" as such in the Sesotho
language, only the
words "Basotho", "Sesotho" etc. Hence "Sotho" is like
talking about the "Engl" people and language.</li>
<li>Prefix included, word capitalized as a single 
English word. E.g. "Setswana", "Motswana". This is the most 
common style in Botswana (used in both official and journalistic
writing in English), and is used in T.Tlou and A. Campbell, 
<cite>A History of Botswana</cite>.</li>
<li>Prefix included but not capitalized, stem capitalized. 
E.g. "He spoke seTswana." This is found (e.g.) in some articles

in Botswana, Lesotho etc.
has long been especially likely to retain prefixes,
including prefixes of non-Sotho-Tswana languages
(e.g. "the Wayeyi").
The fourth option, "SeTswana", 
has the advantage that it fits in with both the logic 
of English grammar (by capitalizing the first letter 
of a name) and the logic of Bantu grammar (by capitalizing 
the stem). The author of these notes favours using this style
but with the option to vary it when convenient (as in
"Sotho-Tswana" etc. etc.)</p>

<p>Some special problems:</p> 
<ol type="i">
<li>Including the prefix can present problems when less 
familiar Bantu languages are being referred to, as 
the prefixes will vary from language to language.
Hence prefixes are least likely to be retained when writing
about a wide range of languages.</li>
<li>"Batswana" has the dual meaning of "Tswana-speaking 
people" and "citizens of Botswana". 
Hence the trend to use "Tswana" for the former meaning 
(even if the writer is using prefixes otherwise) 
in order to avoid ambiguity.

<big><strong>Protectorate</strong></big></dt>

<dd>
<p>The concept of a Protectorate, an arrangement by which one state
had some sort of oversight or control over another state or territory,
developed over time. The earliest type was that of the control
of states which continued to exist as subordinate entities,
but in the 19th century Britain increasingly used Protectorates
in Africa as a form of control which avoided the responsibilities
which went with actual annexation (see <a href="#Colony">Colony</a>).
Theoretically it was "foreign" territory over which Britain exercised control.
At the end of the 19th century, partly as a result of the takeover
of Bechuanaland, the distinction became increasingly blurred,
and in the 20th century protectorates differed little from colonies
in law. Its inhabitants were British Protected Persons rather than
subjects, and in an important case (<i>The King</i> v. <i>Earl of
Crewe: Ex parte Sekhome</i>[1910] 2&nbsp;K.B. 576) it was ruled that
(at least in the B.P.) they lacked certain rights they would have
had in a colony. The status of British Protected Person does still
exist legally though it only applies in a few unusual cases.</p>
<p>The fact of the B.P. having been a Protectorate rather than a 
colony is frequently but mistakenly given as the reason for the
relatively low level of British interference. That 
the key really lies in the circumstances of the territory can be
seen from the fact that Basutoland (Lesotho) was an annexed Colony,
yet treated similarly to the B.P., whereas Northern Rhodesia
(Zambia), a colony with powerful settler influence, was a
protectorate.</p>
<p>The history of protectorate status is a very difficult subject
which requires study of both historical and legal technicalities,
and caution is advised. The classic work is W. Ross Johnston,
<i>Sovereignty and Protection: A Study of British Jurisdictional
Imperialism in the Late Nineteenth Century</i> (1973). For
the B.P. see A.J.G.M. Sanders, <i>Bechuanaland and the Law in
Politicians' Hands</i> (Botswana Society 1992).</p>
<p>The High Commission Territories were often referred to informally
as "the Protectorates".</p>

<big><strong>South Africa</strong></big></dt>
<dd>
<p>Until 1910 "South Africa" was a general term for the region, like "West 
Africa" today. Britain tried to manage the region as a whole through
the "High Commissioner for South Africa". In 1910 four British colonies
 - the Cape Colony, Natal, the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal - 
were combined as a new Dominion, the Union of South Africa. From this
point "South Africa" began to be restricted to this state, but the process
took a long time. Doris Lessing's characters, living in Southern Rhodesia, 
talk in the 1930s of being in "South Africa". The ambiguity was significant
in the case of the three High Commission Territories, as the Union of South
Africa hoped and expected to "incorporate" them as the 1909 South Africa Act 
had envisaged).</p>

<p>In 1961 South Africa became a republic and left the Commonwealth. The Union
became the "Republic of South Africa" (RSA), which should <em>not</em>
be written "South African Republic", as the South African Republic (q.v.)
was one of the 19th century Boer republics. The RSA was readmitted to the 
Commonwealth after the end of apartheid.</p>

<a name="Totem" href="#contents">Back to contents</a><br><br>
<big><strong>Totem</strong></big></dt>

<dd>
<p>In Tswana (and many other African) societies, each individual
has a totem, which is usually an animal. In Tswana society totems
are inherited from the father and thus pass like English surnames.
The totem animal had traditionally a status of veneration and 
avoidance: in particular, it was important not to eat one's totem. In modern
Tswana society this is not as strictly observed.</p>

<p><i>Merafe</i> have their totems, which are the totems of the core group,
but not all members of the <i>morafe</i> will necessarily share this. This
reflects largely the way in which the larger Tswana merafe were built up 
out of various groups in a complex multi-ethnic system. It tends to be assumed
that groups with the same totem are related, though this is not necessarily
true. Totems have occasionally been changed to mark some major
change: a traditional example is the adoption of the duiker (<i>phuti</i>)
by the BaNgwato (see above), but there are other examples within historical
record.</p>

<p>The older Tswana group names tend to refer to the totem: e.g. BaKwena,
they of the crocodile (Kwena) (although Bakwena tradition posits an
eponymous Kwena).</p>
<p>The word "go bina" (usually translated "dance") is used in connection
with totems, as Livingstone noted:</p>

<blockquote>They also use the word "bina", to dance, in reference to
the custom of thus naming themselves, so that, when you wish to ascertain
what tribe they belong to, you say, "What do you dance?"
It would seem as if that had been a part of the worship of old.<br>
[David Livingstone, <cite>Missionary Travels and Researches in 
South Africa</cite>, chapter 1.]
</blockquote>

<p>No direct evidence of such a dance ceremony, however, has been found
in Tswana culture, and other writers have argued that the word may
never have meant "dance" in this context. It is interesting to note that
among the Khoesan peoples of Botswana there are indeed important animal
dances in which, for example, a dancer dances the eland, the lion, etc.</p>

<a name="Tribe" href="#contents">Back to contents</a><br><br>
<big><strong>Tribe</strong></big></dt>

<dd>
<p>This term causes a great deal of confusion. In the pre-colonial and colonial 
periods, there was a general idea among Europeans that African society was
"tribal", without, however, a clearly agreed definition of what this meant.
Most commonly "tribe" has been used to denote ethnic groups, such as 
Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda, and it is in this sense that the pejorative
term "tribalism" is understood. <small>(Modern Africans are often ambivalent about
the term, pointing out that in Europe the Serbs are "ethnic" whereas
in Africa groups are "tribal". Europeans use "tribal" for their own conflicts
only when wishing to harshly condemn the participants, as in some impatient
British comment on Northern Ireland.)</small></p>
<p>However, in the Bechuanaland Protectorate <em>tribe</em> was used to translate
<em>morafe</em>. While "morafe" does have a general sense of "nation",
the 19th C. and colonial-era merafe had become polities of multi-ethnic
composition. (See <a href="#Morafe">merafe</a>).
 Hence the "Bamangwato Tribe" was the <em>multi-ethnic</em>
polity ruled by Khama III and Tshekedi Khama. Official post-independence Botswana
usage has continued this meaning of "tribe". However, the term has also been
used in Botswana (both before and after Independence) to denote <em>ethnicity</em>,
as in for example "the Kalanga tribe" or "the Wayei tribe" - ethnic groups
which in colonial times were part of multi-ethnic Tswana-ruled polities.
Discussions, such as the recent debates in Botswana over the proposal to
extend the membership of the House of Chiefs, has often been seriously confused
by failure to distinguish the two quite different senses.</p>

<big><strong>Villages</strong></big></dt>

<dd>
<p>Early European visitors to pre-colonial Botswana described the
settlements as "towns", on the basis that they were very large
and well-ordered, in some cases larger than most Cape Colony "towns".
However, it later became customary to refer to them as "villages".
This may have been because they were, despite their size, agricultural 
settlements (whereas European "towns" were settlements whose inhabitants
did not themselves generally practise agriculture but lived by trade etc.)
One must however note a general pattern: in pre-colonial times Tswana
society was often described by words suggesting importance in European
terms - "town", "king", "house" etc. - whereas in colonial times these
tended to be reduced to "village", "chief", "hut" etc.
This usage resulted in the description of Serowe as "the
largest village in Sub-Saharan Africa", which often puzzled
European readers, who wondered how this differed from being
the smallest town.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the term "village" has become established as making
a useful distinction. between the traditional Tswana settlement,
built probably on tribal land, and the new "town" built on alienated
land. Connected with this is the way in which Batswana 
conceptualize "urban" and "rural". "Rural" is wherever you
live according to kinship patterns; "urban" is wherever you do
not. Thus, Serowe is a village, while Jwaneng is a town.</p>
<p>Some historians have suggested the 
term "agri-town" for the traditional
settlement.</p>

Le Cellier is an important site a few hundred metres away, which yielded many Aurignacian tools and stone engravings of vulvas. The deposits of le Ruth above Sous le Ruth were excavated by Robert Pagès, Denis Peyrony, and Otto Hauser.

In both cases we express the largest reservations in publishing the results. <br /><br />In fact, we must remember that the layer B contained two superimposed  hearths. <br /><br />However, in his study of lithic material, <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Peyrony (1909)</span></a> has described  Aurignacian blades and  La Gravette points as coming from the same layer B. The industries may have become mixed, and one should therefore be extremely careful. In addition, the series from the  the Museum of Les Eyzies is of uncertain provenance because of the very ambiguous labelling of  these objects.  All these facts lead us therefore to include the bone industry of le  Ruth as the only hope for drawing  meaningful conclusions.<br /><br /><br /><b>Study of bone tools.<br /><br /></b>The two sets of objects studied correspond in principle with the material collected in layer B. However,  doubts remain regarding the set of artefacts from the Museum of Les Eyzies, which we will consider separately.<br /><br /><br /><b>Collection of the  Musée des Antiquités nationales.<br /><br /></b><br /><b>Points and awls</b> -  a double ended bone point has one extremity  sharply bevelled while the other is thin without being bevelled. The middle section of the shaft is circular. It is very possible that the second bevel is under development as traces of scraping  are still visible.<br /><br />A mid-basal  fragment of a triangular shaped object in  reindeer antler, and whose edges converge  suggests that it had  been  a point. The cross section is elliptical. The base is thinned and eroded. The upper surface has two grooves parallel to each other and to the axis of the piece.<br /><br />An awl  made from  a diaphysis, the long bone of an animal,  sawn longitudinally and with elliptical cross section has the head   formed by carving  of the epiphysis. Another awl or poinçon, from the same industry, whose tip is broken,   is serrated obliquely. <br /><br /><br /><b>Smoothers</b> -  one is a bone blade, thin,  and narrow at the rounded apex, but broken at its base. The other, a larger piece of reindeer antler, of concavo-convex section presents an apex which is  tapered, straight, and polished, and which would justify the name of smoother. <br /><br />But the spongy tissue of the lower face, with a cavity dug too deeply to be accidental, casts doubt on this assessment.   It could perhaps be a piece for lifting the skin during skinning (écorçoir)<br /><br /><br /><b>Various tools</b> - a strange object in the form of a fragment of antler literally ' squared'. The edges are sharp. One side is serrated obliquely.<br /><br />Finally, a fragment of a b&acirc;ton percé in  reindeer antler   completes the inventory of this restricted material.<br /><br />Collection of the Musée national de Préhistoire des Eyzies<br /><br /><b>Points</b> -  three in number, unfortunately none of which is  entire. The most interesting, in bone,   is entirely  coated with ochre. It is   triangular in shape. The cross sections are elliptical on the shaft and circular in the vicinity of the tip. It is also chipped, as well as the basal part of the object, without however overriding the piece's claim to being a work of art. <br /><br />The other two of reindeer antler are also fragmentary. Both are quite thick and triangular in shape. Sections of the shafts are piano-convex. One is tapering towards the tip more than the other. The two bases are broken.<br /><br /><b>Smoothers</b> - there are two.  The first, very similar to the one held in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, is  a narrow, thin blade of reindeer antler, with a   plano-convex cross section, the apex  being of rounded  spongy antler. The upper surface is smooth. The spongy tissue of the lower face is scraped. The other is  a thick baguette  of reindeer antler.  It is broken near its apex, which is of spongy material.  <br /><br /><b>Compresseurs</b> -  There is only one, very ordinary, made  on a wide and thick splinter with two separate compression points on opposite ends. <br /><br />We emphasise the fact that the material from l'abri Pagès  should be treated with caution. It  is, further, a bit atypical and allows no satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>The Pagès Collection from le Ruth</h2><br /><center><b>Jean Pagès, the original owner of the site, made this collection at the time of the major excavations from the tools collected at le Ruth, ca 1908.  <br />It is the only good collection now remaining, with the rest of the tools and other artefacts scattered far and wide, and mostly inaccessible.

The technique died out with the passing of the Neanderthals, about 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP.  <br /><br />At top right, Levallois blades modified to serve as knives. Typically one side was modified with an abrupt retouch to blunt the sharp edge. Two of these knives have a notch in the blade, perhaps so that they could also serve for scraping spear shafts smooth. <br /><br />In the centre, three racloirs or side scrapers, again using the Levallois technique. Racloirs are typical tools of the Mousterian tradition. </p><br clear = "all"><p>On the right, burins or engravers, of the Périgordian tradition. It lasted from 35&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP to ca 20&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP. The earliest culture in the tradition is known as the Châtelperronian which produced denticulate tools and distinctive flint knives. It is argued that this was superseded by the Gravettian with its Font Robert points and Noailles burins. The tradition culminated in the proto-Magdalenian.<br /><br />The burin second from the right looks like a beaked burin, characteristic of the Middle Aurignacian, about 29&nbsp;000 BP.  The burin on the right looks more like a simple double bevelled burin, a dihedral burin made on a blade by removing two chips from a truncated blade to form the bevel. It does, however, have the characteristic front spall, not vertical in this case, of the beaked burin. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2014<br />Text: Adapted from Wikipedia<br />Source: Musée du Ruth, Sous le Ruth</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images19/sousruthIMG_1032.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/sousruthIMG_1032sm.jpg" alt = "Sous Ruth" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><a href="images19/sousruthIMG_1031.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/sousruthIMG_1031sm.jpg" alt = "Sous Ruth" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p>Levallois blades, and a racloir on a Levallois blade. <br /><br />The Levallois technique is a name given by archaeologists to a distinctive type of stone knapping developed by humans during the Palaeolithic period.<br /><br />It is named after nineteenth century finds of flint tools in the Levallois-Perret suburb of Paris in France. The technique was more sophisticated than earlier methods of lithic reduction, involving the striking of flakes from a prepared core. A striking platform is formed at one end and then the core's edges are trimmed by flaking off pieces around the outline of the intended flake. <br /><br />This creates a domed shape on the side of the core, known as a tortoise core as the various scars and rounded form are reminiscent of a tortoise's shell. When the striking platform is finally hit, a flake separates from the core with a distinctive plano-convex profile and with all of its edges sharpened by the earlier trimming work.<br /><br />This method provides much greater control over the size and shape of the final flake which would then be employed as a scraper or knife although the technique could also be adapted to produce projectile points known as Levallois points.<br /><br />The technique is first found in the Lower Palaeolithic but is most commonly associated with the <b>Neanderthal Mousterian industries</b> of the Middle Palaeolithic. In the Levant, Levallois methods were also in use in the Upper Palaeolithic and later.<br /><br />The distinctive forms of the flakes were originally thought to indicate a wide ranging Levallois culture but the wide geographical and temporal spread of the technique has rendered this interpretation obsolete.<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008<br />Text: Adapted from Wikipedia<br />Source: Musée du Ruth, Sous le Ruth</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images19/levalloisanimation.gif" title="Click to see animation"><img src="images19/levalloisstill.gif" alt = "Levallois technique animation" width="235" height="200" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><a href="images13/levalloispointanimation.gif" title="Click to see animation"><img src="images13/levalloisanimationsm.gif" alt = "Levallois point making animation" width="290" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Levallois technique animation for a blade (left) and a point (right). <br /><br />Click on the images to expand and view the animation of how the techniques are performed.    <br /><br />Photo: Wikimedia commons, José-Manuel Benito Álvarez<br />Date: 3 January 2007<br />Permission: This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic license</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br /><p><a href="images19/levalloiswiki.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/levalloiswikism.jpg" alt = "Levallois point" width="490" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p>Levallois point - Different views of the same specimen, flint. <br /><br />Dimensions 	8.9 × 4.8 × 1.1 cm (3.50 × 1.89 × 0.43  in)<br /><br />Current location: Muséum de Toulouse, France<br />Object history: Findspot: Beuzeville, Eure, France.<br />Source/Photographer: Didier Descouens, 4 October 2010<br />Permission: Licensing: I, the copyright holder of this work, hereby publish it under the following license:attribution share alike <br />This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.	<br /><br />(<i>&#8239;Didier Descouens is one of this world's treasures.

The branches of the elder are hollow, filled with pith which is easily removed. <br /><br /> To make an axe, people either ground it to shape, or knapped the stone.  to attach the handle they had to drill a hole.  Thanks to the surviving traces of work on equipment and intermediate goods and by practical tests of experimental archeology, we can now reconstruct the technology of the stone drill.<br /><br /> A hollow elder wand was rotated by pulling a bow back and forth. When sand is added  between the soft wooden tube and the  stone, it adds  friction to the drilling. In  the middle of the drill hole a small cylinder forms, which falls out at the end when the hole is bored completely through the stone.  Such cores have been found in Neolithic settlements. Thus, the technique of drilling with a hollow wand has been established.  It remains uncertain, however, exactly what the  drilling device looked like. The drill reconstructed here,  shows only one way in which the  drilling of the stone could have  been performed.<br /><br /> The wooden beam which is located by the fork shown, has a stone on the far end out of frame which provides weight to bear on the rotating rod.  Put  some sand between the hollow rod and the rock to be drilled. Take the  the bow in one hand and pull lightly on it to tighten the cord, then move the bow back and forth slowly.The elder wand rotates and rubs the sand against the stone surface.<br /><br /> It takes between 10 and 20 hours, depending on the hardness of the stone, to drill the hole through the axe head. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008<br />Source and text: Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe Germany</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images19/sousruthIMG_1034.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/sousruthIMG_1034sm.jpg" alt = "Sous Ruth" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Tools with peduncles.  <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008<br />Source: Musée du Ruth, Sous le Ruth</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images33/img_3880ruthmusee.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images33/img_3880ruthmuseesm.jpg" alt = "le Ruth tools" width="404" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Points and burins, mostly made on flakes, and thus most likely Mousterian. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2014<br />Source: Musée du Ruth, Sous le Ruth</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images33/img_3882ruthmusee.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images33/img_3882ruthmuseesm.jpg" alt = "le Ruth tools" width="383" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Points and Levalloisian burins, with a few  blades at the lower right. <br /><br />Levallois burins are typically made on a point, a triangular flake on which a burin spall has been detached from the distal (far) end, that is, in this case,  at the point. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2014<br />Source: Musée du Ruth, Sous le Ruth</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images33/img_3884ruthmusee.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images33/img_3884ruthmuseesm.jpg" alt = "le Ruth tools" width="401" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /> Levalloisian burins, and  blades with the back retouched so that it is blunted. <br /><br /> In this way the knife may be used  without a handle, with the index finger on the blunted back edge to provide control and pressure. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2014<br />Source: Musée du Ruth, Sous le Ruth</p><br clear = "all"><br /><!-- <p><a href="images19/sousruthIMG_1030.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/sousruthIMG_1030sm.jpg" alt = "Sous Ruth" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Three Périgordian burins.

L. Collie in 1927. It was found on the surface of Layer II of Collie, Layer A of Peyrony, with the engraved face turned towards the bottom. For Peyrony, he remarked that it is a stone much less voluminous, carrying a bizarre design. The image appears to be the head of a horse, and on the right a vulva not well represented. These designs are united by a line which seems to indicate a real relation existed between the two.  <br /><br />The block is a thick piece of limestone, 11 cm average thickness, subhexagonal shape, the side faces vertical or slightly oblique. The base is horizontal. The engraved upper  face  (48 cm x 26 cm) presents two major accidents peripherals. <br /><br />The top left edge is truncated by an oblique plane whose connection with the horizontal plane of the upper surface is blunt. This oblique plane is affected by burning. This is not an accident after Palaeolithic decoration. In the middle, the bottom edge is presented as an internal angle. The apex of this angle is close to the geometric center of a bowl with  a flat bottom, one third has disappeared.  <br /><br />This bowl or large cup, tapered, was obtained by a narrow pick whose impacts are so regular and so close to each other, we can speak of modelling by pecking. This bowl is important as it has localized red marks on the back and sides. This coloration of the rock is absent in its immediate vicinity, but occurs also at the center of the face and  along its upper edge, center and left. It may be seen also, in places, on the bottom and the side faces of the block. It evokes, above all, a color of limestone, light tan naturally, near a heat source. It is likely that this block was in the vicinity of a hearth.  <br /><br />The hypothesis that it was a lamp seems less acceptable, because the bowl does not have black marks. However we must note three small blackish spots. Two very diffuse, circular in shape, are located at two irregular pitted cups. The third, elongated, is located in the upper right quadrant, is black and more sustained.</blockquote> <br /><br />Text above from <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Delluc (1978)</span></a>  <br /><br /> <br /><br />--><p><a href="images19/colliercoupe.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/colliercoupesm.jpg" alt = "Cellier vulvas" width="486" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Abri Cellier stratigraphy.  <br /><br /> Note that there are no Mousterian deposits shown, although Peyrony refers to them as being present in his first surveys of the site at Abri Cellier.  <br /><br />(<i>Just as at Laugerie Haute and Laugerie Basse, the overhanging roof collapsed, possibly for the same reason -

L. Collie in 1927. It was found on the surface of Layer II of Collie, Layer A of Peyrony, with the engraved face turned towards the bottom. For Peyrony, he remarked that it is a stone much less voluminous, carrying a bizarre design. The image appears to be the head of a horse, and on the right a vulva not well represented. These designs are united by a line which seems to indicate a real relation existed between the two.  <br /><br />The block is a thick piece of limestone, 11 cm average thickness, subhexagonal shape, the side faces vertical or slightly oblique. The base is horizontal. The engraved upper  face  (48 cm x 26 cm) presents two major accidents peripherals. <br /><br />The top left edge is truncated by an oblique plane whose connection with the horizontal plane of the upper surface is blunt. This oblique plane is affected by burning. This is not an accident after Palaeolithic decoration. In the middle, the bottom edge is presented as an internal angle. The apex of this angle is close to the geometric center of a bowl with  a flat bottom, one third has disappeared.  <br /><br />This bowl or large cup, tapered, was obtained by a narrow pick whose impacts are so regular and so close to each other, we can speak of modelling by pecking. This bowl is important as it has localized red marks on the back and sides. This coloration of the rock is absent in its immediate vicinity, but occurs also at the center of the face and  along its upper edge, center and left. It may be seen also, in places, on the bottom and the side faces of the block. It evokes, above all, a color of limestone, light tan naturally, near a heat source. It is likely that this block was in the vicinity of a hearth.  <br /><br />The hypothesis that it was a lamp seems less acceptable, because the bowl does not have black marks. However we must note three small blackish spots. Two very diffuse, circular in shape, are located at two irregular pitted cups. The third, elongated, is located in the upper right quadrant, is black and more sustained.</blockquote> <br /><br />Text above from <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Delluc (1978)</span></a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />A flat stone, roughly rectangular, 54 cm by 25 cm (fig 5, No. 1) presents, on a longitudinal edge,  three figures of which one (c) is a pubic triangle with softened angles, or maybe just an external genital organ  (b and d) while  (a) is located on the opposite side, more deformed, referring to the same subject.

A quarry on an open scree slope along the rural road from le Moustier to Ruth  in this section of land uncovered many objects made of flint. Those at the base were related to those of the Mousterian and the upper third was  Aurignacian in age.<br /><br />In 1909, I made a survey trench midway between the rocks and the quarry. Almost at the surface, I found some  Aurignacian pieces, but at three metres deep, I reached a brown layer, 5 to 10 cm. in thickness, containing a quite crude Mousterian industry, many discarded flakes, but few retouched pieces. This horizon appeared to  extend on both sides of the slope.<br /><br />On the eastern side, Lucas, then an assistant teacher at Les Eyzies, found tools from  the same period, at the end of the line of rocks, near the house at that location.<br /><br />In 1928, towards the west, Dr. Ami did some research at the same height, some 30 metres from the Faure house. In a shallow archaeological level, and over the whole area, he recovered Mousterian tools identical to the previous two deposits. This deposit appears to be on a rocky terrace, extending from one valley to the other, a length of about 120 metres.<br /><br /> More superficial excavations, made on the slope, against the bottom of the Cellier  house, had revealed Aurignacian pieces  everywhere, it seemed, of a deposit in place at the foot of the rocks under large boulders. A trench found archaeological layers at this point.<br /><br />In 1927, Professor Collie, of the Logan Museum of Beloit (Wisconsin, USA) leased the area with the object of excavating. The deposit had been classified, the excavations there were authorised by the Administration des Beaux-Arts, subject to:<br /><br />1 They are overseen by a qualified representative of the state.<br /><br />2 There would be an important amount of residual deposits left under the shelter.<br /><br />3 That all the pieces found were to be shown to the delegate of Fine Arts. <br /><br />4 That a representative set of items would be deposited with the Prehistoric Museum Les Eyzies<br /><br />5 That the art work, if any was found, would revert to the state.<br /><br />The work began in 1927.<br /><br />Stratigraphy - a trench perpendicular to the bottom of the shelter began to expose a portion of a rocky terrace which was on average 4 metres wide, ending in a slope, completely masked by the scree slope, leading to the second terrace, on which is the  Mousterian deposit.<br /><br />The cut, recorded in front of this witness, gave the following superposition:<p><a href="images19/celliercoupe.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/celliercoupesm.jpg" alt = "Cellier coupe" width="421" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Abri Cellier stratigraphy.   <br /><br /> Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Peyrony (1946)</span></a> </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br />A - On the basement rock lay the first archaeological layer,   of 40 cm maximum thickness.<br /><br />B - 20 cm limestone scree.<br /><br />C - a second archeological layer 30 cm thickness, which was noticed previously.<br /><br />D - large boulders from the collapse of the vault of the shelter and behind that,  scree of smaller dimensions.<br /><br />E - then came a new archaeological horizon  10 cm thick at the rear, ending in a corner 2 metres further on.<br /><br />F - The whole slope was covered with scree and topsoil. <br /><br /><center><b><big>Description of the Industries</big></b></center><br /><br /><center>Layer A - Aurignacian I</center><br /><br />This consisted mainly of small dry limestone boulders, coming from the crumbling of  rocks because of frost action, mixed with earthy elements deposited by wind (we did not notice anywhere the reddish soil of the plateau laid down by small ephemeral streams as is seen in the Mousterian deposits).

On the left a deep and very regular cupule  (e) is in connection with these drawings.<br /><br /><p><a href="images19/cellierfig5.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/cellierfig5sm.jpg" alt = "Cellier fig 5" width="498" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Figure 5<br /><br />Abri Cellier - Vulvas, a cupule, and a penis.    <br /><br /> Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Peyrony (1946)</span></a> </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br />This combination of images and various signs on the same stone  certainly had meaning to the author, and a magical value that escapes us completely. We met comparable sets in the Aurignacian of La Ferrassie.<br /><br />5 - On two big boulders, of which the  parts emerging from the layer had been flattened , one can see many vulvas, some well modelled.<br /><br />6 Finally, on a small stone, we see engraved with a wide and deep stroke, an image that can only be attributed to a  male sexual organ (Fig 5, No. 2)<br /><br /><b>Wildlife - quite abundant faunal remains consisted mainly of reindeer</b>. <br /><br />This is followed, in descending order, by horses, cattle (aurochs and bison), ibex, red deer, chamois, roe deer (<i>Capreolus capreolus</i>)  as well as  rare specimens of wolf, ordinary fox and brown bear, as well as a lion canine tooth.<br /><br />  <br /><br /><center>Layer B - Sterile layer</center><br /><br /> This layer was 20 cm deep at the back  and 70 cm deep at the front. It was formed from dry  limestone gravel and fine particles from the disintegration of the rock of the abri after its abandonment. It was completely sterile.<br /><br /><center> Layer C - Aurignacian I, II, III</center><br /><br />The soil appeared to have been somewhat levelled by the new occupants. The archaeological layer 30 cm thick at the front,  tapering to the rear. A brown colouration to the sediments was observed in places, as well as  fireplaces and and dry limestone deposits everywhere. <br /><br />Lithic Industry - In this layer,  the large and beautiful  retouched blades and notched bottleneck blades were no longer found. The blades were smaller, with less marked retouching. Scrapers (grattoirs) were abundant, made on the tip of the blade, single and double, and were thick (carinated and muzzle types,  with a predominance of the latter).<br /><br />Burins (straight and angled, with a few busqués)  were more numerous than in the basal layer,  A. As for layer A,  picks, awls, cores, hammers and makeshift tools completed the list of tools.<br /><br />Bone Industry <br /><br />The base layer has provided some points with bases with small slits and the upper layer, a few large diamond-shaped flattened points (Fig. 3, No. 5) and a biconical shape with an oval cross section (Fig. 3, No. 7). These last two characterise the Aurignacian II and III, independent of one another and the first facies, in the large gisement or archeological site of Ferrassie (1)<br /><br />It was also gathered a few teeth pierced and a small band has perforated end arches.<br /><br />This layer does not give works of art in the area excavated.<br /><br />Wildlife - The remains of reindeer were abundant.  Horses were more likely than in the lower layer. Cattle (Aurochs and Bison), ibex, red deer, chamois there were a few elements, as well as wolves and foxes.<br /><br /><center>Layer D - Sterile Layer</center><br /><br />As before, with the previous layer, there were  large blocks from the collapse of the roof of the shelter. Between them and the cliff, there was a thickness of 50 cm of limestone scree, small and medium-sized, completely sterile.<br /><br />Similar collapses were recorded in the same industrial horizon at  Sergeac in the Abris Blanchard des Roches (1) and Castanet (2).<br /><br />But, in contrast to these, where the collapse of the roof had been total, those of the Abri Cellier  suffered only a partial collapse. Between the large boulders and rocks in the front and the  back, there was a corridor which was later occupied by another tribe whose residence appears to have been of relatively short duration, the archaeological level was, at the area excavated, only 10 cm thick at the back, tapering to nothing about 2 metres towards the front of the shelter. <br /><br /> <center>Layer E  - Perigordian V</center><br /><br /> This was brown and  rich. It yielded,  amongst many tools, scrapers, usually short on the tips of blades, singles and double, rarely thick; many burins, especially on a corner, a few burin-grattoirs, awls, prismatic cores, hammer stones, many unfinished small blades, thin and narrow (Fig. 6, No. 6) and small blades made into burins.<p><a href="images19/cellierfig6.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/cellierfig6sm.jpg" alt = "Cellier fig 6" width="498" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Figure 6<br /><br />Abri Cellier - Perigordian 5   <br /><br /> Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Peyrony (1946)</span></a> </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br />Very sharp tanged points  (Fig. 6, No. 1 & 2) spikes (Fig. 6, No. 3 and 4) and blades (Fig. 6, No. 5) with a blunted edge, of medium and small size and Gravettian in type.

Occurring  at the same time, they appear due to a common cause which could only have been an earthquake. <br /><br /> (<i>Note, the likelihood is that the cause of the collapse was from a build up of volcanic ash on top of the abris, and when this ash  became wet and very heavy after rain, the roofs collapsed - Don</i>) <br /><br /> 3 - Lithic industries and the bones from  layers A and C are identical to those that have been found in the three Ferrassie  lower Aurignacian layers,  and those of the E layer are identical to those of the Ferrassie Perigordian V. <br /><br />4 - The drawings discovered in the lower level show that art has made its debut, but with  the most archaic designs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><b>General considerations on Aurignacian art</b></center><br /><br />All cave drawings described above belong to the first phase of  Aurignacian art and therefore represent  its infancy, at least in the south-west of France.<br /><br />Animal figures, often semi-natural, half artificial, oversimplified, include only the head (Fig. 4, No. 4) sometimes only part of the head (Fig. 4, No. 1 and 2) but with the essential features needed to characterise the animal.<br /><br />As well as  these crude animal images, we found a significant number of more or less diagrammatic  female genitals.<br /><br />In the La Ferrassie Aurignacian, we have identified many of these drawings.  Some of these representations of female genitals are distinctly triangular with none or few softened edges, others are more schematic, then some are simplified to the  point that we could interpret them, if we had had a series of intermediaries.<br /><br />In the Abri Cellier these drawings are nearly all deformed. Their number allows us to suppose that they played a major role in the daily lives of these people.<br /><br />We know that in  Europe a lot of  Aurignacian and  Perigordian deposits have produced feminine human statuettes, showing that  our  distant ancestors worshipped  the female, mother  of mankind and its nurse. But in Perigord, and particularly within the valley of the Véz&egrave;re , human figures are very rare, but the pubic triangle  occurs in all Aurignacian deposits. These designs seem to have had, in the eyes of these cave dwellers, the same magical value as the statuettes. They appear to have been indispensible in the completion and success of ceremonies related to human and animal procreation.<br /><br />Is it not that the great mystery of life lies at the centre of this triangle? Is it not that this holds the place where the spirits do the work which gives birth to a new being?<br /><br /> Is it surprising that these primitive people, who did not perceive the relation of cause and effect, have attributed to it a supernatural origin, and therefore, this triangle, this trinity, became sacred in their eyes?<br /><br />That is, it seems, we must seek the source of this naturalistic  art:  spiritual in its conception, symbolic in its implementation, magic in ceremony and incantations.Subsequently, one finds in all religions of Eurasia triangles/trinities which are more or less realistic, for which the symbol disappears gradually as science has come to explain the mystery of life,  or perpetuated, but  by losing their original meaning. It remains only  the spiritual trinity, difficult to conceive in itself, that has been incorporated  into religious dogma.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>L'Aurignacien ancien en Périgord. Le problème duProtoaurignacien</h2><h3>Le Cellier (Commune de Tursac, Dordogne)<br />Pierre-Yves Demars, <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Demars (1992)</span></a></h3><center>Translation: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><br />L'abri Cellier is found on a terrace facing south, on the right bank of the Vezere between Le Moustier and le Ruth. It was excavated in 1927 by G. L. Collie who described four archaeological levels attributed to the Middle Aurignacian  using  the schema of H. Breuil (Aurignacian in the strict sense).<br /><br />  A second excavation by  D. Peyrony only discovered  three archaeological levels (Peyrony, 1945). The industry of the layer A, the deepest, was attributed to the Aurignacian I, the intermediate level (layer C) to  the Aurignacian II by D. Sonneville-Bordes (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">de Sonneville-Bordes,1960</span></a>).<br /><br />Finally, the industry of the upper  level (layer E) belongs to the Gravettian with  Font-Robert and Gravette points. <br /><br />I analysed industry layers A and C in the Museum of Eyzies-de-Tayac. Only one layer, layer A, will be presented here.<br /><br /><p><a href="images28/fontrober.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images28/fontrobersm.jpg" alt = "font robert" width="210" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Pointe de la Font-Robert<br /><br />Photo: http://www.musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/homes/home_id24921_u1l2.htm</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images32/img_3017copen.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images32/img_3017copensm.jpg" alt = "flint tools" width="414" height="300"  align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br /> Tools from le Ruth, Aurignacian, 30&nbsp;000 BP. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2014<br />Source and text:  Original, Københavns (Copenhagen) Museum, National Museum of Denmark</p><br clear = "all"><br /><b>A layer<br /><br /></b>The industry is clearly dominated by scrapers (70.11%). In this category, thin scrapers  (39.48%) are more numerous than  thick scrapers (30.63%). The frequency of carinated scrapers (15.50%) and nosed  scrapers, or grattoirs à museau (15.13%) are similar. Among chisels, we note that  truncated burins (13.65%) are slightly more numerous than the dihedral burins (12.55%). There are a few carinated burins (4.43%) and some busqué  or beaked burins (2.21%). Burins à un pan (bevelled chisels) are rather rare (3.69%).<br /><br />Retouched blades (35.79%) are abundant and Aurignacian blades (13.65%), well represented. The  frequency of awls  (3.32%), like that of   truncated pieces parts  (2.95%) is low. In contrast, as noted by D. Sonneville-Bordes, Denticulate or notched pieces are abundant (11.81%).<br /><br />There are 10  rabots or heavy 'push-plane' scrapers made on blocks or thick flakes, abruptly retouched, and no  Dufour blades. <br /><br /><p><a href="images19/sousruthIMG_1036.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images19/sousruthIMG_1036sm.jpg" alt = "Sous Ruth" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Mousterian Rabot from Le Ruth, in the display of the little museum run by the owner of the site, at Sous le Ruth.  <br /><br /> Rabots are heavy 'push-plane' scrapers made on blocks or thick flakes, abruptly retouched.<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br />The industry belonging to  layer A was described  by  Peyrony as the Aurignacian I. This is demonstrated by the abundance of scrapers, especially thin blades and Aurignacian split-based spears or sagaies. In addition, the abundance of thick flake scrapers may be used to classify the industry as the Aurignacian, despite the frequency of dihedral burins being a little lower than truncated burins. However, the large number of denticulate or notched pieces is amazing. This is all the more surprising since the   same is true for the industry of layer C.    <br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><a name="reference"> </a> <!-- <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Glory (1961)</span></a> --><h3><span class="reference">References</span></h3><ol compact type="1" start="1"><li><span class="reference"><b>Bourrillon R., White R.</b>, 2015: Early Aurignacian Graphic Arts in the Vézère Valley: In Search of an Identity?,in White R., Bourrillon R.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 42 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/sousruth.html responseCode 3 200

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 172]]</font> In Mr. Sclater's 
          paper<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> on the Geographical Distribution 
          of Birds, read before the Linnean Society, and published in the 'Proceedings' 
          for February 1858, he has pointed out that the western islands of the 
          Archipelago belong to the Indian, and the eastern to the Australian 
          region of Ornithology. My researches in these countries lead me to believe 
          that the same division will hold good in every branch of Zoology; and 
          the object of my present communication is to mark out the precise limits 
          of each region, and to call attention to some inferences of great general 
          importance as regards the study of the laws of organic distribution. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Australian and Indian regions of Zoology are 
          very strongly contrasted. In one the Marsupial order constitutes the 
          great mass of the mammalia,--in the other not a solitary marsupial animal 
          exists. Marsupials of at least two genera (<i>Cuscus</i> and <i>Belideus</i>) 
          are found all over the Moluccas and in Celebes; but none have <font color="990000">[[p. 
          173]]</font> been detected in the adjacent islands of Java and Borneo. 
          Of all the varied forms of <i>Quadrumana</i>, <i>Carnivora</i>, <i>Insectivora</i>, 
          and <i>Ruminantia</i> which abound in the western half of the Archipelago, 
          the only genera found in the Moluccas are <i>Paradoxurus</i> and <i>Cervus</i>. 
          The <i>Sciurid&aelig;</i>, so numerous in the western islands, are represented 
          in Celebes by only two or three species, while not one is found further 
          east. Birds furnish equally remarkable illustrations. The Australian 
          region is the richest in the world in Parrots; the Asiatic is (of tropical 
          regions) the poorest. Three entire families of the Psittacine order 
          are peculiar to the former region, and two of them, the Cockatoos and 
          the Lories, extend up to its extreme limits, without a solitary species 
          passing into the Indian islands of the Archipelago. The genus <i>Pal&aelig;ornis</i> 
          is, on the other hand, confined with equal strictness to the Indian 
          region. In the Rasorial order, the <i>Phasianid&aelig;</i> are Indian, 
          the <i>Megapodiid&aelig;</i> Australian; but in this case one species 
          of each family just passes the limits into the adjacent region. The 
          genus <i>Tropidorhynchus</i>, highly characteristic of the Australian 
          region, and everywhere abundant as well in the Moluccas and New Guinea 
          as in Australia, is quite unknown in Java and Borneo. On the other hand, 
          the entire families of <i>Bucconid&aelig;</i>, <i>Trogonid&aelig;</i> 
          and <i>Phyllornithid&aelig;</i>, and the genera <i>Pericrocotus</i>, 
          <i>Picnonotus</i>, <i>Trichophorus</i>, <i>Ixos</i>, in fact, almost 
          all the vast family of Thrushes and a host of other genera, cease abruptly 
          at the eastern side of Borneo, Java, and Bali. All these groups are 
          <i>common birds</i> in the great Indian islands; they abound everywhere; 
          they are the characteristic features of the ornithology; and it is most 
          striking to a naturalist, on passing the narrow straits of Macassar 
          and Lombock, suddenly to miss them entirely, together with the <i>Quadrumana</i> 
          and <i>Felid&aelig;</i>, the <i>Insectivora</i> and <i>Rodentia</i>, 
          whose varied species people the forests of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To define exactly the limits of the two regions 
          where they are (geographically) most intimately connected, I may mention 
          that during a few days' stay in the island of Bali I found birds of 
          the genera <i>Copsychus</i>, <i>Megalaima</i>, <i>Tiga</i>, <i>Ploceus</i>, 
          and <i>Sturnopastor</i>, all characteristic of the Indian region and 
          abundant in Malacca, Java, and Borneo; while on crossing over to Lombock, 
          during three months collecting there, not one of them was ever seen; 
          neither have they occurred in Celebes nor in any of the more eastern 
          islands I have visited. Taking this in connexion with the fact of <i>Cacatua</i>, 
          <i>Tropidorhynchus</i>, and <i>Megapodius</i> having their western limit 
          in Lombock, we may consider it established that the Strait of Lombock 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 174]]</font> (only 15 miles wide) marks the 
          limits and abruptly separates two of the great Zoological regions of 
          the globe. The Philippine Islands are in some respects of doubtful location, 
          resembling and differing from both regions. They are deficient in the 
          varied Mammals of Borneo, but they contain no Marsupials. The Psittaci 
          are scarce, as in the Indian region; the Lories are altogether absent, 
          but there is one representative of the Cockatoos. Woodpeckers, Trogons, 
          and the genera <i>Ixos</i>, <i>Copsychus</i>, and <i>Ploceus</i> are 
          highly characteristic of India. <i>Tanysiptera</i> and <i>Megapodius</i>, 
          again, are Australian forms, but these seem represented by only solitary 
          species. The islands possess also a few peculiar genera. We must on 
          the whole place the Philippine Islands in the Indian region, but with 
          the remark that they are deficient in some of its most striking features. 
          They possess several isolated forms of the Australian region, but by 
          no means sufficient to constitute a real transition thereto. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving the Philippines out of the question for 
          the present, the western and eastern islands of the Archipelago, as 
          here divided, belong to regions more distinct and contrasted than any 
          other of the great zoological divisions of the globe. South America 
          and Africa, separated by the Atlantic, do not differ so widely as Asia 
          and Australia: Asia with its abundance and variety of large Mammals 
          and no Marsupials, and Australia with scarcely anything but Marsupials; 
          Asia with its gorgeous <i>Phasianid&aelig;</i>, Australia with its dull-coloured 
          <i>Megapodiid&aelig;</i>; Asia the poorest tropical region in Parrots, 
          Australia the richest: and all these striking characteristics are almost 
          unimpaired at the very limits of their respective districts; so that 
          in a few hours we may experience an amount of zoological difference 
          which only weeks or even months of travel will give us in any other 
          part of the world!
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover there is nothing in the aspect or physical 
          character of the islands to lead us to expect such a difference; their 
          physical and geological differences do not coincide with the zoological 
          differences. There is a striking homogeneity in the two <i>halves</i> 
          of the Archipelago. The great volcanic chain runs through both parts; 
          Borneo is the counterpart of New Guinea; the Philippines closely resemble 
          the equally fertile and equally volcanic Moluccas; while in eastern 
          Java begins to be felt the more arid climate of Timor and Australia. 
          But these resemblances are accompanied by an extreme zoological diversity, 
          the Asiatic and Australian regions finding in Borneo and New Guinea 
          respectively their highest development.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 175]]</font> But it may 
          be said: &quot;The separation between these two regions is not so absolute. 
          There <i>is </i>some transition. There <i>are</i> species and genera 
          common to the eastern and western islands.&quot; This is true, yet (in my 
          opinion) proves no transition in the proper sense of the word; and the 
          nature and amount of the resemblance only shows more strongly the absolute 
          and original distinctness of the two divisions. The exception here clearly 
          proves the rule. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us investigate these cases of supposed transition. 
          In the western islands almost the only instance of a group peculiar 
          to Australia and the eastern islands is the <i>Megapodius</i> in North-west 
          Borneo. Not one of the Australian forms of Mammalia passes the limits 
          of the region. On the other hand, Quadrumana occur in Celebes, Batchian, 
          Lombock, and perhaps Timor; Deer have reached Celebes, Timor, Buru, 
          Ceram, and Gilolo, but not New Guinea; Pigs have extended to New Guinea, 
          probably the true eastern limit of the genus <i>Sus</i>; Squirrels are 
          found in Celebes, Lombock, and Sumbawa: among birds, <i>Gallus</i> occurs 
          in Celebes and Sumbawa, Woodpeckers reach Celebes, and Hornbills extend 
          to the North-west of New Guinea. These cases of identity or resemblance 
          in the animals of the two regions we may group into three classes; 1st, 
          identical species; 2nd, closely allied or representative species; and 
          3rd, species of peculiar and isolated genera. The common Grey Monkey 
          (<i>Macacus cynomolgus</i>) has reached Lombock, and perhaps Timor, 
          but not Celebes. The Deer of the Moluccas seems to be a variety of the 
          <i>Cervus rufus</i> of Java and Borneo. The Jungle Cock of Celebes and 
          Lombock is a Javanese species. <i>Hirundo javanica</i>, <i>Zosterops 
          flavus</i>, <i>Halcyon collaris</i>, <i>Eurystomus gularis</i>, <i>Macropygia 
          phasianella</i>, <i>Merops javanicus</i>, <i>Anthreptes lepida</i>, 
          <i>Ptilonopus melanocephala</i>, and some other birds appear the same 
          in the adjacent islands of the eastern and western divisions, and some 
          of them range over the whole Archipelago. But after reading Lyell on 
          the various modes of dispersion of animals, and looking at the proximity 
          of the islands, we shall feel astonished, not at such an amount of interchange 
          of species (most of which are birds of great powers of flight), but 
          rather that in the course of ages a much greater and almost complete 
          fusion has not taken place. Were the Atlantic gradually to narrow till 
          only a strait of twenty miles separated Africa from South America, can 
          we help believing that many birds and insects and some few mammals would 
          soon be interchanged? But such interchange would be a fortuitous mixture 
          of faunas essentially and absolutely dissimilar, not a natural and regular 
          transition from <font color="990000">[[p. 176]] </font>one to the other. 
          In like manner the cases of identical species in the eastern and western 
          islands of the Archipelago are due to the gradual and accidental commingling 
          of originally absolutely distinct faunas. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our second class (representative species) we 
          must place the Wild Pigs, which seem to be of distinct but closely allied 
          species in each island; the Squirrels also of Celebes are of peculiar 
          species, as are the Woodpeckers and Hornbills, and two Celebes birds 
          of the Asiatic genera <i>Ph&aelig;nicoph&aelig;us</i> and <i>Acridotheres</i>. 
          Now these and a few more of like character are closely allied to other 
          species inhabiting Java, Borneo, or the Philippines. We have only therefore 
          to suppose that the species of the western passed over to the eastern 
          islands at so remote a period as on one side or the other to have become 
          extinct, and to have been replaced by an allied form, and we shall have 
          produced exactly the state of things now existing. Such extinction and 
          such replacement we know has been continually going on. Such has been 
          the regular course of nature for countless ages in every part of the 
          earth of which we have geological records; and unless we are prepared 
          to show that the Indo-Australian Archipelago was an altogether exceptional 
          region, such must have been the course of nature here also. If these 
          islands have existed in their present form only during one of the later 
          divisions of the Tertiary period, and if interchange of species at very 
          rare and distant intervals has occurred, then the fact of some identical 
          and other closely allied species is a necessary result, even if the 
          two regions in question had been originally peopled by absolutely distinct 
          creations of organic beings, and there had never been any closer connexion 
          between them than now exists. The occurrence of a limited number of 
          representative species in the two divisions of the Archipelago does 
          not therefore prove any true transition from one to the other.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The examples of our third class--of peculiar genera 
          having little or no affinity with those of the adjacent islands--are 
          almost entirely confined to Celebes, and render that island a district 
          <i>per se</i>, in the highest degree interesting. <i>Cynopithecus</i>, 
          a genus of Baboons, the extraordinary Babirusa and the singular ruminant 
          <i>Anoa depressicornis</i> have nothing in common with Asiatic mammals, 
          but seem more allied to those of Africa. A quadrumanous animal of the 
          same genus (perhaps identical) occurs in the little island of Batchian, 
          which forms the extreme eastern limit of the highest order of mammalia. 
          An allied species is also said to exist in the Philippines. Now this 
          occurrence of quadrumana in the Australian <font color="990000">[[p. 
          177]]</font> region proves nothing whatever as regards a transition 
          to the western islands, which, among their numerous monkeys and apes, 
          have nothing at all resembling them. The species of Celebes and Batchian 
          have the high superorbital ridge, the long nasal bone, the dog-like 
          figure, the minute erect tail, the predaceous habits and the fearless 
          disposition of the true Baboons, and find their allies nowhere nearer 
          than in tropical Africa. The <i>Anoa</i> seems also to point towards 
          the same region, so rich in varied forms of Antelopes. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the class of birds, Celebes possesses a peculiar 
          genus of Parrots (<i>Prioniturus</i>), said to occur also in the Philippines; 
          <i>Meropogon</i>, intermediate between an Indian and an African form 
          of Bee-eaters; and the anomalous <i>Scissirostrum</i>, which Prince 
          Bonaparte places next to a Madagascar bird, and forms a distinct subfamily 
          for the reception of the two. Celebes also contains a species of <i>Coracias</i>, 
          which is here quite out of its normal area, the genus being otherwise 
          confined to Africa and continental India, not occurring in any other 
          part of the Archipelago. The Celebes bird is placed, in Bonaparte's 
          'Conspectus,' between two African species, to which therefore I presume 
          it is more nearly allied than to those of India. Having just received 
          Mr. Smith's Catalogue of the Hymenoptera collected during my first residence 
          in Celebes, I find in it some facts of an equally singular nature. Of 
          103 species, only 16 are known to inhabit any of the western islands 
          of the Archipelago, while 18 are identical with species of continental 
          India, China, and the Philippine Islands, two are stated to be identical 
          with insects hitherto known only from tropical Africa, and another is 
          said to be most closely allied to one from the Cape.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These phenomena of distribution are, I believe, 
          the most anomalous yet known, and in fact altogether unique. I am aware 
          of no other spot upon the earth which contains a number of species, 
          in several distinct classes of animals, the nearest allies to which 
          do not exist in any of the countries which on every side surround it, 
          but which are to be found only in another primary division of the globe, 
          separated from them all by a vast expanse of ocean. In no other case 
          are the species of a genus or the genera of a family distributed in 
          <i>two</i> distinct areas separated by countries in which they do not 
          exist; so that it has come to be considered a law in geographical distribution, 
          &quot;that both species and groups inhabit continuous areas.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facts such as these can only be explained by a bold 
          acceptance of vast changes in the surface of the earth. They teach us 
          that this island of Celebes is more ancient than most of the islands 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 178]]</font> now surrounding it, and obtained 
          some part of its fauna before they came into existence. They point to 
          the time when a great continent occupied a portion at least of what 
          is now the Indian Ocean, of which the islands of Mauritius, Bourbon<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, 
          &amp;c. may be fragments, while the Chagos Bank and the Keeling Atolls 
          indicate its former extension eastward to the vicinity of what is now 
          the Malayan Archipelago. The Celebes group remains the last eastern 
          fragment of this now submerged land, or of some of its adjacent islands, 
          indicating its peculiar origin by its zoological isolation, and by still 
          retaining a marked affinity with the African fauna. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great Pacific continent, of which Australia 
          and New Guinea are no doubt fragments, probably existed at a much earlier 
          period, and extended as far westward as the Moluccas. The extension 
          of Asia as far to the south and east as the Straits of Macassar and 
          Lombock must have occurred subsequent to the submergence of both these 
          great southern continents; and the breaking up and separation of the 
          islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo has been the last great geological 
          change these regions have undergone. That this has really taken place 
          as here indicated, we think is proved by the following considerations. 
          Not more than twenty (probably a smaller number) out of about one hundred 
          land birds of Celebes at present known are found in Java or Borneo, 
          and only one or two of twelve or fifteen Mammalia. Of the Mammalia and 
          birds of Borneo, however, at least three-fourths, probably five-sixths, 
          inhabit also Java, Sumatra, or the peninsula of Malacca. Now, looking 
          at the direction of the Macassar Straits running nearly north and south, 
          and remembering we are in the district of the monsoons, a steady south-east 
          and north-west wind blowing alternately for about six months each, we 
          shall at once see that Celebes is more favourably situated than any 
          other island to receive stray passengers from Borneo, whether drifted 
          across the sea or wafted through the air. The distance too is less than 
          between any of the other large islands; there are no violent currents 
          to neutralize the action of the winds; and numerous islets in mid-channel 
          offer stations which might rescue many of the wanderers, and admit, 
          after repose, of fresh migrations. Between Java and Borneo the width 
          of sea is much greater, the intermediate islands are fewer, and the 
          direction of the monsoons <i>along</i> and not <i>across</i> the Java 
          sea, accompanied by alternating currents in the same direction, must 
          render accidental communication between the two islands exceedingly 
          difficult; so that where the facilities for intercommunication are greatest, 
          the number of species common to the two <font color="990000">[[p. 179]]</font> 
          countries is least, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. But again, the mass of the 
          species of Borneo, Java, &amp;c., even when not <i>identical</i> are 
          <i>congeneric</i>, which, as before explained, indicates <i>identity</i> 
          at an earlier epoch; whereas the great mass of the fauna of Celebes 
          is widely different from that of the western islands, consisting mostly 
          of genera, and even of entire families, altogether foreign to them. 
          This clearly points to a former total diversity of forms and species,--existing 
          similarities being the result of intermixture, the extreme facilities 
          for which we have pointed out. In the case of the great western islands 
          a former more complete identity is indicated, the present differences 
          having arisen from their isolation during a considerable period, allowing 
          time for that partial extinction and introduction of species which is 
          the regular course of nature. If the very small number of western species 
          in Celebes is all that the most favourable conditions for transmission 
          could bring about, the complete similarity of the faunas of the western 
          islands could never (with far less favourable conditions) have been 
          produced by the same means. And what other means can we conceive but 
          the former connexion of those islands with each other and with the continent 
          of Asia? 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In striking confirmation of this view we have physical 
          evidence of a very interesting nature. These countries are in fact <i>still 
          connected</i>, and that so completely that an elevation of only 300 
          feet would nearly double the extent of tropical Asia. Over the whole 
          of the Java Sea, the Straits of Malacca, the Gulf of Siam, and the southern 
          part of the China Sea, ships can anchor in less than fifty fathoms. 
          A vast submarine plain unites together the apparently disjointed parts 
          of the Indian zoological region, and abruptly terminates, exactly at 
          its limits, in an unfathomable ocean. The deep sea of the Moluccas comes 
          up to the very coasts of Northern Borneo, to the Strait of Lombock in 
          the south, and to near the middle of the Strait of Macassar. May we 
          not therefore from these facts very fairly conclude that, according 
          to the system of alternate bands of elevation and depression that seems 
          very generally to prevail, the last great rising movement of the volcanic 
          range of Java and Sumatra was accompanied by the depression that now 
          separates them from Borneo and from the continent?
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worthy of remark that the various islands 
          of the Moluccas, though generally divided by a less extent of sea, have 
          fewer species in common; but the separating seas are in almost every 
          case of immense depth, indicating that the separation took place at 
          a much earlier period. The same principle is well illustrated by the 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 180]]</font> distribution of the genus <i>Paradisea</i>, 
          two species of which (the common Birds of Paradise) are found only in 
          New Guinea and the islands of Aru, Mysol, Waigiou, and Jobie, all of 
          which are connected with New Guinea by banks of soundings, while they 
          do not extend to Ceram or the K&eacute; Islands, which are no further 
          from New Guinea, but are separated from it by deep sea. Again, the chain 
          of small volcanic islands to the west of Gilolo, though divided by channels 
          of only ten or fifteen miles wide, possess many distinct representative 
          species of insects, and even, in some cases, of birds also. The Baboons 
          of Batchian have not passed to Gilolo, a much larger island, only separated 
          from it by a channel ten miles wide, and in one part almost blocked 
          up with small islands. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now looking at these phenomena of distribution, 
          and especially at those presented by the fauna of Celebes, it appears 
          to me that a much exaggerated effect, in producing the present distribution 
          of animals, has been imputed to the accidental transmission of individuals 
          across intervening seas; for we have here as it were a test or standard 
          by which we may measure the possible effect due to these causes, and 
          we find that, under conditions perhaps the most favourable that exist 
          on the globe, the percentage of species derived from this source is 
          extremely small. When my researches in the Archipelago are completed, 
          I hope to be able to determine with some accuracy this numerical proportion 
          in several cases; but in the mean time we will consider 20 per cent. 
          as the probable maximum for birds and mammals which in Celebes have 
          been derived from Borneo or Java.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now apply this standard to the case of Great 
          Britain and the Continent, in which the width of dividing sea and the 
          extent of opposing coasts are nearly the same, but in which the species 
          are almost all identical,--or to Ireland, more than 90 per cent. of 
          whose species are British,--and we shall at once see that no theory 
          of transmission across the present Straits is admissible, and shall 
          be compelled to resort to the idea of a very recent separation (long 
          since admitted), to account for these zoological phenomena.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, however, to the oceanic islands that we consider 
          the application of this test of the most importance. Let any one try 
          to realize the comparative facilities for the transmission of organized 
          beings across the Strait of Macassar from Borneo to Celebes, and from 
          South Europe or North Africa to the island of Madeira, at least four 
          times the distance, and a mere point in the ocean, and he would probably 
          consider that in a given period a hundred cases of transmission would 
          be more likely to occur in the former case <font color="990000">[[p. 
          181]]</font> than one in the latter. Yet of the comparatively rich insect-fauna 
          of Madeira, 40 per cent. are continental species; and of the flowering 
          plants more than 60 per cent. The Canary Islands offer nearly similar 
          results. Nothing but a former connexion with the Continent will explain 
          such an amount of specific identity (the weight of which will be very 
          much increased if we take into account the representative species); 
          and the direction of the Atlas range towards Teneriffe, and of the Sierra 
          Nevada towards Madeira, are material indications of such a connexion. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Galapagos are no further from South America 
          than Madeira is from Europe, and, being of greater extent, are far more 
          liable to receive chance immigrants; yet they have hardly a species 
          identical with any inhabiting the American continent. These islands 
          therefore may well have originated in mid-ocean; or if they ever were 
          connected with the mainland, it was at so distant a period that the 
          natural extinction and renewal of species has left not one in common. 
          The character of their fauna, however, is more what we should expect 
          to arise from the chance introduction of a very few species at distant 
          intervals; it is very poor; it contains but few genera, and those scattered 
          among unconnected families; its genera often contain several closely 
          allied species, indicating a single antitype.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fauna and flora of Madeira and of the Canaries, 
          on the other hand, have none of this chance character. They are comparatively 
          rich in genera and species; most of the principal groups and families 
          are more or less represented; and, in fact, these islands do not differ 
          materially, as to the general character of their animal and vegetable 
          productions, from any isolated mountain in Europe or North Africa of 
          about equal extent.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On exactly the same principles, the very large number 
          of species of plants, insects, and birds, in Europe and North America, 
          either absolutely identical or represented by very closely allied species, 
          most assuredly indicates that some means of land communication in temperate 
          or sub-arctic latitudes existed at no very distant geological epoch; 
          and though many naturalists are inclined to regard all such views as 
          vague and unprofitable speculations, we are convinced they will soon 
          take their place among the legitimate deductions of science.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geology can detect but a portion of the changes 
          the surface of the earth has undergone. It can reveal the past history 
          and mutations of what is now dry land; but the ocean tells nothing of 
          her bygone history. Zoology and Botany here come to the aid of <font color="990000">[[p. 
          182]]</font> their sister science, and by means of the humble weeds 
          and despised insects inhabiting its now distant shores, can discover 
          some of those past changes which the ocean itself refuses to reveal. 
          They can indicate, approximately at least, where and at what period 
          former continents must have existed, from what countries islands must 
          have been separated, and at how distant an epoch the rupture took place. 
          By the invaluable indications which Mr. Darwin has deduced from the 
          structure of coral reefs, by the surveys of the ocean-bed now in progress, 
          and by a more extensive and detailed knowledge of the geographical distribution 
          of animals and plants, the naturalist may soon hope to obtain some idea 
          of the continents which have now disappeared beneath the ocean, and 
          of the general distribution of land and sea at former geological epochs. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most writers on geographical distribution have completely 
          overlooked its connexion with well-established geological facts, and 
          have thereby created difficulties where none exist. The peculiar and 
          apparently endemic faun&aelig; and flor&aelig; of the oceanic islands 
          (such as the Galapagos and St. Helena) have been dwelt upon as something 
          anomalous and inexplicable. It has been imagined that the more simple 
          condition of such islands would be to have their productions identical 
          with those of the nearest land, and that their actual condition is an 
          incomprehensible mystery. The very reverse of this is however the case. 
          We really require no speculative hypothesis, no new theory, to explain 
          these phenomena; they are the logical results of well-known laws of 
          nature. The regular and unceasing extinction of species, and their replacement 
          by allied forms, is now no hypothesis, but an established fact; and 
          it necessarily produces such peculiar faun&aelig; and flor&aelig; in 
          all but recently formed or newly disrupted islands, subject of course 
          to more or less modification according to the facilities for the transmission 
          of fresh species from adjacent continents. Such phenomena therefore 
          are far from uncommon. Madagascar, Mauritius, the Moluccas, New Zealand, 
          New Caledonia, the Pacific Islands, Juan Fernandez, the West India Islands, 
          and many others, all present such peculiarities in greater or less development. 
          It is the instances of identity of species in distant countries that 
          presents the real difficulty. What was supposed to be the more normal 
          state of things is really exceptional, and requires some hypothesis 
          for its explanation. The phenomena of distribution in the Malay Archipelago, 
          to which I have here called attention, teach us that, however narrow 
          may be the strait separating an island from its <font color="990000">[[p. 
          183]]</font> continent, it is still an impassable barrier against the 
          passage of any considerable number and variety of land animals; and 
          that in all cases in which such islands possess a tolerably rich and 
          varied fauna of species mostly identical, or closely allied with those 
          of the adjacent country, we are forced to the conclusion that a geologically 
          recent disruption has taken place. Great Britain, Ireland, Sicily, Sumatra, 
          Java and Borneo, the Aru Islands, the Canaries and Madeira, are cases 
          to which the reasoning is fully applicable. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his introductory Essay on the Flora of New Zealand, 
          Dr. Hooker<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> has most convincingly applied 
          this principle to show the former connexion of New Zealand and other 
          southern islands with the southern extremity of America; and I will 
          take this opportunity of calling the attention of zoologists to the 
          very satisfactory manner in which this view clears away many difficulties 
          in the distribution of animals. The most obvious of these is the occurrence 
          of Marsupials in America only, beyond the Australian region. They evidently 
          entered by the same route as the plants of New Zealand and Tasmania 
          which occur in South temperate America, but having greater powers of 
          dispersion, a greater plasticity of organization, have extended themselves 
          over the whole continent though with so few modifications of form and 
          structure as to point to a unity of origin at a comparatively recent 
          period. It is among insects, however, that the resemblances approach 
          in number and degree to those exhibited by plants. Among Butterflies 
          the beautiful <i>Heliconid&aelig;</i> are strictly confined to South 
          America, with the exception of a single genus (<i>Hamadryas</i>) found 
          in the Australian region from New Zealand to New Guinea. In Coleoptera 
          many families and genera are characteristic of the two countries; such 
          are <i>Pseudomorphid&aelig;</i> among the Geodephaga, <i>Lamprimid&aelig;</i> 
          and <i>Syndesid&aelig;</i> among the Lucani, <i>Anoplognathid&aelig;</i> 
          among the Lamellicornes, <i>Stigmoderid&aelig;</i> among the Buprestes, 
          <i>Natalis</i> among the Clerid&aelig;, besides a great number of representative 
          genera. This peculiar distribution has hitherto only excited astonishment, 
          and has confounded all ideas of unity in the distribution of organic 
          beings; but we now see that they are in exact accordance with the phenomena 
          presented by the flora of the same regions, as developed in the greatest 
          detail by the researches of Dr. Hooker. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is somewhat singular, however, that not one <i>identical 
          species</i> of insect should yet have been discovered, while no less 
          than 89 species of flowering plants are found both in New Zealand and 
          South America. The relations of the animals and of the plants <font color="990000">[[p. 
          184]]</font> of these countries must necessarily depend on the same 
          physical changes which the Southern hemisphere has undergone; and we 
          are therefore led to conclude that insects are much less persistent 
          in their specific forms than flowering plants, while among Mammalia 
          and land birds (in which no genus even is common to the countries in 
          question) species must die and be replaced much more rapidly than in 
          either. And this is exactly in accordance with the fact (well established 
          by geology) that at a time when the shells of the European seas were 
          almost all identical with species now living, the European Mammalia 
          were almost all different. The duration of life of species would seem 
          to be in an inverse proportion to their complexity of organization and 
          vital activity. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the brief sketch I have now given of this interesting 
          subject, such obvious and striking facts alone have been adduced as 
          a traveller's note-book can supply. The argument must therefore lose 
          much of its weight from the absence of detail and accumulated examples. 
          There is, however, such a very general accordance in the phenomena of 
          distribution as separately deduced from the various classes or kingdoms 
          of the organic world, that whenever one class of animals or plants exhibits 
          in a clearly marked manner certain relations between two countries, 
          the other classes will certainly show similar ones, though it may be 
          in a greater or a less degree. Birds and insects will teach us the same 
          truths; and even animals and plants, though existing under such different 
          conditions, and multiplied and dispersed by such a generally distinct 
          process, will never give conflicting testimony, however much they may 
          differ as regards the amount of relationship between distant regions 
          indicated by them, and consequently notwithstanding the greater or less 
          weight either may have in the determining of questions of this nature.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my apology for offering to the Linnean Society 
          the present imperfect outline in anticipation of the more detailed proofs 
          and illustrations which I hope to bring forward on a future occasion.</p>

  <strong><i><font color="993366">Comment by Bernard Michaux, paleobiologist (pers. commun. 4/00):</font></i></strong></p>
        <p><i>In this original description of the biotic discontinuity between 
          Asian and Australian birds and mammals, Wallace's biogeographical ideas 
          are more clearly spelt out than in later versions, such as the one he 
          gives in <u>The Malay Archipelago</u> (S715). Wallace describes the 
          bird and mammalian evidence on which his discontinuity thesis is based, 
          but does not discuss insect or plant data which would not have supported 
          it. One might accuse Wallace of selective use of evidence, but this 
          would be most uncharacteristic of Wallace who was always intellectually 
          rigorous. Perhaps he simply saw a phenomenon so surprising he felt it 
          required explanation; that the same discontinuity was lacking in other 
          groups was secondary.</i></p>
        <p><i>Wallace argues that we are dealing with a discontinuity, not a transition 
          zone. This is an important idea, not so much because it <u>is</u> regarded 
          as a transition zone in conventional twentieth century biogeography, 
          but because of where this leads him. Wallace dismisses the occurrence 
          of the odd Australian species in the Asian half of the archipelago (or 
          <u>vice versa</u>) as exceptions that prove the rule. He is more amazed 
          that this is not more general, given the proximity and ecological similarity 
          of Bali and Lombok. He evidently missed the Bali honeyeater (<u>Lichmera 
          limbata</u>), but modern data do not substantially alter this argument 
          for rarity. More distantly related taxa, such as endemic genera, represent 
          an ancient connection (<u>i.e</u>. long separation of Asian and Australian 
          land) rather than a modern transition zone.</i></p>
        <p><i>Wallace did not believe that accidental dispersal events in ecological 
          time explained mammalian and avian distributions within the archipelago; 
          indeed, there would be no discontinuity to explain were such events 
          usual. Instead, he links geological connection to biological diversity. 
          The endemic &quot;Asian&quot; genera of Celebes (Sulawesi) have little biological 
          relatedness to taxa in Sundaland and are therefore evidence for Sulawesi's 
          long geological isolation from surrounding areas. In fact, Sulawesi 
          is separated from Sundaland not by width of sea, but by depth of ocean. 
          By contrast, the islands of Sundaland are connected by shallow sea and 
          display relative faunal uniformity. Wallace's connection of the biological 
          concept of &quot;difference equals time&quot; with the geological concept that 
          &quot;ocean depth equals separation&quot; led him to propose that biological evidence 
          could be used to help elucidate Earth history. This connection was to 
          resurface in the 1960s and 70s thanks in part to the writings of Leon 
          Croizat (who promoted the idea that &quot;life and earth evolve together&quot;), 
          and is also a concept central to vicariance biogeography.</i></p>

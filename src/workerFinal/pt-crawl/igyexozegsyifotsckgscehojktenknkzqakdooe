    <h3><a name="Storm"> Storm</a> Warnings</h3>
    <p><a href="images/sugarbabpbl.jpg"><img src="images/sugarbabpbl_small.jpg" 
    alt="The Playbill for Sugar Babies" width="100" height="161" /></a><strong><span>Mickey
    Rooney and Ann Miller on the Playbill cover for <em>Sugar Babies</em> (1979),
    a burlesque-inspired revue that became a surprise hit.</span></strong></p>
          
     <p>Just when it seemed that musicals with a more traditional flavor were back in style, the decade ended
     with critics and audiences giving mixed signals.</p>
     
        <p>An energetic revival of <strong><em>Peter Pan </em>(1979 - 550  performances), </strong>
        starred <strong><a href="who14.htm#Duncan">Sandy Duncan</a></strong>. Although
        it opened during a newspaper strike, word of mouth made it an immediate hit, 
		and Duncan became the
        longest-running Peter in theatrical history.</p>

           <p>MGM veterans <strong><a href="who7c.htm#Rooney">Mickey
        Rooney</a> </strong> and <strong> <a href="who6c.htm#MillerA"> Ann Miller</a></strong> 
        scored an unexpected smash with <strong><em>Sugar Babies</em>  (1979 - 1,208  performances)</strong>, 
        a mildly risqu√©  revue of classic burlesque skits interlaced with vintage songs 
        by composer <strong>Jimmy McHugh</strong> and lyricist <strong>Dorothy Fields</strong>. Between the
            Broadway run, international tour and&nbsp; London production, Rooney 
        and Miller shared the spotlight for the next nine years.</p>
              
     <p>The most anticipated musicals of 1979 included three major 
     new projects by veteran writers. To the theatrical community's general shock, 
     each came and left with chilling speed.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="who4.htm#Herman">Jerry Herman</a></strong>'s 
              <strong><em>Grand Tour</em> (1979 - 79  performances)</strong> offered 
              <strong><a href="who3b.htm#Grey">Joel Grey</a></strong> as a Jew escaping Nazi persecution 
              in a warm-hearted adaptation of <em>Jacobowsky and the Colonel</em>. The underrated
              score featured the gorgeous ballad &quot;Marianne.&quot;<br /></li>
            <li><strong><a href="who6.htm#LaneB">Burton Lane</a></strong> and
              <strong><a href="who6b.htm#Lerner"> Alan Jay Lerner</a></strong>'s 
              <strong><em>Carmelina</em>  (1979 - 28  performances)</strong> starred 
              <strong><a href="who12.htm#Brown">Georgia Brown</a></strong> 
              as an Italian mother who told three American veterans that had fathered her
              child during World War II -- and must face the music when all
              three come back to town.
              Even critics who dismissed the show admired the score,
              particularly &quot;It's Time for a Love Song&quot; and the
              ravishing trio &quot;One More Walk Around the Garden.&quot;<br /></li>
            <li><strong><a href="who7b.htm#Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a></strong>' 
            <strong><em>I Remember Mama</em> (1979 - 148  performances)</strong>              
            offered Swedish film star <strong>Liv Ullman</strong> as a 
              Norwegian immigrant using love and ingenuity to raise her family in 
			San Francisco during the
              early 1900s. Preview audiences cheered, but after critics dismissed it
              as corny and old-fashioned, ticket sales quickly petered out. Rodgers died soon after 
              <em>Mama</em> closed, ending an extraordinary career that stretched over more
              than six decades and fifty Broadway scores.<br /></li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Changing <a name="Climate">Climate</a></h3>
        <p>It's not so much that the public disapproved of these well-written but
        imperfect shows. Most Americans were not paying attention to the musical 
        theatre anymore. Rock 
        and disco were the predominant sounds in popular music, and neither genre had 
        more than a token presence in most Broadway scores. Musicals had become a sort of
        subculture, and the potential sales for cast 
        albums fell so low that major labels stopped recording them altogether.</p>
        
        <p>To make matters worse, by 1979, most Broadway musicals cost $1,000,000 
        or more to produce, and weekly operating expenses were so high that even a two year run 
        could not guarantee a profit. Some blamed the volatile economy, but Broadway was the only
        place where inflation (a widespread problem in the 1970s economy) had run at a rate of 400
        percent. In this unsettled environment, two important musicals came to represent the forces 
        that would compete for the soul of musical theatre in the decade to come.</p>

        <h3><a name="Sondheim">Sondheim</a> vs. Webber: The Future, Round One</h3>
        <p><a href="images/sweeneypgm.jpg"><img src="images/sweeneypgm_small.jpg" 
        alt="Sweeney Todd" width="100" height="135" /></a><strong><span>The original souvenir program for Sondheim's 
        <em>Sweeney Todd</em> (1979). The show's logo was based on Victorian period 
        drawings.</span></strong></p>
        
        <p>While Stephen Sondheim's <strong><em><a name="Sweeney">Sweeney</a> Todd</em> (1979 -
        557  performances)</strong> used a conventional plot structure, its operatic score was Sondheim's most 
        ambitious effort to date. Going further, this blood-soaked tale of an unjustly persecuted 
        man's all-consuming quest for revenge in Victorian London explored emotional territory 
        no musical had ever touched before. Not since Shakespeare had a poet of the theatre taken 
        such an unflinching look into the darkest corners of the human soul. When <em>Sweeney</em>'s 
        cast pointed at audience members and insisted that they had a murderous hate like Sweeney's 
        hiding inside them, it was bound to leave many theatergoers uneasy. Tony-winning 
        performances by <strong><a href="who6.htm#Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a></strong> and 
        <strong><a href="who14.htm#Cariou">Len Cariou</a></strong> added to the impact, as did
        a massive production helmed by <a href="who7.htm#Prince"><strong>Hal Prince</strong></a>. (Prince 
        framed the action in the actual ruins of an old factory, trucked in from Rhode
        Island.) But this lofty accomplishment came at a crippling price. Despite a healthy run 
        and numerous awards, the show was unable to turn a profit.</p>
        
        <p>A far different musical came from England with advance hoopla that 
        Gilbert and Sullivan might have envied. Following the pattern they
        had initiated with <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>, composer 
        <strong><a href="who6b.htm#Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a></strong> and librettist 
        <strong><a href="who7b.htm#Rice">Tim Rice</a></strong> launched their stage biography 
        of Argentina's Eva Peron as a recording. Working 
        with director <strong><a href="who7.htm#Prince">Hal Prince</a></strong>, they
        refined it on stage in London, sharpening the book's focus, toning down the rock 
        elements and adding a touch of disco to expand the score's commercial possibilities.</p>
        
        <p>By the time it reached Broadway, <strong><em><a name="Evita">Evita</a></em>
        (1979 - 1,567  performances)</strong> was a slick and stylish smash hit, with breakthrough
        performances by <strong><a href="who6b.htm#Lupone">Patti Lupone</a></strong> as Evita
        and <strong><a href="who7.htm#Patinkin">Mandy Patinkin</a></strong> as Che. 
        A disco version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; became a hit 
        single &#150; one of the last showtunes to reach the pop charts in any form.
        <em>Evita</em> was a calculated triumph of stagecraft and 
        technology, undeniably entertaining but in some ways as vapid as any 
        of Ziegfeld's <em>Follies</em>. Webber and Rice depicted Eva as a whore with 
        flair and ruthless ambition, but gave no clue as to what made her complex character 
        tick. Meaningful or not, people liked it. Running three times longer than 
        <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, it made a massive profit from productions all over the world. 
        With this flashy victory of matter over mind, the <strong> 
        mega-musical</strong> was born.</p>
        
        <p>Both <em>Sweeney</em> and <em>Evita </em>were expensive productions with 
        stunning stage direction by Hal Prince, and both won seven Tony Awards (including Best 
        Musical) in adjoining seasons. The key difference: <em>Sweeney Todd</em> lost money, 
        <em>Evita</em> made money. This was not lost on producers and investors. </p>
		<p>It is easy
        for armchair critics to advocate artistic merit over financial concerns, but 
        answer this: If you were investing $100,000 or more of your own money, would you 
        prefer to lose it or make a profit? The inevitable answer to that question set the 
        uneasy course of the Broadway musical for the remainder of the 20th Century.</p>

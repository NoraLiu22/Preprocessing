Darwin's theory of natural selection helped to convince most people that life has evolved and this point has not been seriously challenged in the past one hundred and forty years. It is important to note that Darwin's book "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" did two things. It summarized all of the evidence in favor of the idea that all <a href="../life/glossary.html#organism">organisms</a> have <a href="#common_descent">descended with modification from a common ancestor</a>, and thus built a strong case for evolution.

"Specifically, it refers to the Darwin/Wallace principle of natural selection as the major driving force in evolution. Since Darwin (1859, 1872) accepted Lamarck's principle of the inheritance of acquired characteristics as a source of biological variability, it is equally fair to call this the "Lamarck/Darwin/Wallace" period of evolutionary thought. <small>(<a href="#Kutschera&Niklas2004">Kutschera & Niklas 2004</a>, p.259â€“260)</small></p></div>

Group selectionist ideas have been around since Darwin mentioned it in the <i>Descent of Man</i> as a possible mechanism of evolution of human altruism but were further elaborated by V.C. Wynne-Edwards in the 1960s.</p>
 
<p>More correctly, group selection is defined as the differential survival and reproduction of groups (Wade 1977). A response to group selection occurs when the differences among groups has a heritable basis. For group selection this means not only single locus allelic differences, but also epistatic genetic differences, differences in genetically based interactions among individuals, and even potentially cultural differences. Thus, it is simplistic to speak of group selection simply in terms of the spread of an altruistic allele.</p>
 
<p>Critiques, particularly by George C. Williams (1966), John Maynard Smith (1964) and C.M. Perrins (1964) cast serious doubt on group selection as a major mechanism in evolutionary history.

The new synthesis continued to develop in the 1940s, notably with Julian Huxley's, <i>Evolution: The Modern Synthesis</i> (1942) and Bernhard Rensch's, <i>Evolution Above the Species Level</i> (1947). Natural selection was seen as the dominant force shaping evolutionary change.

<div class="glsent"><p><b><a name="neo-lamarckism"></a>Neo-Lamarckism</b> Popular alternative to <a href="#darwinism">Darwinism</a> during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, based on <a href="#Lamarck">Lamarck</a>'s idea of acquired characteristics. Neo-Lamarckism was supported by natural theology, popular in America at the turn of the century. <a href="#Spencer">Spencer</a> supported neo-Lamarckism. "Against selection itself Spencer [1893] used an argument that had considerable force when measured against the pregenetical selection theory (Ridley, 1982a). He pointed out that when a new structure evolved, all the rest of the body would have to accommodate the new development. Thus a series of <a href="#variation">variations</a> would be required to adjust the overall structure in a manner correlated to the new organ. What would be the chance of all these variations appearing together at the right time, if the species had to depend on random variation? Selection might explain the changes in a single organ, but not an integrated transmutation of the whole body." Lamarckism, as Spencer pointed out, could provide an explanation for the integrated development or elimination of organs. This was seen to be a weakness of<a href="#natural_selection"> natural selection</a>. "The law of "acceleration of growth" was first published in <a href="#Cope">Cope</a>'s "On the origin of genera" of 1867 (reprinted in Cope, 1887) and in <a href="../science/biographies/H.html#Hyatt">Hyatt</a> (1868). According to this law, evolution progresses by a series of sudden additions to the growth of the individual. At certain points in time, every individual in a species begins to exhibit a new phase of growth that advances all to the form of a new species. To make room for this addition, the old adult form is compressed back to an earlier phase of growth, hence the "acceleration" of growth to accommodate an extra stage before maturity. Cope denied that evolution on a small scale is a <a href="#cladogenesis">branching process</a>, claiming instead that each genus represents a group of species that have reached the same point in the historical development of their group. Their close relationship is not a sign of <a href="#common_ancestor">common descen</a>t but of identical position in the scheme of development." "Cope postulated a growth-force named "bathmism;" concentrated in those parts of the body most in use, it developed them at the expense of other areas. By the last decade of the century, this Lamarckism had been developed to considerable depth (Cope, 1887, 1896; Hyatt, 1880, 1884, 1889)." Referring to the case of the midwife toad: "Was the india ink added by someone wishing to preserve the original marks, or was it deliberate sabotage, perhaps a Nazi plot to discredit evidence hostile to their racial theories? Koestler certainly has suggested that Kammerer's experiments may have been genuinely successful, although others think he was simply dishonest. (Aronson, 1975)."

In South America, marsupials and placentals shared the ecosystem (prior to the Great American Interchange); in Australia, marsupials prevailed; and in the Old World the placentals won out.

Most speciation involves <a href="#cladogenesis">cladogenesis</a> rather than <a href="#anagenesis">anagenesis</a>, and occurs via <a href="#peripatric_speciation">peripatric speciation</a>. Hence speciation is rarely found in the fossil record, because established, populous and widespread species (the sort that are most likely simply through greater numbers to leave fossil remains) usually change slowly, if at all, during their time of residence. New species tend to develop in a geographically limited region and stratigraphically limited extent, which is small in relation to the overall time and distribution of the species. Sampling of the <a href="#fossil_record">fossil record</a> will reveal a pattern of most species in stasis, with abrupt appearance of newly derived species being a consequence of ecological succession and dispersion. Adaptive change in lineages occurs mostly during periods of speciation, and trends in adaptation occur mostly through the mechanism of species selection.

Although the theory of evolution is a century and a half old the precise mechanism by which new species make their appearance in the biosphere is still a field of active research, with all the disagreements and debates that go with it. A number of types of speciation have been proposed:</p>
<p><i>Allopatric speciation</i> is supposed to be caused by the physical separation of specimens of what was one and the same species. The classical example is Darwin's work on the finches of the Galapagos Islands. The presumed scenario is that an ancestral species of finch reached the various islands and evolved in about as many different species as there are islands. The critical factor causing the speciation is usually assumed to be the severing of the gene flow between the population on an island and the mother population on the mainland. <a href="../science/biographies/M.html#Ernst_Mayr">Mayr</a> also stressed the small size of the new population and contended that e.g. the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama did not lead to much speciation of biota of the shallow seas at either side because both represented a far too large gene pool to allow allopatric speciation to occur. <small>Jcwf100131</small> </p>
<p><i>Peripatric speciation</i> is taken to occur in the same geographic areaâ€”without severance of the gene flowâ€”due to ecological differences, e.g. the existence of two different ecological niches into which an existing species can specialize. <small>Jcwf100131</small>. Alternatively, a population of an ancestral <a href="#species">species</a> in a geographically peripheral part of the ancestral range is modified over time until even when the ancestral and daughter populations come into contact, there is reproductive isolation.

The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes. Viruses are not typically considered to be <a href="../life/glossary.html#organism">organisms</a> because they are incapable of "independent" or autonomous reproduction or metabolism. Their origins are unclear: some may have evolved from <a href="#plasmid">plasmids</a>, others from <a href="#bacteria">bacteria</a>. Viruses are an important means of <a href="#horizontal_gene_transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a>, which increases <a href="#genetic_diversity">genetic diversity</a>. The study of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality of microbiology. <small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus">Wikipedia</a>)</small></p></div>

<div class="glsent"><p><b><a name="web_of_life"></a>Web of life</b> conventionally refers to the food chain or trophic network, describes the feeding relationships between different species in an ecosystem.

<div class="glsent"><p><b><a name="Williams_revolution"></a>Williams revolution</b> <a href="../science/glossary.html#paradigm">paradigm shift</a> of the 1960s which saw the gene become the focus of evolutionary thinking, which saw evolutionary biology united with <a href="#genetics">genetics</a>. The revolution is named after George C. Williams, whose 1966 book <i>Adaptation and Natural Selection</i> popularised the theory. Previously most evolutionary thinkers considered <a href="#natural_selection">selection</a> to favour <a href="../life/glossary.html#organism">individuals</a>, groups (<a href="#group_selection">group selection</a>) and <a href="#species">species</a>, such as individuals acting "for the good of the species". The Williams revolution, however, established <a href="#gene_selection">gene selection</a> as the principal process of selection, and showed that because genes were the units of selection, selection would favour genes which maximised their own survival, not that of the group or species. <small>(<a href="http://evolutionwiki.org/wiki/Williams_revolution">EvoWiki</a>)</small></p></div>

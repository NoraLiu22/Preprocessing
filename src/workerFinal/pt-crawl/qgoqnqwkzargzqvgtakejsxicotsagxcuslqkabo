/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        2024]]</font> My article on this subject in the issue of <em>The Independent</em> 
        of February 26th having excited considerable interest, and several astronomers 
        having done me the honor to criticise it, I gladly take the opportunity 
        now offered me of making a brief reply to some of my critics, and also 
        of defining my position somewhat more clearly.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may at once admit 
        that my former article, owing to the limited time then at my disposal, 
        was written somewhat hastily; and that I made several suggestions and 
        admissions which were of little importance to my general subject, but 
        which laid me open to adverse criticism. Such were a comparison of the 
        stars of the Milky Way with the molecules of a gas, a comparison which 
        I think I have seen made by some writer, but which was suggested to me 
        by the repeated statements in all astronomical works that the proper motions 
        of the stars are <em>in all directions</em> and at various velocities, 
        which quite accords with those of gaseous molecules. I now see that there 
        is probably no justification for this idea, and that the facts that suggested 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 2025]]</font> it are <em>apparent</em> only. 
        A similar unfounded notion (I now think) was that of a variation of gravity 
        near the boundary of the universe, which, like the supposed loss of light 
        in passing through the ether, had better be altogether left out of our 
        calculations till some evidence has been adduced in support of them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point 
        to which several of my critics have referred, and as to which I think 
        they have somewhat misrepresented me, no doubt quite unintentionally, 
        is my supposed statement that our sun is placed at the exact center of 
        the universe. On looking over my article I find that I have in most places 
        when referring to this question used qualifying words, such as &quot;at or 
        near the very central point&quot;--that we are &quot;nearly equally distant from 
        every part of&quot; the Milky Way--&quot;that our sun is one of the central orbs 
        of a globular star cluster,&quot; which cluster occupies &quot;a nearly central 
        position&quot;--that it is &quot;very near to, if not actually at, the center of 
        the whole visible universe&quot;--and then, for once, I omit the qualification 
        and use the words, &quot;in all probability, in the <em>center</em> of the 
        <em>whole material universe</em>.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this one slip 
        some of my critics appear to have had chiefly in mind. Professor Turner 
        says that my argument is that life &quot;is only possible at the exact center,&quot; 
        and that, tho our sun is a mere unit of the solar cluster, I claim that 
        it is &quot;the central unit,&quot; whereas I say only &quot;one of the central orbs.&quot; 
        Professor Marcel Moye twice refers to me as saying that the sun is at 
        &quot;the very center&quot; of the Galaxy and of the universe (<em>Knowledge</em>, 
        June, p. 132). This, however, is a matter of detail hardly worth referring 
        to. I will therefore pass at once to the more important criticisms, which 
        are three in number: (1) That I have given no proof that the stars are 
        not infinite; (2) that the sun's motion through space shows that our present 
        central position can only be temporary, and (3) that there is no advantage 
        whatever in a central position. Let us consider these points a little 
        further.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Is the evidence 
        at our command for or against the infinite extension of the stellar universe? 
        This is the real question, the only question we are able to discuss rationally. 
        As to proof or disproof, either is impossible as regards what exists or 
        what does not exist in infinite space. And even as regards the probability 
        of any particular form of existence being infinite we have and can have 
        no evidence, and without evidence it is irrational to hold any definite 
        opinion. What I urged in my article was that we <em>do</em> possess several 
        distinct kinds of evidence, all pointing toward a limitation of our stellar 
        universe; and I still think that this evidence is sufficient, because 
        this universe being on the enormous scale we know it to be, it is the 
        only kind of evidence we can possibly get. I also find that most students 
        of general astronomy express themselves quite clearly on this point. Sir 
        John Herschel says that in some parts of the Milky Way there are &quot;spaces 
        absolutely dark <em>and completely void of any star</em>, even of the 
        smallest telescopic magnitude,&quot; and that, in other parts,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;extremely minute stars, tho 
          never altogether wanting, occur in numbers so moderate as to lead us 
          irresistibly to the conclusion that in these regions we see <em>fairly 
          through</em> the starry stratum, since it is impossible otherwise (supposing 
          their light not intercepted) that the numbers of the smaller magnitudes 
          should not go on continually increasing <em>ad infinitum</em>. In such 
          cases, moreover, the ground of the heavens, as seen between the stars, 
          is for the most part perfectly dark, which again would not be the case 
          if innumerable multitudes of stars, too minute to be individually discernible, 
          existed beyond.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again, after 
        stating that throughout by far the larger portion of the Milky Way the 
        background of the sky is generally black, and that there is also an absence 
        of excessive crowding of minute stars, he concludes that we have &quot;unequivocal 
        indications that its dimensions <em>in directions where these conditions 
        obtain</em>, are not only not infinite, but that the space-penetrating 
        power of our telescopes suffices fairly to pierce through and beyond it.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These opinions of 
        the man who had studied the whole sphere of the heavens most completely, 
        and who had calmly and deliberately thought out most of the great problems 
        of astronomy throughout a life devoted to the science, are certainly <font color="990000">[[p. 
        2026]]</font> worthy of our attention, and should outweigh the opinions 
        or prejudices of those who ask for proofs of what cannot be proved.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among modern astronomers 
        Dr. Isaac Roberts tells us that eleven years ago he took photographs of 
        the Great Nebula in Andromeda, and has recently taken photographs of the 
        same object with the same instrument (his 20-inch reflector) and with 
        the same exposures, but with more sensitive plates than were obtainable 
        at the earlier period. But altho in the more recent plates both the nebulosity 
        and the star-images are denser, they show no greater number of stars than 
        the earlier ones. Exactly similar facts are recorded in the case of the 
        Orion Nebula and the Pleiades.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another modern astronomer, 
        Mr. J. E. Gore, speaks very strongly on this question. He says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;Those 
          who do not give the subject sufficient consideration seem to think that 
          the number of the stars is practically infinite, or, at least, that 
          the number is so great that it cannot be estimated. But this idea is 
          totally incorrect, and due to complete ignorance of telescopic revelations. 
          It is certainly true that, to a certain extent, the larger the telescope 
          the more the number of the stars seems to increase; but we now know 
          that there is a limit to this increase of telescopic vision. And the 
          evidence clearly shows that we are rapidly approaching this limit. Altho 
          the number of stars visible in the Pleiades rapidly increases at first 
          with increase in the size of the telescope used, and altho photography 
          has still further increased the number of stars in this remarkable cluster, 
          it has recently been found that an increased length of exposure--beyond 
          three hours--adds very few stars to the number visible on the photograph 
          taken at the Paris Observatory in 1885, on which over 2,000 stars can 
          be counted. Even with this great number on so small an area of the heavens, 
          comparatively large vacant places are visible between the stars, and 
          a glance at the original photograph is sufficient to show that there 
          would be ample room for many times the number actually visible.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And, referring to the fact that, near the 
        North Pole of the Galaxy, Celoria, with a quite small telescope he was 
        able to see almost exactly the same number of stars as Sir William Herschel, 
        with his very powerful instruments, he remarks:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;Their 
          absence, therefore, seems certain proof that very faint stars do not 
          exist in that direction, and that here, at least, the sidereal universe 
          is limited in extent.&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These extracts are 
        sufficient to show that astronomers of repute, and with a combination 
        of practical and theoretical knowledge which I make no claim to possess, 
        have arrived at the conclusion that the stellar universe is limited in 
        extent; and I might have quoted Professor Newcomb, Miss Clerke and many 
        others in a similar sense. But directly I, an outsider, venture to set 
        forth the same view, and found it upon three distinct kinds of evidence, 
        of which this is one, I am accused of &quot;starting a myth,&quot; and it is asserted 
        that my &quot;attempted demonstration of the finite nature of the universe 
        breaks down entirely.&quot; This statement is founded upon the possible and 
        probable existence of dark stars and other cosmic matter to such an enormous 
        amount that they would shut out the light from all stars beyond a certain 
        distance. Of course, there probably are great numbers of dark stars, but 
        what proportion they bear to the bright stars no one can tell at present. 
        It is a point which cannot be determined from any general principles, 
        because it must depend upon the whole series of causes which produce so 
        many luminous stars. We must know what is the average life of a luminous 
        star, and also what is the average dormant period of a dark star before 
        it becomes luminous again, if it ever does so. Of these two groups of 
        facts we know absolutely nothing, except that there has been very little 
        change in the brighter stars during the historical period, and that our 
        sun has certainly been giving out both light and heat to nearly its present 
        amount for many millions of years. We may fairly suppose that the dark 
        stars are at least equal in number to the bright ones, or, perhaps, that 
        they are ten times or a hundred times as numerous; few probably would 
        believe, without any evidence whatever, that they are a thousand times 
        as numerous. But even if they were so abundant as this they would not 
        materially diminish the light of the stars, as has been well shown by 
        one of my less adverse critics, Mr. W. H. S. Monck, who on this point 
        is on my side. In <em>Knowledge</em> (May, 1903), he shows that the <font color="990000">[[p. 
        2027]] </font>difference between the light the stars actually give and 
        what they would give if they extended to an infinite distance, and were 
        distributed in anything approaching a similar density, is so enormous 
        that, even if the dark stars were 150,000 times as numerous as the bright 
        ones and both extended to infinity, every part of the heavens should be 
        as bright as the face of the moon. Few persons, I presume, will claim 
        that they are more numerous than this high proportion, while even if they 
        are so numerous some one or more occultations of bright stars (not due 
        to a dark companion) would almost certainly have been observed, since 
        we must assume that all these dark stars have on the average an equal 
        size and as great proper motions as the bright ones. A dark star with 
        a diameter of a million miles and a velocity of ten miles a second would 
        occult a star of the same size and double the distance for about fourteen 
        hours, but with only a few minutes of total obscurity. If the dark star 
        were larger and the bright one less distant from it the period of obscuration 
        would be greater. As such occultations of lucid stars would be visible 
        to the naked eye, and from what we know of the proper motions of the stars 
        and their great diversity of size, might last for periods of from a few 
        hours to a few days, <em>and not recur</em>, and as such a phenomenon 
        has <em>never</em> been observed, we must conclude that the proportion 
        of dark bodies is <em>not</em> so excessive as in the case supposed by 
        Mr. Monck, and therefore that the stars as a whole--bright and dark--are 
        not infinite in number.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My critics who put 
        forward the hypothesis of dark stars partially obscuring the bright ones, 
        and ultimately totally obscuring those beyond a certain distance, do not 
        attempt to show what that hypothesis implies, or consider if it would 
        explain the observed facts. They ignore the essential point in the evidence, 
        which is, that the ratio of increase in the number of stars from magnitude 
        to magnitude, as determined by the lucid stars, continues to be fairly 
        accurate down to the ninth or tenth magnitude, and then, almost suddenly, 
        ceases to be accurate, so that all minute stars down to the seventeenth 
        magnitude are much less numerous than they ought to be. If we assume dark 
        stars to exist in any large proportion we have no right to assume that 
        they are distributed very differently, on the average, from the bright 
        ones. Consequently, the lucid stars and the telescopic stars down to the 
        tenth magnitude ought to have their light diminished in the same proportion 
        as the remainder down to the seventeenth magnitude. We must remember that 
        there is no proof whatever of these very minute stars being on the average 
        further off than the rest. If they are most abundant in the Milky Way, 
        so are stars of the first magnitude. Professor Newcomb says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;The 
          smallest stars that we see with the most powerful telescopes are not, 
          for the most part, more distant than those a grade brighter, but are 
          mostly stars of less luminosity situate in the same regions.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Then we have the remarkable fact that the 
        31 bright stars, above 3.5 magnitude, whose parallax has been measured 
        are twice as far from us on the average as the 41 stars from 3.5 down 
        to 9.5, these being the whole of the stars whose distances Professor Newcomb 
        considers to be fairly well determined. Mr. Thomas Lewis, of the Royal 
        Observatory, Greenwich, announced the same fact in 1895, but dividing 
        the stars somewhat differently. He found that stars from 2.70 down to 
        about 8.40 magnitude had, on the average, double the parallaxes of the 
        brighter stars above 2.70, and were therefore only half the distance from 
        us. We thus see that there is no fixed relation between the apparent size 
        and the nearness of the stars, and it follows that the rapid diminution 
        in the number of stars below a certain magnitude cannot be explained by 
        any amount of dark bodies unless we suppose also an exceedingly unequal 
        distribution of those bodies. Hypothetically numerous dark stars, hypothetically 
        distributed, do not form a very strong argument for rejecting direct inferences 
        from the distribution of the stars. I therefore venture to think that 
        the three converging lines of evidence which I have adduced, leading to 
        the conclusion that the stellar universe <em>is</em> limited in extent, 
        have not even been weakened by the arguments hitherto brought against 
        them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The next point 
        urged by my critics, and that on which they lay most <font color="990000">[[p. 
        2028]]</font> stress, is, that even if our sun is in a central position 
        now, its known motion through space shows that the position is only temporary 
        and can have no real significance. Professor Turner assures us that, without 
        the tremendous inference I draw from it,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font  size="-1">&quot;the fact itself, if fact it 
          be, can only invite our polite attention as a curious coincidence. Even 
          as a coincidence it does not take high rank; for it can, in any case, 
          only be temporary. If there <em>is</em> a center to the visible universe 
          and if we occupy it to-day, we certainly did not do so yesterday, and 
          shall not do so to-morrow. The solar system is known to be moving among 
          the stars with a velocity which would carry us to Sirius in 100,000 
          years if we happened to be traveling in his direction, as we are not. 
          In the 50 or 100 million years during which, according to geologists, 
          this earth has been a habitable globe, we must have passed by thousands 
          of stars on the right hand and on the left.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And he concludes that</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;so far from our having tranquilly 
          enjoyed a central position 'in unbroken continuity for scores or perhaps 
          hundreds of millions of years,' we should in that time have traversed 
          the Universe from boundary to boundary.&quot;<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking Professor 
        Newcomb's estimate of the dimensions of the whole stellar universe, he 
        finds that we should pass across it from boundary to boundary in forty-five 
        million years. Thus lightly and confidently does Professor Turner dispose 
        of the fact that we are, broadly speaking, in a central position with 
        regard to the Milky Way.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. E. Walter Maunder 
        (in <em>Knowledge</em>, April, 1903) supports this view. He says, speaking 
        of our sun's motion through space:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;If 
          this pace has been maintained in a straight line, five million years 
          ago we were deep in the actual stream of the Milky Way; five million 
          years hence we shall have completely crossed the gulf which it encircles 
          and again be a member of one of its constituent groups on the opposite 
          side.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This statement begins with an &quot;if,&quot; but 
        it concludes so positively that no reader would imagine there was any 
        reasonable doubt as to the conclusion arrived at.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another astronomical 
        critic, Prof. Marcel Moye, of Montpellier University, adopts the same 
        view (in <em>Knowledge</em>, of June, 1903). He says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;Further, 
          if, by hypothesis, at a given instant, the sun were at the center of 
          the universe, it would lose its position soon, and never return to it 
          again. We must not forget the proper motion of our luminary, a motion 
          of ten miles per second, at least.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The views here stated 
        by three official astronomers have greatly surprised me, because they 
        assume that the sun, and presumably most of the other stars, are alike 
        moving in straight lines at various speeds and in various directions, 
        and that these motions have been in the same straight lines for many millions 
        of years past, and will be so for many million years to come, carrying 
        us and them in various directions into or beyond the Milky Way. As regards 
        our sun this view is put forth as a proof that its present nearly central 
        position cannot have existed in the past and will not exist in the future; 
        and, therefore, as a complete refutation of my view, that its present 
        central position is a fact of great significance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what surprises 
        me is that all these gentlemen should have either forgotten or have purposely 
        ignored the existence of gravitation. For within a system of hundreds 
        of millions of suns, irregularly distributed, and supposed to be on the 
        average much larger than ours, motion in a straight line, not only for 
        millions of years, but for any one year, is impossible. This view of even 
        approximately straight line motion of our sun--&quot;traversing the universe 
        from boundary to boundary&quot;--implies that such motion was not acquired 
        by gravitation within the universe, but was given to it by some outer 
        force; and, therefore, if <em>all</em> the proper motions of the stars 
        were acquired in the same way--that they were driven into the universe 
        from without--then indeed the whole system would be more analogous to 
        the molecules of a gas than to a universe in which gravitation was the 
        chief or the only ruling force.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still more surprising 
        is the circumstance that my critics have ignored the fact that this determination 
        of the sun's motion at a certain rate and in a certain direction is founded 
        upon an <em>assumption</em>, which assumption is known to be partially 
        and may be wholly erroneous. The assumption is that the proper motions 
        of the stars are not systematic, have no <font color="990000">[[p. 2029]]</font> 
        relation to each other, but are wholly random motions. Now, in the first 
        place, hardly any mathematical astronomers believe this to be really the 
        case, and many are searching in every direction for <em>systematic</em> 
        motions in some part or the whole of the heavens. And, in the second place, 
        some such systematic motions do actually exist. By carefully charting 
        all the proper motions known at the time, the late Mr. R. A. Proctor showed 
        that in various parts of the heavens groups of stars were moving together 
        in the same direction and at exactly or nearly the same speed. Five stars 
        in the Great Bear, three in Cassiopeia, and almost all in the Pleiades 
        thus move together. He termed these motions &quot;star drift,&quot; and till such 
        motions are carefully searched for and compared with each other we cannot 
        say that the apparent motions of any stars are not systematic. M. Rancken 
        and Mr. Maxwell Hall have both discovered what they believe to be very 
        extensive systematic motions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the effect 
        of these facts and indications upon the determination of the direction 
        and rate of motion of our sun, I will give the opinion of three astronomical 
        writers of repute. Mr. W. H. S. Monck, of Dublin, says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;The 
          proof of this motion rests on the assumption that if we take a sufficient 
          number of stars their real motions in all directions will be equal, 
          and that, therefore, the apparent preponderances which we observe in 
          particular directions result from the real motion of the sun. But there 
          is no impossibility in a systematic motion of the majority of the stars 
          used in these researches which might reconcile the observed facts with 
          a motionless sun. And, in the second place, if the sun is not in the 
          exact center of gravity of the universe, we might expect him to be moving 
          in an orbit around this center of gravity, and our observations on his 
          actual motion are not sufficiently numerous or accurate to enable us 
          to affirm that he is moving in a right line rather than in such an orbit.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Again, Miss A. M. Clerke, the historian 
        of modern astronomy, in her &quot;System of the Stars,&quot; speaks still more strongly 
        on the same question, as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;For 
          the assumption that the absolute movements of the stars have no preference 
          for one direction over another forms the basis of all investigations 
          hitherto conducted into the translatory advance of the solar system. 
          The little fabric of laboriously acquired knowledge regarding it at 
          once crumbles if that basis has to be removed.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And quite recently Mr. W. W. Campbell, of 
        the Lick Observatory, writes as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;The 
          motion of the Solar System is a purely relative quantity. It refers 
          to specified groups of stars. The results for various groups may differ 
          widely, and all be correct. It would be easy to select a group of stars 
          with reference to which the solar motion would be reversed 180 degrees 
          from the value assigned above.&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears, then, 
        that whether we consider the effects of gravitation, which almost always 
        lead to motions either in elliptical orbits or in some other allied curves, 
        or whether we take into account the extreme uncertainty, if not total 
        invalidity, of the data on which all determinations of the sun's motion 
        through space depend, my chief astronomical critics have misled their 
        readers by setting before them the supposed motion of the sun as if it 
        were certainly in a straight line and not in some orbit around a center, 
        and also as if both its direction and velocity were determined by methods 
        of observation as secure as those by which the distances of the sun and 
        of the nearest stars have been measured. So far, then, as the objections 
        to my views depending upon the sun's motion through space are concerned, 
        I submit that I have shown them to be wholly worthless.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The third most 
        confidently stated criticism of my article was that, even if we were in 
        a central position in the stellar universe, and if that position were 
        a permanent one, it would not be of the least use to us as an inhabited 
        world. Professor H. H. Turner says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;We 
          have no reason for supposing that if the stars were blotted out of existence 
          our sun would become dead and cold sensibly sooner than under present 
          conditions. The accepted belief is that his slow contraction is sufficient 
          to account for the energy radiated, and other observed phenomena; and 
          it has never, so far as I am aware, been suggested that we are kept 
          alive by the attractive powers of our neighbors, the fixed stars, or 
          by their influence in any other form. We might wander into outer space 
          without losing anything more <font color="990000">[[p. 2030]]</font> 
          serious than we lose when the night is cloudy and we cannot see the 
          stars.&quot;<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this way of 
        looking at the question is a very one-sided and imperfect one. We are 
        situated <em>in</em> a vast universe and are products of it. We cannot 
        detach ourselves from it and say, &quot;we do not want the rest of the universe; 
        the stars are no good to us; so long as we have our sun all the rest may 
        go.&quot; The universe is a mighty organism; its whole aspect and structure 
        assure us of the fact. We are a portion of it, and owe our position, our 
        surroundings, our very existence to it. Looking at it as an evolutionist, 
        I believe that it is only by tracing it back to some necessary earlier 
        state that we shall be able to form some rational conception of <em>how</em> 
        it has evolved, <em>how</em> it has come to be what it is, how <em>we</em> 
        have come to be where we are. Then, and then only, shall we be able to 
        give any probable answer to the question, What advantages have we derived 
        from our nearly central position?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all these points 
        I could find hardly any suggestions of enlightenment in astronomical literature, 
        but, rather, what seem to me now to be unnecessary difficulties thrown 
        in the way of the inquirer; and at the time I wrote my article I had no 
        clear ideas on the subject myself. Hence my vague and weak suggestion 
        of stellar radiations affecting us. But, having undertaken to write a 
        book upon the same subject as my article, I have for some three or four 
        months been almost daily more or less occupied with it, and have quite 
        recently reached what is, to myself at all events, a satisfactory explanation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light first came 
        to me through reading (so far as a nonmathematician can read such a work) 
        Lord Kelvin's remarkable article in the <em>Philosophical Magazine</em> 
        of January, 1902, &quot;On the Clustering of Gravitational Matter in Any Part 
        of the Universe.&quot; In the first place, this removed the difficulty, which 
        almost all writers upon the stellar universe had dwelt upon, as to the 
        proper motions of the stars being often so large that they <em>could not</em> 
        have been produced by gravitation within the universe. By different, but 
        yet quite probable assumptions as to the primitive extent of the universe 
        and the mass of matter within it, Lord Kelvin shows that the average proper 
        motions are such as <em>could be</em> produced by gravitation. But he 
        does not, as I had hoped he would have done, go on to explain how his 
        preliminary assumptions would or might lead to a universe constituted 
        like that which we see around us.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having arrived at 
        the last chapter of my book I was for some weeks puzzling myself over 
        this problem, <em>some</em> solution of which I felt to be essential to 
        the completion of my work; and at last--as I usually find to be the case--the 
        sought-for solution came to me, and brought with it, as I had expected 
        it would bring, a very clear explanation of the extreme importance of 
        our central position as the only one which could afford the conditions 
        which are absolutely essential for the long processes of life development. 
        This enabled me to complete my work, which is now ready for the press, 
        and I hope will be published shortly after the appearance of this article.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The careful study 
        of the whole subject during the preparation of this work has greatly strengthened 
        the position I took in my first article. In the portion devoted to the 
        biology and physics of the earth and solar system especially, I have found 
        that such delicate adjustments and such numerous combinations of physical 
        and chemical conditions are required for the development and maintenance 
        of life as to render it in the highest degree improbable that they should 
        all be again found combined in any planet; while within the solar system 
        this improbability approaches very near indeed to a certainty. This part 
        of my work contains so much novel and suggestive matter as to throw quite 
        a new light on a subject which, so far as I know, has never before been 
        so fully discussed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the astronomical 
        portion of the volume also I have shown that a large body of facts due 
        to recent researches have a direct bearing upon the question of there 
        being other inhabited planets revolving around other suns. On this question 
        of course there can be no direct evidence; but the facts that I adduce 
        will, I think, satisfy those who come to <font color="990000">[[p. 2031]]</font> 
        the subject without prepossessions on one side or the other that the combination 
        of probabilities against such an occurrence are so great as to lead to 
        the provisional conclusion that our earth is the only inhabited planet 
        in the whole stellar universe.</p>

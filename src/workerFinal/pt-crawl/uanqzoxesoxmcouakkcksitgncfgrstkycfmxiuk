Died</em>.</center>

<p>In the year of the Lord 1348 there was a very great pestilence in the
city and district of Florence.&nbsp; It was of such a fury and so tempestuous
that in houses in which it took hold previously healthy servants who took
care of the ill died of the same illness.&nbsp; Almost none of the ill
survived past the fourth day.&nbsp; Neither physicians nor medicines were
effective.&nbsp; Whether because these illnesses were previously unknown
or because physicians had not previously studied them, there seemed to
be no cure.
<p>There was such a fear that no one seemed to know what to do.&nbsp; When
it took hold in a house it often happened that no one remained who had
not died.&nbsp; And it was not just that men and women died, but even sentient
animals died.&nbsp; Dogs, cats, chickens, oxen, donkeys sheep showed the
same symptoms and died of the same disease.&nbsp; And almost none, or very
few, who showed these symptoms, were cured.&nbsp; The symptoms were the
following:&nbsp; a bubo in the groin, where the thigh meets the trunk;
or a small swelling under the armpit; sudden fever; spitting blood and
saliva (and no one who spit blood survived it).
<p>It was such a frightful thing that when it got into a house, as was
said, no one remained.&nbsp; Frightened people abandoned the house and
fled to another.&nbsp; Those in town fled to villages.&nbsp; Physicians
could not be found because they had died like the others.&nbsp; And those
who could be found wanted vast sums in hand before they entered the house.&nbsp;
And when they did enter, they checked the pulse with face turned away.&nbsp;
They inspected the urine from a distance and with something odoriferous
under their nose.
<p>Child abandoned the father, husband the wife, wife the husband, one
brother the other, one sister the other.&nbsp; In all the city there was
nothing to do but to carry the dead to a burial.&nbsp; And those who died
had neither confessor nor other sacraments.&nbsp; And many died with no
one looking after them.&nbsp; And many died of hunger because when someone
took to bed sick, another in the house, terrified, said to him:&nbsp; "I'm
going for the doctor."&nbsp; Calmly walking out the door, the other left
and did not return again.&nbsp; Abandoned by people, without food, but
accompanied by fever, they weakened.
<p>There were many who pleaded with their relatives not to abandon them
when night fell.&nbsp; But [the relatives] said to the sick person, "So
that during the night you do not have to awaken those who serve you and
who work hard day and night, take some sweetmeats, wine or water.&nbsp;
They are here on the bedstead by your head; here are some blankets."&nbsp;
And when the sick person had fallen asleep, they left and did not return.
<p>If it happened that he was strengthened by the food during the night,
he might be alive and strong enough to get to the window.&nbsp; If the
street was not a major one, he might stand there a half hour before anyone
came by.&nbsp; And if someone did pass by, and if he was strong enough
that he could be heard when he called out to them, sometimes there might
be a response and sometimes not, but there was no help.
<p>No one, or few, wished to enter a house where anyone was sick, nor did
they even want to deal with those healthy people who came out of a sick
person's house.&nbsp; And they said to them:&nbsp; "He is stupefied, do
not speak to him!" saying further:&nbsp; "He has it because there is a
<i>bubo</i>
in his house."&nbsp; They call the swelling a <i>bubo</i>.
<p>Many died unseen.&nbsp; So they remained in their beds until they stank.&nbsp;
And the neighbors, if there were any, having smelled the stench, placed
them in a shroud and sent them for burial.&nbsp; The house remained open
and yet there was no one daring enough to touch anything because it seemed
that things remained poisoned and that whoever used them picked up the
illness.
<p>At every church, or at most of them, they dug deep trenches, down to
the waterline, wide and deep, depending on how large the parish was.&nbsp;
And those who were responsible for the dead carried them on their backs
in the night in which they died and threw them into the ditch, or else
they paid a high price to those who would do it for them.&nbsp; The next
morning, if there were many [bodies] in the trench, they covered them over
with dirt.&nbsp; And then more bodies were put on top of them, with a little
more dirt over those; they put layer on layer just like one puts layers
of cheese in a lasagna.
<p>The <i>beccamorti</i> [vultures] who provided their service, were paid
such a high price that many were enriched by it.&nbsp; Many died from [carrying
away the dead] , some rich, some after earning just a little, but high
prices continued.&nbsp; Servants, or those who took care of the ill, charged
from one to three florins per day and the cost of things grew.
<p>The things that the sick ate, sweetmeats and sugar, seemed priceless.&nbsp;
Sugar cost from three to eight florins per pound.&nbsp; And other confections
cost similarly.&nbsp; Capons and other poultry were very expensive and
eggs cost between twelve and twenty-four pence each; and he was blessed
who could find three per day even if he searched the entire city.
<p>Finding wax was miraculous.&nbsp; A pound of wax would have gone up
more than a florin if there had not been a stop put [by the communal government]
to the vain ostentation that the Florentines always make [over funerals].&nbsp;
Thus it was ordered that no more than two large candles could be carried
[in any funeral].
<p>Churches had no more than a single bier which usually was not sufficient.&nbsp;
Spice dealers and <i>beccamorti</i> sold biers, burial palls, and cushions
at very high prices.&nbsp; Dressing in expensive woolen cloth as is customary
in [mourning] the dead, that is in a long cloak, with mantle and veil that
used to cost women three florins climbed in price to thirty florins and
would have climbed to 100 florins had the custom of dressing in expensive
cloth not been changed.&nbsp; The rich dressed in modest woolens, those
not rich sewed [clothes] in linen.
<p>Benches on which the dead were placed cost like the heavens and still
the benches were only a hundredth of those needed.&nbsp; Priests were not
able to ring bells as they would have liked.&nbsp; Concerning that [the
government] issued ordinances discouraging the sounding of bells, sale
of burial benches, and limiting expenses.&nbsp; They could not sound bells,
sell benches, nor cry out announcements because the sick hated to hear
of this and it discouraged the healthy as well.&nbsp; Priests and friars
went [to serve] the rich in great multitudes and they were paid such high
prices that they all got rich.&nbsp; And therefore [the authorities] ordered
that one could not have more than a prescribed number [of clerics] of the
local parish church.&nbsp; And the prescribed number of friars was six.
<p>All fruits with a nut at the center, like unripe plums and unhusked
almonds, fresh broadbeans, figs and every useless and unhealthy fruit,
were forbidden entrance into the city.&nbsp; Many processions, including
those with relics and the painted tablet of Santa Maria Inpruneta, went
through the city crying our "Mercy" and praying and then they came to a
stop in the piazza of the Priors.&nbsp; There they made peace concerning
important controversies, injuries and deaths.
<p>This [pestilence] was a matter of such great discouragement and fear
that men gathered together in order to take some comfort in dining together.&nbsp;
And each evening one of them provided dinner to ten companions and the
next evening they planned to eat with one of the others.&nbsp; And sometimes
if they planned to eat with a certain one he had no meal prepared because
he was sick.&nbsp; Or if the host had made dinner for the ten, two or three
were missing.&nbsp; Some fled to villas, others to villages in order to
get a change of air.&nbsp; Where there had been no [pestilence], there
they carried it; if it was already there, they caused it to increase.
<p>None of the guilds in Florence was working.&nbsp; All the shops were
shut, taverns closed; only the apothecaries and the churches remained open.&nbsp;
If you went outside, you found almost no one.&nbsp; And many good and rich
men were carried from home to church on a pall by four <i>beccamorti</i>
and one tonsured clerk who carried the cross.&nbsp; Each of them wanted
a florin.
<p>This mortality enriched apothecaries, doctors, poultry vendors, <i>beccamorti</i>,
and greengrocers who sold of poultices of mallow, nettles, mercury and
other herbs necessary to draw off the infirmity.&nbsp; And it was those
who made these poultices who made a lot of money.&nbsp; Woolworkers and
vendors of remnants of cloth who found themselves in possession of cloths
[after the death of the entrepreneur for whom they were working] sold it
to whoever asked for it.
<p>When the mortality ended, those who found themselves with cloth of any
kind or with raw materials for making cloth was enriched.&nbsp; But many
found [who actually owned cloths being processed by workers] found it to
be moth-eaten, ruined or lost by the weavers.&nbsp; Large quantities of
raw and processed wool were lost throughout the city and countryside.
<p>This pestilence began in March, as was said, and ended in September
1348.&nbsp; And people began to return to look after their houses and possessions.&nbsp;
And there were so many houses full of goods without a master that it was
stupefying.&nbsp; Then those who would inherit these goods began to appear.&nbsp;
And such it was that those who had nothing found themselves rich with what
did not seem to be theirs and they were unseemly because of it.&nbsp; Women
and men began to dress ostentatiously.</td>

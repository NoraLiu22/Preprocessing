&nbsp; &nbsp; The language of gestures was born with man and is reborn every day as part
of his need to express himself. Before the human voice developed, gestures
served not only to communicate but to aid in the development of vocal
sounds. Later they were incorporated in the first forms of written language
of, for example, the Egyptians, the Aztecs, and in the pictographic
writings of the Hebrews. Gestures and expressive movement were also utilized
in ancient religious dances and ceremonies. And from the ancient ceremonies
in China, Japan, India, and Egypt emerged the actor, who was at once a
dancer, singer, and mime.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; In Greece, the first recorded pantomime actor is the legendary dancer
Telestes, who in Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes (467 B.C.) detached
himself from the chorus to interpret, through rhythmic steps and gestures,
the action that the chorus sang or recited. With the addition of text,
protagonists, and stage sets, miming and dance remained intrinsic to both
tragedy and comedy. As the Greek theatre developed movement became basic to
the actor's art.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; And, though the art of mime in Greece developed into several distinct
categories, it rarely separated from dance and speaking theatre. Only among
the Romans did it disengage from dance and speech to give birth to
pantomime. Roman pantomime consisted of short, improvised, burlesque scenes
and depicted current events and themes of love, adultery, and mocking of
the gods. During the age of Julius Caesar it became more literary in the
works of, for example, Laberius (106-43 B.C.). While tragic pantomime was
developed by Pylades of Cicilia and his disciples, his rival Bathyllus of
Alexandria and his followers performed comic pantomime.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; After the fall of the Roman Empire, entertainers who inherited the
Greco-Roman mime traditions sang, danced, imitated, and performed
acrobatics at the courts and at private banquets throughout Europe. And
despite the ups and downs of their fortune, strolling jongleurs and mimes
never abandoned the ancient mime traditions. The mimes, who earlier had
played a role in the Latin comedy's development and in the works of authors
such as Plautus, later collaborated in the religious and comic theatre of
the Middle Ages. And these same traditions and this mimic spirit would be
revived when they fused with one of the richest theatre forms in Europe,
the commedia dell'arte.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the Greco-Roman mime and Atellan farce, the commedia dell'arte
contains stock character types, masks, farcical action, and scenes full of
bastinadoes, acrobatics, and amusing stage business. The scenarios are
short and simple and the action flexible enough to allow the actor freedom
to improvise, mime, and clown. This improvisational element is reinforced
by the use of inserted bits of comical stock business, similar to the
tricae of Atellan farce, called lazzi.  Along with perfected technique, the
actor's art depends upon successfully linking these lazzi, often
transmitted from generation to generation, to the main action. Each actor
specializes in a stock character, which frequently has a counterpart in
ancient mimodrama or Atellan farce. Arlecchino with his shaven head and
flat feet, his multicolored coat and black mask, recalls the ancient Roman
buffoon, who daubed himself with soot.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, allegorical and
mythological, pageant-type ballet-pantomimes were performed at the courts
and in the theatres of Europe. Among them were the Duchesse du Maine's
ballet-pantomimes at Sceaux and John Weaver's staging of The Loves of Mars
and Venus at Drury Lane in 1717. The traditional dumb show in the
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century French and English melodramas, as well as
the Elizabethan dumb shows, were also called pantomimes. In France, after
the Italian Comedy was prohibited from playing in the official theatres and
spoken dialogues and monologues in French were also forbidden, pantomime
with commedia-type characters appeared at the Théâtres de la Foire. When
staged in the English music halls at Christmas, they were called
harlequinades. By the end of the nineteenth century, English Christmas
pantomimes such as Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk contained
spectacular scenic effects and popular music hall interludes with dialogue,
acrobatics, singing, and dancing in which Clown had replaced Harlequin and
Pierrot. And even though these Christmas pantomimes had almost no mime or
dumb show and contained mostly dialogue, singing, and dancing, they were
still called pantomimes or dumb shows because they included some element,
however remote, of miming's technique and art. In nineteenth-century
England and America, pantomime was incorporated into circus acts, as in
clown George Fox's (1825-77) Humpty Dumpty and in the performances of the
Hanlon-Lees.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, in France, Gaspard Deburau had immortalized the silent Pierrot
pantomimes, which we today call pantomime blanche because of the whiteface
the artist wears. All Paris came to applaud Deburau at the Théâtre des
Funambules. His Pierrot, though inspired by the lazy, mischievous valet
Pedrolino of the commedia dell'arte, soon became an essentially French
character. He changed Pierrot from a cynical, grotesque rogue into a poetic
fellow and brought a personal expression to the fantasy, acrobatics,
melodrama, and spectacular staging that characterized nineteenth-century
pantomimes. Not only did he add extempore bits of business to a given
action, but he also invented his own scenarios. Just as for several
centuries the commedia dell'arte, which depended on the actor's
improvisational skills, had influenced European theatre, nineteenth-century
pantomime, with Deburau's inventive genius, reached great heights.
Other nineteenth century French mimes such as Paul Legrand, Alexandre
Guyon, Louis Rouffe, and Séverin continued the Pierrot tradition. But at
the turn of the century, classical pantomime had become stereotyped. It was
Georges Wague who revitalized it and prepared the ground for modern mime,
discovering and training mimes such as the author Colette, who performed in
his company.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Mime also returned to the fore in 1923, when Jacques Copeau founded his
acting school at the Théâtre du Vieux Colombier, where miming with a mask
and doing exercises resembling those of the Noh drama helped the actor find
greater corporeal expressivity. Convinced that the human body alone
suffices to dress a bare stage, Copeau's student, Etienne Decroux, would
endlessly research and perfect these exercises, developing them into his
codified corporeal mime. His movement style was a far cry from the commedia
figure from which Pierrot took his model. Unlike classical pantomime,
corporeal mime was also no longer an anecdotal art that used conventional
gestures to create illusions of objects or persons. The impetus Decroux's
findings gave to twentieth-century mime had repercussions throughout the
world, opening dimensions in technique and expression unheard of since
ancient Greek mime and Roman pantomime.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; By the mid-twentieth century, Paris was the place for mimes to be. It was
here that several great masters gave new life to the mime art, as well as
merged it with other forms. Etienne Decroux, Marcel Marceau, and Jacques
Lecoq developed schools of mime that no longer represented traditional,
nineteenth-century pantomime. Their schools and styles differed from one
another, as much as they differed from Eastern European pantomime. It was
in Paris, too, that, after studying and performing with Decroux and
creating his own mimodramas, Jean-Louis Barrault brought Pierrot back to
the stage in a 1946 Baptiste pantomime at the Marigny Theatre and in the
role of Deburau in the film Children of Paradise. It was also in Paris that
Barrault integrated expressive movement with speaking theatre. Meanwhile,
Decroux's student, Marcel Marceau, would convert corporeal mime into an art
that could be readily communicated. Through his Bip and style pantomimes he
made this art known to the world. And while Decroux trained corporeal mimes
in Paris and New York, Jacques Lecoq taught mime not as a separate art but
as a research tool to further dramatic creativity as well as one which
could be combined with other arts. Lecoq's global training method fused the
art of the clown and the buffoon, juggling, acrobatics, spoken text, dance,
plastic arts, and all of life with body movement. His movement expression,
based on the observation of natural movement, opened up new directions for
physical theatre. Meanwhile, in 1978, Marceau opened his school in Paris
and taught workshops in America. Decroux, Barrault, and Lecoq inspired many
mimes and theatre artists to discover multiple styles of twentieth-century
movement theatre that, in turn, enriched other stage arts.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Through the contributions of Decroux, Marceau, and Lecoq three main schools
of mime developed in Europe that had worldwide repercussions. The more
commonly whitefaced, illusion pantomime portrayed concrete emotions and
situations by means of conventional gestures, creating the illusion of
something there which in reality is not. Corporeal mimes rejected this form
to express abstract and universal ideas and emotions through codified
movements of the entire body. Those in Lecoq movement theatre combined
acting, dance, and clowning with movement. However, in the 1980s, even the
whiteface, illusion pantomimists and Decroux's corporeal mimes began
expanding in many new directions. Instead of limiting themselves to silent
expression and classical pantomime or codified mime technique, they
experimented freely with texts and the use of voice. Some mimes wrote their
own texts, as did the Greek mime-authors, integrating the mime-actor's art
with the author's. They also included props, costumes, masks, lighting
effects, and music. Mime in the postmodern era thus incorporated so many
new elements that it was no longer referred to exclusively as mime. It was
called mime-dance, mime-clowning, mime-puppetry, New Vaudeville, etc. And
if it contained movement expression along with other elements, it was
loosely alluded to as physical or movement theatre.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; While the actor's total expressivity developed through the theories of
theatre animators, stage directors, and master teachers such as Jerzy
Grotowski and Eugenio Barba, who broadened the actor's physicality by means
of new training methods, barriers also began to break down to incorporate
other art forms into previously hermetic movement styles. Just as modern
mime had revolted against existing artistic forms, so postmodern mime and
movement theatre continued the anti-traditional wave against a modernism
grown too limited. In Europe, as well as in America, postmodern movement
artists abandoned the pure forms of modern mime and classical pantomime to
search for broader expressions.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Twentieth century verbal theatre also explored the use of physical
expression (mime in a broader sense) to create a more complete or total
form of theatre. This not only allowed the actor to challenge his own
creative resources but drew the spectator into a fuller sensory experience,
reestablishing the theatre as spectacle (from the Latin <i>spectare</i> meaning to
see) and giving free vent to the development of a fertile, richer, and more
visual theatre. <IMG SRC="images/womtfig.gif" width=20 height=20 HSPACE=3 align=absmiddle>

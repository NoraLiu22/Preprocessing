<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#000080">Wild Bill Hickok Kills Dave Tutt at 
Springfield, Missouri</font></b><font color="#000080"><span style="text-transform: capitalize"><font size="4"><br>
&nbsp;</font></span></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4" color="#000080">For some time 
after the close of the war Springfield was the resort of many hard characters. 
Adventurers of every sort came in and met the ruffians of both armies, who, 
lately disbanded, were seeking a livelihood by any means not involving hard 
work. Among those who were in the town in the summer of 1865 was one J. B. 
Hickok, who came to be known as &quot;Wild Bill,&quot; and as such has been made the hero 
of divers improbable adventures set forth in certain flashy, sensational 
publications. Hickok had been in the Federal service in Southwest Missouri and 
Northern Arkansas, as a scout for the army of the frontier, and in the 
performance of his duties had grown to be well acquainted with danger, and being 
by nature a ruffian he soon became a desperado - a drunken, swaggering fellow, 
who delighted when &quot;on a spree&quot; to frighten nervous men and timid women. After 
settling in Springfield a favorite diversion of his was to ride his horse on 
sidewalks and into saloons, hotels, stores, and other public places, and make 
the animal lie down and perform other tricks, to the infinite delight, no doubt, 
of the proprietors, none of whom, unfortunately, had grit enough to blow the 
bully's head off.<br>
<br>
A man after Wild Bill's own heart was one David Tutt, an ex-Confederate soldier, 
who had lived at Yellville, Arkansas, and had come, with his mother, sister and 
younger brothers, to Springfield, early in the spring. Tutt was a ruffian and 
and a crack pistol shot. He was said to have &quot;gotten in his work,&quot; not only on 
Federal soldiers, but on citizens who had crossed his path against his protest. 
Both Tutt and Hickok were gamblers, and good ones, although the ex-Confederate 
was the more proficient of the two. The two men mere boon companions for a time; 
the one touch of ruffianism made them both akin. They walked the streets 
together, they drank together, they gambled together - and in the latter pastime 
Tutt effectually &quot;cleaned out&quot; Bill. <br>
<br>
On the night of the 20th of July the two men played poker in a room at the &quot;Lyon 
House,&quot; now the Southern Hotel, on South street. Hickok was the loser. First his 
money went; then his watch, a fine gold hunting-cased &quot;Waltham,&quot; with a flashy 
chain and seal, then his diamond (?) pin and ring. He rose from the table 
completely &quot;strapped,&quot; and much irritated and crest-fallen. Everybody knew Wild 
Bill's watch, and after it had been surrendered to Tutt this night, Bill asked 
him at a special favor, not to wear it publicly, or let people know that it had 
changed owners, as he (Bill) felt bad enough already and did not want the 
evidence of his misfortune, of his ill-luck and bad playing, flaunted in 
everybody's face. <br>
<br>
Tutt laughed a mocking laugh at Bill's humiliation, and assured him that it 
would give him as much pleasure to wear the watch on the streets as it had 
already given him to win it. &quot;I intend wearing it in the morning,&quot; he added. 
Bill replied with an oath, &quot;If you do, I'll shoot you, and I warn you not to 
come across the square with it on.&quot; The two men parted and retired to their 
rooms- to put fresh caps on their revolvers! <br>
<br>
The next morning Tutt put on his watch, - and his revolver, too, and went down 
on the square. Going along the west side he entered the livery stable on the 
northwest corner and sat in the door where he could command a view of all four 
sides of the square, and especially of the Lyon House and South street. Very 
soon afterward Hickok came out of the hotel and down on the square, at the 
corner of South street. He stood on the west side of the street, and stopping 
one or two passers-by inquired if they had seen &quot;Dave Tutt down town this 
morning?&quot; On being told that Tutt was on the square, Bill said, &quot;Well, it's all 
right if he hain't got my watch on, but if he has there'll be merry hell, you 
bet your life!&quot; Tutt's younger brother came up, and to him Bill said, &quot;You had 
better go and tell Dave to take off that watch;&quot; and when young Tutt said he 
thought his brother had a right to wear what he pleased if it belonged to him, 
Bill answered, &quot;He shan't wear that watch anyhow.&quot; Just then Tutt came out of 
the livery stable and walked south along the square. Bill saw him and exclaimed, 
&quot;There he comes now.&quot; The little group about Bill scattered, and he took a few 
steps forward and drew his revolver, a Colt's dragoon, with cap and ball. <br>
<br>
Just as Tutt reached the corner of the court-house and Campbell street, Bill 
called out, &quot;Dave, don't you come across here with that watch.&quot; Tutt, as some 
say, drew his pistol, and almost instantly Bill fired, using one arm as a rest 
for his revolver. Tutt fell, shot nearly through the heart, and died very soon. 
Some deposed that Tutt's revolver was out of its scabbard when the body was 
first examined, and that Tutt had fired first. One chamber of the revolver was 
empty, and there were those who swore that they heard two pistol shots. Bill's 
shot was a fine one, but it is said by those who knew him well that it was a 
chance shot, for it is averred that when here Wild Bill was not considered a 
crack shot at all, and that his shot which killed Tutt at a distance of 75 yards 
was an accident. <br>
<br>
As soon as he had fired and seen that his shot had taken effect Bill handed over 
his pistols to the sheriff, who came up, and informed that officer he was his 
prisoner. A few minutes afterward Bill was observed riding leisurely up South 
street taking the morning air. The circuit court was in session at the time. 
Bill was promptly indicted, arrested on a bench warrant, and brought to trial. 
He was vigorously prosecuted by the circuit attorney, Maj. R. W. Fyan, and ably 
defended by Hon. John S. Phelps. Witnesses testified that they heard two shots, 
and that the first came from near where Tutt's body was found. The empty chamber 
of Tutt's revolver was exhibited, and upon the ground of &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; that 
Hickok was the aggressor, the jury acquitted him. There were those, however, who 
asserted that Hickok was cleared because he was an ex-Federal and a Radical, and 
the man he shot was a &quot;rebel,&quot; and the jury were all men who could take the 
&quot;Drake oath.&quot; A prominent attorney harangued the crowd from the balcony of the 
court house, and denounced the verdict as against the evidence and all decency, 
and there were threats of lynching Bill, but nothing was done, and he was 
allowed to live until shot by another desperate character, named Jack McCall, in 
Deadwood, D. T. <br>
<br>
Tutt's body was at first buried in the old cemetery, inside the city limits. In 
March, 1883, it was disinterred by Lewis Tutt, a former slave of the Tutt 
family, and reburied in Maple Park cemetery.</font></p>

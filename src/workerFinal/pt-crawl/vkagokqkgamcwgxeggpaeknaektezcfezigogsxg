<P>
The Silurian (443 to 417 million years ago) was a time when the
Earth underwent considerable changes that had important
repercussions for the environment and life within it.  The Silurian
witnessed a relative stabilization of the earth's general climate,
ending the previous pattern of erratic climatic fluctuations.  One
result of these changes was the melting of large glacial formations.
This contributed to a substantial rise in the levels of the major seas.
<P>
Coral reefs made their first appearance during this time, and the
Silurian was also a remarkable time in the evolution of fishes.  Not
only does this time period mark the wide and rapid spread of jawless
fish, but also the highly significant appearances of both the first
known freshwater fish as well as the first fish with jaws.
It is also at this time that our first good evidence of life on land is
preserved, including relatives of spiders and centipedes, and also the
earliest fossils of vascular plants.

<I>Patrice Lyons, Law Offices of Patrice Lyons, Chartered, Washington, D.C.</I>
<p>
Work has been going forward on the development of a frame of reference for locating
and invoking digital information services and objects over communication systems and
pathways having computational capabilities. An important concept in this context is the
notion of a 'digital object' as a set of sequences of bits, including a unique identifier for
the object called a 'handle'. A digital object may incorporate digital works and other
digital information in which copyright, patent, trade secret and other rights or interests
are claimed, although this need not always be the case. To take full advantage of the
global information infrastructure, it is helpful for a commercial enterprise to develop a
flexible terminology for thinking about digital information from a copyright perspective;
in this regard, the concept of 'digital work' is suggested. Clearance of rights and
interests in connection with the 'contents' of digital objects may be treated separately
from compliance with procedures for accessing digital objects viewed as entities that
incorporate and identify contents. A suggested legal framework is discussed in this paper.

<p>
Twenty applicants will selected on the strength of support of their
educational institution for innovation, and their interest and experience
in Computer Science education. Preference will be given to under-represented populations.  Three-page 
proposals should be send to fox@vt.edu by May 18, 1997. A proposal for funding
expenses is expected to be funded by the National Science Foundation.
<p>
Guidelines for Proposals:  We have an open first-come-first-served 
admission, but will give preference to:
<ul>
<li>Those at minority institutions,
<li>Those working with minorities,
<li>Those who have the strongest institutional commitment (e.g promise from Dean or Department. Head 
that innovations will be allowed / used, promise of release time to extend work),
<li>Those with interesting educational innovation ideas that fit in with our efforts, and 
<li> Those with background and experience that indicates they can benefit from the workshop.
</ul>
<p>
Location: Virginia Tech, in the Donaldson Brown Center for Continuing
Education and the Department of Computer Science, using a variety of labs,

educational development objectives of each attendee).
<p>
Coverage: This workshop will enable attendees to set up WWW sites to support Computer Science
education, make use of the extensive courseware and lab materials developed
at Virginia Tech and Norfolk State University since 1993, and to apply digital
library and WWW logging methods for delivery and evaluation.  There also will
be coverage of other NSF Education Innovation WWW pages/projects.
<p>

from all over the world who will present details of relevant research and
issues. We invite contributions in the form of
position papers addressing topics relevant to the theme of the workshop.
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
<ol>
<li>similarity retrieval of image data
<li>semantic content-based image retrieval
<li>agent-based image retrieval on the Web
<li>metadata models for networked images
</ol>
Submissions should be in form of a short position paper (2 pages) detailing
the work or ideas to be presented. Submissions should be sent by e-mail to:
savino@iei.pi.cnr.it, no later than June the 30th, 1997. The final program
for the workshop should be completed and available by July 31st. Authors of
accepted papers will be requested to send a contribution of about 5 pages to
be published in the workshop proceedings as an ERCIM Report.
<p>
The workshop will take place in San Miniato, an historical town located
about 50 kms south-west of Pisa, reachable by train or by bus. Participants
will be given precise directions on how to reach the workshop venue.
<p>

<p id="s1">The Second Empire of Napoleon&nbsp;III had been discredited
by defeat, but the Republican government which then took power
was also discredited by its failure. The Commune made
the French bourgeoisie very suspicious of radicalism. In these
circumstances the royalists predominated in the initial years
of the Third Republic, and planned to restore the monarchy.
They lost their opportunity due to failure to resolve the 
Legitimist/Orleanist split and the unrealistic and extreme
views of the Legitimist candidate for the throne.
 Subsequent Bonapartist advances
led the Orleanists to combine with the moderate Republicans
against them, and the constitution of the Third Republic
was settled in <span class="date">1875</span>. </p>

<p>The Third Republic was a compromise arrangement, a
parliamentary republic in which governments changed
frequently. There is a sense in which the various political
movements of the 19th century can be seen as "alternative
endings to the unfinished story of the French Revolution":
the Legitimists rejecting the Revolution, the Orleanists
perhaps wishing it had stopped in 1791, the Republicans
endorsing the First Republic, and the Bonapartists looking to
the legend of Napoleon. </p>

<p>The deep divisions of Left and Right had not, however, been
resolved. Sections of the Right never really accepted
the Third Republic, and in <span class="date">1940</span> they seized their chance.
It is perhaps only with Charles de Gaulle's Fifth Republic
that a stable national consensus on the regime has been reached.</p>

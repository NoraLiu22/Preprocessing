<h2>
<a name="Heading10"></a><b>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS </b></h2>
<p>There has been a vigorous debate both judicially and academically about the
correct approach to constitutional interpretation. An
aspect of that debate has
involved the role of assumptions in informing our interpretation of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. I have argued elsewhere that 'some assumptions form part of
the fabric upon which the written words of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> are superimposed ...
where the assumption is integral to a proper understanding of the structure and
text of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, it can be both used and applied in constitutional
interpretation.'<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The 'executive power of the Commonwealth' is conferred by s 61 of the
<i>Commonwealth</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 61</a> provides that 'the executive
power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the
Governor-General'. Neither
that section nor any other informs us as to what 'the
executive power' is. Nor does the structure of the <i>Commonwealth</i>
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> provide much of a hint of it.  </p>
<p>The term 'executive power' involves a constitutional or political concept. In
the absence of some internal definition of that concept
its interpretation
necessarily requires some reference to material extraneous to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> itself &#8212; what that is, and how it might be applicable
depends ultimately upon what anterior assumptions are made by the interpreter.

</p>
<p>Other commentators have pointed to the role of assumptions in understanding
federal executive power. Graeme Hill, for example, has
pointed out that the
question whether Commonwealth officers can perform State executive functions
depends upon an ancillary assumption
about the nature of the
federation.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> That ancillary
assumption will be based in part upon the text and structure of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but also upon historical and other considerations. </p>
<p>In this paper I consider the issue of whether the executive power in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a>
includes the prerogatives of the Crown and, if it does, whether the limitations
upon the prerogative are also applicable to the executive
power. This very issue
was considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in relation to the seizure
of the <i>MV Tampa</i>. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading18"></a><b>THE TAMPA </b></h2>
<p>On 29 August 2001, the <i>MV Tampa</i>, carrying 433 'boat
people'<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup> that it had rescued,
entered Australian territorial waters without permission and anchored some four
kilometres off the shore of
Christmas Island. Later that day Australian troops
were landed on the <i>MV Tampa</i> and took control over the movement of people
to and from the ship. This event raised a number of issues as to Australia's
obligations
at international law.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup>
It also raised the question of whether the action was lawful under Australian
law. A Full Court of the Federal Court, comprising
Black CJ, Beaumont and French
JJ in <i>Ruddock v Vadarlis</i>, recently considered this
question.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>The question of the validity of the seizure of the ship at Australian law
involved two subsidiary questions: </p>
<p>(1)	In the absence of any statute did the Commonwealth government have the
power to take over the ship so as to prevent the 'boat
people' from landing on
Australian soil? </p>
<p>(2)	If there was such a power, had it been abrogated or limited by statute,
in particular, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</i> 1958</a> (Cth)?  </p>
<p>Chief Justice Black assumed that any relevant power that the Commonwealth had
was limited to the prerogative at common law. He doubted
that such a prerogative
power still subsisted, but held that, even if it did, it had been abrogated by
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act 1958</a>
</i>(Cth).<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Justice Beaumont agreed with French J.  Justice French, faced with
conflicting lines of authority as to the effect of statutes on
the powers
exercised by governments,<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup>
distinguished between 'prerogative power' and 'executive power'. There were a
number of steps in his Honour's reasoning: </p>
<p>(1)	The executive power of the Commonwealth is to be discerned from the
<i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>(2)	The executive power of the Commonwealth is not to be determined by
consideration of the royal
prerogatives.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>(3)	Under s 61 of the <i>Commonwealth</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> there is a
necessary power in the executive to exclude
aliens.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>(4)	Given that this power is a necessary implication from the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, it is not subject to abrogation in the same manner as the
royal prerogative.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup> It can only
be abrogated by a 'clear [statutory]
intent'.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>(5)	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act 1958</a> </i>(Cth) does not evince such a clear
intent.<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There has been some critical analysis of his Honour's reasoning in relation
to the effect of statutes in abrogating the executive
power,<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup> but surprisingly little
comment on the essential step in his Honour's reasoning, that is, that the
executive power in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> is to be ascertained from within the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
itself and that it is not subject to the common law limitations upon the royal
prerogative. </p>
<p>This is somewhat surprising. The vast preponderance of High Court authority
is that the reference to 'executive power' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
includes the prerogative and is subject to the common law limitations upon
it.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup> In the recent case of
<i>Oates v Attorney-General
(Cth)</i><sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup><i> </i>a unanimous
High Court treated the common law prerogative relating to extradition, as it
existed pre-federation, as forming part of
the executive power. Most
commentators also take the view that the common law prerogative forms part of
the executive power.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The only citation French J gives as authority for the proposition that the
executive power is not subject to the limitations applicable
to the common law
prerogative is the comment of Gummow J, then of the Federal Court, in <i>Re
Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation</i>.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup> In determining
whether an exercise of the executive power was justiciable or not Gummow J
commented that one looks, not to the prerogative
in Britain, but  </p>
<blockquote>
rather to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, by which the executive power of the
Commonwealth was vested in the Crown. That power extends to the execution and
maintenance of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and of the laws of the Commonwealth and enables
the Crown to undertake all executive action appropriate to the spheres of
responsibility
vested in the Commonwealth.
<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>The issue in
that case was whether or not the exercise of the relevant power was justiciable,
and the comment of Gummow J may be limited
to that context.  There may also be
some support for French J in some of the comments of Gummow J in the High Court
in <i>Re Residential Tenancies Tribunal; Ex parte Defence Housing
Authority</i>,<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup> although again
the relevant comments might be directed to the somewhat different problem of the
effect of State laws upon the Commonwealth
executive. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading53"></a><b>THE POSSIBLE ASSUMPTIONS </b></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding that French J claimed that the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> was to be
ascertained within the text of the <i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> it is plain
that it cannot be. This is not an issue which can be resolved by applying some
particular rule of constitutional interpretation.
The words 'executive power of
the Commonwealth' have no sensible meaning without some anterior assumption as
to what 'executive power'
is. That assumption is not one that can be derived
from the text.  </p>
<p>There are, in fact, two possibilities.  </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading56"></a><b>THE FIRST ASSUMPTION </b><b>&#8212; THE US MODEL
</b></h2>
<p>The first is that the phrase should be interpreted in light of United States
jurisprudence. The structure of the <i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, including
the structural division of the first three chapters into 'The Parliament', 'The
Executive Government' and 'The Judicature',
is copied from and closely reflects
the similar division in the <i>United States</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. In
particular, s 61 of the <i>Commonwealth</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is similar in
terms to art 2(1) of the <i>United States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, from which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> was
derived. Article 2(1) provides that '[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a
President of the United States of America.' 
 </p>
<p>In relation to judicial power these similarities in text and structure were
sufficient to justify the use of US jurisprudence in interpreting
Chapter III of
the <i>Commonwealth</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. If a similar use could be made of
US authorities in relation to Chapter II it would provide considerable support
for the approach
of French J in <i>Ruddock v
Vadarlis.</i><sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup><i> </i></p>
<p>For example, under the <i>United States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> the executive powers
are defined from the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> itself &#8212; they are those powers
that are conferred expressly or by necessary implication on the US President. In
determining
what those powers might be, the principle of separation of powers as
understood in the <i>United States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is
applied.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup> The executive powers
and functions of the US President are those that are necessary for him to fulfil
his role of executing the laws
and checking and balancing the powers of the
legislative and judicial branches of government. The US executive powers do not,
as
such, include any prerogative powers formerly exercised by the British
Crown.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup> Indeed, one of the causes
of the American Revolution was the reaction of the colonists to the exercise of
those powers.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup> The only relevance
of common law prerogative powers to the interpretation of the <i>United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is by analogy, and there is some dispute in relation to
that.<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>If this approach were applicable to the <i>Commonwealth</i>
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> then the method of interpretation adopted by French J would
be correct. It would not be necessary to inquire into what prerogative
powers
the Crown had at common law. Rather, the issue would be what powers were
necessary for the executive to have to fulfil its
constitutional
responsibilities. In relation to that question the US Supreme Court has held
that the US executive power does include
the power to use armed personnel to
intercept aliens and prevent them landing on US
soil.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup> The effect of the US
approach has been to 'constitutionalise' executive powers, including executive
immunities.<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> This is understood
in US jurisprudence as having the consequence that such executive rights and
immunities, to the extent that they
can be abrogated by statute, will only be
abrogated if the relevant statutory provision is 'unequivocally
expressed'.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>This is the very result reached by French J. But in order to reach that
result it is necessary to make an assumption. That assumption
might be that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a>
should be interpreted in the same way as art 2(1) of the <i>United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Or it might be that the same result is reached because the
assumptions applied by the US Supreme Court in interpreting its
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> are equally applicable to s 61 of the <i>Commonwealth</i>
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. The point is that the interpretation of the provision does
not depend so much upon the text as upon the relevant assumption. </p>
<p>It would seem clear that French J made an assumption. Indeed, given that the
meaning of 'executive power' cannot be gleaned from the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
itself this was unavoidable. The assumption that his Honour made seems to have
been that the assumptions applied by the US Supreme
Court in interpreting its
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> are equally applicable to the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. At the very least his Honour seems to have interpreted <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> in
light of a conceptual separation of the three branches of government.
Consequently, much of his Honour's reasoning is, at the
very least, consistent
with US jurisprudence. For example: </p>
<blockquote>
While the Executive power may derive some of its content by reference to the
royal prerogative, it is a power conferred as part of
a negotiated federal
compact expressed in a written <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> distributing powers between the
three arms of government reflected in Chs I, II and III of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
and, as to legislative powers, between the polities that comprise the
federation. The power is subject, not only to the limitations
as to subject
matter that flow directly from the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> but also to the laws of the
Commonwealth made under it. There is no place then for any doctrine that a law
made on a particular subject
matter is presumed to displace or regulate the
operation of the Executive power in respect of that subject matter. The
operation
of the law upon the power is a matter of construction.  <br>
That construction, while governed ultimately by the terms of the statute under
consideration, is informed by a requirement for a
clear intention to displace
the power.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>The
use of US jurisprudence in this context may also obtain some support from recent
comments of the High Court.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup>
These comments draw attention to the difficulties in simply applying British
jurisprudence relating to 'the Crown' within the Australian
constitutional
structure which necessitates a conception of the Commonwealth and the States as
'organisations or institutions of
government possessing distinct
personality'.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup> However, it is
more likely that those comments merely draw attention to the tension within the
<i>Commonwealth</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> containing, as it does, the concept both
of a national monarchy and of a federal
structure.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The fundamental difficulty with simply relying on the <i>United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> in our understanding of the executive power is that the
<i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> also contains the principle of responsible
government &#8212; a principle that is not contained in the <i>United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup> In light of
that principle there is no separation of powers between the legislative and
executive branches of government &#8212;
at least in theory the executive is

legislature.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> The principle of

<h2>
<a name="Heading82"></a><b>THE SECOND ASSUMPTION &#8212; BRITISH AND COLONIAL
PRACTICE AND HISTORY </b></h2>
<p>The alternative to the approach of relying upon US jurisprudence is to
interpret the constitutional powers and role of the Commonwealth
executive in
the light of British and colonial practice and history. For example, in <i>Re
Residential Tenancies Tribunal (NSW); Ex parte Defence Housing
Authority</i><sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup> Dawson, Toohey and
Gaudron JJ held that the power conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> included 'the prerogatives of
the Crown because the setting in which the Crown is invested with executive
power is that of the common
law and the prerogatives of the Crown are those
rights, powers, privileges and immunities which it possesses at common law.'
This
approach is consistent with the principle of responsible government if only
because British and colonial practice and history are
consistent with it.  </p>
<p>The relevant constitutional background can be briefly stated. By at least the
time of the <i>Colonial Laws Validity Act</i> <i>1865</i> (UK) the basic
constitutional structure of the second British Empire had been established. The
'Imperial' or UK Parliament was sovereign.
The Monarch acted on the advice of
her UK Ministers. The Monarch was represented in the relevant colony by a
Governor who acted as
her agent and, to the extent that the Monarch acted on
advice, as agent for her UK Ministers. Save to the extent that the Governor
was
exercising a function necessarily incidental to the legislative powers of the
relevant colony,<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup> the Governor
was constrained by his instructions and by the nature of his
office.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup> Otherwise, the local
Governor acted primarily on the advice of local Ministers.  </p>
<p>So understood at federation all prerogative powers were 'Imperial prerogative
powers' (ie to be exercised by the Queen on the advice
of her UK Ministers)
unless the prerogatives had been abrogated by legislation (which could be
colonial legislation) or unless the
powers were necessary to or had been
delegated to the local Governor. In the absence of a relevant delegation the
prerogative was
not colonial 'executive power', but Imperial executive power
exercised personally by Her Majesty on the advice of her UK Ministers.
And even
if the power was delegated it could be taken back. </p>
<p>This Imperial history was known and understood by those at the Constitutional
Conventions and formed the background to their deliberations.
There is some
suggestion in the Convention debates that the 'executive power' in s 61 of the
<i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> did not include any of the powers comprised
within the prerogatives of the
Crown.<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup> However, this was because
those at the Conventions viewed those powers as being derived from the Queen and
thus assignable under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a>
provides that the Governor-General shall be Her Majesty's representative and
shall have and may exercise, 'such powers and functions
of the Queen as her
Majesty may be pleased to assign him'. This was an obvious reference to the
ordinary and usual colonial practice
by which the prerogative powers of the
relevant Governor (other than those granted expressly by statute) were expected
to be defined
by Letters Patent and then qualified by Instructions &#8212; a
practice subsequently adopted and applied in relation to the
Governor-General.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup> There is no
suggestion in the Convention debates that the common law limitations upon the
prerogative were no longer applicable to
the exercise of "executive power". </p>
<p>Whatever may have been the view as at 1900 of the source of the prerogative
powers, that understanding must now be considered in the
light of Australian
independence. In the course of the first four decades of the twentieth century
it came to be accepted that the
federal government could exercise all royal
prerogatives relevant to its powers and functions, including the appointment of
ambassadors.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup> It also came to be
accepted that the federal government, and not the UK government was responsible
for advising the Monarch in relation
to matters solely of concern to the federal
government<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup> and that the
Governor-General was responsible to his Australian Ministers and not to UK
Ministers.<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></sup> Finally, it came to
be accepted that the UK Parliament would not legislate in matters of concern to
the federal government without
the consent of the federal government. The
effective independence of the federal Australian government from the UK
government was
confirmed<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></sup> by the
<i>Statute of Westminster</i> <i>1931</i> (UK) which became applicable to the
Australian federal government in
1942.<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a></sup> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> of that Act
provided that the UK Parliament would not legislate for the Dominion except with
its consent.  </p>
<p>The result of this historical evolution was that executive powers which, in
1901 were only 'of the Commonwealth' if they were assigned
to the
Governor-General by the Imperial authorities became 'of the Commonwealth'
because they were constitutional powers of the Crown
necessarily attributable to
the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. It was a necessary consequence of
Australian independence that
'the executive power of the Commonwealth' came to
include all of the prerogatives of the Crown applicable to the
Commonwealth.<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a></sup> And, of course,
the recognised independence of the federal government meant that the Imperial
authorities could not take those powers
back. </p>
<p>Barwick CJ described the historical development in <i>New South Wales v
Commonwealth</i>:<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a></sup> </p>
<blockquote>
The progression from colony to independent nation was an inevitable progression,
clearly adumbrated by the grant of such powers as
the power with respect to
defence and external affairs. Section 61, in enabling the Governor-General as in
truth a Viceroy to exercise
the executive power of the Commonwealth, underlines
the prospect of independent nationhood which the enactment of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> provided. That prospect in due course matured, aided in that
behalf by the Balfour Declaration and the Statute of Westminster and
its
adoption. </blockquote><p>When s 61 of the <i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is
considered in light of the principle of responsible government, and in light of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2</a>, and in light of the constitutional history and context, it seems clear
enough that the assumption upon which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> is predicated is that the common law
prerogative was expected and intended to form part of the executive power of the
Commonwealth.
It would also seem to be clear that there were two classes of such
prerogative powers. First there were those that were necessary
for the
Governor-General to have for the proper government of the Commonwealth (as
understood in the Imperial
context).<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></sup> And secondly there
were the Imperial prerogative powers assigned under s 2 of the <i>Commonwealth
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup> At federation
it was usually necessary to look to the Letters Patent and the Instructions in
order to identify what prerogatives
the Governor-General could exercise, and
what not. So, for example, as at 1901 the Governor-General could exercise the
prerogative
of mercy to offenders against Commonwealth
laws,<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a></sup> but probably could not
exercise some of the prerogative powers in relation to foreign affairs. However,
as the federal government
became more and more independent, so more and more of
the prerogative powers came to be powers that were necessary for the
Governor-General
to have, in the sense that it would have been constitutionally
inappropriate for the Monarch to exercise those powers on the advice
of her UK
Ministers. Once it was necessary for the Governor-General to have them then they
could not be withdrawn under s 2 of the
<i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Since
Australia has been independent there are no assigned prerogatives save for some
minor exceptions where Her Majesty does not
act on advice (such as the grant of
some royal honours). Since that time all prerogative powers have been those
necessary for the
Governor-General to have for the proper government of the
Commonwealth. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading108"></a><b>CONCLUSION  </b></h2>
<p>If the meaning of the relevant constitutional provision was sufficiently
clear from the text of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> there would be no need or
justification for interpreting the provision in light of extraneous assumptions.
However, there are any
number of constitutional provisions which simply assume
that the reader has an understanding of what is intended and that the reader
will interpret the provision in that context. This is particularly so where the
provision contains or includes a concept, including
a political or legal
concept. Such provisions must be interpreted in light of the relevant
assumption, whatever it is. Section 61
of the <i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
is one such provision.  </p>
<p>As discussed, that provision could be interpreted on the assumption that it
be interpreted in the same manner as the similarly drafted
provision in the
<i>United States <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. If so, then the executive power would not
include the common law prerogative powers of the Crown. Although it is not clear
from
his reasoning that French J appreciated that he was interpreting <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> in
light of that assumption, it would nevertheless appear that he did. His
reasoning is certainly consistent with US jurisprudence.
However, it is clear
from the overall context that that is not an appropriate assumption for
interpreting s 61 of the <i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Rather, the provision
should be interpreted in light of British and colonial history. When so
interpreted it does include the common
law prerogatives, or at least such of
them as are applicable to the government of the Commonwealth.   </p>
<p>This highlights a basic difficulty. There is an obvious tension in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> itself between what might be described as its US aspects,
including the principles of separation of powers and federalism and what
might
be described as its British aspects, including Parliamentary sovereignty and
responsible government. The meaning of 'executive
power' within the
<i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> requires the reader to resolve that tension,
one way or another. The debate as to what 'executive power' means in this
context is
fundamentally not one about the meaning of constitutional text or
even about constitutional structure &#8212; rather it is a debate
about
fundamental assumptions.  </p>
<p>The problem this causes is that those assumptions are rarely articulated
either in submissions or in judgments. This failure to address
the fundamental
assumptions means that the basic issue of disagreement is often not fully
addressed or even identified.  </p>
<p>In my view the correct assumption in interpreting s 61 of the <i>Commonwealth
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is that the 'executive power of the Commonwealth' is to be
understood in the context of Imperial and colonial history, including
the law
relating to the common law prerogative. Of course, this history does not give
the entire and whole meaning. The text is still
determinative where it provides
some meaning or implication. For example, the executive power expressly includes
the execution and
maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth.  </p>
<p>On this approach the 'executive power of the Commonwealth' for the purposes
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would comprise: </p>
<p>(1)	Those specific powers given expressly by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> itself
(such as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 5</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">21</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">56</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">57</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">62</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">64</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">65</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">68</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">69</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">70</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">126</a>) or which are implicit
within the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> (such as the "nationhood power"),  </p>
<p>(2)	The power to 'execute and maintain the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and the laws
of the Commonwealth' given by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a>,  </p>
<p>(3)	The powers conferred by a valid Commonwealth statute,  </p>
<p>(4)	Any prerogative powers (and, probably, rights) 'related to the
Commonwealth',  </p>
<p>(5)	The necessarily incidental power. </p>
<p>As George Winterton has convincingly shown, when so interpreted the executive
power is subject to the limitations and controls of
responsible government and
the separation of judicial power, both of which are implicit within the
<i>Commonwealth
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup> It is also
subject to any statute to the contrary. So understood the 'executive power'
conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> is not 'constitutionalised' so as to be immune from
legislative or judicial restraint in accordance with the usual understandings
of
the common law.  </p>
<p>This is a different conclusion as to the meaning of 'the executive power of
the Commonwealth' from that reached by French J in <i>Ruddock v Vadarlis</i>.
The difference is the consequence of making a different assumption as to what
considerations are relevant in determining what executive
power is.  </p>
<p>Whether the different conclusion I reach as to the meaning of 'the executive
power of the Commonwealth' would result in any difference
to the orders actually
made by the majority in <i>Ruddock v Vadarlis </i>is another question for
another day. </p>

1897, 910 (Edmund Barton), cf 914 (Joseph Carruthers). It should be noted that
in the course of debate about <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> during the Adelaide Convention, Barton
commented that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> had been drafted on the basis that
provisions dealing with what were traditionally prerogative executive powers did
not refer to
the Executive Council, whilst statutory executive powers did: see
<i>Official Report of the National Australasian Convention Debates</i>,
Adelaide, 19 April 1897, 910&#8211;11, 913; John Quick and Robert Garran, <i>The
Annotated <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the Australian Commonwealth</i> (1901) 406. The
distinction can be seen between <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> (historically a prerogative power) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67</a>
(historically a statutory power). If that distinction holds true then <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> would
include prerogative powers. </p>

<p><sup><a name="fn48" href="#fnB48">[47]</a></sup> 	Winterton, above n 18, 51
treats this as a change in the common law. I would prefer to describe it as a
development of the common
law. But what did not change was the meaning of either
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sowaa1942379/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2</a> or s 61 of the <i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Of course, related to these
developments the Queen of the United Kingdom in the <i>Commonwealth
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was transformed into the Queen of Australia. However, this
probably occurred at a later time than the development of the meaning
of
'executive power of the Commonwealth' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> (maybe not until 1986).</p>

(<i>'Bonanza Creek')</i>. In particular, at 586 the Privy Council, in discussing
s 10 of the <i>Canadian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, contrast that section with s 61 of the
<i>Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> 'which, <i>subject to</i> the declaration of
the discretionary right of delegation by the Sovereign in ch 1, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2</a>, provides
that the executive power, though declared to be in the Sovereign, is yet to be
exercisable by the Governor-General' (emphasis
added). This was apparently the
view taken by most writers at the time of federation, see Evatt, above n 17,
172&#8211;5; Quick and
Garran, above n 39, 389&#8211;400. To the contrary was
Harrison Moore who viewed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2</a> as limited to legislative powers and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> as
providing for prerogative powers see Harrison Moore, 'The Commonwealth of
Australia Bill'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281900%29%2016%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%2035" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1900) 16 <i>Law Quarterly Review</i> 35</a>, 37&#8211;8, a view
apparently supported by Evatt at 186&#8211;7: see Harrison Moore, <i>Studies in
Australian Constitutional Law</i> (2nd ed, 1905) 65&#8211;6, a view supported by
Evatt: at 186&#8211;7. As Winterton shows in <i>Parliament, the Executive and
the Governor General</i>, above n 17, 52, that view cannot be correct because it
is clear that s 2 was intended to include prerogative powers. Winterton argues
that the powers under s 2 must be separate from those under s 61: see at
50&#8211;2. This may be accepted today, but not in 1901,
as <i>Bonanza Creek</i>
shows. </p>

<h2>Organic Agriculture and Human Health</h2>
<p>
There is a widespread belief that organic agriculture does not use pesticides that are toxic to
humans. This belief is incorrect.
<p>
Organic agriculture was founded on the sustainability of the earth to produce food, and
on the bond between farmers and that earth. Most food production today depends on the
continuous addition of energy-intensive fertilizers and other external materials to farm
soil to keep it productive. Organic agriculture aims at keeping farm soil and farming as
sustainable as natural forests, for time immemorial. This is a valuable and laudable aim.
<p>
Unfortunately, the organic philosophy has become perverted by the meme that
everything in nature is desirable, that everything made by people is evil. Nature is green
in tooth and claw, not just red! There are natural plant toxins that can kill a horse in a
single meal (e.g. the genus <a href="senecio.html">Senecio</a>), fungal toxins that can
kill a person with a single mouthful (especially in the genus Amanita), snakes, spiders, wasps and fish that produce lethal toxins to kill their prey or enemies...
<p>
Two nerve poisons are in particularly widespread use in organic agriculture as it is
presently practised - pyrethrins and rotenone. Both, and others such as nicotine, are just
as toxic to people as they are to pest insects. Arsenic, copper, lead and other elements are
natural too; as I write, it has been found that some organic frozen vegetables from China
contain large amounts of toxic thallium - perfectly natural and therefore organic.
<p>
Organic agriculture needs to add the sustainability of people to the sustainability of the
earth. Only substances non-toxic to humans should be used to grow human food if it is to
be truly safe. Permissible organic inputs should be based on GRAS, generally regarded
as safe, rather than 'natural' as at present.

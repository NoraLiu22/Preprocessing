<h2>Sound Cards vs. Harpsichords</h2>
<p>
The sound card people make it seem so easy - just click 'harpsichord' then 'play'. But, no one
who loves the sound of real harpsichords is fooled by the result!
<p>
Sounds are built by most sound cards in three sections:
<ol>
<li>an initial sound (the pluck) that is assumed to be brief,
<li>a linear decay of a short sound that can be repeated (looped) without hearing the loop,
then
<li>a fixed 'termination' sound (which can only be started from section 2.)
</ol><p>
But, no real harpsichord behaves this way!
<p>
The 'initial' sound is very long in good harpsichords. They have a hundred small strings
between the bridge/nut and pins, which soak up and re-radiate all sounds of the instrument.
A good harpsichord takes several seconds to 'settle down' after a note is sounded, longer than
the duration of most notes in performance. That's an important part of a quality sound.
<p>
Once a steady sound has been reached, all instruments that are activated by an inital action,
such as a harpsichord, decay exponentially, not linearly. It's basic physics.
<p>
And, the termination sound of harpsichords is mostly related to the sound that exists at the
termination - it's not fixed. The sound of the plectrum passing the strings is very different for
a recently plucked string than for a still string.
<p>
So, to recreate the sound of a real harpsichord on a sound card, you must start by deactivating
most of the stuff put there by the computer geeks.
<p>
For <a href="my.html#sf">my sound font</a>,
the only way I found that worked well enough to satisfy me was to record
a single string from pluck to inaudibility. When the sound of the string became comparable to
the noise, I applied a ramp to zero in the sample, then terminated the sample. When you 'play'
a note with my font, the sample starts; when the note ends, a linear ramp to zero of the sample
is activated. There is no true termination sound, because the sound card wouldn't let me
provide one that sounded anything like my instrument. It's true that Flemish instruments were
designed to have as little termination sound as possible. It's also true that harpsichordists
spend hour upon countless hour practising their key release technique so as to minimize
termination sound. But, zero termination sound isn't real, it's just forced by most sound cards.
<p>
For my instrument, which is very regular from bass to treble, I found that three samples
sufficed to recreate the sound adequately. (Fortunately - my 1985 card didn't have memory for more.)
Most harpsichords vary more between bass and treble, and will need more samples.
Fortunately, modern cards have enough memory that this is no longer a problem.
<p>
How do you record a sample? Begin with a microphone and tape recorder with superb
transient accuracy. I ended up using a plain ('cosine directionality') 1/2" condenser
microphone. Smaller microphones have a higher noise level, larger ones I tried had audible
transient problems. All 'directional' microphones, of whatever type, depend on phasing to
achieve directionality - the phase of a harpsichord pluck is discernable right to the limit of
human audibility, so they don't work. No 'Dolby' or equivalent system can be active in the
recorder - they all modify phase of transients too. Then, find the physical location of the
microphone that balances quality sound with sound level. In my case, I ended up with the
microphone hung vertically down approximately over middle c of the soundboard bridge, at a
height about equal to the width of the soundboard. (Several recording engineers have
confirmed this as generally the best location for harpsichords.)
<p>
Then, tune your instrument to the pitch at which it sounds its best, record one note at a time
with a perfect clean pluck, and wait until each sound dies into total inaudibility before doing
the next one. For single string sounds, record notes about a tenth apart from one end of the
compass to the other. The exact tuning of each note is not important because you will trim it
in the soundfont editor.
<p>
Digitize the samples into the sound card, adjust the points at which the card shifts from one
sample to the next so that transitions are barely audible, match them to A440, then fine-tune
the samples so their pitch matches up perfectly at the transition points. At the end of each
sample, create a loop segment of zero sound (otherwise some cards will repeat your sample
over and over during long notes). Then, add a termination ramp-to-zero function that sounds
most like the damping of your instrument.
<p>
Of course, if you listen with the ears of a musician, you will repeat this process many times,
until you regretfully admit that you have reached the limit of what can be done with current
sound cards and seriously consider throwing the whole shebang out rather than publishing it.
Don't! If it is the best you can do, publish it. There are tens of thousands of sound cards out
there for every real harpsichord. How will anyone ever know how beautiful our instrument is
unless we tell them!

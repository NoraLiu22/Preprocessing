<BLOCKQUOTE><i>The digital library, as the epistemological center of the
 university, is certainly positioned to serve as the catalyst for
 transforming the university to meet the needs of the 21st century society
 dominated by electronic technology.</i>
 <font size="-1"> (pg. 3)</font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>With that and similar statements about the power of digital libraries as
 agents of systemic change, Battin and Hawkins set the stage for a
 collective treatise on "discontinuities" and "transformations" that are
 inevitable, and inevitably necessary, for higher education. The editors'
 stage-setting is provocative, describing not only the power of digital
 libraries but also the "debilitating resistance" and the "growing
 dysfunctional paralysis" (pg. 3) of institutions incapable of reforming, or lacking
 the cohesive will to reform, their enterprises to identify and take
 advantage of technologically-driven change. Any qualms a reader may have
 about the explicit technological determinism of the editors' opening
 chapter are likely to dissipate while reading the following eighteen
 essays. This is not simply due to the reputations of the highly
 distinguished list of contributors -- which represents a large proportion of
 contemporary individual and institutional leadership for innovation in
 academic information resource management -- but also from the collective
 force of argument. Presented is a wealth of historical, cultural, anecdotal
 and statistical evidence that transformation lies at the nexus between
 digital information technologies and the most important challenges of
 higher education. </P>

<P>The book, which the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)
 published in partnership with the Association of American Universities,
 includes essays by the editors -- Hawkins is the new president of EDUCAUSE;
 Battin served as Vice President for Information Services and University
 Librarian of Columbia University -- as well as by John Seely Brown, Stanley
 Chodorow, Paul Duguid, Douglas Greenberg, Jos&eacute;-Marie Griffiths,
 Susan Hockey, Richard N. Katz, Donald Kennedy, Michael E Lesk, Paula
 Kaufman, Peter Lyman, Deanna B. Marcum, Susan Rosenblatt, Donald J. Waters,
 and Samuel R. Williamson. </P>

<P>If readers of a publication like <B><i>D-Lib</i></B> are looking for entertainment by
 provocation and the professional insights that arise from addressing
 questions about the future (Which are the most valid and telling
 assumptions about the millennial context of higher education? What
 debilitating habits and structures exist today? What catalytic powers do
 digital libraries have?) then the book completely succeeds. If, on the
 other hand, readers expect to find specific and illuminating blueprints and
 paths identifying the most promising technologies for "reconfiguring
 information resources" (as the volume's title might suggest) there will be
 some disappointment. </P>

<P>There are four loosely related sections titled "Defining the Problem,"
 "Integrating Information Resources with Institutional Mission," "Challenges
 to Implementation," and "Leadership, Staffing and Management." Any subset
 of the essays -- which are meant to be able to stand alone, thus leading to
 some unfortunate, but forgivable, redundancy -- within and across sections
 may have little or a great deal of complementarity. In fact, the two themes
 that are most thoroughly and deeply discussed in relation to digital
 libraries are scholarly communication and organizational structure for
 information resource management. In the former -- occupied by nearly half of
 the essays, notably those by Chodorow, Lyman, and Kaufman -- deeper than
 usual analysis is given of the problems and need for radical change in the
 traditional scholarly communication cycle. Digital libraries, when
 conceived, for example, as publishers or enablers of new peer review
 processes, directly contribute to that change. </P>

<P>The essays devoted to organizational structure for information resource
 management, including those by the editors and by Marcum, are particularly
 effective in moving the discussion beyond the "to merge or not to merge
 libraries and information technology departments" discourse. In all of
 these essays the digital library is seen as a likely focal point for
 creating transformational, rather than superficial, change. Richard Katz's
 "Managing Information Resources in the Future" is particularly effective in
 bridging these diverse themes while also providing concrete scenarios or
 "strategies" for that change. </P>

<P>For <B><i>D-Lib</i></B> readers there is relatively little that is likely to completely
 surprise or enlighten, especially in technology speculation or divination.
 But the volume is full of carefully constructed arguments, action
 rationales, pleas for planning, and prose nuggets that are likely to have
 an "That's what I was trying to say" effect, or to encourage an oblique,
 and therefore liberating, approach to thinking about academic professional
 contexts, especially for information technologists and resource providers.
 Consider this deft finesse -- by emphasizing process rather than substance --
 of the definitional problems inherent in "digital library" in Patricia
 Battin's chapter titled "Leadership in a Transformational Age": </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The "digital library" is an instructive example of several
 phenomena -- the clash between the new and the old, the need to explore
 beyond one's own set of ideas, assumptions, and talent pool, and the
 challenge to reconcile different points of view in the interests of the
 institutional mission. To the computer scientists at the National Science
 Foundation (NSF), who created a multi-million-dollar program to encourage
 research into the concept of "the digital library," the term signifies the
 technological infrastructure. To librarians who hope to apply for the
 grants offered by the NSF, the term implies the storage and management of
 digital information. To college and university administrators seeking to
 restrain library costs, it means cheap and easy ways to provide access to
 knowledge resources traditionally held in libraries. And to scholars in the
 humanities, it means the demise of the book as the primary information
 medium. The "digital library" is all of this -- and more. The use of the
 term itself is dangerously misleading because it imprisons us in an image
 of the past and illustrates, through its familiar connotations of turf and
 containment, either an inability or an unwillingness to accept the
 inevitability of unprecedented collaboration, shared expertise and
 responsibility, and new integrated working relationships. <FONT SIZE3D1>(pg. 276)</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Similar perceptive and useful conceptual summaries or syntheses are
 scattered throughout the volume. They cover not only digital libraries but
 also scholarly communication, higher education history and leadership,
 information technology management, and the real challenges of shepherding
 dramatic change in these interacting domains. These summaries alone are
 enough to recommend the volume. That they are embedded in well-written
 essays from leaders in the field makes it that much easier to do so.

<li><a href="#Heading95">III. Reasons for Objecting to Bills of Rights 
</a></li>
</ul>


<br>
<p>Imagine a Westminster common law jurisdiction without a
bill of rights. As things stand at present, all important social policy
decisions
in this jurisdiction, including decisions about how rights are to be
balanced against one another and against overall community welfare
claims, rest
with the elected legislature and executive. Not everyone in this jurisdiction is
happy with this arrangement, however.
There are some politicians who are not
averse to joining the world-wide trend by adopting some sort of bill of rights.
A handful
of them in fact, mostly from the main left of centre political party,
are positively keen on the idea. They see the post-Second World
War
Americanisation of constitutional law, with its emphasis on formalising the role
and place of human rights in a legal instrument
the judges oversee, as an
unambiguously good thing. They would like an entrenched, justiciable model.</p>
<p>Even more enthusiastic about adopting a bill of rights is the preponderance
of judges and legal academics in this jurisdiction. Many
of the latter have a
barely disguised disdain for elected politicians. Certainly, they tend to think
these creatures of democratic
elections less trustworthy, especially when it
comes to giving specific content to rights, than the unelected judiciary. Truth
be
told, most of the judges deep down agree. When it comes to delivering justice
and fairness and upholding fundamental human rights,
who better than they, they
think. After all, they have life tenure, independence, a proclaimed commitment
to objectivity and they
must give written reasons for their decisions.</p>
<p>Imagine further that the first goal of those who support a bill of rights is
to move their jurisdiction towards some sort of Canadian
or American-style
model&#8212;to adopt a constitutionalised, justiciable bill of rights against
which the judiciary can scrutinise
primary legislation and, if necessary, strike
that legislation down for infringing one of the broad, rather indeterminate
protections
listed therein. Alas, in this suppositious scenario there proves to
be insufficient support for such an entrenched, overriding model.
So the
fall-back position of pressing for a statutory bill of rights is taken up. This
seems less revolutionary to some opponents,
and even wins a modicum of converts.
But opponents still outnumber proponents. Hence the statutory bill of rights
itself is watered
down through a series of rather messy
compromises&#8212;perhaps the remedies section is removed and a new operative
provision is
added explicitly stating that this Act will lose out to all other
Acts, future <i>or</i> past, in the event of mutual inconsistency. The mover in
the House of this enervated compromise instrument even has to assure parliament
that 'this will be a parliamentary bill of rights; it will create no new legal
remedies for courts to grant irrespective of whether
the bill of rights is an
issue'. </p>
<p>At last, with these concessions and assurances in place, the enfeebled Bill
of Rights Act limps through parliament and becomes law.</p>
<p>Now put away your imagination. The picture painted above is not a visionary
(or even chimerical or quixotic) conjecture of how events
may play out here in
Australia. No, there is nothing imaginary at all about the events related above
for they describe what in fact
took place in New Zealand leading up to the
passage of its Bill of Rights Act a dozen years
ago.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> What I want to do next in this
article is briefly to recount what happened in New Zealand subsequent to the
passage of this seemingly
enervated Bill of Rights Act. Then, I want to focus on
a few of the leading cases to date to see what is involved when judges give
specific content to broad, indeterminate rights guarantees. Finally, I will
conclude with a brief summary of the main grounds I have
for objecting to bills
of rights and for hoping that Australia sets its face against the worldwide
trend towards their adoption.</p>
<p>In effect, this article amounts to a cautionary tale. It invokes the New
Zealand experience with a statutory Bill of Rights to warn
Australians against
the current temptation to join with their common law cousins in adopting such an
instrument. What this article
does <i>not</i> do however, is to focus directly
on the issue of why a statutory model fails to answer the criticisms of critics
of constitutional
rights. That issue is put to one side, not because it is
unimportant, but rather because I have attempted to deal with it
elsewhere.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> Here, I deal with the
related, ancillary issue of how the rights disputes arising out of that
statutory Bill of Rights are best characterised.
In particular, my claim will be
that the New Zealand experience of over a dozen years shows that no
cases&#8212;not a single one&#8212;have
been decided there that vindicate the
common rationales given by proponents of bills of rights, namely that judges can
and will protect
us from widespread moral weakness, or that they can and will
protect vulnerable minorities from the tyranny of the majority.</p>
<p>If that claim be correct, if I be right about this ancillary issue, defenders
of any sort of bills of rights&#8212;statutory models
included&#8212;are in a
much more difficult position. To put them there is the limited goal of this
article.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading16"></a><b>I.	JUDICIAL INFLATION OF THE STATUTORY BILL OF RIGHTS
IN NEW ZEALAND</b></h2>
<p>Almost immediately after passage it became clear that the s 6 operative
provision (which roughly seems to amount to an instruction
to 'do what you
can&#8212;with a straight face&#8212;to interpret this other statute as
consistent with the rights in this Bill of
Rights'<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup>) would be emphasised over
the operative provision that had been inserted especially to get the Act passed
and which became s 4 (in
essence commanding that 'all other inconsistent
statutes override the rights in this Bill of
Rights'<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup>). In the first ever Bill of
Rights Act case to reach the Court of
Appeal,<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup> the then President,
speaking for the Court, suggested in <i>obiter</i> that s 6 may require a court
to depart from a long established judicial interpretation of the meaning and
intent of a particular
statutory
provision.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> There followed a steady
stream of <i>dicta</i> to the effect that the enervated Act actually enacted
should, contrary to the clear legislative history, be treated as some sort
of
extra-special, quasi-constitutional Bill of
Rights.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite the specially added qualification at its start to help
ensure the Bill's passage ('Subject to section 4 of this
Bill of Rights'), even
the third main operative provision&#8212;the s 5 abridging
inquiry<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup>&#8212;was given
pre-eminence over s 4. In fact, in a 1992 case the then President of the Court
of Appeal announced that '[i]t is
worth emphasising too that in principle an
abridging inquiry under s 5 will properly involve consideration of <i>all
economic, administrative and social
implications</i>.'<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> And this,
remember, in a Bill of Rights Act where any abridging inquiry is ultimately
otiose because if any statutory limit does
happen to be found unreasonable or
unjustified it nonetheless prevails over the Bill of Rights Act because of s 4!
Still, the judges
would keep open the option of an abridging inquiry regardless,
as they made clear eight years later in the case of
<i>Moonen</i>:<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
In determining whether an abrogation or limitation of a right or freedom can be
justified in terms of s. 5, it is desirable first
to identify the objective
which the legislature was endeavouring to achieve by the provision in question.
The importance and significance
of that objective must then be assessed ... Of
necessity value judgments will be involved. In this case it is the value to
society
of freedom of expression, against the value society places on protecting
children and young persons from exploitation for sexual
purposes ... Ultimately,
whether the limitation in issue can or cannot be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society
<i>is a matter of judgment which the Court is
obliged to make on behalf of the society which it serves and after considering
all the
issues which may have a bearing on the individual case, whether they be
social, legal, moral, economic, administrative, ethical or
otherwise</i>.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Wow,
seems the only appropriate response. Here is the s 5 operative provision&#8212;
an amended, so as to be subject to s 4, carry-over
from the earlier thoroughly
rejected, constitutionalised Bill of Rights model&#8212;being made the basis for
judges to make all these
sweeping value judgments 'on behalf of the society
which they serve'. And for what ultimate purpose? In that same <i>Moonen</i>
case the judges tell us:</p>
<blockquote>
That purpose necessarily involves the Court having the power, and on occasions
the duty, to indicate that although a statutory provision
must be enforced
according to its proper meaning, it is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, in
that it constitutes an unreasonable
limitation on the relevant right or freedom
which cannot be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Such
judicial
indication will be of value should the matter come to be examined by
the Human Rights Committee ... New Zealand society as a whole
can rightly expect
that on appropriate occasions the Courts will indicate whether a particular
legislative provision is or is not
justified
thereunder.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
other words, out of nowhere, a full decade after the Bill of Rights Act came
into force, and with only the flimsiest, most implausible
statutory basis for
doing so at all (namely, s 5), the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <i>Moonen</i>
announced that, henceforth, when some statute is found to be inconsistent with
the Bill of Rights Act, although the courts will be
bound by s 4, they may also
make a declaration of inconsistency.</p>
<p>At least as remarkable as the <i>Moonen</i> <i>Case</i>, however, was the
1994 <i>Baigent's Case</i>.<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup>
There, in a 4&#8211;1 decision of the Court of Appeal, the judges simply read
back into the Bill of Rights Act the remedies provision
that parliament had
specifically removed (and had removed as the price of getting the Bill enacted).
In doing so, the judges ignored
everything in their way, in particular the
<i>Crown Proceedings Act</i> 1950 which precluded all known Crown liability at
the time, and simply created an <i>ad hoc</i> public law remedy sounding in the
Bill of Rights Act (going on to indicate this remedy was distinct from the
common law tort of breach
of statutory duty). In effect, the New Zealand Court
of Appeal, in the name of giving life and force to fundamental human rights,
'discovered' that the Bill of Rights Act subjected the Crown to potentially
unlimited liability for its
breach.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Need I say more to make the point that judges, at any rate New Zealand
judges, can travel a remarkable distance in the name of 'keep[ing]
pace with
civilisation',<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup> not least because
they see 'basic human rights ... [as] inherent in and essential to the structure
of society ... [and as] <i>not</i> depend[ing] on the legal or constitutional
form in which they are
declared'?<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup> I will assume not. At
any rate, suffice it here to say that the history of New Zealand's seemingly
enervated, statutory bill of rights
amounts to this: in fewer than a dozen years
the judges there have transformed the Bill of Rights Act into an instrument that
allows
them to do not that much less than their Canadian judicial brethren who
operate an entrenched, overriding, fully justiciable model.
New Zealand now has
the possibility of declarations of inconsistency; judges there can indulge in
potentially sweeping abridging
inquiries (with the Brandeis Brief-type reliance
on contestable social science which such inquiries necessitate); those same
judges
have simply created a <i>sui generis 'Baigent</i> Bill of Rights Act
cause of action' subjecting the Crown to potentially unlimited liability for its
breach; they have refashioned
the common law to take account of the Bill of
Rights Act.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup> Astonishingly,
judges on their highest domestic court are prepared to say that because of the
Bill of Rights Act, it is no longer
the case that later statutes impliedly
prevail over earlier, inconsistent
statutes.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup> To an extent
unimagined before the Bill of Rights Act's passage, New Zealand now has the
regular exercise of political value judgments
by unelected judges.</p>
<p>That is all I intend to say in this article about the inflationary effect of
the Bill of Rights Act in New Zealand. In essence, the
interpretive techniques
under s 6, where judges read down or read into other statutes, have become the
not too distant functional
equivalent of a United States or Canadian-style
invalidating or striking down of primary legislation. Added to this use of s 6
is
the judiciary's power, which they simply gave to themselves, to issue
declarations of inconsistency. While this latter power has
not been used
frequently, it nevertheless serves to raise the stakes. The judges in effect
allege (inaccurately) that the legislature
is breaching rights. This is much
more difficult to respond to in practice than the accurate claim that the
judges' view of what
a right requires differs from the legislature's view of
what that right requires.<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>But enough of that summary. In the next section I would like to change focus
to consider what sort of issues and value judgments were
at stake in the leading
bill of rights cases in New Zealand. How debateable&#8212;debateable in terms of
rights, that is&#8212;were
the outcomes favoured by the judges? Was there a
clear answer dictated by rights a rights 'right answer' as it were? Are these
cases
more aptly characterised as i) judges protecting us from ourselves in a
moment of widespread moral weakness; ii) judges protecting
a vulnerable minority
from the tyranny of the majority; or iii) unelected judges taking sides (and
having a massively disproportionate
say) on highly debateable social policy
issues where both sides to the dispute are sincere and reasonable? This
question, and one's
answer to it, is likely to have no small influence on
whether one approves of bills of rights. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading46"></a><b>II.	HOW TO CHARACTERISE WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN JUDGES
DECIDE BILL OF RIGHTS CASES</b></h2>
<p>Under a Bill of Rights judges must give specific content to broad,
indeterminate rights guarantees. Of course, on the plane of vague
generalities
these emotive guarantees inspire widespread (at times almost universal)
agreement. Virtually all of us may hold our
hands up high when asked if we are
in favour of freedom of expression. We nod in agreement that society should
ensure the right to
life, the freedom of religion, no undue delay before trying
an accused, and no unreasonable police searches. Here, on this plane,
there is
little contention and disagreement. Likewise, it is here that most of the
selling of bills of rights is done, namely, under
the guise of upholding and
protecting universally desired and uncontentious rights. It is almost as though
these instruments, with
their judicial overseers, will be there to stop the
elected organs of government from indulging in obviously wicked acts.</p>
<p>Of course, it may be that this sort of apocalyptic scenario is little more
than a myth. It may be that when the broad and imprecise
standards enunciated in
a bill of rights are applied to specific situations, any notion of consensus or
near universal agreement
quickly dissolves, and widespread dissensus is in fact
the reality. Similarly, in saying that '[a] Bill of Rights, drawn in
open-textured
terms, necessarily requires individual human rights to be defined
with a content specific to the case in
hand',<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup> it may be that the judges
will end up deciding controversial questions of social policy over which
sincere, intelligent, well-meaning
people disagree&#8212;questions about where
to draw the line when it comes to free speech, privacy, who can marry, police
powers,
abortion, religious practices, how refugee claimants are to be treated,
and much else. In other words, it may well be that giving
'a content specific to
the case in hand'<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup> means that
bills of rights are overwhelmingly about delivering from elected politicians to
unelected judges power to decide highly
contestable, debateable, social policy
issues. The frequently painted picture of judges holding fast to obviously
correct moral standards
(embodied in the language of rights) against the
attempted backsliding of grubby politicians solely concerned with where their
next
vote is coming from, therefore, may prove to be a remarkably inapt
description of what actually happens under a bill of rights.</p>
<p>In the rest of this section I want to tackle this question of how best to
characterise what is happening when judges decide bill of
rights cases by
considering the leading New Zealand cases.</p>
<p>Let us start with what is probably the most significant New Zealand Bill of
Rights Act case to date, <i>Baigent's
Case</i>.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup> This was the case
where the judges created a new <i>sui generis</i> cause of action, a public law
remedy sounding in the Bill of Rights Act, subjecting the Crown to potentially
unlimited liability
for its breach. In doing this the judges overcame two
obstacles. Firstly, not only did the Bill of Rights Act lack any provision
for
remedies for infringement, the remedies clause that had been in an earlier draft
version had had to be removed, seemingly to
ensure the Bill's passage. Secondly,
there was a statutory immunity provision which seemed to apply and, if so, would
trigger s 4
('all other inconsistent statutes override the rights in this
Bill of Rights') and so prevail. Needless to say, both obstacles were
overcome
by the judges.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup> At the very least
this was a clear example of judicial
activism.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Our question, though, is what was at stake to give rise to all this judicial
creativity. Stripped to the bone, it was this: should
the police be held liable
(by reason of the Bill of Rights Act's s 21 right to be secure against
unreasonable search and seizure)
where they, in good faith but erroneously,
search the wrong house? Keep that query in mind as I <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> the
facts and elaborate on the main issue.</p>
<p>The <i>Baigent</i> appeal occurred at an interlocutory stage and the question
before the Court of Appeal was whether the pleadings disclosed any cause
of
action. The relevant pleaded facts were these: A police officer seeking a drug
offender obtained information (from a source that
had been reliable in the past)
that the suspect lived at 16 Main Road. On checking, the officer found there was
no such address but
that the likely address was one of two permutations. The
officer made a mistake and sought and obtained a warrant for the wrong
alternative.
(The suspect in fact lived at the other of the two alternatives.)
The pleadings then allege that, in executing the search, the officer
was told he
had the wrong house. Indeed, it was alleged that during the search the
plaintiff's son called his sister, a barrister,
and she told the officer he had
the wrong address. Most damningly, the officer was alleged to have replied to
the sister '[W]e often
get it wrong, but while we're here we will look around
anyway'.</p>
<p>I include that alleged quote just because it is so damning. But notice
something straight off. Five causes of action were pleaded,
four in tort and one
in the Bill of Rights Act. If, when the action eventually reached trial, this
damning statement by the officer
could have been proved, the plaintiffs had a
perfectly orthodox tort action open to them. The search, continuing after the
officer
knew he had the wrong house, would have been conducted in bad faith and
the statutory immunity would not have applied. </p>
<p>But, by creating this new <i>ad hoc</i> Bill of Rights Act cause of action,
the judges broadened liability to instances where the damning alleged reply to
the sister could
not be proven. Liability under this new Bill of Rights Act
cause of action did not require the search to have been conducted in bad
faith
as the tort actions did. Instead, it only required that the search be
unreasonable under s 21.</p>
<p>So what the judges effectively decided in <i>Baigent</i> is that (a statutory
immunity notwithstanding) the police would henceforth be liable for a good
faith, lawful search provided it
was also unreasonable. In other words, the
judges used the Bill of Rights Act to extend police (and vicariously Crown)
liability
beyond mere bad faith searches to those that are also good faith but
unreasonable.</p>
<p>Is that an uncontentious, obviously good outcome? Is it a decision that needs
to be taken out of the hands of the legislature? Does
the understanding of all
right thinking people demand that liability be imposed for lawful, good faith
police searches that are unreasonable?
My guess (backed up by yearly student
polls) is that many people in society would be prepared, probably for the sake
of a more effective
police force, to take the risk of suffering the
inconvenience of such good faith, but erroneous and unreasonable, searches
(remembering
that no one would have to suffer a bad faith search). More to the
point here though, the sort of judge-made liability that emerged
in
<i>Baigent</i> hardly seems open to being characterised as uncontentiously
appropriate, obviously a good thing, transcendentally needed or anything
remotely similar. Making the Crown (and so taxpayers) liable for good faith but
unreasonable searches (to say nothing of simply announcing
liability for
breaches of the Bill of Rights Act generally) is a highly debateable outcome. It
is a question of public policy on
which sensible, well-intentioned people could
(and do) take opposite sides. In fact I, for one, fail to see why unelected
judges
should have a special, privileged say on such an issue. Therefore, in
terms of the three classifying options I offered at the end
of section one, this
case seems clearly to fall under iii).</p>
<p>The <i>Moonen</i> <i>Case<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup></i>
is another leading New Zealand Bill of Rights Act case, and one&#8212; I have
suggested above&#8212; in which the Court of Appeal
justices were verging on the
audacious in the manner in which they inflated the status and potency of the
Bill of Rights Act. The
case involved the classification by the Film and
Literature Review Board of certain publications as 'objectionable' in terms of s
3 of the <i>Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act</i> 1993. At issue
was a book and various photographs belonging to Mr Moonen. The book was
described by the Board as containing stories
outlining sexual activity between
men and boys under the age of 16. The relevant photographs were of naked
children, mostly boys.
Section 3 of the Act set out the meaning of
'objectionable'. In particular, s 3(2)(a) reads: 'A publication shall be
deemed to be
objectionable for the purposes of this Act if the publication
promotes or supports, or tends to promote or support, the exploitation
of
children, or young persons, or both, for sexual purposes'.</p>
<p>Moonen appealed the classification to the New Zealand High Court on the basis
of error of law. His appeal was dismissed. He then appealed
to the Court of
Appeal, which allowed his appeal and sent the matter back to the
Board.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup> The judgment of the
five-justice court rested on the claimed impact of the Bill of Rights Act (in
particular ss 13 and 14 dealing
with freedom of thought and expression) on
the correct interpretation and application of the <i>Films, Videos and
Publications Classification Act</i> 1993, in particular s 3 of that
Act.</p>
<p>Leave aside the implausibility of judges using this case to give themselves
the authority to issue declarations of
inconsistency,<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> and ask yourself
whether my characterisation iii)&#8212;unelected judges taking sides (by telling
the Board to reconsider) on a highly
debateable social policy issue where
reasonable and sincere people can disagree&#8212;is again the most apt. Even
after calm deliberation,
all but the most rabid libertarians would want some
limitations on paedophiliac pornography, so i) seems inapt. Nor does the
<i>Moonen</i> <i>Case</i> seem in any way analogous to one in which, say, a
group of fellow citizens is being shipped to detention centres because of their
race.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup> So ii) is also
inapposite.</p>
<p>Here again it is not immediately obvious, to me at least, why we (and the
Board) would want guidance from unelected judges when it
comes to decisions
about what is and is not objectionable, about who should and should not be able
to publish sexually explicit photos
of men and boys, on the basis of little more
than the emotionally stirring quality of the phrase 'everyone has the right to
freedom
of expression'.</p>
<p><i>Quilter<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup></i> is another
case worth considering. There the issue was gay marriage and s 19 'freedom
from discrimination' the right in play. Three
of the five Court of Appeal
justices took the view that the prohibition on same-sex marriages in the
<i>Marriage Act</i> <i>1955</i> (NZ) did not infringe the s 19
discrimination provision. (For two of these three this was an <i>obiter
</i>holding.) The other two, both in <i>obiter</i>, held the prohibition did
discriminate against the appellant lesbian couples, though one of these two left
open the question whether
it is justifiable discrimination. All five justices
agreed however, that the <i>Marriage Act</i> <i>1955</i> was intended to confine
marriages to those between a man and a woman, and that whatever s 19 of the
Bill of Rights Act might imply
about discrimination for lesbian couples wanting
to marry but being unable to do so, s 4 ('all other inconsistent statutes
over-ride
the rights in this Bill of Rights') dictated that the <i>Marriage
Act</i> <i>1955</i> must prevail.</p>
<p>The point for us is <i>not</i> that this is one of the very, very few cases
in New Zealand where the judges have actually used s 4 to say, in effect,
that this
sort of social policy-making is for
Parliament.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup> Nor is the point the
cynical one, namely that there was no explicit prohibition of same-sex marriage
in the <i>Marriage Act</i> <i>1955</i> and so&#8212; compared to cases such as
<i>Baigent</i> and others where the judges managed to ignore or interpret away
blatantly clear statutory inconsistencies&#8212;room enough here
for otherwise
rarely deferential judges to find in favour of the lesbian couples. No, the
point is again that gay marriage is a highly
contentious issue over which
reasonable, sincere, even nice, people disagree. Is it really beyond the Pale to
think such an issue
should be decided democratically, by 'letting the numbers
count' as Jeremy Waldron would say? Do we really need first to be told
as much
(grudgingly, and very infrequently) by the unelected judges themselves?</p>
<p>We could go on and on. Instead, let us consider the only New Zealand Bill of
Rights Act case of which I am aware that comes anywhere
close to falling under
the rubric of characterisations i) or ii). This is the <i>Pora</i>
<i>Case</i>.<sup><i><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></i></sup> The facts
there are as good as it gets for believers in strong judicial review and
powerful bills of rights. If you cannot make a
case for delivering the final say
from elected politicians to unelected judges there, you are unlikely ever to
succeed.</p>
<p>The gist of <i>Pora</i> revolves around a form of retrospective legislation.
A 1999 Act amended an earlier 1985 Act so that one sort of murder, murder
involving
'home invasion', had to result in a minimum term of imprisonment of at
least 13 years.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup> That 1985 Act
had been amended in 1993 to provide for a minimum term of 10 years for murder.
Pora was first convicted of a murder
committed in 1992. This conviction came in
1994 but was set aside in 1999 and a new trial ordered. At the re-trial, Pora
was again
convicted. He was sentenced in 2000, after the 1999 Act had come into
force. By this stage, Pora was arguably subject to a harsher
minimum non-parole
period than he would have been at the time of the offence, thereby potentially
breaching s 25(g) of the New Zealand
Bill of Rights
Act.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>If the 1999 Act were held to apply, then the question was whether this sort
of retrospectivity applied back to 1993 (when the 1985
Act had been amended), or
applied back indefinitely. The only other possibility was a refusal to apply
s 2(4) of the 1999 Act, in
effect to say that because of the Bill of Rights
Act the provisions of the earlier 1985 Act defeat the inconsistent provisions of
the 1999 Act. </p>
<p>As I noted above,<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> the
justices split 3&#8211;3 on whether the doctrine of implied repeal is now,
because of the Bill of Rights Act, outmoded. As the
three justices who stood up
for orthodoxy had found that retrospectivity carried back only to 1993, the
deciding justice was able
to agree that the 1999 amendment did not apply before
1993 (thereby leaving Pora unaffected) without having to take a stance on the
revolutionary view that an earlier statute can prevail against a later,
inconsistent statute.</p>
<p>At this point it may be worth reminding readers that New Zealand's Bill of
Rights Act is not entrenched or constitutionalised, and
that the sovereignty of
Parliament is supposed still to be alive in New Zealand. All obfuscation aside,
had the revolutionary view
prevailed, that would now be debateable:</p>
<blockquote>
[W]hen there is stark conflict [between an earlier provision and later
provision], as there is in this case, the doctrine of implied
repeal between
provisions enacted at different times, is not a mechanical rule [as the three
revolutionary justices asserted], but
a consequence of the sovereignty of
Parliament.<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Leave
to one side the merits of any such revolutionary view however, and look at what
was at stake in <i>Pora</i>. In fact, let us put the case as strongly as
possible for bill of rights advocates. In <i>Pora,</i> the elected legislature
had passed a law increasing, by three years, the minimum non-parole period for a
certain type of murder.
And these same elected legislators had determined that
that increased non-parole period would apply retrospectively to murders
committed
before the new law came into force. On these facts, the most
favourable to the case for a bill of rights that we can find after nearly
a
dozen years of the Bill of Rights Act being in force, do we want unelected
judges over-ruling the elected legislators? Is there
a clearly 'right answer'
here, one so clear that democratic decision-making needs second-guessing? (I
ignore the much harder question
for bills of rights enthusiasts of whether, if
this is the best they can point to after twelve years, it is worth giving judges
a
say on all the myriad other cases just so they can have a say here.)</p>
<p>I suspect some will say yes. For them, retrospective legislation can never be
justified. I disagree. There are two grounds for my
disagreement. Start with the
narrower point first. What the legislature did here was to change the non-parole
period for an offence
<i>that was already an offence</i>. The legislature did
not retrospectively make criminal conduct that, at the time, had been perfectly
legal. Murder, unsurprisingly,
was illegal even in 1992. So what was happening
in <i>Pora</i> was that parole conditions were being changed with retrospective
effect. This is important to get clear because I suspect that many
who would
object virtually automatically to criminalising conduct retrospectively would be
much less averse to altering parole conditions
during the term of
incarceration.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup> And the
<i>Pora</i> scenario falls much closer to that latter end of the spectrum than
to the archetypical retrospective-criminalisation-of-hitherto-legal-conduct
end
of the spectrum. Add to that the fact that a thirteen year non-parole period for
murder is still very much on the low side in
international terms and you have my
first ground for asserting that even the <i>Pora</i> <i>Case</i> is best
characterised as iii), as an issue of social policy-making on which reasonable
people can differ and not one we need unelected
judges to decide for us. </p>
<p>As it happens I also have a wider ground for coming to that same conclusion.
Let us go back to the basic issue of retrospective legislation
and consider, in
the abstract, whether such legislation can ever be justified. Frankly, I think
it can. Here, I am much of HLA Hart's
mind.<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup> Retrospective laws are an
evil that have to be weighed against the evil sought to be remedied. So, for
example, I too think&#8212;like
Hart&#8212;that that was what was happening
after World War II when the top Nazis were tried, convicted and executed. The
Allies,
in effect, simply passed retrospective laws, dressed up in natural law
clothes. In addition, I suspect most of us today, in undertaking
any balancing
exercise, would agree that the evils perpetrated by the top Nazis outweighed any
evil attached to the passing of retrospective
laws enabling their prosecution. A
broadly similar analysis would apply to the prosecution of East German border
guards after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, though there the weighing of evils may
well, in my view, point against
prosecution.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup> The point is that I
believe retrospective laws, even the archetypical sort that make illegal
backwards in time what had been perfectly
within the law as it then stood, even
this most extreme sort of retrospective law-making, can be justified in some
situations.</p>
<p>In <i>Pora</i>, of course, nothing remotely similar to the extreme sort of
retrospectivity was involved. But let us ask, nonetheless, what the balancing
exercise would involve. We would have to ask how the evil of this law, which
after the fact added three years to a minimum sentence
for murder, compared to
the evil of home invasion murders. Or, more accurately, we would have to ask
whether, in balancing the two
competing evils, the retrospective minimum
non-parole change is so obviously wicked that we need judges to protect us from
our elected
representatives' proclivity to pass such a law. Is i) the best
characterisation of what the justices were doing in <i>Pora</i>? (I think it
safe to rule out ii)<b> </b>on the grounds that murderers convicted after a fair
trial, whose sentences would still remain on the low end of any international
comparison, hardly fit easily into what is generally understood by 'a vulnerable
minority'.) Or is it, even here, iii)? Is this,
yet again, just another example
of a highly debateable social policy issue over which reasonable people can and
do disagree and over
which unelected judges have no obvious advantages in terms
of greater moral perspicacity, intuition or insight?</p>
<p>I do not doubt that many, perhaps most, lawyers, judges and legal academics
think the rights enunciated in a bill of rights are too
precious to be left to
'the tyranny of the majority', even if that means such rights are simply
transferred over to a different set
of overseers who, as it happens, also reach
their decisions about them purely procedurally by
voting.<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup> But whether one thinks
this or not, one must concede that the effects of a bill of rights are felt not
up in the Olympian heights
of rights guarantees which are so broad,
indeterminate and emotionally appealing that nearly all can support them, but
rather down
in the quagmire of detail. Down there, where these rights have to be
given a content specific to the case in hand, there is always
disagreement,
debate and dispute about how they should play out. Nor can those who disagree
with one's own views about how rights
should rank against one another, who is to
possess them, and whether and when they should lose out to broader social
interests be
easily dismissed as unreasonable, morally blind, uninformed, evil,
in need of re-education, or some such other comfortable categorisation
that
eliminates the need to take one's opponents' views seriously. </p>
<p>It is na&iuml;ve (at least in a democracy) to expect to be on the winning
side of every argument, even arguments about rights. The
same point is true of
bills of rights, at least if one agrees with me that they throw up debateable
case after debateable case. In
New Zealand, after a dozen years in force,
supporters of the Bill of Rights Act can point to no more than one case, and
that too
is debateable, that seems remotely like the sort of scenarios on which
such instruments are sold to the public. I would say the same
is true in Canada
and, in all likelihood, the US too. That realisation, perhaps, might just affect
whether one approves of bills
of rights, with their transfer of immense power
from elected politicians to unelected judges.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading95"></a><b>III.	REASONS FOR OBJECTING TO BILLS OF
RIGHTS</b></h2>
<p>For a sustained, powerful critique of strong judicial review under bills of
rights one could not do better than to read the works
of Jeremy
Waldron.<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> Here, however, I shall
be very brief and simply set out a summary of those arguments against the
adoption (or retention) of bills
of rights that I find most persuasive. Some
degree of overlap can be expected.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bills of rights diminish democracy. Few today believe that how rights should
play out, including how they should rank against one
another and who is to
possess them and when, is self-evident. So, put in place a bill of rights and
what the judges end up deciding
are controversial questions of social policy
over which sincere, intelligent, well-meaning people disagree.</li>
<li>Bills of rights transfer too much power to unelected judges.</li>
<li>Resolving disagreement about rights (or indeed about morality generally) is
in no way analogous to resolving disputes about what is
happening in the
external causal world, the world of science if you like. In the latter there is
an imposed, external reality, however
much it may be filtered and interpreted by
humans. In the former, there simply is nothing remotely equivalent. Therefore,
rights
'right answers' must be understood quite differently from right answers
in the world of medicine, aviation or engineering. The implications
for bills of
rights are obvious.</li>
<li>Bills of rights undercut citizens' participation in decision-making. As most
supporters of rights these days reject utilitarianism
and support rights on
non-consequentialist bases, they would put this point in terms of the
undermining of a right to participate,
tying that right to the notion of humans
as autonomous, self-governing beings. However, under a bill of rights, the
overwhelming
majority of the population is disenfranchised (in favour of a
select few judges) on a significant number of major social policy questions,
indeed on basic rights questions. At the very least it is highly ironic if the
only defence such non-utilitarian rights advocates
can give for the diminishing
of the right to participate is a thoroughly utilitarian justification
(<i>viz</i>, the unelected judges get the 'right' answer more frequently than
the elected branches of government).</li>
<li>In fact, judges do <i>not</i> deliver noticeably better rights
outcomes.</li>
<li>The Sirens analogy defence of bills of rights fails. Adopting a bill of
rights and handing over the policing of such rights to an
unelected elite is
<i>not</i> analogous to having yourself strapped to a mast now because you know
you will be weak&#8212;dangerously weak&#8212;later.</li>
<li>Arguments in favour of bills of rights that disparage the deciding of rights
cases and rights outcomes by means of a purely procedural
system, such as the
counting of legislators' votes, miss the fact that bills of rights also
establish a purely procedural dispute
resolution system, <i>not</i> a
substantive, 'best answer wins' system. In the event of disagreement under a
bill of rights regime, the judges vote and 4 votes
beat 3, full stop. As Waldron
notes, without a bill of rights the rule would be 6 million electors beat 5
million or 80 legislators
beat 70.</li>
<li>Bills of rights bring with them the danger of an excessively politicised
judiciary.</li>
<li>Bills of rights are usually accompanied by interpretive techniques which do
<i>not</i> constrain judges to deciding in accord with the original intent of
the enactors nor to the original understanding at the time of
passage. Instead,
such instruments are often interpreted as 'living trees', where judges pay heed
to what <i>they think</i> are 'contemporary values'. 'Ancestor worship' is the
name given to such forsworn originalism constraints, and it is derided. The
result is an interpretive regime that places few, if any, constraints on the
judiciary.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup></li>
<li>Attempts to find refuge in non-entrenched, statutory models, or in over-ride
clauses, fail. At least they fail if one is a consequentialist
defender of
rights themselves.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup> There is
little evidence that I have seen to show that either of these devices do
anything much to curb the power of unelected judges.
Relatedly, the metaphor of
a 'dialogue' to describe the power relations between the elected Parliament and
the unelected judiciary
in Canada seems manifestly inaccurate.</li></ol><p>These
arguments against the adoption of a bill of rights take on extra force in a
country such as Australia with a long, and comparatively
excellent, democratic
history. The notion of democracy is no doubt protean. A cursory glance around
the globe reveals the myriad
different combinations possible when selecting from
a menu of republicanism or constitutional monarchy, bicameralism or
unicameralism,
federal or unitary structure, written or unwritten constitution
(and the methods for altering the former), presidential or parliamentary
executive, flexible or inflexible dates for elections, and of course the host of
different voting systems on offer. However, for
those who think that the essence
of democracy is self-government by the people, then Australia is one of the most
democratic countries
in the world. From its preferential voting system for lower
house elections, to its differently constituted, genuine House of Review
second
chamber, to its forcing recourse to referenda (and so to all the electors) in
order to change the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, to its compulsory voting requirement,
Australia is a remarkably democratic country. And this matters because, if I be
persuasive
in my arguments thus far, then the last refuge for supporters of a
bill of rights is one that concentrates on institutional design
flaws&#8212;crudely put, something along the lines that however bad throwing
one's lot in with the judges may be, the status quo
is worse. In Australia's
case (unlike, say, Hong Kong's) I believe that argument fails
too.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that the fact Australia is now the only country in the
western world without some kind of bill of rights&#8212;be
it a constitutional
or statutory model, series of Basic Laws, or incorporation in justiciable form
of the European Convention on
Human Rights&#8212;is nothing to be ashamed of.
Indeed, I hope Australia continues to set its face against the world-wide trend
of
the last half-century in favour of such instruments. Were Australia to opt
for a bill of rights, the judges would certainly end up
deciding controversial
questions of social policy over which sincere, intelligent, well-meaning people
disagree. The judges, in other
words, would end up drawing many of the lines
currently drawn by elected politicians. None of those lines would be about
stopping
politicians and the rest of us from indulging in obviously wicked acts.
Simply put, the adoption of a bill of rights would diminish
Australian
democracy.</p>

2 NZLR 37.</a> In <i>Pora</i>, three of the seven Court of Appeal judges took this
rather revolutionary view. Three others disagreed, and the seventh judge and
President of the Court, deciding the case on other grounds, remarkably, left
open the possibility the revolutionary view might prevail.
For an excellent
analysis of the implications of the three rather revolutionary judgments, an
analysis that comes to the conclusion
that these three judges' views undermine
the rule of law, see Jim Evans, 'Questioning the Dogmas of Realism'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20New%20Zealand%20Law%20Review%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001]

<p><sup><a name="fn25" href="#fnB25">[24]</a></sup> 	Professor Michael Taggart,
friendlier than I to bills of rights, describes the case as follows:
'<i>Baigent's Case</i> gives some indication of the potential potency of the
technique known as 'reading down' (and its travelling companion 'reading in').
My colleague, Paul Rishworth, has championed the use of these techniques in the
context of the [Bill of Rights Act] from the beginning.
In essence, his argument
is that in respect of statutes which affirm fundamental rights the courts are
justified in departing from
even clear words by reading the statute down (or
reading words in) so as not to infringe rights as long as by so doing the
legislative
purpose is not frustrated. This well-supported thesis opens up
considerable scope for attaining rights-respecting outcomes by the
judiciary.'

the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990'

<p><sup><a name="fn26" href="#fnB26">[25]</a></sup> 	Above n 10.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn27" href="#fnB27">[26]</a></sup> 	The Board ultimately came
to the same conclusion as it had originally.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn28" href="#fnB28">[27]</a></sup> 	The five justices said that
the purpose of s 5 of the Bill of Rights Act 'necessarily involves the Court
having the power, and on
occasions the duty, to indicate that although a
statutory provision must be enforced according to its proper meaning, it is
inconsistent
with the Bill of Rights ...'. Not only is this incredibly
far-fetched in terms of interpreting s 5 (a sort of
finding-the-purpose-that-best-allows-you-to-reach-the-outcome-you-want
exercise), it is simply untrue in its last assertion. The Courts will <i>not</i>
be indicating inconsistency with the Bill of Rights Act. In fact, what courts
will be doing is indicating that some statutory provision
is inconsistent
<i>with their view</i> (i.e., the judges' view) of what the Bill of Rights Act
covers or of what is a reasonable or unreasonable limitation on some right.
However, it is simply fallacious to <i>assume</i> that judges' views are a
better indication of truth (about what a Bill of Rights does or does not
require) than are the views of
elected legislators. This point is made by
Jeffrey Goldsworthy, 'Legislation, Interpretation and Judicial Review'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%2051%20University%20of%20Toronto%20Law%20Journal%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 51

Bills of Rights and the Role of Courts and Legislatures' in Grant Huscroft and 
Paul Rishworth (eds),
<i>Litigating Rights: Perspectives from Domestic and
International Law</i> (2002) 3. In the New Zealand context the assumption is
doubly fallacious, given that the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act is&#8212;or
was
passed on the basis that it was meant to be&#8212;a parliamentary bill of
rights, one that reserves the power to the legislature
to determine the meaning
of rights in the event of a dispute with the courts.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn29" href="#fnB29">[28]</a></sup> 	In my opinion, in any
imaginable scenario in which elected legislators would contemplate the sort of
things most of us today (when
times are good and there is no external threat)
would consider wicked, the judges too would contemplate the same measures. Cf.
the
plight of Japanese Americans in World War II.

<p><sup><a name="fn31" href="#fnB31">[30]</a></sup> 	As it happened, within a
couple of years a new government had been elected that passed legislation
putting all <i>de facto</i> couples in the same position as married couples,
save for the 'symbolism' of being married. </p>
<p><sup><a name="fn32" href="#fnB32">[31]</a></sup> 	Above n 18.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn33" href="#fnB33">[32]</a></sup> 	Section 2(4) of the 1999
Act reads: 'Section 80 of the principal Act (as amended by this section) applies
in respect of the making
of any order under that section on or after the date of
commencement of this section, even if the offence concerned was committed
before
that date'.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn34" href="#fnB34">[33]</a></sup> 	Section 25(g) reads:
'Everyone who is charged with an offence has, in relation to the determination
of the charge, the following
minimum rights: The right, if convicted of an
offence in respect of which the penalty has been varied between the commission
of the
offence and sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser penalty'. See too
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn35" href="#fnB35">[34]</a></sup> 	See above n 18.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn36" href="#fnB36">[35]</a></sup> 	Evans, above n 18, 169.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn37" href="#fnB37">[36]</a></sup> 	Lon Fuller would appear to
fall into this category. '[I]t is generally more important that a man have a
clear warning of his legal
duties than that he should know precisely what
unpleasantness will attend a breach; a retroactive statute creating a new crime
is
thoroughly objectionable, a similar statute lengthening the term of
imprisonment for an existing crime is less so' in <i>The Morality of Law</i>
(revised ed, 1969) 93. A special thanks to the referee of this journal for this
citation.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn38" href="#fnB38">[37]</a></sup> 	See HLA Hart, <i>The
Concept of Law</i>, (2<sup>nd</sup> ed, 1994) ch 9. See also, Jeffrey
Goldsworthy, 'Legislative Sovereignty and the Rule of Law' in Tomkins, Ewing and
Campbell, above
n 2, 67ff, for a powerful defence of the claim that
'[l]egislation that changes the law retrospectively can often be justified,
sometimes
by the rule of law itself'. Ibid, 67.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn39" href="#fnB39">[38]</a></sup> 	Indeed, anyone tempted to
condemn <i>all </i>retrospective law-making in some blanket fashion must either
also condemn all international war crimes prosecutions (until very recently,
at
least) or make a case for there having been laws in existence at the time
outlawing the misdeeds. The latter seems to me to be
a very difficult task
indeed, requiring the full battery of natural law assumptions that many find
highly implausible. </p>
<p><sup><a name="fn40" href="#fnB40">[39]</a></sup> 	Jeremy Waldron makes this
point in various places. See, for one instance, Jeremy Waldron, 'Freeman's
Defense of Review'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%2013%20Law%20and%20Philosophy%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 13 <i>Law and Philosophy</i> 27.</a> See too Section III
below.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn41" href="#fnB41">[40]</a></sup> 	In particular, start with
Waldron's <i>Law and Disagreement</i> (1999). Note however, that Waldron has not
(to the best of my knowledge) considered the cases of override clauses or of
statutory
bills of rights. On the former, see Jeff Goldsworthy, 'Judicial
Review, Legislative Override, and Democracy' in Tom Campbell, Jeffrey
Goldsworthy and Adrienne Stone (eds), <i>Protecting Human Rights: Instruments
and Institutions </i>(2002 forthcoming) and the Concluding Remarks of my
<i>Sympathy and Antipathy</i>, above n 2. Goldsworthy is more ambivalent
about override clauses than I am. But the point is that claim '10' below (see
text accompanying
n 42) does not rest on arguments made directly or indirectly
by Waldron.</p>

the case against some sort of institutional design argument, in my chapter

favour of judges also fails in the US context see Mark Tushnet,

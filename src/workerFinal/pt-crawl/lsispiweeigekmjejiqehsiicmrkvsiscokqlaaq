<h3>The Sense Chart</h3>

<p>Grades K-2</p>

<p>This is a good project to start young children toward learning about 
their senses.  Draw or make a chart with a picture of an eye, ear, nose, tongue 
and hand.  Write down words or hold up pictures that "go" with each of the 
senses that are represented by the eye (vision), ear (audition), nose 
(olfaction), tongue (gustation) and hand (tactile sense).  For example 
under the:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eye:  light bulb, sun, flashlight</li>
<li>Ear:  piano, music</li>
<li>Nose: garbage, skunk</li>
<li>Tongue:  ice cream, apple, hamburger</li>
<li>Hand:  glove, pencil, book</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, most of these items could go under a few of the categories,
but that is part of the project.  Our senses work together to tell us
about the outside world.</p>

<p><img src="mat2.gif" alt="mat" class="fl" />Materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blackboard and chalk OR a poster chart</li>
<li>A list of words or pictures to be placed under the appropriate 
catagories.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Food Party</h3>

<p>For grades K-6</p>

<p>It is not often that you get to EAT your experiment, but here is your
chance. If possible, bake a cake or a batch of cookies within smelling
distance of the class.  Popping popcorn is also a good idea.  Have 
all the students describe the sounds, taste, smell, feel, sight of the 
food.  Make a list of everything that was experienced by each of the 
senses.  Of course eat the treats too and describe the texture of the 
food.</p> 

<p><img src="mat2.gif" alt="mat" class="fl" />Materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>Food (cake mix, cookie mix, popcorn)</li>
<li>Cooking appliance</li>
<li>Bowls or plates to serve food</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Sensory Stations</h3>

<p>Grades K-3</p>

<p>Explore the 5 senses in different "stations" around the classroom.  
Set up tables with hands-on materials for kids to touch, smell, taste,
hear and see.  Some possible station items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hearing:  bells, drums, whistles, rice-filled containers, spoons to 
tap.</li>
<li>Touch:  sandpaper, playdough, clay, ice, finger paint</li>
<li>Vision:  microscope, magnifying glass, colored water, prism</li>
<li>Olfaction: vanilla, perfume, chocolate, spices</li>
<li>Taste:  jellybeans, cookies, crackers, fruit slices, salty chips, 
dill pickles</li></ul> 

<hr />

<h3>Sensory Concentration Game</h3>

<p>Grades K-12</p>

<p><a href="./java/sencon.html"><img src="./java/scon1.gif" width="58"
height="58" class="fl" alt="ja" /></a> Test your memory with this on-line
concentration game by locating the pictures of different sense organs
(ear, eye, nose, skin, tongue). The game requires that your browser is
"JAVA-enabled." </p>

<h3>Sensory Sensory Pile On Game</h3>

<p>Grades 3-12</p>

<p>Play "Sensory Pile On" by grouping words into touch, smell, taste,
hearing and seeing piles. </p>

<p><img src="mat2.gif" alt="mat" class="fl" />Materials:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="envelop.html">Sensory Pile On Worksheet</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Mystery Objects</h3>

<p>Grades 3-12</p>

<p>Put several objects inside of a box or can and close it.  Pass the 
box around to each person who must draw a picture of what he or she thinks 
is inside.  People can shake the box to listen to sounds and estimate its 
weight.  Perhaps the smell of the object provides a clue to its identity.  
The only rule is that people cannot look inside the box.</p>

<p>After everyone has a turn, open the box see what was inside.  Compare 
drawings and discuss how people made their decisions.</p>

<p><img src="mat2.gif" alt="mat" class="fl" />Materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>Box or can</li>
<li>Mystery objects:  Examples include an apple, tennis ball, small 
stuffed animal, rice, coins<li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Find an Experiment!</h3>

<p>Grades 3-12</p>

<p>Goal:  To learn something new and interesting about one of the five
senses through an experiment of your choice.</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose a sense that you would like to learn more about:  Sight,
Hearing, Taste, Touch, Smell</li>

<li>Search the website: <a href="chsense.html">
http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chsense.html</a></li>

<li>Find an experiment that you could do during the next class period that
will help you to learn about the sense that you chose. </li>
</ul>

<p>Guidelines for experiment:  </p>
<ul><li>Location:  The activity must be able to be performed in the
classroom</li>
<li>Materials:  These should be found in the class or brought from 
home</li>
<li>Time:  The activity must be done within one class period</li>
<li>Be ready to share the experiment with classmates</li>
<li>Have fun!</li></ul>

<p>Turn In: Write a summary on a separate sheet of paper that includes the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Name and date</li>
<li>Sense that you chose</li>
<li>Description of activity</li>
<li>If the teacher requests: Question, Hypothesis, Results, Conclusion</li>
<li>A paragraph (3-5 sentences) which describes  what you learned and what
you could do to find out more.</li>
</ul>

<p>("Find an Experiment" was developed by Randy Lehnen, middle school 
science teacher)</p>

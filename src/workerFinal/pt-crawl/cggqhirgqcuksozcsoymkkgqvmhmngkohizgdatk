<h2>Polarization</h2>

<p>Polarization is a phenomenon peculiar to transverse waves.&nbsp; Longitudinal waves 
such as sound cannot be polarized.&nbsp; Light and other electromagnetic waves are 
transverse waves made up of mutually perpendicular, fluctuating electric and 
magnetic fields.&nbsp; In the diagram below an EM wave is propagating in the 
x-direction, the electric field oscillates in the xy-plane, and the magnetic 
field oscillates in the xz-plane.&nbsp; A line traces out the electric field vector as 
the wave propagates.</p>

</div>

<p>An unpolarized electromagnetic wave traveling in the x-direction is a 
superposition of many waves.&nbsp; For each of these waves the electric field vector 
is perpendicular to the x-axis, but the angle it makes with the y-axis is 
different for different waves.&nbsp; For unpolarized light traveling in the 
x-direction E<sub>y</sub> and E<sub>z</sub> are randomly varying on a timescale 
that is much shorter than that needed for observation.</p>

Unpolarized light: Natural light is, in general, unpolarized.

<p>For a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave traveling in 
the x-direction, the angle the electric field makes with the y-axis is unique. 
</p>
<p><img class="rightfloat" alt="polarizer transmission axis" src="images/img3A.jpg">An ideal polarizer is a material that passes only EM waves for which the electric 
field vector is parallel to its transmission axis.&nbsp; The electric field is a 
vector and can be written in terms of the components parallel and perpendicular 
to the polarizer's transmission axis.&nbsp; <b><br>
E</b> = <b>E</b><sub>parallel</sub> 
+ <b>E</b><sub>perpendicular</sub>.&nbsp; <br>
An ideal polarizer passes <b>E</b><sub>parallel</sub> 
and absorbs <b>E</b><sub>perpendicular</sub>.<br><br>If 
<b>E</b><sub>0</sub> is the incident 
field vector and the angle between <b>E</b><sub>0</sub> and the transmission 
axis is &#952;, then the magnitude of transmitted field 
vector is E<sub>0 </sub>cos&#952; and its direction is the 
direction of the transmission axis.&nbsp; The intensity I of an electromagnetic wave 
is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric field vector.&nbsp; We 
therefore have<br><br>I<sub>transmitted </sub>= I<sub>0 </sub>cos<sup>2</sup>&#952;.<br>
<br>This is called the <strong>law of Malus</strong>.&nbsp; If &#952; = 90<sup>o</sup> the transmitted intensity is zero.</p>

The lines indicate the direction of the transmission axis.</div>
<p>When unpolarized 
light passes through a polarizer, the intensity is reduced by a factor of &frac12;.&nbsp; 
The average of cos<sup>2</sup>&#952;, averages over all angles &#952; is &frac12;.<br>
I<sub>transmitted </sub>= I<sub>0</sub>&lt;cos<sup>2</sup>&#952;&gt;<sub>all angles</sub> = 
&frac12;I<sub>0</sub>.</p>


<h4>Problem:</h4>
<p>	
<img class="rightfloat" src="images/po3p.jpg" alt="three polarizers">A beam of unpolarized light of intensity I<sub>0</sub> passes 
through a series of ideal polarizing filters with their transmission 
axis turned to various angles, as shown in the figure.<br>
(a)&nbsp; What is the light intensity (in terms of I<sub>0</sub>) in 
regions A, B, and C?<br>
(b)&nbsp; If we remove the middle filter, what will be the light intensity at 
point C?</p>
<p>	
Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasoning:<br>
When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, the 
intensity is reduced by a factor of &frac12;.&nbsp; The transmitted light 
is polarized along the axis of the polarizer.<br>When polarized light of intensity I<sub>0</sub> is incident on a 
polarizer, the transmitted intensity is given by I = I<sub>0</sub>cos<sup>2</sup>&#952;, 
where &#952; is the angle between the polarization direction of the incident 
light and the axis of the filter. The transmitted light is polarized along 
the axis of the polarizer.</li>
<li>Details of the calculation:<br>
In this problem we have 3 polarizing filters.&nbsp;
For the second polarizer &#952; = 30<sup>o</sup> between the polarization 
direction of the light incident of the filter and the axis of the filter.&nbsp; For the 
third polarizer &#952; = 90<sup>o</sup> - 30<sup>o</sup> = 60<sup>o</sup> 
between the polarization direction of the light incident of the filter and 
the axis of the filter. <br>We then have that:<br>(a) In region A the intensity is I<sub>0</sub>/2 and the light is 
polarized along the vertical direction.<br>In region B the 
intensity is (I<sub>0</sub>/2)cos<sup>2</sup>30<sup>o</sup>, = 0.375 
I<sub>0</sub>, and the light is polarized along the axis of the 
second polarizer.<br>in region C the intensity is (0.375 I<sub>0</sub>)cos<sup>2</sup>60<sup>o</sup> 
= 0.0938 I<sub>0</sub> and the light is horizontally polarized.<br>(b) If we remove the middle filter, for the last filter we now have 
that &#952; = 90<sup>o</sup>.&nbsp; Thus I = 0. <br>It is important to 
visualize the fact that adding the middle filter increases the 
transmitted intensity!<br>This "paradoxical" effect is a 
signature of wave phenomena in general.</li>
</ul>

<p>	
There are different polarization mechanisms.&nbsp;	
The most common method of 
producing polarized light is to use polaroid material, made from chains of 
organic molecules, which are anisotropic in shape.&nbsp; Light transmitted is 
linearly polarized perpendicular to the direction of the chains.&nbsp; The 
transmission axis is perpendicular to the chains.</p>

<p>A polarizer produces linearly polarized light.&nbsp; It is often convenient 
to orient the transmission axis of a polarizer vertically or horizontally to 
produce light with vertical or horizontal linear polarization.</p>

<h3>Polarization by reflection:</h3>
	
<p>	
<img class="rightfloat" src="images/polari5.gif" alt="polarization by reflection">When unpolarized light is incident on a boundary 
between two dielectric surfaces, for example on an air-water boundary, then the 
reflected and transmitted components are partially polarized.&nbsp; The 
reflected wave is 100% linearly polarized when the incident angle is equal to an 
angle called the
<strong>Brewster angle</strong>.&nbsp; <br>
For water this angle is is ~53<sup>o</sup> with respect to 
the normal or 37<sup>o</sup> with respect to the water surface.<br>
For are 
considerable angular range around the Brewster angle the reflected light is 
highly polarized in the horizontal direction.</p>


<p style="clear:both">
<img class="rightfloat" src="images/polari8.gif" alt="polarized sunglasses">When 
the sun is at a low angle in the sky, the sunlight reflecting off the surface of 
water is nearly 100% horizontally polarized because the angle of incidence is 
close to the Brewster angle.<strong><br>
Glare-reducing 
sunglasses</strong> are coated with a polarizer with a vertical transmission axis and 
therefore block the reflected light.</p>

<h3 style="clear: both">Demonstrations</h3>
<p style="clear: both">The way light is transmitted through some materials 
depends on its polarization.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><img  class="rightfloat" alt="image" src="images/polari5a.gif">Certain <strong>birefringent crystalline substances</strong> bend light trough an 
angle that depends upon the state of incident polarization.&nbsp; The have an optic 
axis.&nbsp; Unpolarized light entering a birefringent crystal not along the 
optic axis of the crystal is split into beams which are bend by different 
amounts.</p>

Double refraction in a calcite crystal.&nbsp; The vertical lines are imaged twice.<br>

polarization of the light producing the other image.
</div>

<p style="clear: both">Some materials turn birefringent when stressed.&nbsp; By placing transparent 
materials between two polarizers, we can perform <strong>stress analysis tests</strong>.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><img class = "center" alt = "stressed glass"  src="images/polari3.jpg"></p>
<p style="clear: both"><strong>Optically active or circular birefringent materials</strong> rotate the direction of polarization of 
linearly polarized light.&nbsp; The amount of rotation depends on the 
wavelength of the light.&nbsp; Sugar molecules have a handedness (chirality) 
and in solution are optically active.&nbsp; If we polarize white light and 
pass it through sugar syrup, the direction of polarization of the light 
emerging from the syrup will be different for the different color 
components.&nbsp; If the light then passes through a second polarizer, its 
color changes with the orientation of the transmission axis of this 
polarizer.</p>

Taylor is on his seventh team in 13 years, so he’s played with different offenses and against all types of defenses. Between the two of them, they have played in 323 NFL games and more than 14,000 snaps.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTravis plans to be a sponge around them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I observe a lot,” he said. “I watch every little thing that they do.

Game 2 surely will have to be Tuesday (since the Knicks play Monday and Wednesday) though the NHL was waiting until after the conclusion of Game 7 between Boston and Toronto Saturday night before announcing the rest of the series schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe series is a battle of heavyweights. The Rangers won a league-high 55 games in the regular season and finished first overall, with 114 points. Carolina chased them all season in the race for the Metropolitan Division and ultimately finished second in the division and third overall.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe teams know each other very well, with both\u0026nbsp;returning most of their rosters from their ’playoff matchup two years ago, and with Rangers center Vincent Trocheck having played for Carolina in that last playoff series.

He pronounced himself good to go for Game 1. The same can’t be said for Carolina defenseman Brett Pesce, who didn’t make the trip to New York for Games 1 and 2. Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who has filled in for Pesce, got banged up in the Hurricanes’ series against the Islanders, but Brind’Amour said he is good to go. The Rangers’ K’Andre Miller took a puck to the face in practice Saturday, but Laviolette said he is OK.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFamiliar foes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese teams have played each other so much over the last few years —\u0026nbsp;seven regular season games the last two seasons, plus that seven-game classic in the playoffs two years ago —\u0026nbsp;there aren’t any secrets. The Hurricanes like to take a lot of shots, but everybody knows that. The Hurricanes play a man-to-man defensive system in the defensive zone, but everybody knows that, too, and the Rangers were working on attacking that in practice Thursday. And if there’s anything the Rangers don’t know about the ‘Canes, they can ask Trocheck for insight.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMixing and matching up\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBrind’Amour likes to play the matchup game, and two years ago, he matched his checking line, centered by Jordan Staal, against the Rangers’ top line, centered by Mika Zibanejad, in the games in Carolina, and that proved effective, where the Hurricanes had the last line change. The Rangers have home ice advantage in this series, and so they’ll get the last line change in four of the seven\u0026nbsp;games if the series goes that long. Rangers coach Peter Laviolette likes to use a checking line at times, too, but he’s got four defensively capable centers in Zibanejad, Trocheck, Alex Wennberg and Barclay Goodrow, so he can more easily match any of his lines against any of Brind’Amour’s lines.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNet positive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith Igor Shesterkin as their goaltender, the Rangers are usually going to have the advantage in net against almost any opponent they face, but Frederik Andersen was fabulous down the stretch for Carolina as they chased the Rangers in the battle for the Metropolitan Division title. Andersen was great in the first round against the Islanders, though Shesterkin had slightly better numbers against Washington (a 1.75 goals-against average and .931 save percentage) than did Andersen against the Isles (2.25, .912).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial sauce\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Hurricanes had the best penalty kill by percentage in the regular season and the second-best power play, while the Rangers’ power play and penalty kill were both third-best overall. “I think we've proven what we can do [on special teams],’’ Laviolette said Saturday. “I think that they've proven what they can do. And here we are.’’ In the playoffs, the Rangers are tied for fourth-best in the power play (37.5%), and Carolina is sixth (33.3%).

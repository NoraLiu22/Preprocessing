/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        <i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: A paper read at the 
          13 June 1853 meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, and published
         in its <u>Journal</u> later the same year. Included here is a scan of
         the <u>My Life</u> (S729) reprint (Vol. 1, opposite p. 320) of 
         the historically significant fold-out map that accompanied the original
         publication; as near as I can tell this is the exact same map that was
         printed in 1853. I have scanned it at a  high resolution, so on
         magnification  the smallest lettering should be visible. Original
         pagination indicated within double brackets. To link directly to this

        <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 212]]</font> The Rio Negro, 
          or &quot;Black River,&quot; is one of the largest northern tributaries of the 
          Amazon. It enters that river at about 800 miles from the ocean, while 
          near its source it communicates, by means of the Cassiquiare, with the 
          Orinoko. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most striking characteristic of the Rio Negro 
          is that from which it derives its name--its black waters. And this is 
          no imaginative or fanciful appellation; forasmuch as the waters of the 
          ocean are blue, so are those of this river jet black. The sudden change 
          from the pale-yellowish olive of the Amazon is most striking, and must 
          have immediately suggested its name to its <font color="990000">[[p. 
          213]]</font> first European discoverers. The water, when examined in 
          a glass vessel, is seen to be very slightly tinged with a clear coffee 
          brown; and where it runs over white sand, at the depth of a few feet, 
          it appears of a rich golden brown colour. In deep water it is, in every 
          variety of light, <i>jet black</i>. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The colour varies in intensity in different parts 
          of its course. In the lower part there is a slight olive tint, caused 
          by a mixture of sediment; higher up in the rocky district it is much 
          purer and more transparent, and towards its sources above the falls, 
          and in its smaller branches, the water attains its maximum of purity 
          and colour. The tributary streams vary much in this particular. All 
          on its southern side, above those which communicate with the Solim&otilde;es, 
          are black, the great river Uaup&eacute;s alone being of a rather paler 
          colour, though it, too, is a black-water river. On the N. side, also, 
          there are some black-water streams, though the greater number are white. 
          The small streams below the Rio Branco are black. That river, however, 
          is white to a remarkable degree, its waters being actually milky in 
          appearance. Above it, the Darah&aacute; and some other small streams 
          are black, while the Padauar&iacute;, Maravih&aacute;, and Cababur&iacute;s 
          are white-water rivers, though none of them so much so as the Rio Branco, 
          or even as the Amazons. Other small streams flowing between them have 
          black water.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These various-coloured waters may, we believe, readily 
          be accounted for by the nature of the country the stream flows through. 
          The fact that the most purely black-water rivers flow through districts 
          of dense forest, and have granite beds, seems to show that it is the 
          percolation of the water through decaying vegetable matter which gives 
          it its peculiar colour. Should the stream, however, flow through any 
          extent of alluvial country, or through any districts where it can gather 
          much light-coloured sedimentary matter, it will change its aspect, and 
          we shall have the phenomenon of alternating white and black water rivers. 
          The Rio Branco and most of its tributaries rise in an open, rocky country, 
          and the water there is pure and uncoloured; it must, therefore, be in 
          the lower part of its course that it obtains the sediment that gives 
          it so remarkably light a colour; and it is worthy of note, that all 
          the other white-water tributaries of the Rio Negro run parallel to the 
          Rio Branco, and, therefore, probably obtain their sediment from a continuation 
          of the same deposits; only as they flow entirely through a forest district 
          producing brown water, the result is not such a strikingly light tint 
          as in the case of that river.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Is&aacute;nna, X&iacute;e, and Guani&aacute; 
          or Upper Rio Negro, which all have remarkably black waters, we know 
          flow entirely through a dense forest and granitic district, and none 
          of them extend much beyond the parallel of 72&deg; W. of Greenwich. 
        The Guaviare and

        (to enlarge, right-click and choose 'view image')</p>  
        <p><font color="990000">[[p. 214]]</font> the Japur&aacute;, 
          which rise considerably W. of this line, have white waters; and the 
          Uaup&eacute;s, which also rises near them, and much further W. than
          all the other tributaries of the Rio Negro, has also paler waters,
          and in its upper course nearly white. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ascending the Rio Negro, at about 10 miles from 
          its mouth, we reach the city of Manao, or Barra do Rio Negro, the capital 
          of the new province of Amazonas. At 40 miles the river divides into 
          two branches, and from this point to the mouth of the Rio Branco, at 
          about 200 miles up, the N. bank is never to be seen from the S. side, 
          up which all the traffic takes place. The river is here more like an 
          immense lake or labyrinth of islands, and is 15 or perhaps 20 miles 
          wide. For about 70 miles below the village of Ayr&atilde;o there are 
          high banks of clay and sandstone; below and above this are tracts of 
          low, flooded lands, and between Ayr&atilde;o and the next village, Pedreiro, 
          are two channels which communicate with the Solim&otilde;es, or Upper 
          Amazon.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below Ayr&atilde;o commences a hard sandstone rock; 
          about Pedreiro it becomes highly crystalline, and a little further, 
          opposite the Rio Branco, it changes into a true granitic rock, which, 
          however, immediately ceases, and does not again appear until we arrive 
          at the commencement of the great granitic district of the Upper Rio 
          Negro. Immediately on passing the Rio Branco, islands again appear, 
          and the opposite bank is not visible for 240 miles further, when in 
          about 64&deg; 20' W. the river is clear, and its width, determined by 
          triangulation from a measured base, is 4 1/4 miles. In this space we 
          have passed the towns of Carvoeiro, Barc&eacute;llos, Cabuqu&eacute;no, 
          and Bararu&aacute;, which are all of them small, half-ruined, and almost 
          uninhabited villages. About Carvoeiro is a labyrinth of lakes and islands 
          in which even experienced pilots are sometimes lost. From the river 
          Q&uacute;iuin&iacute; to Xibar&uacute; are high banks of clays and earth 
          of various colours, with occasional inlets, lakes, and tracts of flooded 
          lands.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the islands, as well as the low parts of the 
          river banks, are flooded annually for several months--generally from 
          April to August or September, the rise of the river being from 30 to 
          50 feet.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 64&deg; 25' W. long., the granitic formation 
          commences, and extends without interruption up to the sources of the 
          river and of all its tributaries. From this point there is less flooded 
          land on the banks, and some islands are always above water. Islands 
          still continue in great abundance up to Castanheiro. From thence to 
          the cataracts of St. Gabriel they are more rocky, and smaller. The river 
          averages 3 or 4 miles wide, and up towards the falls one mile.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little below Castanheiro begin the isolated granite 
          peaks, which are thence plentiful all up the river. The Serra de Jacam&iacute; 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 215]]</font> is the first of any size--a group 
          of isolated, conical, granite hills, 500 or 600 feet high. About 20 
          miles below S. Gabriel are the Serras de Curicuriar&iacute;, which must 
          be nearly 3000 feet high, and are the most lofty in the whole district, 
          though the Serras de Cababur&iacute;s, near the sources of the river 
          Cababur&iacute;s are perhaps nearly equal to them. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cataracts of the Rio Negro extend in length 
          about 20 miles, and are a series of rapids, where the river flows among 
          islands and vast masses of granite rock, forming falls, eddies, and 
          whirlpools, which greatly obstruct navigation. They may be descended 
          in a few hours with a skilful pilot, but a laden canoe often takes a 
          week to ascend them, and at some seasons more; and then with great peril 
          both to life and property.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the falls the river keeps an average width 
          of about 3/4 mile to S. Carlos, the first town in the Republic of Venezuela. 
          Above the Cassiquiare the Rio Negro takes the name of the Guaini&aacute;, 
          and gets narrower and more shallow, varying from 1/4 to &frac12; a mile 
          wide up to Mar&oacute;a, the last village on the river. Above this it 
          winds about, turning to the W., and has its sources certainly to the 
          eastward of the meridian of 71&deg; W. longitude, and probably near 
          that of 70&deg;.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Uaup&eacute;s is the largest tributary of the 
          Rio Negro above the falls, and is perhaps larger than the Rio Negro 
          itself; and by some is supposed to be the principal stream. We ascend 
          it for about 130 miles in smooth water, when we come to the first group 
          of cataracts, just above the village of St. Jeronymo. There are three 
          falls, and they are much more furious and dangerous than those of the 
          Rio Negro, the river being confined in a very narrow channel, and in 
          the wet season rushing down with incredible fury. Up to this point the 
          Uaup&eacute;s is generally more than a mile wide. Above these falls 
          we have about 50 miles more of smooth water, when with the next fall 
          begins a series of cataracts extending for 180 miles further up the 
          river. They are placed in four principal groups, and there are 50 of 
          them which have native names. Some of these are mere rapids, others 
          foaming cataracts, and others again real falls of 10 or 15 feet perpendicular 
          height. Above these, the river is quite unknown. One more great fall, 
          the Jurupari Caxoeira, exists, at least 100 miles further up; and above 
          this again traders have ascended for 12 or 15 days, and report a great 
          river with little current, with whiter water, and with trees, birds, 
          and fishes, which assimilate it to the Upper Amazon.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mean temperature of the water of the Rio Negro 
          in its lower part, in the month of September, was, at 6 A.M., 85&deg; 
          4' <i>[85.4?--Ed.]</i>; at 2 P.M., 86&deg; 5'; and at 6 P.M., 86&deg; 
          4'; giving very nearly 86&deg; as the mean temperature for the month, 
          which is one of the hottest in the year. The mean temperature of the 
          air for the same period <font color="990000">[[p. 216]]</font> was, 
          at 6 A.M., 76&deg;; and at 2 P.M., 92&deg; 5'. It is probable that at 
          no time would the temperature of the water in the lower part of the 
          Rio Negro be less than 80&deg;. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rise of country in the valley of the Rio Negro 
          is remarkably slight. Humboldt gives the height of St. Carlos as 812 
          feet above the sea; but I have reason to believe it is much less.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observations of the boiling point of water made 
          at the mouth of the Rio Negro, and at different points up to near St. 
          Carlos, gave me a rise of about 300 feet. The height of the mouth of 
          the Rio Negro cannot be more than 200 feet, and probably not more than 
          150, judging from the height of Tabatinga, 1000 miles higher up the 
          river, given by Martins as 620 feet; and from the fact of the influence 
          of the tides being felt at Obydos, more than half-way from the ocean 
          to the mouth of the Rio Negro.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should, therefore, have 400 to 500 feet for the 
          height of St. Carlos, which I cannot but think is not far from the truth. 
          It is to be observed that Humboldt mentions <i>air</i> having got into 
          his barometer-tube, which rendered refilling necessary, and of course 
          destroyed the trustworthiness of the instrument.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a remarkable fact, that the pressure of the 
          atmosphere at the mouth of the Rio Negro, as observed by the boiling-point 
          of water, and by an aneroid, in the possession of my friend Mr. Spruce, 
          was greater than at Par&aacute; at the level of the sea, giving a negative 
          result for the altitude. It, therefore, seems probable that there is 
          a difference of atmospheric pressure in the interior of South America 
          independent of altitude.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having unfortunately broken my thermometers, I had 
          no means of ascertaining the height I reached on the Uaup&eacute;s; 
          but from an estimate of the depth of the falls, I do not think my farthest 
          point could be more than 1000 feet above the sea-level.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole of the country through which the Rio Negro 
          and Uaup&eacute;s flow is one unbroken forest, which also extends over 
          every one of the countless islands which are found in every part of 
          its course. The numerous villages, whose names are marked on our maps, 
          are little groups of mud-walled, palm-thatched cottages; and it seldom 
          happens that more than two or three in a village are inhabited, the 
          Indians preferring to reside in houses secluded in the forest, up the 
          various narrow streams that everywhere abound. The articles of export 
          of the country are chiefly salsaparilha and piass&aacute;ba. The latter 
          is the material used to make the brooms now used for sweeping our streets, 
          and is the produce of a palm found only on some of the tributaries of 
          the Rio Negro.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inhabitants of the banks of the main stream 
          of the river are semi-civilized, and are nominal Christians; but most 
          of the tributary streams, and especially the Uaup&eacute;s, are inhabited 
          by various tribes of uncivilized and unchristianized Indians.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 217]]</font> The map which 
          I have constructed of the Rio Negro and the Uaup&eacute;s is from observations 
          made during two ascents and descents of those rivers in the years 1850, 
          1851, and 1852. The only instruments I possessed were a prismatic compass, 
          a pocket sextant, and a watch. With the former I took bearings of every 
          point and island visible on my voyage, with sketches, embodying all 
          the information I could obtain from the persons, well acquainted with 
          the river, who accompanied me; and I constantly determined the variation 
          of the needle, which was from 4 3/4&deg; to 5&deg; E. With the sextant 
          I was enabled to obtain a few latitudes with tolerable accuracy. The 
          position of Barra on the Rio Negro I have taken from Lieut. Smith, who 
          determined it on his descent of the Amazon in the year 1835. The other 
          extreme point, S. Carlos and the mouth of the Cassiquiare, I have taken 
          from Humboldt and Schomburgk. For my positions between these points 
          I have had to trust to the time occupied in the passage to the various 
          stations, which I always accurately noted both in my ascents and descents, 
          and thus obtained a <i>mean</i> which I think will not be very far from 
          the truth. I also thus gained experience as to the rate of travelling 
          in canoes under different circumstances, which I have had to depend 
          upon in determining my distances on the Uaup&eacute;s, where I had no 
          other method of ascertaining the longitude of the extreme point reached. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The map, therefore, does not pretend to any minute 
          accuracy in general positions, but only to give an idea of the physical 
          features of a river still very imperfectly known.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are the most important distances on 
          the Rio Negro:--

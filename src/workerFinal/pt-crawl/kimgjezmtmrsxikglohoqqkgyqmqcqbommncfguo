/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

      <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 471]]</font> Having 
        spent nine months in a district where the Mias is most abundant, and having 
        devoted much time and attention to the subject, I wish to give some account 
        of my observations and collections, and particularly to record their bearing 
        on the question of how many species are yet known from Borneo.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have altogether examined the bodies of seventeen 
        freshly killed Orangs, all but one shot by myself. Of eleven of these 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 472]]</font> I have preserved the skins, either 
        in spirits or dried. Of seven I have perfect skeletons, and of the remainder 
        the skulls; and of all, the sex, colour and other external peculiarities 
        were accurately noted at the time, as well as all the principal dimensions. 
        I have besides two other skeletons and two skulls, the sex and external 
        characters of which are determined on the authority of Europeans or natives 
        who saw them when freshly killed. Of this extensive series sixteen are 
        fully adult, and their skulls are therefore strictly comparable with each 
        other, nine of them being males and seven females. They were moreover 
        all obtained in a very limited tract of country watered by the same small 
        river and of very uniform physical features. We may therefore assume, 
        unless the contrary can be supported by the very strongest evidence, that 
        the male and female specimens are sexes of the same species, whether they 
        be one or more.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The males procured by me may be divided into 
        two groups, differing considerably both in the external characters and 
        in those of the cranium. The first and most abundant is the large animal 
        known among the natives as the &quot;<em>Mias pappan</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>Mias chappan</em>,&quot; 
        the latter name being used by the Dyaks as well as that of &quot;<em>Mias Zimb</em>,&quot; 
        while the former is, on the authority of Sir James Brooke, a name applied 
        to it by the Malays. It is known by its large size and by the lateral 
        expansion of the face into fatty protuberances or ridges over the temporal 
        muscles, which have been mistermed <em>callosities</em>, as they are perfectly 
        soft, smooth and flexible. Five of this form measured by me varied only 
        from 4 feet 1 inch to 4 feet 2 inches in height from the heel to the crown 
        of the head, the girth of the body from 3 feet to 3 feet 7 &#189; inches, and 
        the extent of the outstretched arms from 7 feet 2 inches to 7 feet 8 inches; 
        the width of the face from 10 to 13 &#189; inches. The colour and length of 
        the hair varied in different individuals and in different parts of the 
        same individual; some possessed a rudimentary nail on the great toe, others 
        none at all, but they otherwise present no external differences on which 
        to establish even varieties of a species. Yet when we examine the crania 
        of these individuals we find remarkable differences of form, proportion 
        and dimension, no two being exactly alike. The slope of the profile and 
        the projection of the muzzle, together with the size of the cranium, offer 
        differences as decided as those existing between the most strongly marked 
        forms of the Caucasian and African crania in the human species. The orbits 
        vary in width and height, the cranial ridge is either single or double, 
        either much or little developed, and the zygomatic aperture varies considerably 
        in size. This variation in the proportions of the crania enables us satisfactorily 
        to explain the marked difference presented by the single crested and double- 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 473]]</font> crested skulls, which have been 
        thought to prove the existence of two large species of Orang. The external 
        surface of the skull varies considerably in size, as do also the zygomatic 
        aperture and the temporal muscle; but they bear no necessary relation 
        to each other, a small muscle often existing with a large cranial surface 
        and <em>vice vers&acirc;</em>. Now those skulls which have the largest 
        and strongest jaws and the widest zygomatic aperture, have the muscles 
        so large that they meet on the crown of the skull and deposit the bony 
        ridge which separates them, and which is highest in that which has the 
        smallest cranial surface. In those which combine a large surface with 
        comparatively weak jaws and small zygomatic aperture, the muscles on each 
        side do not extend to the crown, a space of from 1 to 2 inches remaining 
        between them, and along their margins small ridges are formed. Intermediate 
        forms are found in which the ridges meet only in the hinder portion of 
        the skull. The form and size of the ridges are therefore independent of 
        age, being sometimes more strongly developed in the less-aged animal. 
        Professor Temminck states that the series of skulls in the Leyden Museum 
        shows the same result.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir James Brooke first noticed these differences 
        in the ridges, and finding that the Dyaks affirmed that two large species 
        of Orang existed, very naturally concluded that they respectively belonged 
        to them. Mr. Blyth of Calcutta has adopted this view, considering that 
        the animal possessing the double-crested skull has the large cheek-excrescences, 
        while that with the single-crested skull is deprived of them; but my specimens, 
        as well as the series at Leyden, show that these various forms of skull 
        belong to one and the same species of animal, in which view Sir James 
        Brooke, after an examination of my specimens, perfectly coincides. I may 
        here mention, that Mr. Blyth has since written to Sir J. Brooke acknowledging 
        the receipt of some skeletons from Sarawak, and stating that he has found 
        a <em>new species</em> among them distinguished by its shorter and more 
        robust limbs and slightly projecting jaws. The great amount of variation, 
        however, which exists in these respects among animals whose external characters 
        are identical, would show that it is not possible to establish a new species 
        on such grounds from a single specimen. As an instance of the extreme 
        variation which occurs in the skull of the fully adult male Orang with 
        cheek-excrescences, I may mention that the width between the orbits externally 
        is only 4 inches in one specimen and fully 5 in another, while the two 
        animals did not differ 1 inch in their total height.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second form of male Orang which I have procured 
        differs so remarkably from the first, that it seems well entitled to be 
        considered a distinct species. The two fully adult specimens <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        474]]</font> which I obtained were respectively 3 ft. 8 &#189; in. and 3 ft. 
        9 &#189; in. in height, 6 ft. 6 in. in extent of arms, and about 2 ft. 6 in. 
        in girth of body. They possessed no signs of the cheek-excrescences, but 
        in other respects resembled the larger kinds. The skull is smaller and 
        weaker, and the zygomatic arches narrower than in the large species; it 
        has no bony crest, but two faint ridges from 1 3/4 inch to 2 inches apart, 
        exactly as in the <em>Simia Morio</em> of Prof. Owen, figured in the 'Transactions 
        of the Zoological Society.' The teeth however are in proportion to the 
        skull, of immense size, equalling, and in one case surpassing, those of 
        the larger animals: the molars extending further backward, and the incisors 
        and canines being set closely together, room is found for them in a much 
        smaller jaw. The great canine teeth are quite as large as in most specimens 
        of the larger animal, and of exactly the same form. These animals the 
        Dyaks called &quot;Mias Kassu.&quot;</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult females, five in number, examined 
        by me exhibit a remarkable uniformity among themselves, and a striking 
        difference compared with the large males. In size they vary only from 
        3 ft. 6 in. to 3 ft. 7 in. in height, from 2 ft. 4 in. to 2 ft. 6 &#189; in. 
        in girth below the arms, and from 5 ft. 9 in. to 6 ft. 5 &#189; in. in extent 
        of arms. None possess any cheek-excrescences, some have and some want 
        the nail on the great toe, the colour varies considerably, but the external 
        characters are in general remarkably similar to those of the smaller males 
        before mentioned, from which they only differ in a stature from 1 &#189; in. 
        to 3 inches lower. Their crania are either equal to or slightly less than 
        those of the small males; but their teeth differ remarkably from those 
        of all the males, in the canines being comparatively small, and of the 
        peculiar subtruncated form, dilated at the base, which is represented 
        in the plate of <em>Simia Morio</em> before alluded to. With that plate 
        most of these crania exactly agree; I presume therefore that it represents 
        a female specimen, and that the peculiar form of canine tooth is characteristic 
        of the female sex. The question then remains, to which of the two forms 
        of male animal are these the females. From a careful examination of my 
        specimens I am induced to consider that most of those, the crania of which 
        equal in size those of the small males, may be referred to the larger 
        species, while one or two, slightly smaller in all their dimensions, but 
        remarkable for having the two middle incisors in the upper jaw larger 
        than in the other specimens, may be considered as the females of the smaller 
        species, the male of which has also those teeth larger than in the animals 
        which possess huge crested skulls and cheek-excrescences. These smaller 
        females so exactly correspond with Prof. Owen's figure, that there is 
        no doubt of their belonging to <font color="#990000">[[p. 475]]</font> 
        the same species, the adult male of which will, I believe, now be made 
        known for the first time. The skins of the two small males and of the 
        females, now on their way to England, in spirits, will, when strictly 
        compared, serve to determine accurately the characters of the two species 
        of Bornean Orang, <em>Simia Satyrus</em> and <em>S. Morio.</em></p>
      <p><em> </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dyaks of N.-Western Borneo, however, 
        have names for three species of Mias, although I could never find any 
        one who could determine them with precision. All the animals with large 
        cheek-excrescences form the &quot;<em>Mias chappan</em>,&quot; but they declare 
        that females are also found of the same form. Authenticated female specimens, 
        however, with cheek-excrescences do not exist in Europe, and if they ever 
        do occur, seem far too rare in proportion to the males to be any other 
        than an accidental variety in which the one sex has assumed characters 
        generally confined to the other. All Orangs of smaller size and without 
        cheek-excrescences are called by the Dyaks <em>Mias Kassu</em>, and my 
        small males and females are undoubtedly of this kind; but these people 
        have asserted that every female I shot was a <em>Mias Kassu</em>, so that 
        I am rather inclined to think that they have regarded the larger males 
        as distinct species from the smaller and differently formed females. In 
        one case however they said that a female was a <em>Mias chappan</em>, 
        though it possessed no cheek-excrescences, nor differed from the other 
        females except in having the skin of the throat rather more loose and 
        inflated than usual,--a character generally very prominent in the large 
        males. The third kind they call the <em>Mias rambi</em>, and they say 
        it equals the &quot;chappan&quot; in size, but has no cheek-excrescences and very 
        long hair. This seems very rare, and is probably one of the large species 
        in which the excrescences have been little or not at all developed. One 
        of my females they asserted with hesitation to be a &quot;rambi,&quot; but I could 
        not perceive that it in any way differed from the others except in a much 
        paler colour than usual.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusions therefore at which I have arrived 
        are as follows:--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. That two species of Orang have been ascertained 
        to exist in Borneo.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The differences between them are well marked 
        in the males, but much less distinct in the females.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. That all the females are characterized by 
        the small-sized skull without prominent ridges and by their subtruncated 
        dilated canine teeth.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The males of both species possess large conical 
        canines.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. That the form, size and proportions of the 
        crania, and the size and position of the teeth, vary in each individual 
        to such an <font color="#990000">[[p. 476]]</font> extent, that these 
        variations alone cannot be taken to mark distinct species.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these conclusions are fully supported 
        by Prof. Temminck, from an examination of the very extensive series of 
        specimens in the Leyden Museum, though, from not possessing specimens 
        of the smaller male, he was unable to detect any specific difference in 
        the females.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Owen, in his admirable papers published 
        in the 'Transactions of the Zoological Society,' has described the apparent 
        confusion in the position of the second set of teeth in the jaws of the 
        young animal, and observes that it seems wonderful that they should all 
        fall into their proper places in the adult, without those irregularities 
        which are so frequent in Man. My specimens however prove that such irregularities 
        are very frequent, as more than one-half of my crania exhibit them in 
        a greater or less degree. In two cases a sixth molar tooth occurs on one 
        or both sides of the jaw; the incisors are often unsymmetrical and the 
        whole jaw is frequently oblique, in one case so much so, that while the 
        upper canine closes inside the lower on one side of the jaw, it is outside 
        on the other.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A striking peculiarity, not, I believe, hitherto 
        noticed, exists in the mamm&aelig; of the female, which are scarcely perceptible 
        even when giving suck. In two specimens which I shot with their infant 
        young, the nipples rose from a breast not more developed than in the male 
        animal.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding observations might have been very 
        much extended, but the object has been merely to give some account of 
        the writer's observations and collections, believing that no definite 
        and certain conclusions can be arrived at without a comparison of his 
        materials with those which already exist in England and at Leyden, a comparison 
        which he looks forward to making on his return.</p>

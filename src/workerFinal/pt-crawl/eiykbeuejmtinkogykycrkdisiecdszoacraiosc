<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>When and where did you receive your Ph.D.?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>The University of California at Berkeley in 1963 in the field
of geology.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What is your current employment?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>I am presently employed as the assistant chief geologist for
the western region of the United States Geological Survey, and I am one
of three assistant chief geologists for the three regions of the United
States. The western region includes the eight western states in the Pacific
coast territory.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Were you responsible for scientific testing of the lunar rock
samples returned from the moon?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. I was selected by NASA to be one of the principal investigators

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) geochronology, paleomagnetism, and radiometric
data in general.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What, briefly, is geochronology?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, geochronology includes methods that are used to determine
the ages of geological events.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Have you published a substantial number of books and articles
in these fields?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Over a hundred scientific papers and a book that is commonly

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Okay.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Doctor Dalrymple, I have just handed you a copy of Act 590.
Have you had an opportunity to read Act 590?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, I have.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is there anything in the Act's definition of creation science
to which the field of geochronology is relevant?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Section 4(a)(6) specifies, and I quote, A relatively recent
inception of the earth and living kinds, end of quote.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page409"><font face="Times New Roman">409</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is there anything in the Act's definition of evolution to which
the field of geochronology is relevant?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Section 4(b)(6) specifies, quote, An inception several
billion years ago of the earth and somewhat later of life, end of quote.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are you familiar with the creation science literature concerning
the age of the earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, I am. I have read perhaps two dozen books and articles
either in whole or in part. They consistently assert that the earth is
somewhere between six and about twenty thousand years, with most of the
literature saying that the earth is less than ten thousand years old.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are you aware of any scientific evidence to indicate that the
earth is no more than ten thousand years old?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>None whatsoever. In over twenty years of research and reading
of scientific literature, I have never encountered any such evidence.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are you aware of any scientific evidence to indicate the earth
is no more than ten million years old?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>None whatsoever.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Wait a second. What is it that the creation scientists
say is the age of the earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>They make a variety of estimates. They range between about
six and about twenty thousand years, from
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page410"><font face="Times New Roman">410</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) what I've read. Most of them assert rather persistently
that the earth is less than ten thousand years. Beyond that they are not
terribly specific.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are you aware of any scientific evidence to indicate the earth
is no more than ten million years old?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>None whatsoever.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are you aware of any scientific evidence to indicate a relatively
young earth or a relatively recent inception of the earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>None whatsoever.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>If you were required to teach the scientific evidences for
a young earth, what would you teach?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Since there is no evidence for a young earth, I'm afraid the
course would be without content. I would have nothing to teach at all.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is the assertion by creation scientists that the earth is relatively
young subject to scientific testing?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, it is. It one of the few assertions by the creationists
that is subject to testing and falsification.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Have such tests been conducted?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Many times, by many different methods over the last several
decades.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What do those tests show?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Those tests consistently show that the concept of a young earth
is false; that the earth is billions of years
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page411"><font face="Times New Roman">411</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) old. In fact, the best figure for the earth is
in the nature of four and a half billion years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And I would like to point out that we're not talking about just the
factor of two or small differences. The creationists estimates of the age
of the earth are off by a factor of about four hundred fifty thousand.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>In your professional opinion, are the creation scientists assertions
of a young earth been falsified?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Absolutely. I'd put them in the same category as the flat earth
hypothesis and the hypothesis that the sun goes around the earth. I think
those are all absurd, completely disproven hypotheses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>In your professional opinion, in light of all of the scientific
evidence, is the continued assertion by creation scientists that the earth
is relatively young consistent with the scientific method?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>No, it is not consistent with the scientific method to hold
onto a hypothesis that has been completely disproven to the extent that
it is now absurd.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>How do geochronologists test for the age of the earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>We use what are called the radiometric dating techniques.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Would you tell us very briefly, and we'll come back to the
details later, how radiometric dating techniques work?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page412"><font face="Times New Roman">412</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Basically we rely on the radioactive decay of long lived
radioactive isotopes into isotopes of another element. By convention we
call the long lived isotopes that's doing the decaying the parent, and
the end product we call the daughter.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">What we do in principal is we measure the amount of parent isotopes
in a rock or mineral and we measure the amount of the daughter isotope
in a rock or mineral, and knowing the rate at which the decay is taking
place, we can then calculate the age.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is considerably more complicated than that, but that's the essence
of those techniques.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are these isotopes, isotopes of various atoms?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, they are.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you briefly tell the Court what an atom is, how it's
composed?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, an atom consists of basically three particles. The nucleus,
or inner core of the atom, has both neutrons and protons. The number of
protons in the nucleus determines what the chemical element for that atom
is. Both neutrons and protons have the same mass.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Neutrons have no charge. The number of neutrons in an atom do not determine
the elemental characteristics of that atom, only the number of protons.
Orbiting the nucleus of the atom is a cloud of electrons
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page413"><font face="Times New Roman">413</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) that orbit more or less like the planets around
the sun.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you tell us briefly what an isotope is?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Differing atoms of the same element that have different
numbers of neutrons in a nucleus are called isotopes of that particular
element. The addition of a neutron, more or less, as I said, does not change
the character of the element, it only changes the atomic mass. And in some
cases, when several neutrons are added to the nucleus, the atom becomes
unstable and becomes radioactive.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you give an example of an isotope?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Carbon-14, for example. The element, Carbon, normally
contains six protons. Ordinary carbon contains six neutrons, as well, giving
it an atomic mass of twelve. That is usually indicated by the capital letter
C, for carbon, and the superscript in the upper left hand corner denotes
it being Carbon-12 for the atomic mass. If we add two neutrons to that
atom, it can become Carbon-14, which is designated C-14.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Carbon-14, because of those two extra neutrons, is unstable and is radioactive,
whereas Carbon-12 is not radioactive.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Why did geochronologists rely upon radiometric dating techniques
rather than other techniques?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Because radioactivity is the only process that we
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page414"><font face="Times New Roman">414</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) know of that's been constant through time for
billions of years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is radioactive decay affected by external factors?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>No, radioactive decay is not affected by external factors.
That's one reason we think it's been constant for a long time.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you give an example of processes that are affected by
external factors.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Examples would be the rates of erosion or the rates of
sedimentation. That is the rate that sediments are deposited into the oceans
and lakes. Both of those processes are affected by the amount of annual
and daily rainfall, they are affected by the height of the continents above
sea level, they are affected by the amount of wind, and so forth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We know that all those factors vary with time, both on a daily and annual
basis, and, therefore, the rates are not constant. They can't be used to
calculate ages of any sort.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do creation scientists rely on the rates of erosion or sedimentation
in their attempts to date the age of the earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. In some of their literature they have used both of those
techniques, and that is a good example of how unscientific some of their
estimates are, because
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page415"><font face="Times New Roman">415</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) again, these processes have not been constant
over time.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you tell us why radioactive decay rates are basically
impervious to external factors?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>It's basically because the nucleus of an atom is extremely
well protected from its surroundings. And also because radioactive decay
is a spontaneous process that arises only from the nucleus; it's not affected
by external factors. The cloud of electrons that surrounds the nucleus
of an atom provides very good protection against external forces. And also
the strength of the nuclear glue, the strength of the nuclear binding,
is among the strongest forces in nature. This is one reason why scientists
have to use powerful and extensive accelerators in atomic reactors to penetrate
the nucleus of an atom. It's really tough to get in there.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Have scientists tested and measured those decay rates under
various circumstances to see whether they would be affected by external
forces?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. There has been a variety of tests over the past number
of decades addressing exactly that point. And they found, for example,
that decay rates do not change with extremes of temperature, from a hundred
ninety-six degrees below zero Centigrade to two thousand degrees
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page416"><font face="Times New Roman">416</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) Centigrade. The rates were not affected.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">At pressures of a vacuum or two thousand atmosphere, for example, thirty
thousand pounds per square inch, we found that the combining of radioactive
isotopes in different chemical compounds does not affect the decay rates.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Have any tests ever shown any change in the decay rates of
any of the particular isotopes geochronologists use in radiometric dating?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>None. They've always been found to be constant.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are changes in decay rates of various isotopes at least theoretically
possible?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Theoretically in some instances, and let me explain that.
There are three principal types of decay involved in radioactive dating
techniques. One is alpha decay. That's the decay that involves the ejection
of an alpha particle from the nucleus of the atom. Another is beta decay.
That involves the injection of something like an electron - it's called
a beta particle - from the nucleus.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Theory tells us that neither of those types of decay can be affected
by external factors, and in fact, none of the experiments have ever shown
any effect on either alpha or beta decay.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a third type of decay called electron capture,
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page417"><font face="Times New Roman">417</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) where an orbital electron falls into the nucleus
and converts a proton into a neutron. That type of radioactive decay, because
the original electron comes from the electron shell, one can imagine if
you depress that shell a little bit, you might increase the probability
of the electron falling into the nucleus.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Theory tells us that such changes in electron capture decay are possible,
but theory also tells us that those changes should be very small. And in
fact, the maximum changes ever detected or ever forced have been the Beryllium-7,
and that changes only one-tenth of one percent. No larger.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There have never been any changes affecting any of the decays being
used for radioactive dating.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do creation scientists challenge the constancy of those radioactive
decay processes?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, they do. There have done that on a number of occasions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Have they advanced any scientific evidence to support their
challenge?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>None whatsoever.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Did they use the relevant data on the decay rates in a fair
and objective manner, in your professional opinion?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>No. In fact, they frequently cite irrelevant or
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page418"><font face="Times New Roman">418</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) misleading data in their claims of decay rates
change.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you give an example?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, I can give two examples. The first is in an Institute
for Creation Research technical monograph written by Harold Slusher entitled,
I believe, <u>A Critique of Radiometric Dating</u>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In that publication he makes the statement that the decay rates of Iron-57
have been changed by as much as three percent by strong electric fields.
The problem with that is that Iron-57 is not radioactive. Iron-57 is a
stable isotope. When Iron-57, it does undergo an internal conversion decay,
and by that I mean simply a mechanism for getting rid of some excess energy.
And that type of decay does also have a decay rate, but it's completely
irrelevant to radioactive dating.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So when Iron-57 decays, "by internal conversion", it remains Iron-57.
One of the dating schemes used in geology involved internal conversions.
So the example of Iron-57 cited by Slusher is simply irrelevant.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And in fact, he did reference his source of that data, and I've been
unable to confirm the fact that Iron-57 decay rates by internal conversion
have been changed, so I'm not sure that's even true.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page419"><font face="Times New Roman">419</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>But even if it were true, it would be irrelevant because Iron-57
would remain Iron-57?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>That's exactly right.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>And the isotope techniques you rely upon are changed from one
element to another?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>That's true.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you give, another example?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Another example frequently cited is the use of neutrinos.
They frequently claim that neutrinos might change decay rates. There are
several things wrong with that hypothesis also. The first thing, the source
of their statement was a column in <u>Industrial Research</u> by Frederich
Houtermanns entitled <u>Speculative Science</u> or something. <u>Scientific
Speculation</u> is the title of his column.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And without any empirical evidence whatsoever, Houtermanns speculated
the neutrinos might somehow effect radioactive clocks. But there is no
theory for that and there is no empirical evidence that such is the case.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The creationists conveniently leave out the speculative nature of that
particular idea. The second thing is that neutrinos are extremely small
particles. They have virtually no mass or little mass and no charge. They
were first postulated by Pauli back in the 1930's as a way of an atom carrying
off excess energy
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page420"><font face="Times New Roman">420</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) when it decays by beta decay. They interact so
little with matter, in fact, that they're very difficult to detect, and
it's several decades later before they were even detected. Neutrinos can
pass completely through the earth without interacting with the matter,
and there's no reason at all to suspect that they would change the decay
rates or alter the decay rates in any way.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the creationists typically argue that neutrinos might reset
the atomic clock. I am not quite sure what they mean by that, but if it's
used in the usual sense, to reset a clock means starting it back at zero.
The effect of that would be that all of our radiometric dating techniques
would overestimate the geologic ages and ages of the earth, not underestimate
them. So that works against their hypothesis.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>If they reset the clocks, then the test results from that resetting
would show the earth to be younger than in fact?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. What, in fact, we would have would be a minimum age instead
of a correct age. So it works in exactly the opposite direction.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>In addition to questioning the constancy of the decay rates,
do creation scientists make other criticisms of radiometric dating?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. One of their other criticisms is that your
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page421"><font face="Times New Roman">421</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) parent or daughter isotopes might be either added
or subtracted from the rock between the time of its formation and the time
it would be measured. And they commonly say that since we can't know whether
or not the daughter or parent isotopes have been added or subtracted, therefore,
we have no basis for assuming they are not, or for calculating an age from
this data.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is that commonly referred to as the closed system-open system
problem?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Basically all radiometric dating techniques require -
most of them do, not all - most of them require that the rock system, the
piece of rock or the mineral they were measuring, has been a closed system
since the time of crystallization up until the time that we measure.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And what they're basically saying is that we have no way of knowing
whether they have been a closed system or not.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What steps do geochronologists take to insure that the samples
they test have remained closed systems and have not changed since they
were initially formed?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>We try to be fairly careful with that. We don't run out and
pick up just any rock and subject it to these expensive and time consuming
tests. There are several different ways we go about this. The first thing
is, we can observe the geological circumstances in which the

<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page422"><font face="Times New Roman">422</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) sample occurs. And that tells us a lot about the
history of that sample, what kinds of external factors it might have been
subjected to. The second thing is that there are microscopic techniques
that we can use to examine the rock in detail and tell, whether or not
it's likely to have been a closed system since its formation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You see, all things that can affect the rock system in terms of opening
it also leave other evidence behind, like changes in minerals that we can
observe. So we have pretty good field and laboratory techniques which will
tell in advance whether a system has been a closed system or an open system.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do you, yourself, engage in that testing process?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Oh, yes, all the time. As a result, I personally reject perhaps
a half to three-quarters of all samples for dating just for that very reason
that the samples are not suitable. This rejection is done before we get
any results.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Once you have a sample which you believe has not changed since
formation, is there any objective way to test a sample to determine whether
you're right or wrong?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. There are a number of objective ways to do that. These
ways rely on the results themselves.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do the results themselves show whether the sample has changed
its formation?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page423"><font face="Times New Roman">423</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, they do.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>If the results of a test showed that a sample had changed since
formation, is that sample then utterly worthless?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>No, not at all. We are not always interested in the age of
the rock, For example, sometime we are interested in the age of the heating
events. If, for example, a rock body has been subjected to heating, we
might be more interested in what event caused that heating than the usual
crystallization age of the rock, so that usually these kinds of results
give us other kinds of information.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">They also tell us a good deal about the state of that sample, whether
or not it has been an open or closed system. So just because we don't get
a reliable crystallization age doesn't mean that we aren't getting other
information.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, we might end up with the age of the heating events which
would be an extremely valuable piece of information. Sometimes just knowing
the sample has not been a closed system is an extremely valuable piece
of information.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So we use these dating techniques for lots of things other than determining
the age of the rock sample.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>How many methods are there for determining
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page424"><font face="Times New Roman">424</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>(Continuing) subjectively whether a sample has been changed
since formation?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, there are quite a variety, but I think they can be lumped
into about four categories. Those include dating two minerals from the
same rock; using two different techniques on the same rock; other tests
that Are called geological consistency tests, and finally, there is a category
of techniques called isochron techniques that also serve that purpose.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you briefly describe the first method?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. In dating of two minerals from the same rock, the reason
we do that is because different minerals respond in different ways to external
factors.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, in the potassium argon method, the daughter product is
argon, which is a rare gas. It's not terribly happy being inside minerals.
It doesn't chemically combine with any of the other elements there.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If we take the mineral biotite, that's a mica, for example, and date
that with the potassium argon method, then we also date the mineral hornblende
with the potassium argon method, if there has been an external influence
on this system, we expect those two minerals to respond differently.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is because the biotite would start to release its argon at temperatures
of perhaps two-fifty to three
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page425"><font face="Times New Roman">425</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) hundred degrees centigrade, whereas the hornblende
would reach six or seven hundred degrees centigrade before it starts to
release its argon.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There, of course, has been a heating event of, let's say hypothetically
five hundred degrees, we would expect to see argon loss or younger ages
from the biotites, whereas the hornblende might retain all of its argon
completely.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The main point is that when we get a discrepancy like this, we know
that something has happened to the system that made it, violate our assumption
of a closed system, and that's valuable information.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>And if you get that result, you then do not use that sample
to postulate an age for the initial formation of the samples?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>That's right. The results themselves tell us that that would
be a very dangerous conclusion to come to. But we can postulate that there
has been something happen to that rock.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Go to the second method you use.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>The second method involves using two different dating techniques
on the same rock. This has a couple of advantages. It's a little more powerful
than the first method.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, if we use the potassium argon method, which has a half
life of one point two five billion years, and
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page426"><font face="Times New Roman">426</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) we use the rubidium strontium method, which has
a half life of forty-eight point eight billion years, we essentially have
two clocks running at different speeds but keeping the same time.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If I could use an analogy, we might have two wristwatches. One wristwatch
might use a balance wheel that rotates back and forth five times a second.
On the other hand we might have a digital watch that uses a little quartz
crystal that operates at a speed of, let's say, twenty thousand times a
second. We, then, have two watches that are ticking at different rates
but keeping the same time. That same advantage accrues to using two different
methods on the same rock.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The second advantage is the daughter products are different. The daughter
product of the potassium argon method is argon. It's a rare gas. It behaves
quite differently to heating, whether in alteration, than does strontium-87,
which is the daughter product of the rubidium strontium method. Strontium-87
is not a gas, it's a chemical element that likes to be in chemical combination
with certain other things in a rock.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So again we expect a different response.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Does testing a sample with the two or more techniques frequently
yield the same age for that sample?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Particularly in the cases where we know from
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page427"><font face="Times New Roman">427</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) other evidence that the sample has been undisturbed,
we commonly get that result.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What do creation scientists say about age agreements between
different techniques?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, they usually just ignore them. They don't pay any attention
to them at all.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Does testing a sample with two or more techniques ever yield
different rates for that sample?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Quite often it does.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What do creation scientists say about those age disagreements?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, they usually use those disagreements and purport that
they have evidence that the techniques don't work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is that a scientific assessment of the evidence?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, no. There are several things wrong with that. In the
first place, when we get disagreements, they are almost invariably caused
by some external factor that has caused one of the clocks to read in a
way that's too young. It gives us an age that is too young.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The second thing is that age that is too young might measure, for example,
the age of the event. Those ages that are too young are still millions
and millions of years old, which, even though we don't have agreement between
the techniques, still contradict the hypothesis
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page428"><font face="Times New Roman">428</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) of an earth less than ten thousand years old.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the reason for doing these kinds of tests is to determine in
advance upon the results themselves whether or not the technique is reliable.
Therefore, they are using our very test method as a criticism of the method
itself, and I sort of consider that dirty pool. It's not very honest.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What's the third method commonly used to test the changes in
a sample?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, the third method involves geological consistency. Rocks
don't occur all by themselves. They usually are surrounded by other rocks,
and the relationship of the sample to these other rocks can be determined.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the simplest example might be a lava flow. If we have a stack
of lava flows from a volcano and we are interested in determining the age
of that volcano or that stack of lava flows, we wouldn't just date one
rock. We would date one from the top of the sequence, perhaps; we would
date one from the bottom of the sequence, and we might date eight or ten
intermediate in the sequence. We know because of the way lava flows form,
one on top of the other, that all of those ages should either be the same
or they should become progressively older as you go
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page429"><font face="Times New Roman">429</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) down in the pile.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If, in fact, we get random or chaotic results, that tells us that something
is wrong about our assumption of the closed system, so we can use a variety
of geological consistency tests like this to test the results as well.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What is the fourth method that you rely upon?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, the fourth is really a family of methods called isochron
techniques.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>How do the isochron techniques differ from the other techniques
you've just mentioned?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>These are techniques that have especially built in checks and
balances, so that we can tell from the results themselves, without making
any other assumptions, whether or not the techniques are giving reliable
ages.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Some isochron techniques really work very well, and work best on open
systems. Isochron techniques typically yield two important results. One
is, most of the isochron techniques are able to tell us the amount and
composition of any initial daughter that is present. That's not something
we need to assume, it's something that falls out of the calculations.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The second thing is that the isochron techniques tell us very clearly
whether a sample has been opened or closed. If the sample is still an isochron,
then we know that that
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page430"><font face="Times New Roman">430</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) sample is a good closed system. If we don't get
an isochron, we know that something is wrong with the sample. And we get
these results just from the experimental data themselves, without any other
geological consideration.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So they are ultimately self-checking, and they are one of the most common,
surefire ways to date rocks.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Have creation scientist's produced any evidence or suggested
any plausible theory to support their assertion that the earth is only
about ten thousand years old?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>No. I know of no plausible theory that they suggest. They have
proposed several methods that don't work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Have you looked into the creation science claim that the decay
of the earth's magnetic field shows a young earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. I've looked into that in some detail. That is rather fully
described in an Institute for Creation Research technical monograph by
Thomas Barnes, which if I recall correctly is titled <u>The Origin and
Destiny of the Earth's Magnetic Field</u>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Let me try to explain briefly what Barnes asserts. For the last hundred
and fifty years or so, since 1835, scientists have analyzed the earth's
magnetic field, and they have noticed that the dipole moment, and we can
think
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page431"><font face="Times New Roman">431</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) of that just as the strength of the main magnetic
field, has decreased, and it has decreased in intensity over the last hundred
and fifty years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The decrease amounts to about six or seven percent. Barnes claims that
the earth's magnetic fields are decaying remnants of a field that was originally
created at the time the earth was created, and that it is irreversible
decaying and will eventually vanish, in about nine or ten thousand years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">What Barnes does is assume that this decay is exponential. Actually
you can't tell whether it's exponential within the earth, but he assumes
it's exponential going back to a hypothesis proposed by, actually a model
proposed by Sir Forrest Land back in the eighteen hundreds.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Land is not talking about the magnetic field, though. He gives the mathematical
calculations that Barnes uses. Barnes then calculates a half life with
this presumed exponential decay, extrapolates backwards in time and concludes
that in 8000 B.C. the strength of the earth's dipole moment would have
been the same as the strength of the magnetic star.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And since that is obviously absurd, and I would have to agree that that
would be absurd, therefore, the earth must be less than ten thousand years
old.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page432"><font face="Times New Roman">432</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What is wrong with that claim?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, there are quite a few things wrong with that claim. To
start with, Barnes only considers the dipole field. The earth's magnetic
field, to a first approximation, is like a dipole. That is, it produces
the same field as would a large bar magnet, roughly parallel to the axis
of rotation of the earth, lining across the merging poles, circle around
the earth, and return back in at the other pole. But that's not the whole
story. That's only the part that Barnes works with.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The other component of the magnetic field is the non-dipole field. These
are irregularities that are superimposed on the dipole field and amount
to a considerable proportion of the total field.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, theory tells us that there is probably another very large component
of the magnetic field inside the core of the earth that we can't observe
because the line of the flux are closed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">So Barnes makes several mistakes. First, he equates the dipole field
with the total earth's field, which it's not. It's only a part of the earth's
field. And second, he equates the dipole field strength with the total
magnetic energy. And both of those extrapolations are completely unjustified.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Careful studies of the non-dipole and dipole field over
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page433"><font face="Times New Roman">433</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) the past fifty years have shown that the decrease
in the dipole field is exactly balanced by an increase in the strength
of the non-dipole field.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, over the last fifty years, as far as we can tell, there has
been no decay in total field energy external to the core at all. Similar
studies over the last hundred and twenty years show a very slight decrease
in the total field energy external to the core. So in fact, we don't know
exactly what's happening to the total field energy.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And finally, paleomagnetic observations have shown that the strength
of the dipole moment doesn't decrease continually in one direction, but
it oscillates with periods of a few thousand years. So it goes up for a
while and goes down for a while. At the same time the non-dipole field
is also changing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And lastly, he completely ignores geomagnetic reversals. Paleomagnetic
studies of rocks have shown conclusively that the earth's field has periodically,
in the past, reversed polarities, so that the North Pole becomes the South
Pole, and vice versa. This happens rather frequently geologically, that
is, hundreds of thousands to millions of years at a time.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We now have a pretty good time scale for those reversals over the last
ninety million years. And Barnes completely
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page434"><font face="Times New Roman">434</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) ignores that evidence.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One thing we do know about geomagnetic reversals from the evidence,
of rocks is that during the process of the field reversing, the dipole
moment decays.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What do creation scientists say about the possibility of the
polarity reversals?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, they claim that they can't happen, and they claim that
they have not happened.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is there any basis for that claim?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>No, none whatsoever. The paleomagnetic evidence is very sound,
and, in fact, it's verified by other evidence as well.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It's also interesting to note that the earth's field is not the only
field that reverses polarity. For example, in 1953, the dipole field of
the sun was positive polarity in the North and negative polarity in the
South pole. Over the next few years the strength of the sun's dipole field
began to decrease, very much in the same way that the strengths of the
earth's dipole field is now decreasing, until within a few years it had
vanished entirely. It couldn't be measured from the earth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then gradually it began to reestablish itself, and by 1958 the sun's
dipole field was completely reversed, so that the North Pole, instead of
being positive, was now negative, and vice versa for the South Pole.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page435"><font face="Times New Roman">435</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) So geomagnetic reversals are not a surprising
phenomena, and in fact, they are expected. Magnetic reversals have also
been seen in the stars.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>But creation scientists just deny that that happens?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, they never mention that. It's simply ignored.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do creation science arguments for a young earth rely on the
cooling of the earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. They commonly use that argument. And again, that argument
is one that has been championed by Thomas Barnes and some of the patrons
of the Institute of Creation Research.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">That particular theory, or idea, goes back to an idea championed by
Lord Kelvin (Thomson) who started in the mid-eighteen hundreds. At that
time you must remember that there was no such thing as radioactivity. By
that I mean it had not been discovered yet.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Kelvin observed that the temperature of the earth increased as it went
downward from the surface. That is, he observed the geothermal gradient.
He had started with the assumption that the earth started from a white
hot incandescent sphere and it cooled to its present state. So he calculated
how long that would take.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">His first estimates were something between twenty and four hundred million
years. Later he settled on twenty-four million years, which was not his
figure, but
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page436"><font face="Times New Roman">436</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) it was a figure that was first calculated by the
geologist Clarence King, who quite incidentally was the first director
of the Geological Survey.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem with total analysis in Barnes championing of this thing
is that partly he took a physical way to calculate the age of the earth.
The problem with that is that in 1903 Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated
conclusively that there's an enormous amount of energy available in radioactive
decay. In fact, all of the heat now pouring outward from the earth can
be accounted for solely by radioactive elements in the earth's crust and
mantle.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Kelvin never publicly recanted his views, but in the history of his
life it has been recorded that he privately</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Admitted that the discovery by Rutherford and Soddy that said this enormous
energy is from radioactive decay had completely disproved his hypothesis.
Even Kelvin knew it was wrong.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It's quite amazing to me that the creationists would hold such an idea
for a couple of reasons. The first reason being that we've known for all
these centuries that Kelvin's calculations were completely irrelevant.
And the second thing is that Kelvin thought the earth was billions of years
old.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do creation scientists rely on the accumulation of meteor dust
as evidence for a young age of the earth?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page437"><font face="Times New Roman">437</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. That's another one that they claim. And I've looked into
it some, and if you don't mind, I'd like to refer to some notes on that
so that I get the figures straight.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you explain that creation science claim?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. Morris, in 1974, and also a book by Wysong in 1966, both
claim that there's evidence that the influx of meteoric dust to the earth
is fourteen million tons per year.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And they calculate that if the earth were five billion years old, this
should result in a layer of meteoric dust on the earth a hundred and eight-five
feet thick. And they say, "How absurd, we don't observe this," of course.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There are some problems with that, however. They are relying on calculations
done by a man by the name of Peterson in 1960. What Peterson did was collect
volumes of air from the top of Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii, using a pump
originally developed for smog, I believe.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then he thought about the dust. Then he analyzed this dust for nickel
content. He observed that nickel was a fairly rare element on the earth's
crust.
That's not exactly true, but that was the assumption that he used.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And he assumed that the meteoric dust had a nickel content of two and
half percent. So using the mass of dust that he had and the nickel content
of the dust and an
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page438"><font face="Times New Roman">438</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) assumed two and a half percent nickel content
for meteoric material, he was able to calculate the annual volume of meteoric
dust that flowed into the earth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">He came up with a figure of about fifteen million tons per year, but
when he weighed all of the evidence, he finally concluded that perhaps,
about five million tons per year was about right.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Morris, on the other hand, and Wysong, both choose thehigher number,
I think because that makes the layer of dust thicker.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem with that is that nickel is not all that uncommon in the
earth's crust, and probably Peterson was measuring a lot of contamination.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There have been more recent estimates than Peterson's. In 1968, for
example, Barker and Anders made an estimate of the meteoric influx of cosmic
dust based on the uranium osmium contents, which are extremely rare, of
matter in deep sea sediments. And they came up with an influx figure that
was a factor of twenty-three lower than Peterson's figure, and, therefore,
twenty-three times lower than the figure used by Morris.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Probably the best completely independent estimates, however, are based
on satellite data, satellite penetration data. That is, the number and
the mass of particles distract satellites as they orbit the earth.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page439"><font face="Times New Roman">439</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) And NASA collected quite a bit of these data in
the 1960's.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a review of that done in 1972, and you note that that information
was available when Morris and Wysong wrote their book, but they didn't
cite it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What does that NASA data show?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, that showed that the influx of meteoric materials was,
in fact, not fourteen million tons or even five million tons per year,
but more like eleven thousand tons per year. In other words, two orders
of magnitude lower.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And coming out here on the plane, I redid Morris' calculations using
these better figures, and I came up with a rough layer of four point six
centimeters in five billion years. And of course, with the rainfall and
everything, that simply would have been washed away.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There's an interesting aside. NASA was quite concerned about the layer
of dust on the moon. NASA estimated that it would produce a layer of dust
on the moon in four and a half billion years of about one and half to perhaps
fifteen centimeters maximum. And in the least disturbed areas of the moon,
the astronauts measured a thickness of about ten centimeters, so the observations
agree exactly with the predictions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do these observations on the moon prove that the

<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page440"><font face="Times New Roman">440</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>(Continuing) earth or the moon are, in fact, four point five
to five million years old?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>No, they don't prove anything whatsoever except that there's
dust on the moon. It's another one of those processes that has a non-constant
rate. We have more reason to suspect that the rate of influx of meteoric
dust has been constant with time. In fact, we have a lot of reasons to
suspect that it is not.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, in the early history of the earth, four and a half billion
years ago when the earth was first formed, it was sweeping up out of space
enormous amounts of material. During those periods of the earth's history,
we would expect the influx rate to be very, very high. Now it's much lower.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The evidence indicates it has probably been constant for perhaps the
last ten million years. We have no idea what the rate of influx of meteoric
dust has been over geologic history. So it's one of these things that you
simply can't use.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Do creation scientists rely upon the shrinking of the sun?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. That's another one I've read, and that stems from a paper,
I think in the Institute of Creation Research Impact, Number 82, published
in April of 1980. Their claim is based on a paper by Eddie Inpornasian
(Aram Boornazian) which was published in 1979. Using
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page441"><font face="Times New Roman">441</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) visual observations of the sun, Aram Boornazian
observed that they thought that the sun's diameter was decreasing. And
it was decreasing at such a rate that in a hundred thousand years the sun
would vanish to a point.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And the creationists work this backwards and say that if the earth was
as old as geologists claim it was, then the sun would have been very large
in the past history, and would have been so large that life would not have
been possible on the earth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem with this particular calculation is that the original data
of Aram Boornazian was completely wrong. There had been another study done
by Irwin Shapiro of MIT, who used twenty-three transits of mercury across
the face of the sun that occurred between 1736 and sometime within the
last few years, a much more accurate way to measure the diameter of the
sun than the techniques used by Aram and his colleagues. Shapiro, his paper
was published in 1980. He said rather conclusively that the sun's diameter
is not changing at all. The sun is not shrinking or it's not growing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Are you aware of other supposed tests for the earth's age proposed
by creation scientists?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. There are a number of them in a book by Morris called,
I believe, <u>The Scientific Case for Creation</u>. As I recall, he proposes
about seventy
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page442"><font face="Times New Roman">442</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) different methods that he lists. They ranged all
the way from influx of soda aluminum into the oceans, for which he gets
a figure of a hundred years, I believe, to influx of magma into the crust,
for which he gets a figure of five hundred million years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. ENNIS</u>: Your Honor, Plaintiffs have previously marked for
identification excerpts from that particular book that include approximately
six pages to which Doctor Dalrymple might refer in his testimony. I have
given copies of those additional six pages to the Attorney General.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If there is no objection, I'd like for those six pages to be added and
included with Plaintiffs' Exhibit Eighty-Six for identification.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Okay.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: (Continuing)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>I'd like to show you Plaintiffs' Exhibit Eighty-Six for identification.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Okay.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Does Mr. Morris, in that book, acknowledge any assumptions
he used in deciding which of those tests to rely upon and which not to
rely upon?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, he does. On page 53 he makes the following statement:
"It is equally legitimate for creationists to calculate apparent ages using
assumptions which agree with
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page443"><font face="Times New Roman">443</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>(Continuing) their belief in special creation, provided they
acknowledge that fact. And then he goes on to present seventy such calculations,
most of which are made by him and his colleagues, but some of which he
refers to the scientific literature.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>What do those seventy tests supposedly show?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Well, Morris approaches this in a rather strange way. He says,
"I'm going to make all these calculations for the age of the earth using
these assumptions," and then gets a variety of results, ranging from too
small to measure, to, I don't know, five hundred million years, something
like that.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">And he says, "Look how inconsistent the results are. As you see, we
really can't calculate the age of the earth." However, he thinks that the
young ages are probably more reliable than the old ages, basically because
there would have been less time for external factors to affect the calculation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem with these seventy ages is that most of them rely on rates
that are not constant. And these seventy also include things like the magnetic
field and meteoric dust, which I have already discussed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, however, he uses very misleading and erroneous data.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Could you give me an example of that?
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page444"><font face="Times New Roman">444</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes, I can. There is one which is here, number thirty-three.
It's entitled, "Formation of Carbon 14 on Meteorites." The age he lists
is a hundred thousand years, and the reference he gives is to a paper published
in 1972 by Boeckl. There is a problem with that, and that is that Boeckl's:
paper was not about meteorites at all; Boeckl's paper was about tektites.
Tektites are objects which are thought to originate on the earth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The second thing was that Boeckl was interested in calculating the cosmic
rays exposure ages for these tektites. He wanted to know how long they
had spent in space.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to make the calculations he was trying to make, he had to assume
an initial age for the tektites. His calculations were not terribly sensitive
at all to what he assumed, so he just assumed ten thousand years for his
particular purpose.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I don't know where Morris got a hundred thousand years. That figure
he must have made up. But the fact is that Boeckl's paper wasn't about
the subject Morris claims it was. There was no data in Boeckl's paper that
could be used to calculate the age of the earth or anything else.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The one age that Boeckl was trying to calculate was the residence time
of these objects in space, and that's all. So this is truly misleading
and very unscientific.
<br>&nbsp;</font>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><a name="Page445"><font face="Times New Roman">445</font></a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Doctor Dalrymple, in conclusion, in your professional opinion,
is there any scientific evidence which indicates a relatively recent inception
of the earth?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>There is none whatsoever.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. ENNIS</u>: I have no further questions, Your Honor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: I think we probably ought to recess for the night.
How long do you think your cross examination is going to be?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: Not very long, your Honor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: You are talking about five or ten minutes?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: It will be a little longer. Might take twenty minutes,
or under.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Why don't we wait until tomorrow to do it if you don't
mind.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I found out today that GSA recalculated the cost of driving an automobile,
and it is not twenty-two and a half cents a mile like they were paying
us; it is twenty cents a mile. And you can find some comfort in that, but
I think I am going to protest by quitting early today.</font>

<u>THE COURT</u>: I see you all made it back, and I believe
we are about to begin the cross examination of Doctor Dalrymple.</font>
<center>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">CROSS EXAMINATION</font></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">BY MR. WILLIAMS:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Is constancy of the rate of radioactive decay a requirement
for radiometric dating?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>Yes. It is required that radiometric dating be based on constant
decay rates, at least within limits of significant areas, and what I mean
by that is that if the decay rates were to change a percent or two, that
would probably not significantly alter any of our major conclusions in
geology.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>To the best of your knowledge, has the rate of radioactive
decay always been constant?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>As far as we know from all the evidence we have, it has always
been constant. We have no, either empirical or theoretical reason to believe
it is not.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>So as far as you know, it would have been constant one billion
years ago, the same as it is today.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>As far as we know.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b>Five billion years ago?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b>As far as we know.
<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page450"><font face="Times New Roman">450</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Ten billion years ago?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> As far as we know.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Fifteen billion?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I don't know how far back you want to take this, but I think

for the purposes of geology and the age of the solar system, we are only

interested in using radiometric dating on objects we can possess in our

hand, so we only need to take that back about four and a half or five billion

years.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">I think whether it's been constant fifteen billion years is irrelevant,

we have no way of getting samples that old. We can only sample things that

have been in the solar system.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> How old is the solar system, to the best of your knowledge?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> As far as we know, it is four and a half billion years old.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> The solar system itself?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> The solar system itself. Now, when we talk about the age of

something like the solar system, you have to understand that there was

a finite period of time over which that system formed, and we may be talking

about a period of a few hundred years, so it is not a precise point in

time, but some interval, but compared with the age of the solar system,

it is thought that that interval

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page451"><font face="Times New Roman">451</font></a>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) was probably rather short-a few percent.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Are you aware of when those scientists hypothesized or when

the so-called Big Bang occurred, how many years ago?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No, I am not sure exactly when that was supposed</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Would the rate of radioactive decay have been constant at the

time of the Big Bang?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I am not an astrophysicist. I don't know the conditions that

existed in the so-called primordial bowl of soup, and so I am afraid I

can't answer your question.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> So you don't have any opinion as to whether it was constant

then?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That's out of my field of expertise. I can't even tell you

whether there were atoms in the same sense that we use that term now.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But you did state that it had always been constant as far as

you knew, but now you state you don't know about the Big Bang, whether

it was constant then; is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, what I said, it's been constant within the limits in

which we are interested. For the purposes of radiometric dating it hardly

matters whether it was constant at the moment of the Big Bang. Let me say

this-</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> I don't want to interrupt you.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page452"><font face="Times New Roman">452</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That's all right.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> You say as far as you are concerned, for the purposes of your

concern it has been constant as far as you know, and your purposes go back

to the age of the earth for four point five billion years; is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes, that's correct.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But you base that age of the earth on the assumption or on

this requirement that it has always been constant; is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That is not entirely- That's correct, but it is not an assumption.

It is not fair to calculate it that way. In a certain sense it is an assumption,

but that assumption has also been tested.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, if you look at the ages of the oldest, least disturbed

meteorites, these objects give ages at one point five to four point six

billion years. A variety of different radioactive decay schemes, schemes

it at different half lives. They are based on different elements. They

would not give those identical ages if the rate of decay had been constant.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But do those schemes that you mentioned there rely upon the

requirement that the rate of radioactive decay has always been constant

as well?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes, they do.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> So all methods you know would rely upon this, what

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page453"><font face="Times New Roman">453</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) you termed a requirement and what I termed an assumption;

is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That is correct.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> The rate of decay is a statistical process, is it not? I think

you testified yesterday to that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Basically, it is.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Would you agree that any deviation in the rate of decay would

have to be accompanied by a change in physical laws?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> As far as we know, any change in decay would have to be accompanied

by a change in physical laws, with the exceptions that I mentioned yesterday.

There are small changes known in certain kinds of decay, specifically in

electron capture, a tenth of a percent.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> What do you consider the strongest evidence for the constant

rate of radioactive decay?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I don't think I could give you a single piece of strongest

evidence, but I think the sum total of the evidence, if I can simplify

it, is that rates of decay have been tested in the laboratory and found

to be essentially invariant.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Theory tells us those rates of decay should be invariant. And when we

are able to test those rates of decay on undisturbed systems; that is,

systems that we have good reason to presume have been closed since their

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page454"><font face="Times New Roman">454</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) formation clear back to the oldest objects known

in the solar system, we find we get consistent results using different

decay schemes on isotopes that decay at different rates.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So that is essentially a synopsis of the evidence for constancy of decay.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Did you say- but is it not true that as long- Well, if the

rate of decay has varied and as long as the variation would have been uniform,

would you still get these consistent results?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> It is possible to propose a set of conditions under which you

could get those consistent results.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Excuse me. I didn't understand that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS</u>: I think what he is saying is, is it possible to

vary the decay rate in such a way that you could still get a consistent

set of results by using different decay schemes, and I think it is always

possible to propose such a set of circumstances, yes.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So that question is in the nature of a "what if", and one can always

come to the conclusion that you can restructure science in such a way to

make that "what if" happen. But that is not the sort of thing we usually

do unless we have good reason to presume the physical laws have changed,

and we presume they have not.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is true with things like the speed of light,

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page455"><font face="Times New Roman">455</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: (Continuing) gravitational constant and so forth. May I elaborate

just a little bit more? We are not talking about small changes in decay.

If the creation scientists are correct and the earth is only ten thousand

years old, we are talking about many orders of magnitude, thousands of

times difference. The difference between the age of the earth that scientists

calculate and the age that the creationists calculate are different by

a factor of four hundred and fifty thousand.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So you don't have to perturb the constancy of decay laws a little bit;

you have to perturb them a lot.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: (Continuing)</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Where in Act 590 is the age of the earth listed as ten thousand

years?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> It is not listed as ten thousand years in 590.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> To you, as a geologist, would not an age of several hundred

million years still be relatively recent?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That would be considered on the young side of middle age, yes.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Mr. Williams, while we are on that point, I have really

been curious. What does the State contend a teacher is supposed to interpret

that to mean- "relatively recent"? What is going to be your contention,

if you are a biology teacher and the biology teacher tells the students

about "relatively recent"?

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page456"><font face="Times New Roman">456</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE COURT: (Continuing) What does that mean?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: I think it means a couple of things. First of all,

that there may be some doubt as to the reliability of some of the dating

methods which are currently being used. Therefore, the generally accepted,

as described by Doctor Dalrymple, age of four point five billion years

may not be that certain.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">I think, secondly, our testimony will show that because of this factor

the age of the earth may, in fact, be somewhat younger. The State, I don't

think, is tied to the age of ten thousand years as the plaintiff has tried

to pin on Act 590.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed, the age of the earth is probably, in terms of the overall creation

science model, is probably, I would say, the least important of those.

I am not sure how much the subject would come up in a biology class myself.

I have some questions about it myself.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Apparently the Act directs that it come up. I'm curious

about that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: Well, your Honor, the Act directs that there be

balanced treatment when there is scientific evidence on either side. And

doesn't it require that all-</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: I assume that any biology course will address the

age of the earth in some fashion, and they will, I think, talk about radioactive

decay and that

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page457"><font face="Times New Roman">457</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE COURT: (Continuing) method of aging the world or judging the age of

the world. And I gather the Act also directs the biology teacher to say

something about a relatively recent formation of the earth, and I'm puzzled

as to what the teacher is supposed to say.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A</b>re they supposed to approach it in a negative fashion and say,

"No, it's not four and a half billion years old"? And what if some student

says, "Well, how old is it, then, under this model?" What would they say?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: Well, first of all, let me say that I'm not engaged

in curriculum design or materials design, but as I understand it, I think

that they could say that there are besides this, other sciences, first

of all, who have some doubts as to this dating method. There are other

competent scientists who believe that the earth might be, relatively speaking,

to the four point five billion years, relatively speaking, younger than

that. I don't think there is any one age which anyone would have to be

taught as an alternative age. I think it would be a range of ages.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Well, again, what is that range, then?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: Well, your Honor, I would prefer, if we could,

to defer that to the presentation of our testimony when we will get into

that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Maybe that would be best. It's just

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page458"><font face="Times New Roman">458</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE COURT: (Continuing) something that keeps occurring to me as we listen

to the testimony here.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: (Continuing)</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Mr. Dalrymple, is it correct that you think that geochronology

establishes an age of the earth, not only that the earth is several million

years old, but also establishes the age of the fossils which are enclosed

in the rocks?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes. That's correct.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Is there any reliable method for gauging fossils themselves

that you are aware of?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> You mean dating the fossil specifically?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Yes.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> There is one method, but it does not go back very far, and

that's Carbon-14. The rest of the fossils on the record are done by dating

primarily igneous rocks that are in known relationship to fossils. By an

igneous rock, I mean a rock that's cooled from a melt, like a lava flow

or granite.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> How old would you say that geochronology establishes the ages

of the oldest fossils?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, the oldest fossils that I know of - And I'm not a paleontologist;

I'm going to have to give you a semi-layman's answer - that I know of are

bacteria that are found in certain shales in, I believe, Africa or South

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page459"><font face="Times New Roman">459</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) Africa. And if I remember correctly, those are close

to three billion years old.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> You say you're not a paleontologist and you give a lay answer,

but the method of dating fossils actually relies upon the dating of certain

rocks around the fossil, does it not?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, not necessarily the rocks that actually enclose the fossil,

because most of the dating technicians work on igneous rock or metamorphic

rocks, that is, crystalline rocks in which fossils don't occur.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">But again, to take a simple case, if we had a sedimentary bed that includes

fossils and we have a lava flow beneath that bed and another lava flow

on top of that bed. And if we date those two lava flows, then we have sensibly

dated the age of that fossil, or at least we have bracketed the age of

that fossil.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">That's the general way in which fossils are dated radiometrically.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Now, do you understand that biologists consider these fossils

enclosed in these rocks to be the relics or the remnants of some evolutionary

development?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I think the fossils are relics of an animal.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Would that be the evidence of the evolutionary development?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, as far as I know, yes.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page460"><font face="Times New Roman">460</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Then would it be fair to say in your mind that the ages for the

various types of fossils have been most precisely determined or measured

by radioactive dating or by geochronology?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That sounds like a fair statement.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Since geochronology does play such an important role on the

ages of the rocks and the fossils, would you agree that it would be important

to know whether there is any evidence which exists which would bear on

the fundamental premises of geochronology?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Of course. Let me add that that's a subject that's been discussed

considerably in scientific literature. We're always searching for that

sort of thing. That's a much debated question</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> I think you said yesterday that anyone who believes. in a young

age of the earth, in your opinion, to be not too bright scientifically,

and are in the same category as people who believe that the earth is flat?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes. I think if we are talking about people who profess to

be scientists and insist on ignoring what the actual evidence is for the

age of the earth, then I find it difficult to think that their thought

processes are straight.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Is it true that you do not know of any scientists who would

not agree with you, with your viewpoint on this

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page461"><font face="Times New Roman">461</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) radioactive dating and of the age of the earth and

fossils?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Will you rephrase that? I'm not sure I understand it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Is it true that you stated, I think in your deposition, that

you do not know of any scientist-</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. ENNIS</u>: Excuse me. If you're referring to the deposition,

please identify it, what page.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: I'm not referring to a page at this point, I'm

asking a question.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: (Continuing)</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Is it true that you do not know of any scientist who does not

agree with you and your view point and opinion as to the age of the earth

and the fossils?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> It depends on who you include in the word "scientist". I think

if you want to include people who categorize themselves as creation scientists,

then that would not be a true statement. I know that some of those do not

agree.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As far as my colleagues, geologists, geochemists, geophysicists and

paleontologists, the ones that I know of, I don't know of any who disagree

that the earth is very old or that radiometric dating is not a good way

to date the earth.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Are you aware of any creation scientist, then, who

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page462"><font face="Times New Roman">462</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) has published evidence in the open scientific literature

who has questioned the fundamental premises of geochronology by radioactive

dating?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I know of one.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Who is that?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That's Robert Gentry. I should say that Robert Gentry characterizes

himself as a creation scientist, if I understand what he's written.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Are you familiar with Paul Damon?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes. I know him personally.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Who is Mr. Damon?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Mr. Damon is a professor at the University of Arizona at Tucson.

He specializes in geochronology.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Are you aware that Mr. Damon has stated in a letter that if

Mr. Gentry's work is correct, that it casts in doubt that entire science

of geochronology?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Which letter are you referring to?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Do you recall the letter which you gave to me from <u>EOS</u>

by Mr. Damon?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes. I recall the general nature of that letter.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> And do you recall that Mr. Damon said that if history is correct,

in his deductions it would call up to question the entire science of geochronology?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I think that's the general sense of what Paul Damon said,

but I think it's an overstatement. I'm not

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page463"><font face="Times New Roman">463</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) sure I would agree with him on that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Mr. Damon is not a creation scientist, is he?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No. Doctor Damon is not a creation scientist, by any means.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Would you consider him to be a competent scientist and an authority

in this field?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes. He's extremely competent.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Are you aware as to whether Mr. Gentry has ever offered or

provided a way for his evidence to e falsified?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I am aware that he has proposed one, but I do not think his

proposal would falsify it either one way or the other.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Have you ever made any attempts, experiments that would attempt

to falsify his work?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, there are a great many- I guess you're going to have

to tell me specifically what you mean by "his work". If you could tell

me the specific scientific evidence you're talking about, then let's discuss

that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Well, first of all, do you like to think you keep current on

the scientific literature as it may affect geochronology?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I keep as current as I can. There's a mass amount of

literature. In the building next to my office, there are over two hundred

fifty thousand volumes, mostly on geology. It's extremely difficult to

keep current.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page464"><font face="Times New Roman">464</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) But I am currently relatively up on the mainstream,

anyway.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Certainly the most important points?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I do my best.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> And if someone had issued a study which would, if true, call

up to question the entire science of geochronology, would you not want

to be made aware of that and look at that closely yourself, as an expert

in the field?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Oh, yes, I would.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> And as a matter of fact, your familiarity with Mr. Gentry's

work is limited, is it not, to an article that he wrote in 1972 and a letter

that he wrote in response to Mr. Damon's letter, in terms of what you have

read, is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Those are the things I can recall having read, and the reports

that I have some recollection of. I have never been terribly interested

in radioactive haloes, and I have not followed that work very closely.

And that is the subject upon which Mr. Gentry has done most of his research.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As I think I told you in the deposition, I'm not an expert on that particular

endeavor. I'm aware that Mr. Gentry has issued a challenge, but I think

that challenge is meaningless.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page465"><font face="Times New Roman">465</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Well, let me ask you this. You stated in the deposition,

did you not- Let me ask you the question, can, to your knowledge, granite

be synthesized in a laboratory?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I don't know of anyone who has synthesized a piece of granite

in a laboratory. What relevance does that have to anything?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> I'm asking you the question, can it be done?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, in the future I suspect that it will be done.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> I understand. But you said it has not been done yet?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I'm not aware that it has been done. It's an extremely difficult

technical problem, and that's basically what's behind it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> To the extent that you are familiar with Mr. Gentry's work

and that as you have reviewed it, would you consider him to be a competent

scientist?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I think Mr. Gentry is regarded as a competent scientist within

his field of expertise, yes.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> And you would agree with that?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> From what I've seen, that's a fair assessment of his work,

yes. He's a very, did some very careful measurements, and by and large

he comes to reasonable conclusions, I think, with the possible exception

of what we're hedging around the fringes here, and that is his experiment

to falsify his relatively recent inception of

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page466"><font face="Times New Roman">466</font></a>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) the earth hypothesis. We have not really discussed

what his hypothesis is and what his challenge is, we've sort of beat around

the edges.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Well, you haven't read his articles that he wrote since 1972,

have you?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No. That's true.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> So if his hypothesis were in those articles, you really wouldn't

be able to talk about it, at any rate, would you?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> His hypothesis, I believe, is pretty fairly covered In those

letters between, exchange of letters between Damon and Gentry, and I can

certainly discuss that part.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">That's a very current exchange of letters. It is just a few years old.

And it is in that letter that he throws down to challenge to geology to

prove him wrong. What I'm saying is, that challenge is meaningless.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Are you familiar with his studies of radio haloes?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No, I'm not familiar with that work at all.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But to the extent that work shows that evidence that these

formations are only several thousand years old, you're not familiar with

that?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I'm not familiar with that, and I'm not sure I would accept

your conclusion unless I did look into it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> If you're not familiar with it, I don't want to question you

about something you're not familiar with.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P><a name="Page467"><font face="Times New Roman">467</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Fair enough.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> You have been active, of late, have you not, in trying to formulate

a resolution against creation science in one of the professional societies

to which you belong?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That's true. The American Geophysical Union.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> How do you go about writing that? Did you just sit down and

try to write something yourself?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No. I requested from Bill Mayer copies of the resolutions holding

the teaching of creation science as science in the classroom last March,

so that I could see the general form and tone of resolutions that had already

been passed by other principal scientific societies, including the National

Academy of Sciences. He sent me, I believe, copies of about eight or nine.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And after reading through those, I drafted a proposal which was sent

around to members of the Council of the American Geophysical Union. That

proposal was discussed, the resolution was modified, and a much abbreviated

resolution was adopted Sunday night.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> I think you stated earlier that you reviewed quite a bit of

creation-science literature in preparation for your testimony in this case

and also a case in California, is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes. I think I've read either in whole or in part about two

dozen books and articles.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page468"><font face="Times New Roman">468</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But on the list of books that you made or articles that you have

reviewed, you did not include any of Robert Gentry's work as having been

reviewed, did you?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> That's right. I did not.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Although you consider Gentry to be a creation scientist?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, yes. But, you know, the scientific literature and even

the creation science literature, which I do not consider scientific literature

- It's outside the traditional literature - there is an enormously complex

business. There is a lot of it. And we can't review it all.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Every time I review even a short paper, it takes me several hours to

read it, I have to think about the logic involved in the data, I have to

reread it several times to be sure I understand what the author has said;

I have to go back through the author's references and sometimes read as

many as twenty or thirty papers that the author has referenced to find

out whether what has been referenced is true or makes any sense; I have

to check the calculations to find out if they are correct. It's an enormous

job. And given the limited amount of time that I have to put in on this,

reviewing the creation science literature is not a terribly productive

thing for a scientist to do.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> How many articles or books have you reviewed,

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page469"><font face="Times New Roman">469</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) approximately?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> You mean in creation science literature?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Creation science literature.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I think it was approximately twenty-four or twenty-five, something

like that, as best I can remember. I gave you a complete list, which is

as accurate as I can recall.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> And if there were articles in the open scientific literature

- Excuse me - in referee journals which supported the creation science

model, would that not be something you would want to look at in trying

to review the creation science literature?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes, and I did look at a number of those. And I still found

no evidence.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But you didn't look at any from Mr. Gentry?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No, I did not. That's one I didn't get around to. There's quite

a few others I haven't gotten around to. I probably never will look into

all the creationists literature.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">I can't even look into all the legitimate scientific literature. But

I can go so far as to say that every case that I have looked into in detail

has had very, very serious flaws. And I think I've looked at a representative

sample.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And also in Gentry's work, he's proposed a very tiny

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page470"><font face="Times New Roman">470</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) mystery which is balanced on the other side by an

enormous amount of evidence. And I think it's important to know what the

answer to that little mystery is. But I don't think you can take one little

fact for which we now have no answer, and try to balance, say that equals

a preponderance of evidence on the other side. That's just not quite the

way the scales tip.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> If that tiny mystery, at least by one authority who you acknowledge

his authority, has been said, if correct, call to question the entire science

of geochronology.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, that's what Damon said. And I also said that I did not

agree with Paul Damon in that statement. I think that's an overstatement

of the case by a long way. I think that Paul in that case was engaging

in rhetoric.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> What is your personal belief as to the existence of a God?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I consider my religion a highly personal matter, and

I've never required personally anything other than explaining the world

we see around us by natural events. But I try to remain rather open minded

on the subject.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So I guess at best I can tell you that I have not come to any firm conclusion

that I am not willing to change in the future.</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="pg471"><font face="Times New Roman">471</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) would be something between an agnostic and an atheist;

is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No. I said about halfway between an agnostic and an atheist.

But the reason I said that was because you were trying to get me to label

myself. And I think I also said that I do not label myself. But you were

insistent that I give you some answer on that scale, and I'm afraid that's

the best I can do. I'm not happy with that answer, but I simply can't do

any better.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But you also stated, did you not, that you had not seen any

proof of a God?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I think I did say that. Yes.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Nonetheless, you would agree that a religious person can be

<p><font face="Times New Roman">BY MR. ENNIS:</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Doctor Dalrymple, Mr. Williams asked you about a resolution

of the American Geophysical Union. What is the American Geophysical Union?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> The American Geophysical Union is the largest society of physicists-

Well, let me take that back. I think it's one of the largest societies

of geophysicists

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page472"><font face="Times New Roman">472</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) in North America. The American Society for Exploration

of Geophysicists may be larger. I'm not sure.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It consists of a variety of sections that include scientists working

on geochemistry, seismology, petrology, hydrology, planetology, astronomy,

meteorology, upper atmosphere physics, and so forth. Anything to do with

the physics and chemistry of the earth is included in the American Geophysical

Union.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Mr. Williams brought out on his cross examination that you

had worked on a proposed resolution to be considered by the American Geophysical

Union on this subject, is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes, I have.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> And he brought out that in the course of working on that resolution,

you asked to see if other scientific organizations had adopted resolutions

on teaching of creation science in public schools?</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) letters that appeared, actually three letters that

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It's Volume 60, Number 22; May 29, 1979, page 474. In Mr. Gentry's response

comprehensive theory is concerned, I would replace the once singularity

of the Big Bang with two major cosmos-related singularities (in which I

exclude any implications about extraterrestrial life-related phenomena)

derived from the historic Judeo-Christian ethic, namely the events associated

with (1) the galaxies (including the Milky Way) being Created ex nihilo

by Fiat nearly 6 millennia ago and (2) a later catastrophe which resulted

in a solar system-wide disturbance that was manifested on earth primarily

as a worldwide flood with subsequent crustal adjustments."</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> During cross examination Mr. Williams asked you if Mr. Gentry's

I will explain that. I have it now.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: May I read what you quoted from the newsletter before

you go to that?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Okay, sir.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> The experiment that Doctor Gentry proposed-</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Let me ask you a question. As I understand it, that's

his conclusion. I still don't understand what his theory is.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS</u>: He has proposed that it is either a theory or a

hypothesis that he says can be falsified.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: What's the basis for the proposal? How does he come

up with that?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE WITNESS</u>: Well, basically what he has found is there is a

series of radioactive haloes within minerals in the rocks. Many minerals

like mica include very tiny particles of other minerals that are radioactive,

little crystals of zircon and things like that, that have a lot of uranium

in them.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And as the uranium decays, the alpha particles will not decay, but travel

outward through the mica. And they cause radiation damage in the mica around

the radioactive particle. And the distance that those particles travel

is

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page478"><font face="Times New Roman">478</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: (Continuing) indicated by these radioactive haloes. And that

distance is related directly to the energy of the decay. And from the energy

of

the decay, it is thought that we can identify the isotopes.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">That's the kind of work that Gentry has been doing.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And what he has found is that he has identified certain haloes which

he claims are from Polonium-218. Now, Polonium-218 is one of the isotopes

intermediate in the decay chain between uranium and lead.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Uranium doesn't decay directly from lead. It goes through a whole series

of intermediate products, each of which is radioactive and in turn decays.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Polonium-218 is derived in this occasion from Radon 222. And what he

has found is that the Polonium haloes, and this is what he claims to have

found, are the Polonium-2l8 haloes, but not Radon-222 haloes. And therefore,

he says that the Polonium could not have come from the decay of Radium,

therefore it could not have come from the normal decay change.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And he says, how did it get there? And then he says that the only way

it could have gotten there unsupported Radon-222 decay is to have been

primordial Polonium, that is Polonium that was created at the time the

solar system was created, or the universe.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, the problem with that is Polonium-2l8 has a

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page479"><font face="Times New Roman">479</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: (Continuing) half-life of only about three minutes, I believe

it is. So that if you have a granitic body, a rock that comes from the

melt, that contains this mica, and it cools down, it takes millions of

years for body like that to cool.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So that by the time the body cooled, all the Polonium would have decayed,

since it has an extremely short half-life. Therefore, there would be no

Polonium in the body to cause the Polonium haloes.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So what he is saying, this is primordial Polonium; therefore, the granite

mass in which it occurs could not have cooled slowly; therefore, it must

have been created by fiat, instantly.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And the experiment he has proposed to falsify this is that he says he

will accept this hypothesis as false when somebody can synthesize a piece

of granite in the laboratory.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And I'm claiming that that would be a meaningless experiment.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Does that- I know this is a rather complicated subject.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: I am not sure I understand all of this process. Obviously

I don't understand all of this process, but why don't you go ahead, Mr.

Ennis?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. ENNIS</u>: Yes, your Honor. Obviously, your Honor, these subjects

are somewhat complex, and if the Court has

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page480"><font face="Times New Roman">480</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: (Continuing) additional questions, I'd hope that the Court would

feel free to ask the witness directly.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: (Continuing)</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Why, in your opinion, would the test proposed by Mr. Gentry

not falsify his hypothesis?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Let me read specifically first what his proposal is. He said,

"I would consider my thesis essentially falsified if and when geologists

synthesize a hand-sized specimen of a typical biotite barium granite and/or

a similar sized crystal of biotite."</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And if I understand what he's saying there, he's saying that since his

proposal requires that granite form rapidly, instantly, by instantaneous

creation, that he does not see any evidence that these granites, in fact,

cool slowly; his evidence said they cool rapidly. And he would accept as

evidence if somebody could synthesize a piece of granite in the laboratory.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There are a couple of problems with that. In the first place, we know

that these granites did form slowly from a liquid from the following evidence:

These rocks contain certain kinds of textures which are only found in rocks

that cool from a liquid. And we can observe that in two ways, these textures.

They are called igneous and crystalline textures.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">We can observe these textures by crystallizing compounds

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page481"><font face="Times New Roman">481</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Page is missing.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P><a name="Page482"><font face="Times New Roman">482</font></a>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) a liquid. There is no other way that they could

have formed.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The other problem with Gentry's proposal is that the crystallization

of granite is an enormously difficult technical problem, and that's all

it is. We can't crystallize granite in the laboratory, and he's proposing

a hand-sized specimen. That's something like this, I presume.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first place, the business of crystallizing rocks at temperatures,

most of them crystallize at temperatures between seven hundred and twelve

hundred degrees centigrade. The temperatures are high. And in the case

of granites and metamorphic rocks, sometimes the pressures are high, many

kilobars. So it takes a rather elaborate, sometimes dangerous apparatus

to do this.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And the apparatus is of such a size that usually what we have to crystallize

is very tiny pieces. I don't know of anyone who has developed an apparatus

to crystallize anything that's hand-sized.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So he's thrown down a challenge that's impossible at the moment, within

the limits of the present technical knowledge.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The second thing is that the crystallization of granite, the reason

we have not been able to crystallize even a tiny piece in the laboratory

that I know if, unless there

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page483"><font face="Times New Roman">483</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) has been a recent breakthrough, is essentially an

experimental one. It's a kinetic problem.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Anyone who has tried to grow crystals in a laboratory knows that it's

very difficult to do if you don't seed the melt. That is, you have to start

with some kind of a little tiny crystal to begin with. And when the semi-conductor

industry, for example, grows crystals to use in watches like this, they

always have to start with a little tiny seed crystal. And once you have

that tiny seed crystal, then you can get it to crystallize.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So it's basically a problem of getting the reaction to go, it's a problem

of nucleation, getting it started, and it's a problem of kinetics, getting

the reaction to go on these viscous melts that are very hot under high

pressure.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And what I'm saying is that even if we could crystallize a piece of

hand-sized granite in the laboratory, it would prove nothing. All it would

represent would be a technical breakthrough. All of a sudden scientists

would be able to perform experiments that we cannot now perform.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">But in terms of throwing down a challenge to the age of the earth, that's

a meaningless experiment. So he's thrown down a challenge that has no meaning,

hand-sized crystallized granite. And he's saying, `If you don't meet it,

then I won't accept your evidence.' Well, it's a meaningless challenge.

It's not an experiment.

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page484"><font face="Times New Roman">484</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Doctor Dalrymple, if I understand correctly, Polonium-218 is the

product of the radioactive decay of Radon-222, is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes, that's correct.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> And does Polonium-218 occur through any other process?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Not as far as I know. I suspect you could make it in a nuclear

reactor, but I don't know that. I'm not sure, but I don't think Polonium-2l8

is a product of any other decay chain.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> So if there were Polonium-218 in a rock which did not have

any previous Radon-222 in that rock, then that existence of Polonium-218

would mean that the laws of physics as you understand them would have had

to have been suspended for that Polonium to be there; is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, if that were the case, it might or it might not. But

there are a couple of other possibilities. One is that perhaps Gentry is

mistaken about the halo. It may not have been Polonium-218. The second

one is that it's possible that he's not been able to identify the Radon-222

halo. Maybe it's been erased, and maybe for reasons we don't understand,

it was never created.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why I say It's just a tiny mystery. We have lots of these in

science, little things that we can't quite explain. But we don't throw

those on the scale and

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page485"><font face="Times New Roman">485</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (continuing) claim that they outweigh everything else. That's

simply not a rational way to operate.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">I would be very interested to know what the ultimate solution to this

problem is, and I suspect eventually there will be a natural explanation

found for it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Does Mr. Gentry's data provide scientific evidence from which

you conclude that the earth is relatively young?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I certainly wouldn't reach that conclusion, because that

evidence has to be balanced by everything else we know, and everything

else we know tells us that it's extremely old.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The other thing that I should mention, and I forgot to make this in

my previous point, if I could, and that is that Mr. Gentry seems to be

saying that the crystalline rocks; the basic rocks, the old rocks of the

contents were forms instantaneously. And he uses granite.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">But the thing that he seems to overlook is that not all these old rocks

are granites. In fact, there are lava flows included in those old rocks,

there are sediments included in those old rocks. These sediments were deposited

in oceans, they were deposited in lakes. They are even pre-Cambrian glacial

deposits that tells that the glaciers were on the earth a long, long time

ago.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So it's impossible to characterize all of the old crystalline rocks

as being just granite. Granite is a

<p><font face="Times New Roman">BY MR. WILLIAMS:</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> You state that the challenge which Mr. Gentry has

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page487"><font face="Times New Roman">487</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) issued, if I understand you, is essentially impossible?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> It is presently impossible within our present technical capability.

There have been people working on this, and I suspect someday we'll be

able to do it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Is it not true that you can take a pile of sedimentary rocks

and by applying heat and pressure just simply convert that to something

like a granite?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Something like a granite, yes, that's true. But it's something

like a granite, but they have quite different textures. When you do that,

you now have a metamorphic rock, and it has a different fabric, and it

has a different texture, which is quite distinct from a igneous texture.

They are very easily identified from both a hand specimen and a microscope.

Any third year geology student could tell you if you handle a piece of

rock whether it's igneous or metamorphic. It's a very simple problem.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> But it is quite similar to a granite, but you just can't quite

get it to be a granite, can you?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, granite sort of has two connotations. In the first place,

in the strict sense, granite is a composition only. It's a composition

of an igneous rock. Granite is a word that we use for rock classification.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is also used in a looser sense, and that looser sense

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page488"><font face="Times New Roman">488</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) includes all igneous rocks that cool deep within

the earth. And they would include things like quartz, diorite- I won't

bother to tell you what those are, but they are a range of composition.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes granite is used in that loose sense. People say that the Sierra

Nevada is composed primarily of granite. Well, technically there is no

granite in the Sierra Nevada. They are slightly different compositions.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is also used to describe the compositions of certain types of metamorphic

rocks. So you have to be a little careful when you use the term `granite'

and be sure that we know exactly in what sense we are using that word.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Now, you stated that you think, in trying to explain why Gentry's

theory might not be correct or not that important, you said that perhaps

he misidentified some of the haloes, and I think you also said that perhaps

he had mismeasured something, is that correct?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I think those were the same statement. I'm just offering

that as an alternative hypothesis.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Do you know that's what happened?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Oh, no, no.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> You have not made any of these studies and determined that

yourself, have you?</font>

plaintiffs' witnesses that science is not concerned with where a theory

comes from, a model comes from, it's concerned with whether the data fit

the model. Would you agree with that?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, I think that that sounds like a fair statement, yes.

If you mean by that that we don't really care who proposes it. Is that-

I'm not sure I understand the sense of your question. That's the way I

took it anyway.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you mean that is anyone eligible to propose something like that and

will it be considered?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> Not just who proposes it, but the source from which they get

it or their motivation. Those aren't important. The important thing is

that the data fit what has been proposed.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Well, the motivation might be important. For example, I think

we went over this in the deposition a little bit. You don't just simply

propose a theory. What you really propose is a hypothesis or something

smaller in scale. A: theory only becomes accepted as a theory in the scientific

theory when there is a large amount of evidence - I would characterize

it as a preponderance of evidence - to support that theory.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">That doesn't necessarily mean that it's right. At some time in the future

it may have to be modified. But we

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page490"><font face="Times New Roman">490</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) don't just characterize any idea as a theory. I think

we start with something much less tentative. And even a hypothesis is usually

proposed to explain some set of facts so that- One thing we're not allowed

to do in science is to let any kind of belief or prejudice drive our hypotheses

or theories. We're not supposed to become personally involved in them.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And this is why I say that motivation might be important. We are not

out to prove our personal beliefs. What we're out to do is seek the truth

within the limited framework within which science operates.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So that's why I say that motivation might be important. If someone is

out to prove something for their own benefit, then their motivation might

come into it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> If someone had proposed, for example, a theory or hypothesis

motivated by their own political ideology, would you be concerned about

that, as long as the data fit the hypothesis or the theory?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> I think as long as the data, if it was proposed on a reasonable

basis, on the basis of existing data, then I think in a case like that,

that would be perfectly acceptable. As long as the motivation was truly

divorced from the hypothesis, then I would have no problem with it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> By the way, you differentiated between a hypothesis and a theory.

Is it true that a hypothesis is something

<br>&nbsp;</font>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page491"><font face="Times New Roman">491</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) more tentative, in your mind, and a theory is perhaps

more established, and at some point a theory becomes a fact?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> No, I don't put them together in quite that difference, but

I'll explain to you as best I can what my notion of those terms are.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">I think a fact - facts are data. That's the way I consider facts.
A fact is if we measured the length of this box a number of times and determined

that it's three and a half feet long, then that becomes a relatively indisputable

fact.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a difference, in my mind, between a theory and a hypothesis,

both in scale and in the degree of proof behind it. I think a hypothesis

can be a relatively small thing. We might again hypothesize that this box

is three and a half feet long, and we could test that hypothesis by making

measurements and find out whether that is true or false. That could be

a reasonable hypothesis.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Or it might be bigger. After it become rather firmly established, after

there is a lot of evidence for it, then it is adopted as a theory. And

I think if you look in places like Webster's Dictionary, I think you will

find that there is a distinction made there in the degree of tentativeness.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Theories are fairly firmly established things. Now,

<P>&nbsp;

<P><a name="Page492"><font face="Times New Roman">492</font></a>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> (Continuing) sometimes we find that they are not true and have

to modify them, but there is this degree of scale between hypothesis and

theory.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> For example, Copernicus proposed a theory, did he not-</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. ENNIS</u>: Your Honor, I didn't object earlier to this line of

questioning, but I think it's entirely outside the scope of my redirect

examination.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Well, I don't think it's limited by that, or it wouldn't

be as far as I'm concerned, but where are you going with it?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: Your Honor, I think I'm going, this particular

line of testimony is important to show that there is perhaps not an accord

among even the Plaintiffs' scientists as to what is a fact, what's a theory,

what's a hypothesis.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">And I think it goes to the fact that there is no unanimity on these

things, even among the plaintiffs' own scientists. I think that has some

relevance at least to the argument which the plaintiffs are making as to

whether this is a scientific theory in looking at creation science.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Well, I would take notice that there's probably not

unanimity among all the scientists.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: Fine.</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b> (Continuing) from a National Academy of Science Resolution of

April of 1976, which reads in part: "That the search for knowledge and

understanding of the physical universe and of living things that inhabit

it should be conducted under conditions of intellectual freedom, without

religious, political, or ideological restrictions. That freedom of inquiry

and dissemination of ideas require that those so engaged should be free

to search where their inquiry leads, without political censorship and without

fear of retribution and consequence of unpopularity of their conclusions.

Those who challenge existing theory must be protected from retaliatory

reactions."</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you agree with that statement?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A:</b> Yes, I would subscribe to that.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. WILLIAMS</u>: No further questions.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: May this witness be excused?</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>MR. ENNIS</u>: He may, your Honor.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE COURT</u>: Thank you.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Why don't we take about a ten minute recess.</font>

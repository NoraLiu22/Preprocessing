<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Native American Indian Dolls</H1>

In every culture I am aware of, parents give their children dolls and toys to play with. Native North America was no 
exception, and there are doll-making traditions in many tribes which have survived to this day.

However, the idea of a child's doll as a lasting keepsake is not really traditional in a lot of Indian tribes. 
Dolls were usually made of perishable materials like cornhusk, palmetto fiber</B>, or 
bundled pine needles;</b> even dolls that were made out of wood or leather were not often built 
to last the way adult crafts were. In many tribes it was considered inappropriate to discipline a very young 
child, so they simply weren't given toys they weren't allowed to chew on and throw in the river.
And in some tribes, the impermanence of children's dolls and toys was meaningful to parents--
as corn dolls and other childhood things naturally fell apart with time, it showed that a girl was 
growing up. Even though Native American dolls were not traditionally made to last, they were 
often beautifully adorned with miniature doll clothing and jewelry, beadwork or painting, and animal 
fur or even hair from the mother's head. Because native adornment and decorative patterns are so 
distinctive, handmade Indian dolls are distinctive as well, and today many people, adults
and children alike, like to keep them as cultural collectibles as well as toys.
<BR><BR>
If you are looking to buy a doll that was actually made by Native Americans--either because it's 
important to you to have the real thing or because you want to support native people with your 
purchase--then here is our list of American Indian doll-makers whose crafts are available online. 
Hopefully this can provide you with a good starting point. If you have a website of Indian toys and dolls 
to add to this list, <A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">let us know</A>.
We gladly advertise any individual native artist or native-owned art store here free of charge, 
provided that all dolls were made by tribally recognized American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists.
<BR><BR>
Thank you for your interest in Native American art!

Mayan people from Guatemala make these miniature dolls (no more than an inch high) as a charm to ward
off bad dreams or an evil spirit. According to some versions of the Maya worry doll legend, if you sleep with them
under your pillow they will protect you in your dreams. In other versions of the story, if you tell each worry doll
one of your troubles, the doll will appear in your dream and teach you how to solve it.

organization</a> dedicated to preserving and promoting endangered Native American languages. We are not artists ourselves, so 
if you are interested in buying some of the Indian dolls featured on this page, please contact the artists directly. 
Though we have featured only Native American dolls identified with the name and tribal affiliation of each artist, we haven't 
called the tribal offices to check up on any of them, and we only know a few of them personally. We also don't guarantee any of their products. 
This is not an exhaustive list of American Indian dolls--if you would like us to add your native doll site to this page, please 
<A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">contact us</A> with your URL and tribal affiliation. We advertise any individual native artist or 
native-owned art business here free of charge. We do <U>not</u> link to dolls which are not made by tribally recognized 
American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists, so please do not ask us to. And finally, websites do occasionally expire and change hands, so use 
your common sense and this general rule of thumb<B>:</b> if the creator of each individual artwork is not identified by name and specific tribe, 
you are probably not looking at a genuine Native American Indian doll.

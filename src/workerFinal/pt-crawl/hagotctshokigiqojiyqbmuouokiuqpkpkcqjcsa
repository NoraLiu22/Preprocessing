/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">&nbsp;[[p. 
        141]] </font>The present work will not add to the reputation of the author 
        of &quot;Life and Habit.&quot; It is, nevertheless, an interesting and useful book, 
        inasmuch as it gives a pretty full account of the theories and opinions 
        of several authors whose writings are almost unknown to the present generation 
        of naturalists. The sketch of the lives, and the numerous quotations from 
        the works of the celebrated men named in the title page, are instructive 
        and sometimes amusing. Quotations are also given from Mr. Patrick Matthew, 
        &Eacute;tienne and Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and Herbert Spencer, 
        illustrating their views on evolution, and giving altogether a fair idea 
        of the progress of modern thought on this important subject. But the main 
        object of the book is to show that all these authors have been right, 
        while Mr. Charles Darwin is altogether wrong; and that the works of the 
        former contain a more philosophical, more accurate, and altogether superior 
        view of the nature and causes of evolution in the organic world than those 
        of the latter.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Butler finds 
        in all the writers whose views he advocates, opinions which agree more 
        or less closely with those so ingeniously and forcibly developed by himself, 
        and to which full justice has already been done in the pages of <em>Nature</em> 
        (vol. xix. p. 479). No one can object to his adducing these points of 
        agreement to fortify his own position, or to his arguing that his own 
        hypotheses, thus supported, form an important and even a necessary supplement 
        to the theory advocated by Mr. Darwin. But he goes much further than this, 
        and maintains that the action of external conditions, combined with the 
        desires and habits of animals, are the all-powerful causes of evolution, 
        and that &quot;natural selection,&quot; or &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; is comparatively 
        unimportant, and is quite unworthy of the position given to it by Mr. 
        Darwin and his followers. In doing this he not only falls into much confusion 
        as to the phenomena of variation, but indulges in an amount of petty verbal 
        criticism, quite unworthy of the high reputation established by his previous 
        work; and I believe that naturalists in general will endorse the remark 
        in my review of &quot;Life and Habit&quot; (which Mr. Butler has, apparently under 
        the impression that this volume refutes it, placed in a conspicuous position 
        on the fly-leaf of his book), that &quot;the want of a practical acquaintance 
        with natural history leads the author to take an erroneous view of the 
        bearing of his own theories on those of Mr. Darwin.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing the 
        views and arguments of Buffon, Mr. Butler suggests that the numerous contradictory 
        statements of this eminent writer are due to the necessity he was under 
        of not arousing the enmity of the Church. He therefore adopts the method 
        of directly contradicting himself whenever he has been a little too advanced. 
        Over and over again he points out the evidence of the several families 
        of animals and plants having each had a common ancestor, and he specially 
        mentions the horse and the ass, man and apes, as having been thus derived. 
        But he puts it all hypothetically, and then, to satisfy the Sorbonne and 
        the public, he proceeds thus: &quot;But no! It is certain from revelation that 
        all animals have alike been favoured with the grace of an act of direct 
        creation, and that the first pair of every species issued full formed 
        from the hands of the Creator.&quot; These, and numerous other passages quoted, 
        certainly support the theory that many of Buffon's statements are ironical; 
        and that while himself a firm believer in the development of all organisms 
        from common ancestors, he purposely contradicted himself sufficiently 
        to prevent the suppression of his work as being opposed to religion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most interesting 
        among the quotations from Buffon, however, are those which show how near 
        he was to seizing upon the idea of &quot;selection&quot; as a means of modifying 
        organisms. Thus he says:--&quot;The dog is short-lived; he breeds often and 
        freely; he is perpetually under the eye of man; hence when--by some chance 
        common enough with nature--a variation or special feature has made its 
        appearance, man has tried to perpetuate it by uniting together the individuals 
        in which it has appeared, as people do now who wish to form new breeds 
        of dogs and other animals.&quot; And again, in discussing the origin of our 
        cultivated fruits, &amp;c., he says: &quot;It was only by sowing, tending, 
        and bringing to maturity an almost infinite number of plants of the same 
        kind that he was able to recognise some individuals with fruits sweeter 
        and better than others.&quot; Here he clearly recognises the selection of individual 
        variations as the source of varieties, and the necessity for breeding 
        or growing on a large scale, in order to obtain such individual variations 
        as are required. But he never laid hold of this idea with any firmness; 
        for we find him elsewhere dwelling on the influence of change of climate, 
        food, and treatment, as having produced the changes in domestic animals 
        and cultivated plants; especially change of climate while accompanying 
        man in his migrations, and the action of these changes on habits &quot;influencing 
        their natures, instincts, and most inward qualities.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We next come to 
        Dr. Erasmus Darwin, of whose life, writings, and opinions a very interesting 
        account is given, and who is an especial favourite of Mr. Butler on account 
        of his views as to the transmission of memory and habit from parent to 
        offspring, and as to the existence of sensation and voluntary motion in 
        plants, although he laid more stress on imitation and instruction than 
        on inherited habits, and in this departs widely from Mr. Butler. Dr. Darwin 
        anticipated Lamarck in arguing that the transformations of animals &quot;are 
        in part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires 
        and aversions, of their pleasures and their pains, or of irritation or 
        of associations; and many of these acquired forms or propensities are 
        transmitted to their posterity.&quot; He also had a glimpse of the mode of 
        action of sexual selection; for, speaking of the spurs with which the 
        males of many game birds are armed, and which they use in fighting, he 
        says: &quot;The final cause of this contest among the males seems to be that 
        the strongest and most active animal should propagate the species, which 
        should thence become improved.&quot; We cannot see, however, that he had any 
        clear notion of the general action of the law of the <font color="990000">[[p. 
        142]]</font> survival of the fittest, nor of the important part it necessarily 
        plays in the accumulation and perpetuation of variations, however these 
        may be caused. In this respect he was probably not so enlightened as Buffon.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamarck's writings 
        are very largely quoted and his opinions fully illustrated; and we freely 
        admit with Mr. Butler that, as a thorough and consistent evolutionist, 
        he was not inferior to Mr. Darwin himself. But although he clearly saw 
        the <em>fact</em> of evolution, and almost demonstrated the reality of 
        the fact by a variety of arguments and a wealth of observation, yet, so 
        far from adducing any adequate <em>causes</em> for evolution, he was actually 
        inferior to his predecessors Buffon and Dr. Erasmus Darwin, since he appears 
        to have had no glimpse of the way in which domestic races have actually 
        been produced by human selection, and still less of the action of the 
        law of the survival of the fittest on animals and plants in a state of 
        nature. Everything he imputes to changed conditions and changed habits, 
        developing new desires in animals and inducing new courses of action. 
        He dwells much on the time required for these changes, and considers that 
        we have a practically unlimited amount at our disposal, remarking that 
        &quot;a time infinitely great <em>qua</em> man is still infinitely short <em>qua</em> 
        nature.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamarck is exceedingly 
        vague in his statements as to the cause and mode of change. After describing 
        the different kinds of locomotion, walking, leaping, flying, swimming, 
        and the great need of these powers of movement to most animals, he adds: 
        &quot;Since, then, the power of locomotion was a matter affecting their individual 
        self-preservation, as well as that of their race, the existence of the 
        want led to the means of its being gratified.&quot; He does not seem to have 
        perceived the struggle between individuals of the same species owing to 
        their excessive numbers, but only the struggle between distinct races; 
        as when he says: &quot;The strongest and best armed for attack eat the weaker, 
        and the greater kinds the smaller. Individuals of the same race rarely 
        eat one another; they war only with other races than their own.&quot; He also 
        refers to the excessive multiplication of the smaller kinds of animals, 
        and shows how their numbers are limited, but he never observed that the 
        race was thereby invigorated and might even be modified. He sums up his 
        theory in the following three propositions:--</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;1. That every considerable 
          and sustained change in the surroundings of any animal involves a real 
          change in its needs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;2. That such change of needs 
          involves the necessity of changed action in order to satisfy these needs, 
          and, in consequence, of new habits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;3. It follows that such and 
          such parts, formerly less used, are now more frequently employed, and 
          in consequence become more highly developed; new parts also become insensibly 
          evolved in the creature by its own efforts from within.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These arguments 
        are repeated in a variety of ways, and are applied to explain the origin 
        of all our breeds of dogs and other domestic animals, as well as of all 
        wild species; and he evidently had no notion that though these may be 
        real causes, they would be utterly inadequate to produce any such effects 
        as we see in nature without the accumulating power of natural selection. 
        Mr. Butler, indeed, maintains that this power is implied in Lamarck's 
        reasoning. He maintains &quot;that one of the most important conditions of 
        an animal's life is the relation in which it stands to the other inhabitants 
        of the same neighbourhood--from which the survival of the fittest follows 
        as a self-evident proposition.&quot; And he adds: &quot;Lamarck would not have hesitated 
        to admit that, if animals are modified in a direction which is favourable 
        to them, they will have a better chance of surviving and transmitting 
        their favourable modifications.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is clear 
        that Lamarck neither saw it nor admitted it; and his theory is therefore 
        radically deficient. And he evidently sees this deficiency himself, for 
        he says that frequent crosses with unmodified individuals will destroy 
        the effect produced, and that therefore isolation is necessary.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come next to 
        Mr. Patrick Matthew, who in 1831 put forth his views on the development 
        theory in a work on arboriculture; and we think that most naturalists 
        will be amazed at the range and accuracy of his system, and will give 
        him the highest credit as the first to see the important principles of 
        human and &quot;natural selection,&quot; conformity to conditions, and reversion 
        to ancestral types; and also the unity of life, the varying degrees of 
        individuality, and the continuity of ideas or habits forming an abiding 
        memory, thus combining all the best essential features of the theories 
        put forth by Lamarck, Darwin, and Mr. Butler himself. The following quotations 
        illustrate Mr. Matthews's views:--&quot;As the field of existence is limited 
        and preoccupied, it is only the hardier, more robust, better-suited-to-circumstance 
        individuals who are able to struggle forward to maturity, these inhabiting 
        only the situations to which they have superior adaptation and greater 
        power of occupancy than any other kind; the weaker and less circumstance-suited 
        being prematurely destroyed. This principle is in constant action; it 
        regulates the colour, the figure, the capacities, and instincts; those 
        individuals in each species whose colour and covering are best suited 
        to concealment or protection from enemies, or defence from inclemencies 
        or vicissitudes of climate, whose figure is best accommodated to health, 
        strength, defence, and support; in such immense waste of primary and youthful 
        life those only come forward to maturity from the strict ordeal by which 
        nature tests their adaptation to her standard of perfection and fitness 
        to continue their kind by reproduction.&quot; He then goes on to show how this 
        law tends to the production of almost uniform groups of individuals which 
        we term species, and then adds: &quot;This circumstance-adaptive law operating 
        upon the slight but continued natural disposition to sport in the progeny, 
        does not preclude the supposed influence which volition or sensation may 
        have had over the configuration of the body.&quot; This, he says, is a matter 
        to be inquired into, as well as &quot;its dependency upon the preceding links 
        of the particular chain of life, variety being often merely types or approximations 
        of former parentage; thence the variation of the family as well as of 
        the individual must be embraced by our experiments.&quot; These, and many other 
        passages, show how fully and clearly Mr. Matthew apprehended the theory 
        of natural selection, as well as the existence of more obscure laws of 
        evolution, many years in advance of Mr. Darwin and myself, and in giving 
        almost the whole of what Mr. Matthew has written on the subject Mr. Butler 
        will have helped to call <font color="990000">[[p. 143]]</font> attention 
        to one of the most original thinkers of the first half of the 19th century.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last four chapters 
        of the work are devoted to a critical comparison of the theories of Mr. 
        Darwin with those of Lamarck, Dr. Darwin, and Buffon, greatly to the disadvantage 
        (in Mr. Butler's opinion) of the former. Much of this criticism, however, 
        is merely verbal, and is quite valueless; much of it, also, is founded 
        on a confusion as to the meaning of such terms as &quot;variation&quot; and &quot;variety,&quot; 
        and on an inability to grasp the fact of the extent and universality of 
        the individual variations of organisms; while another portion arises from 
        taking the hypotheses of Lamarck as established facts. Of these several 
        classes of unsound criticism we will give a few examples.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Butler first 
        quotes (p. 339) numerous expressions from the &quot;Origin of Species,&quot; referring 
        to our great ignorance of the laws of variation, and our total ignorance 
        of the cause of each individual difference; and then speaks of Lamarck 
        &quot;having established his principle that sense of need is the main direct 
        cause of variation,&quot; and that variations thus engendered are inherited, 
        which sufficiently accounts for all the facts. If Lamarck had &quot;established&quot; 
        anything of the kind, Mr. Darwin and all evolutionists would certainly 
        have followed him, but he nowhere proves or even attempts to prove his 
        &quot;principle,&quot; but merely states it as an &quot;hypothesis&quot; to account for facts 
        which he saw no other way of explaining. Again, Mr. Butler himself says, 
        that owing to the conditions of life being permanent for long periods--&quot;The 
        thoughts of the creature varying will thus have been turned mainly in 
        one direction for long together; and hence the consequent modifications 
        <em>will also be mainly in fixed and definite directions</em> for many 
        successive generations; as in the direction of a warmer or cooler covering, 
        &amp;c. . . . It is easy to understand the accumulation of slight successive 
        modifications<em> which thus make their appearance in given organs and 
        in a set direction</em>.&quot; The passages which I have italicised look like 
        statements of fact--of what actually occurs; yet no such facts have ever 
        been made known. If the law thus stated had been sufficiently effective 
        to produce any permanent variations, breeders would sometimes have made 
        use of it. Yet they certainly do not do so, whereas they do systematically 
        and very successfully make use of selection. According to the above theory 
        Australian sheep must have their thoughts constantly turned in the direction 
        of less wool owing to the great heat of the climate, and a much larger 
        proportion of each succeeding generation should have thin and scanty fleeces 
        than occurs in England, especially in the tropical colony of Queensland, 
        which, in proportion to its population, produces as much wool as the other 
        colonies. If Mr. Butler could adduce, on good authority, such a fact as 
        this, he would have some evidence in his favour, instead of which he can 
        only make suppositions. The fantail and pouter pigeons, the crested Poland 
        fowls, and all other strange domestic varieties, have been produced by 
        selection of variations or sports which occurred among animals all subject 
        to the same tolerably uniform conditions; while no proof has ever been 
        given that anything more than very slight changes can be produced and 
        perpetrated by change of conditions unaided by some kind of selection.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Butler's want 
        of appreciation of what variation and natural selection really are, is 
        shown by his referring to &quot;the fact that <em>one</em> in a brood or litter, 
        is born fitter for the conditions of existence than its brothers and sisters&quot;--by 
        his continually laying stress upon Mr. Darwin not having shown &quot;how the 
        individual differences first occur&quot;--by his thinking that because natural 
        selection is not the cause of &quot;variation&quot; it is therefore not the cause 
        of &quot;modification&quot; or of a &quot;variety&quot; or &quot;species&quot;--and by his hardly ever 
        referring to the enormous multiplying powers of animals, and the consequent 
        extermination of a much greater number annually than the whole average 
        living population. In my former article on the works of Mr. Murphy and 
        Mr. Butler (<em>Nature</em>, vol. xix. p. 477) I have shown how we may 
        look at the whole population of a species at any given time as divisible, 
        with regard to any one of its characters, into a more and a less developed 
        moiety, and I believe that this mode of viewing the question will at once 
        almost entirely remove the coincident-variation-in-the-right-direction 
        difficulty, which forms the great stumbling-block of almost all the opponents 
        of Mr. Darwin.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty as 
        to the &quot;cause of variation&quot; also disappears from this point of view, for 
        &quot;variation&quot; is seen to be synonymous with &quot;want of perfect identity&quot; between 
        any two organisms, and this is clearly due to the almost infinite complexity 
        of structure and minuteness of parts of all living things and the absolute 
        impossibility that any two can have passed through an identical series 
        of conditions or even had an origin in two identical germs. We see infinite 
        variety arise in the inorganic world where there is a far less complexity 
        of structure or variety of conditions. Even among the sands on the sea-shore 
        no two grains are probably so nearly identical that a good microscopist 
        could not detect a difference; while it is certain that nowhere in the 
        world are there two hills or two rivers with any approach to complete 
        similarity, though the entire process by which many of them have been 
        produced must have often been almost identical. Variation, such as <em>always</em> 
        occurs between the individuals of a species, is therefore an ultimate 
        fact of nature which wants no further explanation than that we cannot 
        even conceive it to be otherwise. We may indeed conceive more likeness 
        on the average than actually exists, but we cannot really conceive of 
        <em>perfect identity</em> between individuals formed and developed as 
        are animals and plants. We may, on the other hand, seek for the causes 
        of unusual or abnormal variation, and Mr. Darwin has suggested several. 
        It is quite possible that those suggested by Lamarck and Mr. Butler may 
        also be real causes, but they have certainly not been proved to be so; 
        and even if they had they would not in the least affect the law of natural 
        selection which <em>accumulates and perpetuates variations</em>, however 
        they may have been produced.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous verbal 
        criticisms or quibbles in which Mr. Butler indulges are quite unworthy 
        of his subject. When Mr. Darwin says, &quot;Variation will cause the slight 
        alterations,&quot; Mr. Butler remarks that this is the same as saying &quot;Variation 
        will cause the variations.&quot; Again, Mr. Butler maintains that the term 
        &quot;conditions of existence&quot; is identical with or includes &quot;survival of the 
        fittest,&quot; which is identical with &quot;natural selection.&quot; Therefore, when 
        Mr. Darwin says &quot;natural selection is <font color="990000">[[p. 144]]</font> 
        the main but not the exclusive means of modification,&quot; he must mean &quot;the 
        conditions of existence are the main,&quot; &amp;c., &amp;c.; therefore he 
        really agrees with Lamarck, whose opinions he has called &quot;erroneous!&quot; 
        Again, because Mr. Darwin has once used the term <em>nature</em>, metaphorically, 
        for natural selection, our author seizes hold of it for a little ridicule, 
        thus: &quot;When, therefore, Mr. Darwin says that natural selection is the 
        most important, but not the exclusive means whereby any modification has 
        been effected, he is really saying that nature is the most important means 
        of modification--which is only another way of telling us that variation 
        causes variations, and is all very true as far as it goes.&quot; In the same 
        style the use of the term &quot;by <em>means</em> of natural selection&quot; is 
        criticised, and the use of &quot;natural selection&quot; at all, when &quot;survival 
        of the fittest&quot; is admitted to be a more accurate term; and Mr. Butler 
        seems to think that if the latter term were always used, a great deal 
        of the force of Mr. Darwin's arguments would be lost. I venture to assert, 
        however, that every argument can be stated with equal accuracy and effect, 
        using only &quot;survival of the fittest;&quot; but there is this great advantage 
        in using the term &quot;natural selection,&quot; that it keeps before the mind the 
        striking analogy and almost identity between the action of man and of 
        nature in modifying species, an identity that was never seen by any of 
        the older writers, but which was first clearly apprehended by Mr. Patrick 
        Matthew, and first fully worked out by Mr. Darwin himself.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last chapter 
        Mr. Butler takes the celebrated case of the Madeira wingless beetles to 
        test the respective theories of Lamarck and Charles Darwin, and he could 
        hardly have made a more unfortunate choice. According to Lamarck, he says, 
        when a beetle found the wind taking it in a wrong direction, <em>which 
        it knew would be fatal to it</em>, it ceased flying, and thus, by long-continued 
        disuse, gradually lost its wings. Here we have the assumption that such 
        insects as beetles know beforehand that if blown out to sea they will 
        be drowned, an assumption for which not one particle of evidence is adduced, 
        while, as every entomologist knows, pages might be filled with facts proving 
        that insects of various orders do not possess any knowledge of the kind, 
        but year after year go recklessly to their death by myriads.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly less weak 
        than this statement of the Lamarckian theory is the objection to that 
        of Mr. Darwin, which is as follows:--&quot;For Mr. Darwin cannot mean that 
        the fact of some beetles being blown out to sea is the most important 
        means whereby other beetles come to have smaller wings--that the Madeira 
        beetles, in fact, come to have smaller wings, mainly because their large-winged 
        uncles and aunts go away.&quot; Though Mr. Butler has tried to put this so 
        as to look like an absurdity, it is strange that he cannot see that it 
        contains an important truth. If the &quot;large-winged&quot; beetles go away, the 
        small-winged remains to breed, and each succeeding generation will have, 
        on the average, smaller wings than the last; and if, so long as any fly 
        at all, the larger-winged continue to &quot;go away,&quot; at last none will fly, 
        and then, the wings being unused, will become abortive and rudimentary. 
        As a crucial case, and to compare the power of the two theories as agents 
        of change, let us suppose them both applied to the human inhabitants of 
        Britain. First we will suppose all the men and women above the average 
        height to go away year by year to Australia or elsewhere, while those 
        under the average height remained. Does Mr. Butler doubt that at the end 
        of, say, ten generations, the average height of English men and women 
        would have been considerably reduced? This would be selection pure and 
        simple. Now for the Lamarckian theory. Let all the people be taught (and 
        believe) that to be short is to be beautiful and virtuous, and let all 
        doors and all public vehicles be made low to suit short people and inconvenience 
        tall ones, and moreover, let short people alone be eligible for a number 
        of posts of honour and dignity, there would thus be created a general 
        desire to be short oneself and to have short children, and the Lamarckian 
        principle would be brought fairly into play. Now supposing that no artificial 
        selection of any kind was practised, and that, owing to the prevalence 
        of high moral principle, the health, lives, and affections of tall people 
        were valued and cared for as much as those of their more favoured short 
        fellow-countrymen, does Mr. Butler seriously maintain that at the end 
        of ten generations any perceptible effect would be produced on the average 
        height of the people; or that anything like the same amount of effect 
        would be produced as by the other experiment? But if not, then &quot;selection,&quot; 
        whether natural or artificial, is the <em>main cause</em> or <em>means</em> 
        of modification; the plain reason being that it accumulates differences 
        which actually exist, whereas, by the other mode, you must produce an 
        increase or diminution of these differences by causes which have not been 
        proved to act at all, and which, even if they do produce any effect, can 
        only do so with extreme slowness.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, then, 
        we may admit the possibility that the causes of variation adduced by Lamarck, 
        as well as those so well set forth by Mr. Butler in his &quot;Life and Habit,&quot; 
        are real causes; we may further admit that some or all of these causes 
        are essential to the origin and development of the more important organs 
        of animals, and that they constitute the chief supplementary agencies 
        the existence of which Mr. Darwin himself recognises; but, even admitting 
        all this, we still maintain that they would be all powerless to effect 
        great or permanent modifications without the accumulating action of natural 
        selection, which may therefore be truly described as the &quot;means&quot; by which 
        alone the &quot;origin of species&quot; has been actually brought about.</p>

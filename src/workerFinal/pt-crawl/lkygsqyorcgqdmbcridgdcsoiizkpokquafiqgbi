<p align="left">
The January 2007 <i>D-Lib Magazine</i> editorial alerted <i>D-Lib</i> readers to the funding issues the magazine faced that might have forced it to suspend or discontinue publication. It was also announced in the editorial that to cut costs, the frequency of publication of <i>D-Lib Magazine</i> would need to be reduced from eleven issues per year to a bimonthly schedule of dissemination. 
</p>

<p align="left">
It would be wonderful to be able to report that funding problems for <i>D-Lib Magazine</i> have been solved; however, finding a satisfactory long-term business model for sustaining <i>D-Lib</i> remains a goal rather than an accomplishment. Nevertheless, while attaining that goal cannot be described as a <i>fait accompli</i>, attaining it <i>is</i> possible &#150; thanks to the support we have received over the past eleven months from a diverse group of organizations that recognize the value of <i>D-Lib Magazine</i> to the digital library community worldwide.
</p>

<p align="left">
These organizations have become participants in the D-Lib Alliance, and their financial contributions have enabled <i>D-Lib</i> to continue publication on a bimonthly basis. The organizations participating in the D-Lib Alliance to date include (in alphabetical order):
</p>

<blockquote>
Australian National University<br>
Center for Computing in the Humanities, King's College<br>
Columbia University Libraries<br> 
Corporation for National Research Initiatives<br>
CrossRef<br>
EMC Corporation<br>
Ex Libris<br>
Florida Center for Library Automation<br>
Harvard University Library<br>
King's Digital Consultancy Services<br>
Nanyang Technological University<br>
National Library of New Zealand<br>
Rutgers University Libraries<br>
Syracuse University Libraries<br>
The Business Glossary<br>
University Libraries of Notre Dame<br>
University of California San Diego Libraries<br>
University of Maryland Libraries<br>
University of Pittsburgh University Library System<br>
University of Washington Libraries</blockquote>

In addition, late in 2007 SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) provided in kind services in the form of consulting regarding business models that might, in time, enable <i>D-Lib Magazine</i> to become fully self-supporting. Over the course of this year we plan to try some of the things the consultant suggested to see if they can produce sufficient funds to sustain the magazine over the long term and at the same time, fit within our stated aim to continue providing open access to <i>D-Lib Magazine</i> content. 
</p>

<p align="left">
We at <i>D-Lib</i> are very pleased at the response we have received thus far and are grateful for the support of the D-Lib Alliance and SPARC, as well as the Corporation for National Research Initiatives for its continuing substantial financial and technical support. We also invite and encourage other organizations to join the D-Lib Alliance so that we can continue to make <i>D-Lib Magazine</i> freely available to readers around the world.

Qualifications for this distinction are at least ten years of professional practice and five years of significant performance as exemplified by substantial engineering responsibility or achievement, publication of engineering and technical papers, books or inventions, and the development and teaching of engineering courses.<br />
<br />
<b>Todd Brun </b>joined USC in 2003, and is now associate professor and associate department chair of the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems.&nbsp; He also has joint appointments in computer science and physics.<br />
<br />
His technical field is in quantum communications, quantum computation and quantum information processing (QIP) in general.&nbsp; These emerging fields have many applications in secure communications and in solving computationally difficult problems more efficiently than conventional computers.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Brun has several novel accomplishments in the field of QIP, including: modeling and simulation of proposed experiments to explore the practicality and applicability of QIP theories; development of new communication protocols for QIP that use quantum entanglement principles and quantum walks as an encoding procedure; determining the effect of decoherence (noise effects) on these protocols; and addressing basic questions in QIP theory, including the notion of quantum state as an indicator of information state or physical reality.&nbsp; He has been a keynote or plenary speaker at many major conferences and workshops, and has won a number of awards including: a National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award and a USC Zumberge Grant for Innovation. <br />
<br />
<b>Krishna Nayak</b> joined the Ming Hsieh Electrical Engineering-Systems faculty in 2003 as assistant professor.&nbsp; He also has joint appointments in the USC Department of Medicine (Radiology) and Biomedical Engineering.<br />
<br />
Nayak's area of study is in the broad field of biomedical imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&nbsp; His research concentrates on several related themes, including: novel signal processing methods to improve image quality (resolution and signal-to-noise ratio) by compensating for high-order physical defects in the scanning systems); improving the speed and efficiency of reconstruction algorithms (for real-time video imaging of moving components of the cardiovascular system (heart, blood vessels, blood flow); and extending the applicability of MRI (developing new imaging techniques that produce high quality images without requiring invasive contrast agents).&nbsp; <span style="display: block;">

He has also developed new applications of MRI, including: real-time imaging of the human vocal tract and upper airway for research in sleep apnea and vocal system modeling; new imaging techniques of the coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion for understanding blood flow dynamics near atherosclerotic plaques; and techniques to quantify body fat distribution for studies of obesity and the regulation of fat accumulation.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Nayak has received several awards, including the USC Mellon Mentoring Award for Faculty Mentoring of Graduate Students, and the Viterbi School of Engineering Outstanding Junior Faculty Research Award in 2007.&nbsp; He also was a best paper finalist in two conference presentations. <br />
<br />
<b>Michael Neely</b> joined the Ming Hsieh Electrical Engineering-Systems faculty in 2004 as assistant&nbsp; professor, and is&nbsp; a member of the Communications Sciences Institute (CSI) within the department.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Neely's research interests are in the areas of stochastic optimization and queueing theory, with applications to resource allocation and scheduling in wireless networks, ad-hoc networks, networks with mobile nodes, sensor systems, and satellite communications.&nbsp; His recent work concerns the analysis and control of delay in stochastic data networks.&nbsp; While algorithms to optimize energy use and throughput in networks have been studied, little work has been done on the optimization of delay (the most important parameter to the average user) due to the complex models that must be employed.&nbsp; <span style="display: block;">

</span><br />
<br />
Neely&rsquo;s novel approach recognizes that the solution of these difficult problems is related to optimization techniques applied to a different set of problems.&nbsp; From this, energy-delay and utility-delay bounds, and adaptive, low complexity procedures to achieve them can be obtained. He was recently awarded a Faculty Early Career Development (Career) grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support research on these topics.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>Kostas Psounis</b> was appointed to the Ming Hsieh Electrical Engineering-Systems faculty in 2003 as assistant professor.&nbsp; He also has a joint appointment in the USC Department of Computer Science.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Psounis' research is on the mathematical foundations and theory of networks, including performance analysis, as well as more applied studies of protocol implementation and system specification.&nbsp; He is known for his work on routing techniques for networks with&nbsp; intermittent connectivity (such as mobile networks) that achieve near-optimal performance while avoiding excessive network loading and resource use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Psounis also studies the optimal performance limits of static multi-hop wireless networks that pass messages through multiple nodes, and has developed rate control and scheduling techniques for efficient use of their available resources.&nbsp; A final topic is on downscaling techniques for modeling the behavior of large very complex networks (such as the Internet, or other wireless and telecomm networks).&nbsp; <span style="display: block;">

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United <a aria-label="Definitions - States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=20-USC-80204913-1611298790&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">States</a> of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Section</span> 1. Policy. Nearly 14 million students in our Nation’s public elementary and secondary school system and nearly 4 million students in post-secondary education are Hispanic. Hispanic students constitute more than 27 percent of all pre-kindergarten through 12th grade students and nearly 20 percent of college students. The Nation’s future prosperity and global leadership across industries is therefore tied to the success of Hispanic and Latino students, and their success is a priority of my Administration.</p>
<p>From advancements in science and civil and labor rights to leadership in government, advocacy, entrepreneurship, and business, the Hispanic community has had a profound and positive impact on our schools, our communities, our economy, and our Nation. Hispanic and Latino communities encompass many racial and cultural identities that span the globe. The diversity of Hispanic and Latino students makes our classrooms across the country rich learning environments. It is important to ensure that from early childhood to higher education, Hispanic and Latino students, including Dreamers, can reach their highest potential. For many Hispanic and Latino students, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) provide critical pathways to opportunity, and hundreds of HSIs across our Nation are advancing intergenerational mobility, success, and opportunity.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hispanic and Latino students face systemic inequitable barriers in accessing a high-quality education and a fair shot at the American dream. Only 40 percent of Latino children participate in preschool education programs as compared to 53 percent of their White peers. Due to systemic and historical inequities faced in the classroom, the high school graduation rate for Hispanic students is below the national average. Hispanic students are underrepresented in advanced courses in mathematics and science, and they can face language barriers in the classroom. Only 19 percent of Latino adults have at least a bachelor’s degree compared with 1 in 3 overall, and just 6 percent have completed graduate or professional degree programs, versus 13 percent nationally. Further, the lack of availability of adult continuing education courses makes it difficult for many Hispanic adults to further their education. In addition, barriers to equity in education can compound and intersect for Hispanic and Latino students who are women and girls, LGBTQ+ individuals, English language learners, and individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>The COVID–19 pandemic has laid bare and exacerbated many of these inequities. Hispanic and Latino students are more likely than their White peers to experience remote learning arrangements, yet they have less access to the tools necessary to succeed, such as broadband and computer access. Hispanic women have been adversely impacted by job loss, a lack of access to child care, and the inability to provide care, in greater numbers than their White counterparts. These and pre-existing disparities have led to declines in student achievement for Hispanic students. Latino students—once the fastest-growing group of undergraduates in the United <a aria-label="Definitions - States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=20-USC-80204913-1611298790&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">States</a>—have seen a decline in undergraduate college attendance amidst the COVID–19 pandemic. It is a priority of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID–19, and to provide Hispanic and Latino students with a successful return to the classroom.</p>
<p>These barriers exist not simply in the classroom, but also in the workplace. Hispanic workers are overrepresented in industries that have been hit hardest by the COVID–19 pandemic, and they have faced disproportionate losses in employment. Hispanic and Latino workers often face discrimination in hiring, pay, and consideration for promotions among other challenges. They need greater access to work-based learning opportunities such as mentorships, internships, and registered apprenticeships that not only guide employment seekers to a career, but provide the experience needed to secure well-paying jobs.</p>
<p>To ensure that our Nation reaches the ambitious goals we have set for our economy to thrive, as well as to ensure equal access to opportunity for all, we must enable Hispanic and Latino students to reach their highest potential through our Nation’s schools and institutions of higher education. The Federal Government must also collaborate with Hispanic and Latino communities to ensure their long-term success.</p>
<p>It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Hispanic communities from early childhood until their chosen career.</p>

<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Section</span> 1. Policy. Educational opportunity is a fundamental element of the American promise. The United<a aria-label="Definitions -  States " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=20-USC-80204913-1611298790&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> States </a>Supreme Court recognized in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education that education “is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.” In the decades since, our Nation has made progress in advancing equality and fairness in our schools, and the achievements, talents, and tenacity of Black students, educators, families, and scholars make our Nation’s schools and communities stronger for all Americans. Black students are thriving in schools across the country, inside the classroom—as valedictorians and award-winning scientists—and outside of it, including in debate, athletics, student government, and national spelling bees, among many other areas.</p>
<p>Over the course of America’s history, Black Americans have helped to build, strengthen, and lead our Nation towards becoming a more perfect Union. Although for far too long, Black Americans were denied even the most basic access to education, the vital contributions of Black Americans in the fields of science, academia, business, and public service, among others, are a testament to the resilience of Black Americans and the steps our Nation has taken to expand access to education and opportunity.</p>
<p>In spite of this progress, entrenched disparities continue to plague America’s education system, holding far too many Black students back from achieving their full potential. Because of persistent racial and systemic injustices in our Nation, Black students remain more likely to attend high-poverty and racially segregated schools than White students. Black students are inequitably disciplined and suspended from school at disproportionately higher rates than White students for similar offenses. In addition, Black students too often face limited access to advanced and college-preparatory courses. Systemic racial disparities in education negatively impact learning outcomes for Black students and many face persistent gaps in reading and mathematics achievement. Studies show that school districts with high concentrations of Black students are much more likely to be underfunded than districts where a majority of students are White, and face much wider funding gaps, with an average deficit of more than $5,000 per student. Black students are still below the national average for educational attainment in high school, and that gap is even higher for college attainment rates, as 26 percent of Black Americans ages 25 and older have attained a bachelor’s degree, while the national average is 36 percent. Black students also face unique challenges at the intersection of race and gender. Barriers to equity in education can compound for Black students who are also LGBTQ+ students, English-language learners, Dreamers, or students with disabilities.</p>
<p>These disparities result in long-standing college and postsecondary educational attainment gaps that affect life outcomes and access to opportunities. Although student populations are becoming increasingly diverse, Black teachers remain significantly underrepresented in our Nation’s classrooms. Educational inequities have only widened throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, as Black students are more likely to experience remote learning challenges and greater learning loss as compared to their White peers. The persistent digital divide faced by some Black students has contributed to this disparity. It is a priority of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID–19, and to provide all students with a successful return to the classroom.</p>
<p>In the face of these historic and present-day inequities in our Nation’s schools, Black students continue to persevere. Black students and scholars today are breaking the barriers confronted by generations who came before. Our Nation’s schools and communities are irrefutably strengthened by the success, scholarship, and tenacity of Black students of all ages. But our Nation must go further to finally root out systemic barriers in our schools.</p>
<p>Additionally, these barriers are present not just in the classroom, but also in the workplace. Black Americans face systemic obstacles to getting good jobs, gaps in wages and promotion, and higher incidences of reported workplace discrimination than White workers. Eliminating these inequities requires expanding access to work-based learning and leadership opportunities, including mentorships, sponsorships, internships, and registered apprenticeships that provide not only career guidance, but also the experience needed to navigate and excel in successful careers. In order for our Nation to equitably recover from the COVID–19 crisis, and to ensure that every Black person in America has a fair shot at the American dream, we must advance equity and excellence in public education and access to economic opportunities.</p>
<p>It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Black Americans and communities from early childhood until their chosen career.</p>

<p>Over the course of my Administration, we have made consistent progress on important goals such as reducing high school dropout rates and lowering unemployment and crime. Yet as the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/congress" occur="3" src="named_federal_agencies">Congress</span>,<a aria-label="Definitions -  State " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=20-USC-80204913-1611298790&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> State </a>and local governments, research institutions, and leading private-sector organizations have all recognized, persistent gaps in employment, educational outcomes, and career skills remain for many boys and young men of color throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Many boys and young men of color will arrive at kindergarten less prepared than their peers in early language and literacy skills, leaving them less likely to finish school. Labor-force participation rates for young men of color have dropped, and far too many lack the skills they need to succeed. The disproportionate number of African American and Hispanic young men who are unemployed or involved in the criminal justice system undermines family and community stability and is a drag on <a aria-label="Definitions - State" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=20-USC-80204913-1611298790&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">State</a> and Federal budgets. And, young men of color are far more likely to be victims of murder than their white peers, accounting for almost half of the country’s murder victims each year. These outcomes are troubling, and they represent only a portion of the social and economic cost to our Nation when the full potential of so many boys and young men is left unrealized.</p>
<p>By focusing on the critical challenges, risk factors, and opportunities for boys and young men of color at key life stages, we can improve their long-term outcomes and ability to contribute to the Nation’s competiveness, economic mobility and growth, and civil society. Unlocking their full potential will benefit not only them, but all Americans.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am establishing the Task Force on Improving the Lives of Boys and Young Men of Color and Underserved Youth, an interagency effort to improve measurably the expected educational and life outcomes for and address the persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color. The Task Force will help us determine the public and private efforts that are working and how to expand upon them, how the Federal Government’s own policies and programs can better support these efforts, and how to better involve <a aria-label="Definitions - State" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=20-USC-80204913-1611298790&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">State</a> and local officials, the private sector, and the philanthropic community.</p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United <a aria-label="Definitions - States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=20-USC-80204913-1611298790&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">States</a> of America, I hereby direct the following:</p>

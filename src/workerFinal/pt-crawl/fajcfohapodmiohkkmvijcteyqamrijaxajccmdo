<h1>History of Compact Cassette:</h1>

The Compact Cassette is a plastic case containing a spool of 3.81 mm magnetic 
tape spooled between two reels. The tape is run at a rate of 4.76 cm/second. 
A tape head in the tape player or deck, in contact with an exposed portion 
of the tape, interprets an analog signal from the tape's magnetic surface.

When Poulsen's patent expired in 1918, Germany led efforts to improved magnetic recording. 
Between 1920 and 1945 series of machines using wire and steel tape were developed (Germany, UK and Japan).

In summer of 1938 BASF introduced the gamma ferric oxide tape, &gamma;-Fe2O3,

dating back to a 1935 BASF patent. It was not until thirty years later, in 1971
with chromium dioxide tape, that anything fundamentally
better would replace it. 
The &gamma;-Fe2O3 magnetic particles
were considerably smaller than the original Fe3O4
formulation, which resisted erasing by the permanent
magnet erase heads then in use. With DC-bias AEG Magnetophons,
the new tape achieved a signal-to-noise
ratio of little more than 40 dB and a frequency response
remaining 50 Hz to 5 kHz.

The marketing in USA and Europe had learned that home tape recording was a very 
attractive function for consumers, but that reel-to-reel would never exceed the 
very limited market of those who have technical skills.
Consequently, from around the mid 1950s trials to get the tape in one or another case started
(Tefi cassette for Tefifon in 1955, Dictet cassette for Dictaphone in 1957, Saba cassette for Sabamobile in 1958).
Below we present the most successful attempts.




<h2>Cartridges and Cassettes (1958-65)</h2>

Launch of tape cartridges by RCA spurred companies worldwide into developing tape cartridges, 
cassettes and "magazine tapes" under various names and based on different standards. The common 
feature of these products was, unlike manually threaded reel-to-reel systems, simply inserting 
the encased tape into a tape player and pressing a button could operate the new systems. People without 
technical backgrounds could operate it very easily. Naturally, the machine itself could also be miniaturized.

			  <b> RCA cartridge.</b> It was the first attempt to put reel-to-reel tape in cartridge form. 
			  Dimensions: 5 x 7 1/8 x 1/2 inches (127 x 197 x 13 mm). The cartridges were reversible 
			  and either side could be played. Tape speed was either 3.75 ips resulting in 30 minutes 
			  of audio on 0.25 inch tape or 1 7/8 ips selected by a small lever.
			  RCA Records made an early attempt at making this a popular pre-recorded music format. 
			  However it turned out to be a major "Flop" in that regard. Cartridges would have prices
			  ranging from $4.95 for a 20 minute tape to $9.95 for an hour
			  RCA was slow to produce machines for the home market and to license recorded music, 
			  and the format disappeared from the market by 1964.

			  It will be used until the late 1990s and is on the direct path 
			  to the first popular consumer tape format.
			  It was originally a 1/4-inch-wide (6.4 mm) audio recording tape, two-track format at 7.5 ips.
			  Fidelipac cartridge was later adapted by Earl "Madman" Muntz in 1962 for his <b>Stereo-Pak</b> cartridge system (run at 3.75 ips).
			  Muntz also sold a library of 3000 titles licensed from 40 record companies.

<h2>The King emerge: Compact Cassette</h2>

<p>
The rather stiff license fees demanded by the creators were the 
reasons why Philips and Grundig decided to jointly develop a "Euro" cartridge system. 
The cooperation did not last long and Philips 
introduced a prototype in Europe in August 1963 (at the Berlin Radio Show).
Scarcely any product has drawn more attention of Japanese industry visitors 
then the Philips cassette. No doubt it was the most photographed product of that event. 
</p>

<p>
When the cassette was developed there were only three tapes in the world which enabled 
Philips to get it right, 3M's low-noise cartridge tape, KODAK's triple-play tape P 300 
and BASF's PES-18. Of these only BASF tape was perfectly balanced in all its properties, 
in particular also the mechanical characteristics. Consequently, BASF had the honor 
to make the very first tapes for the compact cassette.
</p>

<p>
Grundig was preparing war against the Philips compact cassettes. In 1965 during 
Berlin Exhibition together with Telefunken and Blaupunkt they introduced "DC-International" 
cassette system and planned not to ask any license fees. Philips wanted the common 
license fee for hardware, nothing for music cassettes.
</p>

<p>
One day in September 1963, at the opening of the Berlin IFA Exhibition, Fredrich Lachner of 
the German company Grundig proposed to Ohga that the two companies cooperate in developing 
a DC International Standard for cassette tapes, a standard conceived by three German manufacturers. 
While Ohga considered this possibility, another proposal came from Wisse Dekker, manager 
of the Philips Electronics Far East Division and later president, and L.F. Ottens, a technical 
expert also from Philips. They came to Japan and proposed the co-development of the compact 
cassette to Ohga. Philips had already developed a compact cassette in 1963. The advantages 
of both the Grundig and Philips formats were weighed and considered. In the end, Ohga chose 
the Philips compact cassette because of its smaller size.
</p>

<p>
A problem over royalties arose during the contract stage. Philips 
initially suggested that it receive a payment of 25 yen for each unit sold by 
companies in Japan. Ohga thought this was excessive and did not agree to it. 
A few days later, Philips showed some flexibility and asked for 6 yen per unit, a 
figure it said other companies had agreed to. Masanobu Tada, Operations Division manager, 
recommended that Sony accept the offer, but Ohga still refused, insisting that 
unless Philips waived royalties altogether, Sony would collaborate with Grundig. 
Finally, Philips agreed to waive royalties, but did not give Sony exclusive rights 
to the technology. In 1965, based on a patent that guaranteed compatibility, Philips 
made the technology available free of charge to manufacturers all over the world. 
</p>

<p>
During first two years everybody has its own name. Sometimes cartridge, sometimes cassette. 
A uniform name was necessary. The result is well known. Since 1965 the cassette carries 
the name compact cassette.
</p>


<h2>The reign: Compact Cassette (1965-90)</h2>

The Compact Cassette format initially offered fairly poor fidelity and was marketed 
for voice recording and dictation. Technology improved quickly, and advances 
in noise reduction technology, its ability to play stereo tapes, and new tape 
formulations soon assured high-quality sound from the compact format.
Here we present the milestones in Compact Cassette development:

Over the years the improvement of tape itself and better shells made compact cassettes high fidelity source.
Advances have been made in all areas of compact cassette manufacturer, from the magnetic particles of the tape itself,
to the material used to bind material in place and to the cassette shell itself. TDK says it has reduced
particle size by almost a factor of 10 over the years, while magnetic energy of each particle has almost doubled.

Unfortunatelly it was a start of a decline as CD start taking over. It was just cheaper to produce good sounding
CD and CD player then cassette deck and compact cassette. The sales declined but they well still high for 10 or so years.
The global sale of blank cassettes in 1996 was 2.098 billion pieces. In 1997 this decreased by 4.5% to 2.003 billion.

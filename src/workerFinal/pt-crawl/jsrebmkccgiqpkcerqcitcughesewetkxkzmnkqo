Private property, including intellectual property, is essential to our way of life. It provides an incentive for investment and innovation; it stimulates the flourishing of our culture; it protects the moral entitlements of people to the fruits of their labors. But reducing too much to private property can be bad medicine. Private land, for instance, is far more useful if separated from other private land by public streets, roads and highways. Public parks, utility rights-of-way and sewers reduce the amount of land in private hands, but vastly enhance the value of the property that remains. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="21" id="pa21"> So too it is with intellectual property. Overprotecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it. Creativity is impossible without a rich public domain. Nothing today, likely nothing since we tamed fire, is genuinely new: Culture, like science and technology, grows by accretion, each new creator building on the works of those who came before. Overprotection stifles the very creative forces it's supposed to nurture.<a note-disclosure="11" href="#d842263a-a401-4e99-b868-b349b874eefb-fn11"></a> <span page-number="1514" pagination-id="989 F.2d 1512" id="p1514"></span>  </p><div note-container="11" id="d842263a-a401-4e99-b868-b349b874eefb-fn11"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22"> <i>See</i> Wendy J.

Concerned about what it sees as a wrong done to Vanna White, the panel majority erects a property right of remarkable and dangerous breadth: Under the majority's opinion, it's now a tort for advertisers to <i>remind</i> the public of a celebrity. Not to use a celebrity's name, voice, signature or likeness; not to imply the celebrity endorses a product; but simply to evoke the celebrity's image in the public's mind. This Orwellian notion withdraws far more from the public domain than prudence and common sense allow. It conflicts with the Copyright Act and the Copyright Clause. It raises serious First Amendment problems. It's bad law, and it deserves a long, hard second look. </p> <h3> II</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="25" id="pa25"> Samsung ran an ad campaign promoting its consumer electronics. Each ad depicted a Samsung product and a humorous prediction: One showed a raw steak with the caption "Revealed to be health food. 2010 A.D." Another showed Morton Downey, Jr. in front of an American flag with the caption "Presidential candidate. 2008 A.D."<a note-disclosure="12" href="#d24668c6-4ace-48ad-ae0f-6878552bdc23-fn12"></a> The ads were meant to convey &mdash; humorously &mdash; that Samsung products would still be in use twenty years from now.  </p><div note-container="12" id="d24668c6-4ace-48ad-ae0f-6878552bdc23-fn12"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="26" id="pa26"> I had never heard of Morton Downey, Jr., but I'm told he's sort of like Rush Limbaugh, but not as shy.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="27" id="pa27"> The ad that spawned this litigation starred a robot dressed in a wig, gown and jewelry reminiscent of Vanna White's hair and dress; the robot was posed next to a Wheel-of-Fortune-like game board. <i>See</i> Appendix. The caption read "Longest-running game show. 2012 A.D." The gag here, I take it, was that Samsung would still be around when White had been replaced by a robot. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="28" id="pa28"> Perhaps failing to see the humor, White sued, alleging Samsung infringed her right of publicity by "appropriating" her "identity." Under California law, White has the exclusive right to use her name, likeness, signature and voice for commercial purposes. Cal.Civ. Code &sect; 3344(a); <i>Eastwood v. Superior Court,</i> <a href="/case/eastwood-v-superior-court#p417" class="raw-ref">149 Cal.App.3d 409, 417</a>, <a href="/case/eastwood-v-superior-court#p347" class="raw-ref">198 Cal.Rptr. 342, 347</a> (1983). But Samsung didn't use her name, voice or signature, and it certainly didn't use her likeness. The ad just wouldn't have been funny had it depicted White or someone who resembled her &mdash; the whole joke was that the game show host(ess) was a robot, not a real person. No one seeing the ad could have thought this was supposed to be White in .2012. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="29" id="pa29"> The district judge quite reasonably held that, because Samsung didn't use White's name, likeness, voice or signature, it didn't violate her right of publicity. 971 F.2d at 1396-97. Not so, says the panel majority: The California right of publicity can't possibly be limited to name and likeness. If it were, the majority reasons, a "clever advertising strategist" could avoid using White's name or likeness but nevertheless remind people of her with impunity, "effectively eviscerat[ing]" her rights. To prevent this "evisceration," the panel majority holds that the right of publicity must extend beyond name and likeness, to any "appropriation" of White's "identity" &mdash; anything that "evoke[s]" her personality. <i>Id.</i> at 1398-99. </p> <h3> III</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="31" id="pa31"> But what does "evisceration" mean in intellectual property law?

State courts are unlikely to be particularly sensitive to federal preemption, which, after all, is a matter of first concern to the federal courts. The Supreme Court is unlikely to consider the issue because the right of publicity seems so much a matter of state law. That leaves us. It's our responsibility to keep the right of publicity from taking away federally granted rights, either from the public at large or from a copyright owner. We must make sure state law doesn't give the Vanna Whites and Adam Wests of the world a veto over fair use parodies of the shows in which they appear, or over copyright holders' exclusive right to license derivative works of those shows. In a case where the copyright owner isn't even a party &mdash; where no one has the interests of copyright owners at heart &mdash; the majority creates a rule that greatly diminishes the rights of copyright holders in this circuit. </p> <h3> V.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="60" id="pa60"> The majority's decision also conflicts with the federal copyright system in another, more insidious way. Under the dormant Copyright Clause, state intellectual property laws can stand only so long as they don't "prejudice the interests of other States." <i>Goldstein v. California,</i> <a href="/case/goldstein-v-california#p558" class="raw-ref">412 U.S. 546, 558</a>, <a href="/case/goldstein-v-california#p2310" class="raw-ref">93 S.Ct. 2303, 2310</a>, <a href="/case/goldstein-v-california" class="raw-ref">37 L.Ed.2d 163</a> (1973). A state law criminalizing record piracy, for instance, is permissible because citizens of other states would "remain free to copy within their borders those works which may be protected elsewhere." <i>Id.</i> But the right of publicity isn't geographically limited. A right of publicity created by one; state applies to conduct everywhere, so long as it involves a celebrity domiciled in that state. If a Wyoming resident creates an ad that features a California domiciliary's name or likeness, he'll be subject to California right of publicity law even if he's careful to keep the ad from being shown in California. <i>See Acme Circus Operating Co. v. Kuperstock,</i> <a href="/case/acme-circus-operating-co-v-kuperstock#p1540" class="raw-ref">711 F.2d 1538, 1540</a> (11th Cir. 1983); <i>Groucho Marx Prods. v.

A limited right that applies to unauthorized use of name and likeness probably does not run afoul of the Copyright Clause, but the majority's protection of "identity" is quite another story. Under the majority's approach, any time anybody in the United States &mdash; even somebody who lives in a state with a very narrow right of publicity &mdash; creates an ad, he takes the risk that it might remind some segment of the public of somebody, perhaps somebody with only a local reputation, somebody the advertiser has never heard of. <i>See</i> note 17 <i>supra</i> (right of publicity is infringed by unintentional appropriations). So you made a commercial in Florida and one of the characters reminds Reno residents of their favorite local TV anchor (a California domiciliary)? Pay up. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="62" id="pa62"> This is an intolerable result, as it gives each state far too much control over artists in other states. No California statute, no California court has actually tried to reach this far. It is ironic that it is we who plant this kudzu in the fertile soil of our federal system. </p> <h3> VI</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="64" id="pa64"> Finally, I can't see how giving White the power to keep others from evoking her image in the public's mind can be squared with the First Amendment. Where does White get this right to control our thoughts? The majority's creation goes way beyond the protection given a trademark or a copyrighted work, or a person's name or likeness. All those things control one particular way of expressing an idea, one way of referring to an object or a person. But not allowing <i>any</i> means of reminding people of someone? That's a speech restriction unparalleled in First Amendment law.<a note-disclosure="28" href="#d509f3cb-d80b-4ef2-bceb-940159347b4a-fn28"></a>  </p><div note-container="28" id="d509f3cb-d80b-4ef2-bceb-940159347b4a-fn28"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="65" id="pa65"> Just compare the majority's holding to the intellectual property laws upheld by the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court didn't set out the <i>Central Hudson</i> test for its health.

If the Court wanted to leave these matters to judges' gut feelings, to nifty lines about "the difference between fun and profit," <a href="/case/new-kids-on-the-block-v-new-america-pub-inc#p1401" class="raw-ref">971 F.2d at 1401</a>, it could have done so with much less effort. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="78" id="pa78"> Maybe applying the test would have convinced the majority to change its mind; maybe going through the factors would have shown that its rule was too broad, or the reasons for protecting White's "identity" too tenuous.

Millions of people toil in the shadow of the law we make, and much of their livelihood is made possible by the existence of intellectual property rights.

<p>Turkey's population at the end of 1994 was estimated at 61.2 million
        (for a more recent population estimate, see <a href="http://worldfacts.us/Turkey.htm">Facts
        about Turkey</a>) .
        This number represented an 8.4 percent increase over the 56.5 million
        enumerated in the twelfth quinquennial census, conducted in October
        1990. The State Institute of Statistics (SIS) has estimated that since
        1990 the country's population has been growing at an average annual rate
        of 2.1 percent, a decrease from the 2.5 percent average annual rate
        recorded during the 1980s. Turkey's population in 1985 was about 50.7
        million, and in 1980 about 44.7 million. In the fourteen years from 1980
        to 1994, the population increased nearly 37 percent.</p>
        <p>Turkey's first census of the republican era was taken in 1927 and
        counted a total population of about 13.6 million. Less than seventy
        years later, the country's population had more than quadrupled. Between
        1927 and 1945, growth was slow; in certain years during the 1930s, the
        population actually declined. Significant growth occurred between 1945
        and 1980, when the population increased almost 2.5 times. Although the
        rate of growth has been slowing gradually since 1980, Turkey's average
        annual population increase is relatively high in comparison to that of
        European countries. In fact, member states of the European Union
        (EU--see Glossary) have cited this high population growth rate as
        justification for delaying a decision on Turkey's long-pending
        application to join the EU.</p>
        <p>The 1990 census is the most recent one for which detailed statistical
        data are available. That census revealed the relative youth of the
        population, with 20 percent being ten years of age or under (see table
        4, Appendix A). About 50.5 percent of the population was male, and 49.5
        percent female. The average life expectancy for females of seventy-two
        years was greater than the corresponding figure for men of sixty-eight
        years. The birth rate was twenty-eight per 1,000 population; the death
        rate was six per 1,000.</p>
        <h3>Population Density, Distribution, and Settlement</h3>
        <p>Population density has increased along with the relatively rapid
        growth rate. For example, although Turkey had an average of only
        twenty-seven inhabitants per square kilometer in 1950, this figure had
        nearly tripled, to 72.5 persons people per square kilometer, by 1990.
        Population density was estimated at 78.5 people per square kilometer at
        the end of 1994. According to the 1990 census, the most densely
        populated provinces included Istanbul, with 1,330 persons per square
        kilometer; Kocaeli, with 260; and Izmir, with 220. The most lightly
        populated provinces included Tunceli and Karaman, with seventeen and
        twenty-four persons, respectively, per square kilometer. Turkey's
        overall population density was less than one-half the densities in major
        EU countries such as Britain, Germany, and Italy.</p>
        <p>Although overall population density is low, some regions of Turkey,
        especially Thrace and the Aegean and Black Sea coasts, are densely
        populated. The uneven population distribution is most obvious in the
        coastal area stretching from Zonguldak westward to Istanbul, then around
        the Sea of Marmara and south along the Aegean coast to Izmir. Although
        this area includes less than 25 percent of Turkey's total land, more
        than 45 percent of the total population lived there in 1990. In
        contrast, the Anatolian Plateau and mountainous east account for 62
        percent of the total land, but only 40 percent of the population resided
        there in 1990. The remaining 15 percent of the population lived along
        the southern Mediterranean coast, which makes up 13 percent of Turkey's
        territory.</p>
        <p>In 1990 about 50 percent of the population was classified as rural.
        This figure represented a decline of more than 30 percent since 1950,
        when the rural population accounted for 82 percent of the country's
        total. The rural population lived in more than 36,000 villages in 1990,
        most of which had fewer than 1,000 inhabitants (see Village Life, this
        ch.). For administrative purposes, a village can be a small settlement
        or a number of scattered rural households, jointly administered by a
        village headman (<em>muhtar</em> ).</p>
        <p>By 1995 more than 65 percent of Turkey's population lived in cities,
        defined as built-up areas with 10,000 or more inhabitants. The urban
        population has been growing at a rapid rate since 1950, when it
        accounted for only 18 percent of Turkey's total. The main factor in the
        growth of the cities has been the steady migration of villagers to urban
        areas, a process that was continuing in the 1990s. The trend toward
        urbanization was revealed in the 1990 census, which enumerated more than
        17.6 million people--more than 30 percent of the total population--as
        living in nineteen cities with populations then of more than 200,000.
        The largest was Istanbul, with a population then of about 6.6 million,
        approximately 12 percent of Turkey's overall population. Two other
        cities also had populations in excess of 1 million: Ankara, the capital
        (about 2.6 million), and Izmir, a major port and industrial center on
        the Aegean Sea (about 1.8 million). Turkey's fourth and fifth largest
        cities, Adana (about 916,000 in 1990) and Bursa (about 835,000), have
        been growing at rates in excess of 3 percent per year, and each is
        expected to have more than 1 million inhabitants before 2000. Gaziantep
        in the southeast and Konya on the Anatolian Plateau were the only other
        cities with populations in excess of 500,000 in 1990. The ten largest
        cities also included Mersin (about 422,000), Kayseri (about 421,000),
        and Eskisehir (about 413,000).</p>
        <h3>Migration</h3>
        <p>During the decade 1915 to 1925, the country experienced large
        population transfers--a substantial movement outward of minority groups
        and an influx of refugees and immigrants. The first major population
        shift began in 1915, when the Ottoman government, for a variety of
        complex and in some instances contradictory reasons, decided to deport
        an estimated 2 million Armenians from their historical homeland in
        eastern Anatolia (see Armenians, this ch.; World War I, ch. 1). The
        movement of Greeks out of Turkey, which began during the 1912-13 Balkan
        Wars, climaxed in the 1920s with an internationally sanctioned exchange
        of population between Turkey and the Balkan states, primarily. In
        accordance with the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey accepted
        approximately 500,000 Muslims, who were forced to leave their homes in
        the Balkans, in exchange for nearly 2 million Greeks, who were forced to
        leave Anatolia. By special arrangement, Greeks living in Istanbul and
        Turks living in the Greek part of Thrace were exempted from the
        compulsory exchanges.</p>
        <p>After 1925 Turkey continued to accept Muslims speaking Turkic
        languages as immigrants and did not discourage the emigration of members
        of non-Turkic minorities. More than 90 percent of all immigrants arrived
        from the Balkan countries. Between 1935 and 1940, for example,
        approximately 124,000 Bulgarians and Romanians of Turkish origin
        immigrated to Turkey, and between 1954 and 1956 about 35,000 Muslim
        Slavs immigrated from Yugoslavia. In the fifty-five-year period ending
        in 1980, Turkey admitted approximately 1.3 million immigrants; 36
        percent came from Bulgaria, 30 percent from Greece, 22.1 percent from
        Yugoslavia, and 8.9 percent from Romania. These Balkan immigrants, as
        well as smaller numbers of Turkic immigrants from Cyprus and the Soviet
        Union, were granted full citizenship upon their arrival in Turkey. The
        immigrants were settled primarily in the Marmara and Aegean regions (78
        percent) and in central Anatolia (11.7 percent).</p>
        <p>The most recent immigration influx was that of Bulgarian Turks and
        Bosnian Muslims. In 1989 an estimated 320,000 Bulgarian Turks fled to
        Turkey to escape a campaign of forced assimilation. Following the
        collapse of Bulgaria's communist government that same year, the number
        of Bulgarian Turks seeking refuge in Turkey declined to under 1,000 per
        month. In fact, the number of Bulgarian Turks who voluntarily
        repatriated--125,000--exceeded new arrivals. By March 1994, a total of
        245,000 Bulgarian Turks had been granted Turkish citizenship. However,
        Turkey no longer regards Bulgarian Turks as refugees. Beginning in 1994,
        new entrants to Turkey have been detained and deported. As of December
        31, 1994, an estimated 20,000 Bosnians were living in Turkey, mostly in
        the Istanbul area. About 2,600 were living in camps; the rest were
        dispersed in private residences.</p>
        <p>In 1994 the government claimed that as many as 2 million Iranians
        were living in Turkey, a figure that most international organizations
        consider to be grossly exaggerated. Turkey is one of the few countries
        that Iranians may enter without first obtaining a visa; authorities
        believe that the relative ease of travel from Iran to Turkey encourages
        many Iranians to visit Turkey as tourists, or to use Turkey as a way
        station to obtain visas for the countries of Europe and North America.
        Consequently, as many as 2 million Iranians actually may transit
        Turkey--including multiple reentries for many individuals--in a given
        year. Specialized agencies of the European Union and the United Nations
        that deal with issues of migrants and refugees believe a more realistic
        figure of the number of Iranians who live in Turkey, and do not have a
        residence in Iran or elsewhere, is closer to 50,000.</p>
        <p>In the 1960s, working-age Turks, primarily men, began migrating to
        Western Europe to find employment as guest workers. Many of these
        Turkish workers eventually brought their families to Europe. An
        estimated 2 million Turkish workers and their dependents resided in
        Western Europe in the early 1980s, before the onset of an economic
        recession that led to severe job losses. The Federal Republic of Germany
        (West Germany) initiated the program of accepting Turkish guest workers.
        In the 1990s, however, Germany adopted a policy of economic incentives
        to encourage the voluntary repatriation of Turkish workers. At the end
        of 1994, an estimated 1.1 million Turks continued to reside in Western
        Europe as semipermanent aliens. About two-thirds of these Turkish
        migrants lived in Germany, and another 10 percent in France. Other
        European countries with sizable Turkish communities included Austria,
        Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. In addition, at least
        150,000 Turks were working in Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil-exporting
        countries of the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <h3>Government Population Policies</h3>
        <p>For almost forty years after the establishment of the republic in
        1923, the government of Turkey encouraged population growth. Use of
        contraceptives and distribution of information about them were
        prohibited by law, and the state provided financial incentives to
        encourage large families. During the 1950s, however, members of the
        political elite gradually became concerned that the country's relatively
        high population growth rate of nearly 3 percent was hurting economic
        development. Following the military coup of May 1960, population
        planning became a major government objective. A 1965 family planning law
        provided for the establishment of the Family Planning Division within
        the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance to extend birth control
        information and services to as many couples as possible. A 1967 law
        decriminalized abortion and authorized use of this procedure for a broad
        range of medical causes. Access to abortion was liberalized further by
        legislation in 1983 stipulating that a pregnancy could be terminated
        lawfully upon request in a public hospital up to ten weeks after
        conception. A married woman seeking an abortion was required to obtain
        her husband's permission or submit a formal statement of assumption of
        all responsibility prior to the procedure.</p>
        <p>Family planning services have expanded considerably since the
        mid-1960s. A primary focus has been on educating couples about the
        material and health benefits of both limiting and spacing births. The
        Ministry of Health adopted the 1978 International Congress on Primary
        Health Care recommendations that family planning be combined with
        maternal and child health services and undertaken in cooperation with
        state hospitals, maternity hospitals, health centers, and clinics in
        both urban and rural areas. In addition to its support of public
        education about family planning, the ministry has solicited the
        cooperation of volunteer associations and international organizations to
        promote its programs. But despite concerted government efforts to
        encourage smaller families, Turkey's birth rate between 1965 and 1994
        declined at a relatively slow pace, falling only from thirty-three to
        twenty-eight births per 1,000 population.</p>
        <p>Concern about the continuing high birth rate prompted the Ministry of
        Health in 1986 to launch a new population control campaign that
        concentrated on rural areas, where the fertility rate was highest. The
        campaign included the construction of new health clinics, the expansion
        of centers training medical professionals in family planning counseling,
        and the enlistment of private-sector cooperation in the distribution of
        birth control information and materials in factories. Private businesses
        established the Turkish Family Health and Planning Foundation, which has
        supplemented the state's population control efforts since 1986 through
        its financial support for special training programs and nationwide
        television advertisements.</p>
        <p>Religion has not been an impediment to birth control. Turkey's Sunni
        Muslim religious leaders, who have addressed the subject of birth
        control in religious publications, have stated that Islam does not
        prohibit married couples from trying to space births or limit the size
        of their families. The use of specific birth control devices generally
        has not been addressed in religious literature. However, during the
        early 1990s there appeared to be a consensus among religious leaders
        that the resort to sterilization or abortion as a means of birth control
        was not permissible under Islam.</p>

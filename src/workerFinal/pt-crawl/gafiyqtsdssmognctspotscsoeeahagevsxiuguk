<P>The 
<a href="http://www.DL.ulis.ac.jp/ISDL97/">International Symposium on Research, Development and Practice in Digital Libraries 1997 (ISDL'97)</a> was held from November 18 to 21, 1997 in Tsukuba, Japan. ISDL'97 was sponsored by University of Library and Information Science (ULIS), which also sponsored the previous symposium <a href="http://www.DL.ulis.ac.jp/ISDL95/">ISDL'95</a>. In this short report, the author would like to summarize the topics discussed in the symposium. The full conference proceedings, with 19 presentations invited from representatives from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the United States, and Japan and 17 contributed papers selected from submissions from 5 continents, were printed and made available at the conference; a web version shall be released shortly. 
<p>
As set forth in the Call for Participation, various research and development projects are in progress in many countries and regions. ISDL'97 was intended as an international forum for researchers, developers and practitioners of the digital library and for discussion not only from technological viewpoints but also from cultural and social points of view. The major topics discussed were metadata (Dublin Core), electronic journals and journal-oriented digital libraries, advanced information technologies for digital libraries, information access in digital libraries, digital library projects and so forth. Some highlights: 
<p>
In his keynote address, Gary Olson, Associate Dean of the School of Information, University of Michigan, talked about knowledge and knowledge network showing various research projects at his school. He showed that knowledge and information intensive work done by a single person or a group of people requires an environment where the digital library is a central component. 
<p>
Metadata is one of the key aspects for information access in digital libraries. In the metadata session, Stuart Weibel, OCLC, gave an overview of the Dublin Core and recent activities at the series of Dublin Core workshops. Global access to information requires internationalization and multilingualization of metadata. Thomas Baker, Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand presented a basic approach to multilingual metadata description of Dublin Core. 
<p>
Electronic journals and electronic document delivery have been widely accepted by users and libraries. There are major projects oriented to electronic journals and electronic collection of journal articles and there is lots of experience in this area, for example, JSTOR in the USA and NACSIS-ELS in Japan. Cliff McKnight, University of Loughborough, UK, talked about user aspects of electronic journals. For example, readers seem to prefer different media reading, browsing, and searching. He also described user behavior when searching information in electronic journals and related issues. Takeo Yamamoto, ULIS, talked about the conditions required for electronic journals to be viable in the digital library. Jun Adachi, National Center for Science Information Systems (NACSIS), Japan, described his experience in the NACSIS-ELS project, which is a nation-wide digital library project. 
<p>
The digital library is an integration of digital contents and various advanced information technologies built on high performance computing and communication. The program featured many talks on advanced information technologies. The technical topics include advanced searching and retrieval, information visualization and navigation, multimedia information retrieval and access, support tools for information access and management, and so forth. Y.T. Chien, USA National Science Foundation (NSF), discussed knowledge networks and the digital library in the context of human-centered information systems. He showed several key concepts for the digital library research and talked about new research initiatives in the USA. 
<p>
Discussions from a comprehensive point of view is crucial for the digital library being accepted as a library. Mel Collier from Dawson, UK talked about the role of digital libraries and surveyed the primary aspects required to develop the digital library based on his experience at De Montfort University. Michael Buckland, University of California, Berkeley, outlined a three-level process of information selection: selecting libraries, selecting documents, and selecting data. These discussions clarified the fundamental requirements for digital libraries. 
<p>
ISDL'97 also hosted a variety of talks about specific digital library projects and activities; Steve O'Connor, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia talked about the related activities at Australian universities. Edie Rasmussen described the Pennsylvania Education Net Digital Object Repository (PEN-DOR). Hiroyuki Taya, National Diet Library (NDL), Japan, outlined the NDL's activities and plan for the next century. Hiroshi Mukaiyama, Japanese Information Processing Development Center (JIPDEC), talked about their information technology development project for digital libraries. Sadao Kurohashi, Kyoto University, Japan, presented the digital library project at the Kyoto University Library. The Kyoto University's digital library, which is designed based on their former prototype, Ariadne, will provide a digital collection of Japanese classic literature including Japanese national treasures and publications by Kyoto University. Ray Suzuki talked about the campus-wide digital library at NAIST (Nara Institute of Science and Technology), Japan. 
<p>
The printed version of the symposium proceedings was published at ISDL'97. The electronic version of the symposium proceedings will be made available on the Web. ULIS is planning ISDL'99 in September 1999 as part of its 20-year anniversary.<p>

<B>About CIDL</B>
<P>
Early in 1997 the National Library of Canada initiated a national consultation to establish the status of digital library resource development in Canadian libraries.  The first step was to distribute, within the Canadian community, a questionnaire related to digitization activities and the management of digital collections.  From approximately fifty responses, twenty libraries with experience in one or both of these areas were invited to a meeting held at the National Library in March 1997.  The primary objective of the meeting was to determine which issues concerning the development of digital resources that merit national discussion and co-ordination and to assess the preparedness of libraries to work toward common solutions.
<P>
The participants reached consensus that a co-ordinated approach to the development of Canadian digital collections was needed. The National Library was asked to assist with the creation of a group of self-selected institutions whose mission is "to promote, co-ordinate and facilitate the development of Canadian digital collections and services in order to optimize national interoperability and long-term access to Canadian digital library resources".  The Canadian Initiative on Digital Libraries or CIDL was launched at the Canadian Library Association's annual conference in June.
<p>
By September 1997, 53 Canadian public, research and special libraries had joined CIDL.  In so doing, the members indicated a willingness to commit funds, expertise and staff resources to work to resolve issues of common and national concern.  The National Library agreed to host the Initiative's secretariat, the CIDL Web site and listserv. 
<p>
Members of CIDL elected a Steering Committee of representatives of seven member libraries from across the country in October 1997.  At the first meeting, held in late November 1997, Ernie Ingles, Associate Vice-President (Learning and Systems) at the University of Alberta, was elected as Steering Committee chair.  The six other members are Pam Bjornson, Canadian Institute for Historical Microreproductions (CIHM), Claude Bonnelly, Bibliothèque de l'Université de Laval, Aldyth Holmes, Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI), Carole Moore, University of Toronto Library, Marianne Scott, National Library of Canada and John Teskey, University of New Brunswick, Harriet Irving Library.  Secretariat staff presented the committee with the results of a more recent survey on members concerns, ranked according to priority.  On the basis of the results, it was agreed that CIDL would act as the co-ordinating body to address these concerns.  The focus of the alliance would be to support the development of Canadian digital content, following a standards-based approach to ensure quality and access in both the short and long-term.
<p>
At the November meeting three priorities were chosen for working groups to address.  They are:
<ol>
<li>Creation and Production Issues 
<li>Organizational and Access Issues (metadata)
<li>Advocacy and Promotional Issues
</ol>
<b>Next Phase</b>
<p>
The next meeting of the Steering Committee will be held in March 1998.  The agenda will include a half-day session on advocacy and communications to allow the Steering Committee to develop a Communications and Advocacy Plan.  In the meantime, the working groups will begin their efforts.  Each working group is led by a member of the Steering Committee and is comprised of member libraries with experience in working with digital resources or in interest in working to resolve the many issues. 
<p>
Further details about CIDL, including a list of member libraries, can be found in both English and French on the CIDL Web site. &lt;<a href = "http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/cidl">http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/cidl</a>&gt;

<b>&Agrave; propos de l'ICBN</b>
<p>
Au d&eacute;but de 1997, la Biblioth&egrave;que nationale du Canada a amorc&eacute; une consultation nationale dans le but de conna&icirc;tre l'&eacute;tat du d&eacute;veloppement des ressources documentaires num&eacute;riques dans les biblioth&egrave;ques canadiennes. La premi&egrave;re phase visait &agrave; distribuer, dans le milieu canadien, un questionnaire sur les activit&eacute;s de num&eacute;risation et la gestion de collections num&eacute;riques. &Agrave; partir d'environ cinquante r&eacute;ponses, vingt biblioth&egrave;ques qui poss&egrave;dent de l'exp&eacute;rience dans l'un de ces domaines ou les deux ont &eacute;t&eacute; invit&eacute;es &agrave; une r&eacute;union tenue &agrave; la Biblioth&egrave;que nationale en mars 1997. La r&eacute;union avait principalement pour but de d&eacute;terminer les questions concernant la cr&eacute;ation de ressources num&eacute;riques qui m&eacute;ritent une discussion et une coordination nationales et d'&eacute;valuer la mesure dans laquelle les biblioth&egrave;ques sont pr&ecirc;tes &agrave; travailler &agrave; des solutions communes.</P>
<P>
Les participants ont tous convenu qu'il fallait aborder de fa&ccedil;on coordonn&eacute;e le d&eacute;veloppement de collections num&eacute;riques au Canada. On a demand&eacute; &agrave; la Biblioth&egrave;que nationale d'aider &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation d'un groupe d'&eacute;tablissements qui se sont eux-m&ecirc;mes propos&eacute;s et dont la mission consiste «&agrave; favoriser, &agrave; coordonner et &agrave; faciliter le d&eacute;veloppement des collections et des services num&eacute;riques au Canada en vue d'optimiser l'interfonctionnement &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle nationale, et l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; long terme aux ressources documentaires num&eacute;riques au Canada». L'Initiative canadienne sur les biblioth&egrave;ques num&eacute;riques (ICBN) a &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;e &agrave; la conf&eacute;rence annuelle de la Canadian Library Association, organis&eacute;e en juin.</P>
<P>
En septembre 1997, cinquante-trois biblioth&egrave;ques canadiennes publiques, de recherche et sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es s'&eacute;taient jointes &agrave; l'ICBN. De par leur participation, les membres ont indiqu&eacute; leur bonne volont&eacute; &agrave; engager des fonds, des comp&eacute;tences et du personnel pour travailler &agrave; la r&eacute;solution de questions d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun et national. La Biblioth&egrave;que nationale a accept&eacute; d'accueillir le secr&eacute;tariat de l'Initiative, le site Web de l'ICBN et la tribune &eacute;lectronique.</P>
<P>
En octobre 1997, les membres de l'ICBN ont &eacute;lu un comit&eacute; directeur compos&eacute; de repr&eacute;sentants de sept biblioth&egrave;ques membres &agrave; travers le pays. &Agrave; la premi&egrave;re r&eacute;union tenue &agrave; la fin de novembre 1997, Ernie Ingles, vice-pr&eacute;sident associ&eacute; (apprentissage et syst&egrave;mes) &agrave; la University of Alberta, a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;lu pr&eacute;sident du comit&eacute; directeur. Les six autres membres sont Pam Bjornson, Institut canadien de microproduction historique, Claude Bonnelly, Biblioth&egrave;que de l'Universit&eacute; de Laval, Aldyth Holmes, Institut canadien de l'information scientifique et technique (ICIST), Carole Moore, biblioth&egrave;que de la University of Toronto, Marianne Scott, Biblioth&egrave;que nationale du Canada, et John Teskey, Universit&eacute; du Nouveau-Brunswick, Biblioth&egrave;que Harriet Irving. Le personnel du secr&eacute;tariat a inform&eacute; le comit&eacute; des r&eacute;sultats d'un plus r&eacute;cent sondage sur les pr&eacute;occupations des membres, class&eacute;es par ordre de priorit&eacute;. En fonction des r&eacute;sultats, on a convenu que l'ICBN servirait d'organisme de coordination pour traiter de ces pr&eacute;occupations. L'alliance aurait pour but d'appuyer le d&eacute;veloppement de contenu num&eacute;rique canadien, conform&eacute;ment &agrave; une approche fond&eacute;e sur des normes afin d'assurer la qualit&eacute; et l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; court et &agrave; long termes.
<P>&Agrave; la r&eacute;union de novembre, on a &eacute;tabli les trois priorit&eacute;s suivantes dont traiteront les groupes de travail :</P>
<P>
1.&#9;les questions de cr&eacute;ation et de production;<br>
2.&#9;les questions d'organisation et d'acc&egrave;s (m&eacute;tadonn&eacute;es);<br>
3.&#9;les questions de d&eacute;fense des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et de promotion.
<P>
<B><P>Phase suivante</P>
</B><P>La prochaine r&eacute;union du comit&eacute; directeur se d&eacute;roulera en mars 1998. L'ordre du jour englobera une s&eacute;ance d'une demi-journ&eacute;e sur la d&eacute;fense des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et les communications afin de permettre au comit&eacute; directeur de dresser un plan de communication et de d&eacute;fense des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts. Dans l'intervalle, les groupes de travail se mettront en train. Chacun de ces groupes sera dirig&eacute; par un membre du comit&eacute; directeur et compos&eacute; de biblioth&egrave;ques membres qui poss&egrave;dent de l'exp&eacute;rience relativement aux ressources num&eacute;riques ou manifestent de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; travailler &agrave; la r&eacute;solution des nombreuses questions.</P>

<LI>The
<a href = "http://www.ics.forth.gr/2EuroDL/">Second European Conference on Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries</a> will be held September 19 -23, 1998, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Sponsored by the European Union, European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, ICS-FORTH, and the University of Crete, this conference is the second of a series of European conferences on research and technology for digital libraries funded by the European Commission's TMR Programme. Its objectives are: to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines whose science relates to the development of digital libraries; to provide an opportunity for these scientists to form a research community in Europe specific to digital library development and to enable them to discuss issues and strategies specific to the European context; to assist young researchers in establishing relationships with senior scientists in their areas of interest; to enable review and discussion of research under way in Europe, the USA, Japan and other countries on digital libraries; to stimulate researchers, especially young scientists, to explore new areas of interest in digital library development; to establish a forum for discussion of issues specific to Europe such as interoperability, multilinguality, intellectual property policy, and information commerce; to provide an opportunity for researchers in the relevant enabling technologies and information sciences, to discuss issues related to interoperability between world wide distributed digital libraries. 
<p>
From a technical point of view, the European Conferences series aims to contribute to the definition of those digital library parameters which especially influence issues of access, retrieval, and interaction with information; to identify key problems which must be solved to make digital library services an effective reality; to identify a general structure or framework for integrating research and solutions; and to propose and encourage specific, high priority research directions within such a framework.
 <p>
The conference organisers solicit papers on topics related to digital
 libraries, including but not limited to the following list:
<ul>
<li>Digital Library Models, Frameworks, and System Requirements
<li>Metadata
<li>System Integration and Architecture Issues
<li>Interoperability, Scalability
<li>Networked Information Discovery, Agent Technologies
<li>Information Retrieval, Organisation, Navigation - Tools and Paradigms
<li>Multilinguality
<li>Role of Knowledge Representation Systems in Digital Library Interactions

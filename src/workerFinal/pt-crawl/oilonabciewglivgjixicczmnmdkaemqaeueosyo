<div id="mn"> <h3> Another Day, Another Neuron</h3>

<p><img src="gif/ec.gif" width="129" height="191" alt="head" class="fl" />
The lights are low.  Electronic equipment hums.  A loud speaker pops and
crackles. Green lights flash across a monitor as a recording tape rolls.
An electrode is lowered. Ah...another day studying the brain .  Not all
scientists who study the brain and the rest of the nervous system
(neuroscientists) work in these conditions...some work in the jungles of
the Amazon looking for new plants that may hold the cure for neurological
disorders; others work in the clinics of medical centers helping people
stricken with neurological disease; still others work in laboratories
examining microscopic sections of the brain or the studying the behavior
of man and other animals. </p>

<p>So what does it take to study that 1.4 kilogram (3 pound) mass of
tissue in our heads we call the brain?  What does a neuroscientist
actually do?  Can the part of our anatomy that makes us who we are really
be studied?  </p>

<h3>To Become a Neuroscientist</h3>

<p><img src="gif/seussgen.gif" width="120" height="195"  class="flr"
alt="seuss" /> When you ask a child, "What do you want to be when you grow
up?" many will answer, "I want to be a Teacher" or "I want to be a
Fireman"  or "I want to be a Pilot" - I doubt any will say "I want to be a
Neuroscientist."  Yet many people do pursue careers studying the nervous
system.  In fact, the <a href="http://www.sfn.org">Society for
Neuroscience</a>, an international organization of scientists who study
the nervous system, has over 38,000 members!  </p>

<p>To start on the road to becoming a neuroscientist - any scientist for
that matter - first and most importantly, you must get an education.  
Study hard in school and go to college.  Once in college, you do not need
to take neuroscience classes immediately.  Shop around - take classes in a
variety of departments and follow your interests. Neuroscientists come
from many different disciplines including psychology, zoology, physics,
anthropology, biology, chemistry, physiology, and philosophy.  A diverse
educational background will provide the most important skill of all:  how
to ask questions.  </p>

<p>As an undergraduate, you may have a chance to test the waters of
research by working in a neuroscience lab.  Ask around - neuroscientists
are always looking for cheap labor.  You could even make a little money.  
As a volunteer research subject, you could also make a little money.  
Just strap on the electrodes and ...Don't worry - all experiments, even
those on students, MUST be approved by a university human subjects
committee to determine that they are safe.</p>

<p> After finishing at the university with your Bachelor of Science or
Bachelor of Arts degree, you are now ready for the next step - graduate
school or medical school or dental school.  Some people go to <a
href="http://www.andp.org/">graduate school</a> for their Ph.D. and a
health profession school such as medical, dental or nursing school.  You
have a wide range of departments from which to select your area of study.  
Many universities have separate neuroscience departments, but psychology,
physiology, pharmacology, and biology departments also offer coursework
and laboratories that study the nervous system.  Do you want to study how
drugs affect the brain?  Why do we sleep?  What causes and what are the
treatments for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke,
schizophrenia?  What about pain, memory, stress, emotion, consciousness?
The list is endless. It is important that you pick a graduate program with
people who are doing what you want to do.  Nevertheless, it is common for
students who are pursuing one area of neuroscience to become interested in
another area and switch labs.  As long as you use some tact and common
courtesies with your advisor, changing labs should not be a problem.  
</p>

<p>Many graduate schools will assist you financially with stipends in the
form of research and teaching assistantships.  Research assistants
typically perform experiments in a laboratory under the guidance of a
senior researchers.  Teaching assistants help instructors with classroom
duties such as grading papers, leading discussion sections and even
lecturing students. These are not high paying positions, but they are
wonderful training ground for the future. </p>

<p>So you have your Ph.D.and/or M.D. and D.D.S.?  Now what?  Many people
further their training with a "postdoctoral" fellowship.  A "post-doc"  
goes to a laboratory where he or she can learn new techniques or explore
a new area of neuroscience.  Your time as a post-doc is free from the
worries of grant writing and teaching...you are in the lab to do
research.  After your post-doctoral fellowship, it is time to get a
"real job."  Here are just some places that offer employment for
neuroscientists: </p>

<ol> <li><strong>Government </strong>(for example, in laboratories at the
<a href="http://www.nih.gov">National Institutes of Health</a>) - These
positions usually do not involve traditional teaching 
responsibilities.</li>

<li><strong>University</strong> (as a researcher or teacher) - At the 
university
it is sometimes difficult to balance research and teaching duties.  
However, the university environment, surrounded by students interested in
learning, is exciting. </li>

<li><strong>Industry </strong>(for example in biotechnology,
pharmaceutical or medical instruments companies) - Often paying higher
salaries than government or university jobs, private industry offers the
chance to research and develop new products for the marketplace without
the pressure of teaching responsibilities. </li>

<li><strong>Hospital or Medical Center</strong> (as a clinician and/or
researcher) - Working in a medical center is an ideal place to study
neurological disorders in patients.</li> </ol>

University and National Museum of Health and Medicine)</p>

<p> Although employment opportunities in some major cities are sparse,
there are jobs for neuroscientists - you just have to know <a
href="http://www.aaas.org/programs/centers/careers/"> where to 
look</a>.</p>

<p><strong>"Neuroscientist"</strong> is actually a general word that
describes someone who studies the nervous system.  Many neuroscientists
"wear several hats."  For example, a neurosurgeon may also have a Ph.D. in
physiology.  He or she may work in the operating room but also have time
to perform experiments.  There are many career paths that neuroscientists
can take: </p>

<h3>A Day in the Life of a Neuroscientist</h3> 

<p>You have finished your training, you have a nice job.  What does a
neuroscientist really do?  Like most professions, the job of a
neuroscientist requires a multitude of talents.  In addition to performing
experiments in their area of expertise, neuroscientists must be:</p>

<ol>
<li>writers (to publish manuscripts and write grant applications)</li>
<li>accountants (to balance laboratory expenses)</li>
<li>fund raisers (to support the laboratory financially)</li>
<li>electricians, carpenters and plumbers (to repair minor problems with
equipment or build new instruments)</li>
<li>teachers (to lecture large audiences and classes or talk one-on-one
with students)</li>
<li>travel agents (to get to meetings around the country and world)</li>
<li>artists (to create graphics and illustrations of results from
experiments)</li>
<li>photographers (to document your work and prepare manuscripts)</li>
<li>counselors (to advise students)</li>
<li>editors (to critique  their own work and that of others)</li>
</ol>
<p>Neuroscientists in charge of their own labs are also head custodian and
chief bottle washers. </p>

<h3>Challenges for the Future</h3>

<p>Because of many <a href="chmethod.html">technological advances</a>,
neuroscience has made great strides in recent years.  There is the patch clamp
to listen to ion channels;  the electron microscope to see inside neurons;
single unit techniques to record electrical activity from inside and outside of
individual neurons; <a href="image.html#pet">positron emission tomography</a>
to study brain function; <a href="image.html#mri">magnetic resonance
imaging</a> to see inside the living brain.  Yet even with all these
inventions, there is still so much to learn about the brain and the rest of the
nervous system.  The next century holds many exciting challenges for current
and future neuroscientists.  Here are only a few of the possible questions that
face neuroscientists in laboratories and clinics around the world:</p>

<p><img src="gif/blubrag.gif" width="190" height="335" alt="bluebrain" 
class="flr" /></p>
<ul>
<li>What are the methods for early detection of <a href="disorders.html">neurological
disorders</a> such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and for
mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression?  What are the
causes of these illnesses?  What are the cures?</li>
<li>How can we help nerves regenerate?  Can we cure spinal cord injuries? 
Can we transplant or replace parts of the brain?</li>
<li>What causes <a href ="http://www.iasp-pain.org">chronic
pain</a>? What is the best way to treat pain?  How can we tap into our
endogenous pain inhibitory system?</li>
<li>What are the mechanisms of addiction?  Are there better ways to treat
addictions?</li>
<li>How are memories formed, stored and lost?</li>
<li>What are better ways to image the living brain?</li> 
<li>What is the neurological basis of emotions such as anger, happiness
and sadness?</li>
<li>What are the differences in the brains of men and women and what do 
these differences mean?</li>
<li>How does experience and learning affect the brain and how can we use
this information to improve our daily lives?</li>
<li>What are the neurological mechanisms of "alternative medicine"
treatments such as acupuncture, herbal therapy and hypnosis and how can 
these methods be used to treat nervous system disorders?</li>
<li>Why do we sleep and how can we shift our internal body clocks?</li>
<li>What is consciousness?</li>
</ul>

<p>Neuroscientists are studying these and many other questions 
about the brain right now.  With increased effort, the answers to these
questions are in the near future. Perhaps you would like to help?

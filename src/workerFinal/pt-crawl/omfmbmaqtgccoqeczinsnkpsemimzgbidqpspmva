Stella was born to a modest family in rural England. 
Her father was a thatcher by trade.
At school, she enjoyed tennis, and excelled
at zoology, botany and chemistry. 
She became Head Prefect at South Wiltshire Grammar School and
won an Open Scholarship to St. Hilda's College Oxford to
study biology.
There she gained a First Class Honours degree.
She went on to study under the Nobel Laureate <A HREF=
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaas_Tinbergen>
Niko Tinbergen</A> to gain her doctorate, 
studying how genetics affected behaviour.
She chose as her test candidates the Fruit Flies: 
<I>Drosophila</I> species. 
They have the advantage of having a
generation time of less than two weeks,
making it feasible to study changes of behaviour
over many generations in a relatively short period.
<I>Drosophila</I> also have a variety of complex courtship 
displays that were readily observable under a microscope.
On completion of her doctorate 
she became a Fellow of St Anne's College Oxford.
<P>
In 1969 she moved to Australia, becoming a 
Lecturer in the Psychology Department at Monash University.
She advanced up the academic ladder, intermittently
acting as Head of the Psychology Department,
and Associate-Dean of the Science Faculty there,
being accorded the title of Professor and later Emeritus Professor.
<P>
She worked hard for the status of women in the university,
and was Chair of the Affirmative Action Coordinating
Committee at Monash.
<P>
Throughout her life, she was in wonder at 
the complexity of the natural world,
not just its physical attributes, but how animals 
(including humans) behave and how their behaviour develops.
<P>
On moving to Australia, she was struck by the extraordinary
flora and fauna of the country. 
She coauthored a book in manuscript on the caterpillars 
that she found in her garden in suburban Melbourne, 
and circulated it at great length through all the local publishers,
but none were interested in a book on caterpillars
at that time (ca 1985).
That manuscript became the basis of a website she co-developed on the 
<A HREF=../larvae.html>biology of Australian Lepidoptera</A>, 
which currently covers over 4,000 species.
<P>
She contracted Multiple Sclerosis in 1975, 
but did not retire from full-time academia until 1997.
Even then she continued teaching and fostering 
postgraduate students up to a few weeks before her death.

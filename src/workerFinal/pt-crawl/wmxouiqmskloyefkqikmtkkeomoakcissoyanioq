Please read those rules and policies before proceeding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n#Corporate and Third Party Subscriptions and Marketing Data\n\nIf your access to BioCentury’s Products or Services is provided by your employer or another third party, your employer or that third party may provide us with limited amounts of personal information about you to enable your access to the Products and Services. In addition, your employer or the third party may require us to provide them with information about your access to the Products or Services, for example to verify that you are using the Products and Services they have purchased on your behalf. In addition, we may be required to provide your employer or third party with personally identifiable information in order to enforce compliance with the BioCentury User Agreement or other applicable BioCentury license agreement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFrom time to time, we may obtain names from third parties that may contain individuals’ personal information. We do not accept names from third parties that do not comply with the privacy laws and regulations that govern the rest of our business, and our use of such personal information is subject to the same permissions and consents as apply to other personal information in our possession.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n#Your Choices\n\nBioCentury offers you the choices and means to limit our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information, and control how we communicate with you. You may, at any time, select not to receive any BioCentury product emails, any BioCentury marketing emails or any BioCentury emails on behalf of third parties. You may also at any time request that (a) BioCentury stop processing your personal data, (b) BioCentury remove any personal data about you from our systems to the extent required by the relevant data protection authority, and (c) BioCentury provide you with an export of the personal data we maintain about you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBioCentury occasionally collaborates with third parties to provide you with content such as white papers, podcasts and webinars, as well as services, including the opportunity to participate in conferences and other events. To do so, we may share your personal information (limited to your name, email address, title, employer, physical address, and telephone numbers) with these third parties. In these cases, you will not be able to access such content or register to participate in an event unless you agree to this Privacy Policy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNote, however, if you have consented to the privacy policy of a BioCentury vendor or partner who has the right to market to you, BioCentury cannot opt you out of marketing on behalf of that other vendor or partner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBioCentury will provide you with a clear, conspicuous, readily available mechanism to exercise these choices. We will take all reasonable steps to honor your request. To opt out, [please click here](https://go.biocentury.com/GDPR-Opt-Out-Preferences.html) and you will be re-directed to our Preferences Request Form. You may also exercise these choices by contacting us at [privacy@biocentury.com](mailto:privacy@biocentury.com) or in writing to BioCentury Inc. 1235 Radio Road, Ste. 100, Redwood City, CA 94065-1217 Attn: Privacy. If you have any inquiries, complaints or difficulties in exercising these choices, please direct your inquiry to [privacy@biocentury.com](mailto:privacy@biocentury.com).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGenerally, if you choose to limit the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information, BioCentury may not be able to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Provide the Products or Services you have ordered.\n- Process order and payment transactions for you. \n- Provide Service Notices regarding Web Site changes, new or existing products, services, special offers, or otherwise contact you.\n- Share your information for participation in an event with a partner or third-party manager.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n#Correcting and Updating Your Information\n\nYou may modify your Password at any time by using the [Forgot Password](/contact/forgot-password) function on the BioCentury Web Site. This password is stored in a secure, encrypted format so that no one else, including BioCentury, can read, see or use it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou may contact [support@biocentury.com](mailto:support@biocentury.com) to notify BioCentury of changes to your personal information, to review and correct your personal data if they are inaccurate, or to delete such data if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for some legitimate business purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo process your requests, we may ask you to provide such identification as we deem necessary to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. Also, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for example, requests concerning information residing on backup media), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge during normal business hours of our headquarters corporate office, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or concerns about the use of your personal information, please direct your inquiry to [privacy@biocentury.com](mailto:privacy@biocentury.com).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n#Your California Privacy Rights\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we disclosed personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

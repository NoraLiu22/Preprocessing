<p>Rembrandt's oils took a few centuries to yellow; Dan Flavin's fluorescent bulbs
took a few decades to go out of production; Group Z's work for Netscape 1.1 lasted
a few years before Netscape 2.0 made it obsolete. For those artists working in new
media who want posterity to experience their work more directly than through
second-hand documentation or anecdote, I have proposed an alternative called
"variable media." Drawing on paradigms originally explored by Conceptual and
Process artists in the 1960s and 70s, the idea behind variable media is to conceive
of a work whose integrity is not compromised by its re-creation in different
formats.</p>

<p>I am working at the Guggenheim on a Variable Media Initiative to confront the
problem of how to preserve works from the museum's Panza collection of Minimal and
Conceptual works as well as more recent acquisitions of new media art. To date
we've put together an extensive Web site on the subject, including information on
ten case studies of variable media works by artists such as Robert Morris, Mark
Napier, Nam June Paik, and Meg Webster. At the core of the site will be an
interactive questionnaire designed to help artists write guidelines for translating
their works into new media once the original medium has expired. </p>

<p>This questionnaire is unlike any protocol hitherto proposed for cataloguing or
preserving artworks. It requires artists to define their work according to
behaviors like "performed" or "networked" rather than in medium-dependent terms
like film or video. The variable media paradigm also asks artists to choose the
most appropriate strategy for dealing with the inevitable slippage that results
from translating to new mediums: storage (mothballing a PC), emulation (playing
Pong on your laptop), migration (putting Super-8 on DVD), or reinterpretation
(Hamlet in a chat room).</p>

<p>Apart from organizing public and private symposia on the subject, the Guggenheim
plans to publish its findings to serve as guidelines for other collecting
institutions. More information can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/variablemedia">http://www.guggenheim.org/variablemedia</a>&gt;.

</p>


<p>The <a href="http://disa.nu.ac.za/">South African Digital Imaging Project</a> (DISA - also an orchid indigenous to southern Africa)  first came into bud in 1997 at a workshop on digital imaging at the University of the Witwatersrand led by Anne Kenney and Sandy Payette of <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/">Cornell University</a>. The workshop brought together librarians, archivists, and respected scholars in the fields of history, political science and anthropology from a number of local research institutions to obtain an overview of digital imaging, and to consider the creation of a digital archive, not unlike the <a href="http://moa.umdl.umich.edu/">Making of America</a>, highlighting the Apartheid era of South African history.</p>

<p>Few digital imaging initiatives were underway in South Africa at the time, and the challenges experienced individually gave rise to the concept of a co-operative approach.  Equipment, for example, is comparatively expensive in South Africa, especially if it is state-of-the-art, and most institutions simply cannot afford to purchase the best.  Standards too, had not been agreed upon, and varied widely from one project to another as an indication of the lack of the operational expertise and technical capacity.
</p>

<p>Made possible by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the DISA project is  managed by the <a href="http://khozi2.nu.ac.za/index.html">Campbell Collections of the University of Natal</a>, with the assistance of a  digital technician, a digital indexer and a student assistant. Intended to conform with internationally accepted standards, the digital conversion of selected journals was conducted within the framework of the Cornell digital imaging workshop, using the <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> model, to ensure firstly, that the best advice was obtained, and secondly, that we did not work in isolation. 
</p>

<p>A primary purpose of the pilot digitisation project is that of capacity building and skills development in southern African cultural heritage institutions. The project encourages interested persons to visit the host institution, and has presented training workshops on the implementation of digital projects, teaching the technical processes involved in image and metadata capture. South Africa is after all geographically isolated from locations hosting an abundance of conferences and workshops announced in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States, and even further distant from exciting Australian initiatives. The stated aim of the DISA project, to provide experience and develop knowledge and experience in digital technologies, has provided the means to train staff in partner institutions at <a href="http://www.wits.ac.za/library/index.html">Wits University Library</a>, the <a href="http://www.nlsa.ac.za/">National Library of South Africa</a>, and the <a href="http://www.national.archives.gov.za/">National Archives of South Africa</a>, the <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a> and the <a href="http://scnc.udw.ac.za/doc/home/index0.htm">University of Durban-Westville Documentation Centre</a>, each institution now contributing as remote capture sites.  In addition, training programmes have enabled informed decision-making processes to be followed in the implementation of digital projects in other South African institutions as well as the National Libraries and National Archives of ten neighbouring southeast African countries.</p>

<h3 class="blue">A Contemporary Culture Virtual Archive in XML (COVAX)</h3>

</p>


<p>COVAX (Contemporary Culture Virtual Archive in XML) is a two-year
European Commission 5th Framework IST funded project that began in
January 2000. Its objectives are:</p>

<ul><li>To build a web service for search and retrieval of European
contemporary culture descriptions and documents from memory
institutions. </li></ul>
<ul><li>To make accessible over the Internet existing document descriptions in
libraries, archives and museums. </li></ul>
<ul><li>To satisfy needs of memory institutions, regardless of their size or
document types, to provide access to their collections. </li></ul>
<ul><li>To implement standards and achieve interoperability between systems.</li></ul>

<p>The project corresponds to the European Commission 5th Framework Key Action 3 (Multimedia content and
tools: cultural heritage and digital content) in the action line III.2.3
(Access to scientific and cultural heritage).</p>

<p>COVAX partners have large and small collections described by existing
museum, library and archive records, including some full text records.
The project is assessing the future provision of improved access to
these collections by converting samples of existing data into a small
number of common structured formats, each of which can be expressed as
XML (eXtensible Markup Language).</p> 

<p>COVAX is exploring the idea that future collection records in libraries,
museums and archives will be stored in a variety of XML formats instead
of proprietary formats. Since much material is described already in
machine-readable form, we need to develop widely applicable methods and
approaches for converting the material to XML and integrating it with native XML
data for building user-friendly websites and data feeds.</p>

<p>Each COVAX partner must have or create a database in native XML. Data
for this must be mapped from existing structures.</p> 

<p>COVAX concluded that for bibliographic data we will use
USMARC (MARC21) and use available tools, where necessary, to convert to
this format before finally converting the data to XML.</p>

<p>Partner data will be converted to one of the appropriate XML formats
using existing DTDs for archives (EAD), museums (AMICO) and electronic
texts (TEILite). The DTDs have to be interpreted by the technical team
to produce XML schemas and schemas for the particular local XML
repository software used in each site, such as Tamino and TeXtML.</p>
 
<p>COVAX partners are currently implementing XML repositories using two
software packages, Tamino from Software AG, a COVAX technical partner
(<a href="http://www.softwareag.com/taminoplatform/">http://www.softwareag.com/taminoplatform/</a>) and TeXtML from IXIAsoft
(<a href="http://www.textmlserver.com/">http://www.textmlserver.com/</a>). Sites are being established in London,
Rome, Salzburg, Graz and Madrid.</p>

<p>A website containing the project newsletter, state of the art and market
study documents has been established in Catalan, English, German,
Italian, Spanish, and Swedish at &lt;<a href="http://www.covax.org">http://www.covax.org</a>&gt;. Carlos Wert, the
project coordinator, and Francisca Hern&aacute;ndez have published an
introductory article on COVAX in <em>Cultivate Interactive</em>, Issue 3, January
2001 (<a href="http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue3/covax/">http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue3/covax</a>).

<h3 class="blue">Griffith Artworks CD-ROM Archival Project</h3>

<p class="italics">

&lt;<a href="mailto:ken.lyons@mailbox.gu.edu.au">ken.lyons@mailbox.gu.edu.au</a>&gt;
</p>


<p>Griffith Artworks is a Centre within Griffith University, Australia, that is responsible for overseeing the acquisition, exhibition and management of the Griffith University Art Collection. Over the years the Collection has developed a focus area in video and multimedia/CD-ROM artworks and it is timely that archival strategies be developed for the current CD-ROM collection and for future acquisitions. To our knowledge, Griffith Artworks is the only Art Museum in Australia actively acquiring artworks in CD-ROM format. Archiving procedures initiated now will mean the preservation of unique and historically significant Australian works of art.</p> 

<p>The focus of the project is to develop a solution or set of solutions for archiving CD-ROM artworks within digital media environments that will preserve and enable them to be viewed in years to come. As a pilot study of the CD-ROM as an artform medium within the museum collection environment, this project also presents a number of unique challenges for Griffith Artworks.</p>

<p>CD-ROM works consist of digital information and as 'virtual artworks' are free of the usual conservation problems associated with material objects. However, in order to be viewed they are reliant on certain software, hardware and computer system environments. As computers are upgraded and modified, will we still be able to view these works?</p>

<p>To date, we have found that each artwork requires the collection and identification of an elemental set of comprehensive metadata. This will not only provide a detailed record of information regarding the specific and varied hardware and software requirements of the CD-ROM artworks, but will also note vital provenance information.</p>

<p>For greater interoperability with other agencies, the element set we propose will fall within the Dublin Core Metadata standard. We are currently investigating other initiatives in this area on which to base our development. The collection of this metadata will also have an impact on the definition categories within the current catalogue collection structure. It is envisaged that to effectively serve both curatorial and research purposes, detailed information regarding each CD-ROM will need to be noted and made available. Other materials supplied with the CD-ROM artworks, such as custom packaging and graphic inserts, also require preservation consideration.</p> 

<p>Not only recording and maintaining long term access to the metadata about the works, but also maintaining as much as possible the artistic and aesthetic integrity, the "look and feel" of each artwork is a another core endeavour in this project.</p>

<p>For viewing, research and curatorial purposes, it is our aim to establish a central server on which to physically store copies of the CD-ROM collection and associated metadata within Griffith Artworks. Due to the specific and varied operational requirements of each interactive, the greatest challenge presented will be to determine and develop a compatible system environment on which to successfully view the works.</p>

<p>Our initial review has indicated that some of the titles reveal specific challenges -- due to software obsolescence and custom designed plug-ins -- and will not function properly within the current system environment. In these cases, it may be necessary to implement an alternative strategy such as presenting key elements from the work that the artist regards as representative within the central server environment accompanied by associated metadata. In this situation it would be ideal to store an operational version of the artwork within a separate digital environment.</p> 

<p>At this stage, it appears that a combination of preservation strategies, such as refreshment, migration and emulation, may prove to be the most effective action to take. It must also be accepted that whatever set of solutions we adopt will require periodic attention as technologies change to identify and implement timely action to maintain continued long term access to the CD-ROM archive and update associated metadata.</p>

<p>This project, which will continue until September 2001, has just passed through its initial information and research gathering phase. At its completion, Griffith Artworks will produce a report for the wider museum community detailing our findings and the actions conducted throughout this study.</p>

<h3 class="blue">Proposal to Form ASIST Special Interest Group on Bioinformatics (SIG/BIO)</h3>

</p>


<p>The field of bioinformatics is growing extremely rapidly with inevitable 
current and future global impact.  ASIST has begun soliciting interest in 
forming a new special interest group around this topic.  The following 
proposal was circulated in March, 2001:</p>

<p>"As a new group, SIG/BIO will explore the applications of information 
science to bioinformatics.  Bioinformatics has been defined as "the 
generation, handling, storage, retrieval and analysis of biological 
sequence data [genes and proteins]." This is bioinformatics in the 
research sense used by Cole &amp; Bawden -- J.Doc. v52 (1): 51-68, March 1996 
-- as distinguished from the sense implied by the phrases medical 
informatics or literature search specialists. We plan to foster 
collaborations with ASIST SIG/MED when appropriate, albeit SIG/BIO will 
focus on a specialized subset of topics."</p>

<p>"This new SIG will provide a forum for interaction between three distinct 
scientific research and informatics communities: bioinformatics (e.g., 
scientists in computational molecular biology), information technology, 
and information science."</p>

<p>"SIG/BIO programs will center on such topics as:  identification of areas 
where information science may impact current genomics and proteomics 
programs; existing and new methods for the organization, structuring and 
linking of biochemical, genetic, genomic and proteomic data collections 
(ontologies and thesauri, perhaps); information science and the emerging 
problems of systems biology; application of information measures to 
theoretical problems in genomics; design, implementation and use of 
effective gene annotation and retrieval methods; current awareness of the 
genomic sequencing and proteomics efforts; and discussion of the social 
and ethical issues involved with the acquisition and use of genomic data. 
SIG/BIO interests will span from the theoretical -- application of 
information science principles to the understanding of genomic sequences 
-- to the practical -- navigation and mediated use of genomics and 
proteomics databases in corporate, academic and public contexts."</p>

<p>Once SIG/BIO has been established, bridges to and collaborative
partnerships with other organizations and SIGs will also be pursued.
Such groups as the Molecular Biology and
Genomics SIG

and the International Society for
Computational Biology
<&lt;<a href="http://www.iscb.org/">http://www.iscb.org</a>&gt; 
all appear to have overlapping interests with
SIG/BIO. They represent not only a source of prospective members, but
also a source of new ideas and intellectual cross-fertilization.</p>

<p>In the dialog that ensued after that initial announcement, nearly 50 
people responded with interest. This is a great start, but we still need 
more "subscribers" (and ASIST members) to make SIG/BIO a reality -- in 
order to satisfy the organization's bylaws about chartering and 
supporting a SIG.  If you are interested, please respond; if you know 
others who might be interested, pass the word.  Contact the author

indicate interest or ask questions, and your name/e-mail will be added to 
our list.</p>

<p>Until we get off the ground, a "virtual SIG" has been set up.  Its

<p>
The Defense Virtual Library (DVL), sponsored by the Defense Technical Information Center, is a pilot digital library implementation which serves as a testbed for DARPA-funded research, including CNRI’s Digital Object Architecture. Collections include still and moving images, and sound materials.  Complex digital objects will be added within the next few months.</p>  

<p>Metadata issues have received considerable attention from the beginning of the project.  Early on, the decision was made to format the metadata according to US MARC standards.  Silver Image Management &lt;<a href="http://dvl.dtic.mil:8100/silver-image.html">http://dvl.dtic.mil:8100/silver-image.html</a>&gt; was selected as the consultant to assist with development of guidelines for creating metadata for each of the media formats, and with creating the data and MARC-like databases.</p>

<p>Manuals for the three media formats (still images, moving images, and sound) are accessible in PDF format on DVL's Project Notes page at &lt;<a href="http://dvl.dtic.mil:8100/notes.html">http://dvl.dtic.mil:8100/notes.html</a>&gt;.  A fourth metadata guidelines manual for complex digital objects is planned for Summer 2001.</p> 
	
<p>While the need to develop solid practices for creating resource discovery metadata was apparent from project inception, it also quickly became clear that additional technical metadata would be required for adequate management and preservation of digital materials.  The DVL project officers, again assisted by Silver Image Management, are currently working to determine what technical metadata is required in DVL and how it should be formulated. The Metadata Guidelines for Moving Images, [dated Oct 11, 2000, starting on page 117] shows a first cut at that determination. Our thinking in this area has been influenced by the OAIS model and we expect to continue to draw on the work underway at CEDARS, NLA, and NEDLIB.  XML is under serious consideration as the tool to create and maintain the technical metadata.</p>

<p>The Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology is
 launching a program of grants for researchers in residence. With this new program, the Foundation hopes to foster critical thinking about how technologies affect people and their natural and cultural environments.</p>

<p>Following an international competition open to historians, curators, critics, independent researchers, artists and scientists in various fields, including computer science and related areas of social science, the Foundation will enable two researchers to work in the collections and archives of the Centre for Research and Documentation (CR+D). Each year, the Foundation will announce the research topics that researchers' proposals must address. For 2001-2002, the topics are: Technological, artistic and aesthetic history of computer animation, and Conceptual, scientific and artistic issues involved in preserving digital artworks or works with digital components. Twice a year, the CR+D will welcome a researcher for three to six months. The researchers will be given access to computer and audiovisual equipment, the Foundation's database, and
its entire collection of documentation. The researchers in residence will be required to publish their research findings on the Foundation's Web site.</p>

<p>Bethesda, MD, USA – (April 19, 2001) NISO, the National Information
Standards Organization, announces the release of Guidelines for
Information
About Preservation Products (Z39.77-2001).  This new standard identifies
the
information vendors should feature in catalogs and promotional literature
describing products used to store, bind, or repair a variety of library
holdings including books, pamphlets, sound recordings, videos, films,
CDs,
manuscripts, maps, and photographs. Librarians and archivists who use
these
products will benefit from these guidelines as they compare and evaluate
products.</p>

<p>The purpose of this standard is to encourage and promote the use of
consistent language and to help vendors provide accurate information
about
preservation products used for storage, binding, and repair of library
materials. The impetus to create this standard came in response to
concerns
expressed by librarians and archivists of the need for a qualitative
means
of evaluating preservation products. To help the librarians and vendors
use
the standard, there is a glossary that defines technical terms and a
set
of references to related standards.</p>

<p>NISO gratefully acknowledges the efforts of the following people who were
members of this committee at the time this standard was approved: Mark
Roosa
(Chair), Library of Congress; Harry Campbell, Etherington Conservation
Center, a division of Information Conservation Inc.; Jesse Munn, Library
of
Congress; Nancy Schrock, Harvard College Library; and Abby Shaw,
Conservation Resources International.</p>

<p>In December 2000, bepress.com, the Berkeley Electronic Press, was launched. It was founded by three University of California, Berkeley, professors. As scholarly authors and editors themselves, they realized that the journal publication process was plagued by inefficiencies. Characterized by slow time to market, typesetting gaffes, an inequitable revenue split between contributor and publisher, and exorbitant subscription rates, the scholarly journal system was broken, and bepress.com was born from these frustrations.</p>

<p>The bepress system aims to put the reader and scholarly author into direct contact at low cost without error or delay  by producing  quality, peer-reviewed scholarly journals over the Internet. Among the unique features of the bepress model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refereed publication within 10 weeks</li>
<li>Quality-rating by prominent reviewers and editors</li>
<li>Feedback and forums among authors and readers</li>
<li>Easy, anytime-anywhere access to content</li>
<li>Email notification of new  publications, tailored to readers’ interests</li>
<li>Links between and among related articles</li>
<li>Simple electronic submission and revision for authors</li>
<li>Comprehensive tracking and publication system for editors, via EdiKit</li>
</ul>

To learn more about bepress.com advantages, see &lt;<a href="http://www.bepress.com/advantages.html">http://www.bepress.com/advantages.html</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>Inaugural bepress titles -- <em>The B.E. Journals in Macroeconomics</em>, <em>The B.E. Journals in Theoretical Economics</em>, and <em>The Global Jurist -- are available free of charge for a limited time at &lt;<a href="http://www.bepress.com">http://www.bepress.com</em></a>&gt;.  When the journals transition to a subscription model, bepress.com hopes to attract support within the library community by offering quality content backed by library-friendly policies:</p>
<ul><li>bepress.com is committed to providing quality peer-reviewed journals at an affordable price.  To this end, the subscription cost of bepress economics journals will be at least 33% below the discipline average.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Licenses to bepress.com journals will include a permanent archiving solution.  Libraries will have perpetual access to the electronic content to which they subscribe.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Access to bepress.com journals will be unrestricted within a subscribing community.  No seat license or simultaneous user caps to administer and enforce.</li></ul>

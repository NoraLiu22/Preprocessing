              Marie's research program-- to identify and isolate radioactive elements--intensified. 
              In part she was spurred on by a challenge from an unexpected quarter. 
              In a letter to the editor on the front page of <i>The London Times</i> 
              of August 9, 1906, Pierre's longtime fan Lord Kelvin advanced a 
              theory that radium was no element but rather a compound of lead 
              and five helium atoms. Since the theory threatened the entire science 
              of radioactivity, Marie began lab work to disprove it -- and more 
              generally to put her discovery on such a firm basis that nobody 
              could doubt it. </font></p>
            <font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Enlisting the aid of 
            her old colleague Andr&eacute; Debierne, she eventually confirmed that radium 
            was indeed an element. It was an effort of years to measure the atomic 
            weight of radium beyond question and thus firmly locate the element 
            in <a href="periodic.htm">the Periodic Table</a>. But the measurements

              a lab worthy of Pierre's memory. She had her fame, her friends, 
              and her fierce determination. A substantial grant in 1907 from an 
              American philanthropist enabled her to assemble a research staff, 
              but that was only a start. It helped that in the little world of 
              the Paris elite, the professors in Curie's circle were on good terms 
              with politicians in the left-leaning parties that controlled the 
              French government. These politicians agreed with the professors' 
              ideals--rational science was the vanguard of human progress. Yielding 
              to persuasion, the government-funded University of Paris joined 
              the private Pasteur Foundation to fund a Radium Institute. Marie 
              Curie would supervise one of its divisions, a radioactivity laboratory, 
              while an eminent physician would supervise the second division, 
              a medical research laboratory. </font></p>

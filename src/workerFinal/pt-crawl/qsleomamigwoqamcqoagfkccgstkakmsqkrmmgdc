                    <div>I had a dream that I was wearing a really cool wig.
(A really cool wig. A really cool wig.)
Cuz I was Google Image Searching for a really cool wig.
(A really cool wig. A really cool wig.)

AND IT WAS REALLY COOL. AND IT WAS REALLY FLY.
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHAT THE FUCK IT LOOKED LIKE.
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE JEALOUS, EXCEPT MY BLIND FRIENDS.
IF ONLY THEY COULD SEE my really cool wig.
my really cool wig. my really cool wig.

And I was at a party hanging out with Mos Def.
Nobody else was dancing so I danced with Mos Def.
(I danced with Mos Def. I danced with Mos Def.)

WE DID AN AWESOME DANCE. WE HAD AN AWESOME TIME.
WE STARTED MAKING OUT, BUT THEN SOME PIZZA ARRIVED -- FUCK YES!
WE ATE THE WHOLE PIZZA, AND THE ENTIRE TIME
I NEVER TOOK OFF my really cool wig.
my really cool wig. my really cool wig.
MY REALLY COOL WIG. MY REALLY COOL WIG. MY REALLY COOL WIG.
MY MEGA RAD WIG. MY HELLA SWEET WIG. MY HOLY SHIT WIG.
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

When I woke up I was feeling pretty good, I must say.
(I really felt great. I really felt great.)
I started Google Image Searching for my wig right away.
(Before it could fade. Before it could fade)

I LOOKED AT EVERY PICTURE. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME.
BUT I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHAT THE FUCK IT LOOKED LIKE.
I DON&#39;T WANT FAME AND FORTUNE. I DON&#39;T WANT A HAPPY LIFE.
I JUST WANT TO DIE IN my really cool wig.
my really cool wig. my really cool wig.

MY REALLY COOL WIG. MY REALLY COOL WIG. MY REALLY COOL WIG.
MY WICKED TIGHT WIG. MY CRAZY SICK WIG. MY GANGSTA ASS WIG.
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

                    <div>Jaws the shark!
Lurking in the dark of the depths of sea, one day on a lark
Decides to get rowdy, get real violent
Takes a vay-cay up to Amity Island

Sunshine lotion fun in sun
Blood in the ocean, everybody run
Cuz it&#39;s crazy how few fucks this shark gives
He&#39;ll eat naked ladies! He&#39;ll eat little kids!
Oh no!
 
But the one thing keeping the commmunity safe
is a guy named Brody and his pal Richard Dreyfuss
Jaws don&#39;t know that a storm&#39;s gonna come
He just wants everyone to be his chum, get it? get it

The mayor don&#39;t care if the townsfolk die
He doesn&#39;t want to spoil the fourth of July
He&#39;s like, &quot;Everyone cool it, and go for swim!&quot;
But holy shit here comes that fin!!

JAWS IS HERE
HERE IS JAWS
(He is a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie you should watch it it&#39;s called Jaws
JAWS IS HERE
HERE IS JAWS
(He is a shark who fights the law)
He was in a movie that everyone saw

Long story short, the beach gets closed
The mayor&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, yeah this blows&quot;
Suddenly Jaws has got a price on his head
But the wrong little shark baby ends up dead

It was Jaws&#39; little brother! Now he&#39;s pissed
The mayor just shot to the top of his list
He sneaks in his house in the middle of the night
and he eats that fucker in a single bite
Golly

Now the mayor&#39;s dead, so Brody&#39;s in charge
He knows the real killer is still at large
So he and the Dreyfuss make a decision
They&#39;re going on a mission
They&#39;re gonna go FISHIN&#39;
for Jaws

A man named Quint lets them use his boat
on the condition that he be the one to cut Jaws&#39; throat
Cuz he was a sailor back in World War II
And Jaws ate his entire crew, WOAH!

JAWS IS HERE
HERE IS JAWS
(He is a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie-- a movie called Jaws!
JAWS IS HERE
HERE IS JAWS
(He is a shark who fights the law)
He was in a movie that everyone saw

They&#39;re out on the sea. They wait all night.
Where could Jaws be? He&#39;s no where in sight.
Dreyfuss decides to go down in a cage
and Jaws shows up in a full on rage

He tears up the cage like paper in a shredder
While Dreyfuss&#39;s makes his wetsuit wetter
He hides behind a rock like cowardly prick
And he doesn&#39;t come back until the end of the flick

Brody&#39;s like, &quot;We&#39;re gonna need a bigger boat&quot;
So they go home and get a bigger boat
The biggest boat that&#39;s ever sailed
Gonna kick Jaws&#39; ass or I guess his tail. yeah his tail

but OH MY SHIT!
Jaws jumps out and Quint gets bit!
Right in half like a kit-kat bar!
Up in the sky there&#39;s a shooting star
That&#39;s Quint up in heaven. He&#39;s a star now

Brody&#39;s angry. He&#39;s all like, &quot;Fuck it&quot;
He takes a harpoon and welds it to a rocket
Jaws&#39; last words are, &quot;Woah-- respect&quot;
Then he explodes and it&#39;s a pretty good effect, yeah!

JAWS IS DEAD
LONG LIVE JAWS
(He was a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie, you should watch it, it&#39;s called Jaws
JAWS IS DEAD
LONG LIVE JAWS
(He was a shark who fought the law)
He was in a movie that everyone saw
(He was in a movie that everyone saw)
He was in a movie that everyone saw
JAWS IS DEAD
LONG LIVE JAWS
(He was a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie, called Jaws
He was in a movie that everyone saw
(JAWS IS DEAD)
At the Academy Awards
(LONG LIVE JAWS)
He was robbed
(He was a shark without a cause)
Sharks exist in real life, woah
(He was in a movie that everyone saw)
Jaws is dead
Long live jaws</div>

Gonna show you my beautiful basement.
Where the concrete floor feels cool to the touch.
I&#39;ll turn up the heat if it&#39;s too much.
I&#39;ll turn on the lightbulb on the wire.
Turn on the dehumidifier.
I&#39;m serious when I flick this next switch.
Look you in the eye, and I say, &quot;Check this.&quot;

My trains, uh.
My trains, uh.
I got small ones. Tiny little trains.
I come down here just to get away.

It&#39;s like magic. Magic trains.
I wish these trains could take me away.

In the club, the Model Railroad Club,
A motherfucker said shit about my trains.
Might as well have took a shit on my brain
Cuz I went insane.
I laid track on his ass with a styrofoam bat.
But the president never did let me back after that.
Shit, I said, &quot;Fuck you.
Who the fuck needs a punk ass choo-choo crew anyhoo?&quot;
My trains, uh.
My trains, uh.
I got small ones. Tiny little trains.
I come down here just to get away.
My trains, uh.

It&#39;s like magic. Magic trains.
I wish these trains could take me away.

(chugga chugga woo-woo)
(chugga chugga woo-woo)

I lie here every night.
I feel like if I focus
and think of getting smaller
I&#39;ll gradually get smaller.
And if I get small enough
My trains will seem much bigger
and I&#39;ll be the conductor.
The tiniest conductor.

OH!
Then whatchu gonna do?
Then whatchu gonna do?
Whatchu gonna do then, huh?
Whatchu gonna do?
Whatchu gonna do?
Whatchu gonna do when I&#39;m fucking small
Like one inch tall
You won&#39;t see me coming at all
When I crawl into your ear late at night
Yeah, you heard me right motherfucker, sleep tight
And you think I&#39;m just another bad dream
But I&#39;m a tiny little man in your bloodstream
Little hands hold an artery shut
Yeah, that&#39;s right motherfucker, then what?

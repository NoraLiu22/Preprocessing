<h3>Data Distribution Over the Web</h3></a>
<p>
In the last year, many Web surfers interested in VRML (Virtual Reality
Modeling Language) files have found themselves visiting the NCSA
Astronomy Digital Image Library (ADIL) [<a href="#note1">1</a>] to
view 3-D visualizations [<a href="#note2">2</a>] of a galaxy or an
interstellar cloud.  Others, perhaps looking for images of the Milky
Way, have caught a glimpse of what the center of our galaxy [<a
href="#note3">3</a>] looks like in radio waves.  It would seem that a
such an image-ready medium like the World Wide Web would be a perfect
fit for such an image-oriented field as astronomy.  Indeed, judging
from the public response to the ADIL and related astronomy resources
(such as the hugely popular Mars Pathfinder site from NASA [<a
href="#note4">4</a>] and public gallery from the Hubble Space
Telescope [<a href="#note5">5</a>]), the Web has proved to be
extremely successful in distributing science to the general
public. The Web, of course, has also been important for distributing
that same science throughout the scientific community as well;
however, making the network an effective tool for scientists through
the distribution of research-quality data presents a number of
challenges.  <p>
 
The NCSA Astronomy Digital Image Library was developed with support
from NASA and the National Science Foundation to address some of the
challenges of distributing scientific data over the network.  Its
specific mission is to collect fully processed astronomical images in
FITS format (a standard astronomical image
format [<a href="#note6">6</a>]) and make them
available to the research community and the interested public via the
World Wide Web.  The research component itself has two sides, which I
will discuss in this story:  on the one side, the ADIL allows users to
search, browse, and download astronomical images.  This can be
non-trivial when the images are not in the usual GIF or JPEG formats.
On the other side, the ADIL provides researchers with a place to
archive and share their fully-processed images with the community by
allowing them to add the images to the Library's collection. <p>

ADIL can be thought of as a place to search for and store data.  But
it is also a tool that strives to work at a high conceptual level,
providing a bridge between data and astronomical ideas.  This is
accomplished in part through links between the images and other
electronic data including, in particular, scientific literature.  In
fact, today, the majority of current refereed journal literature is
available on-line, either as abstracts or full articles.
Interconnecting astronomical resources on the network has been the
topic of considerable effort within the community which I will discuss
in a follow-up story (to appear in the February 1998 issue of <b>D-Lib</b>).
With such connections to the scientific literature, the ADIL can be
more than just a repository for astronomical images; it can be a part
of the presentation of scientific results.  Astronomers can now
publish scientific data to a level not previously possible.  In this
way, we hope that the ADIL and resources like it will change the way
astronomers do research.  <p>

<a name="whyFITS">
<h3>Why FITS?</h3></a>
<p>

Many of the complications of running a scientific data library trace
back to two characteristics of the basic data items being serverd: the
item's file type and size.  The ADIL stores and distributes its images
in FITS format, which is not a file type generally supported by the
Web.  Why not use GIF or JPEG?  To understand why these formats are
not appropriate for scientific data, consider the difference between
<em>scientific images</em> and the usual sort of images one finds on
the network. <p> 

The biggest difference is that, to a scientist, an image is
multi-dimensional, regularly-sampled array of measurements.  This
means first of all that the image is not restricted to two (or even
three) dimensions.  Second, the value at each pixel represents a
scientific measurement or quantity, such as brightness, temperature,
or magnetic field strength.  The value could be an integer or
floating-point number or something more complex.  In contrast, the
value in GIF pixel is an index into some color table.  A scientific
image often contains no notion of color.  The application of a color
table to a scientific images is usually applied only during
visualization.  The visualization process usually causes a loss of
information in the image (e.g. one might only have 256 colors) in
order to highlight some particular feature of the data.  <p>

The other important feature of a scientific image is its associated
<em>metadata</em>.  The metadata are the ancillary data needed to
properly interpret the basic image data.  They include basic
information like the number of dimensions in the image, image size,
and data type contained in each pixel which allow the data to be read
in properly by application programs.  They also include information
necessary to properly analyze the data.  For an astronomical image,
the metadata might include information like the telescope used, the
observing frequency, the position in the sky, and the name of the
object in the image.  Such information plays an important role when
searching for and browsing images in a library.  Thus, a scientific
format must not only be able to support a scientist's notion of an
image, it must also be able to store necessary metadata needed to
handle that image.  <p>

The other important concern for handling scientific data is the size
of the individual data items.  There is no restriction on how big a
FITS file can be, and in practice, they can be between a few hundred
kilobytes to several hundreds of megabytes in size.  Downloading such
files through today's Internet is a slow operation; therefore, the
data library must have effective ways of <em>browsing</em> the
data -- that is, finding out what's in the data without downloading it
all.  <p>

<a name="visit">
<h3>A Visit to the Library</h3></a>
<p>
For web surfers, the ADIL home page [<a href="#note1">1</a>]
provides links to various highlights of the Library's contents.  An
astronomer visiting the ADIL, however, normally would first go to the
Library's Query Page [<a href="#note7">7</a>].  This HTML form
allows the user to search for images using a variety of criteria,
including: 

<ul>
  <li> sky position
  <li> frequency 
  <li> object name or type (e.g. galaxy, cloud, etc.)
  <li> image origin: author, title, and telescope
</ul>

As an example, the user could enter "supernova" in the "Object Type"
box and press the "Submit Query" button, and a list of matching images
would appear in a Results Page.  For each image, the page lists some
of the metadata associated with the image so that the user gets some
idea of what the image contains.  From this page, the user can
download any of the matched images; however, most users would browse
the images by clicking on the links to their Preview Pages.  <p>

The purpose of the Preview page is to give as much information as
possible so that the users can determine what is in the image and
whether they should download it for further analysis.  This is done
through the formatted presentation of the image metadata, a preview
image, and links to further information.  For example, a typical
Preview Page contains the title and authors and a digest of the image
header (see <a href="#fig2"">Figure 2</a>).  The preview image is a
visualization of the FITS image in GIF format.  Often, the image is
subsampled to allow it to be downloaded quickly.  If the FITS image
has more than two dimensions, a typical 2-D subimage is chosen for
previewing.  There are links for further browsing of related data,
including an abstract and the full FITS header.  If the image does
have more than two dimensions, there is a link to a "Movie Page" which
allows the user to browse other 2D frames from the image.  <p>

about the image as well as links to other information.  Note the link
just below the preview image labeled "Reference"; this anchor links
the image to the related journal abstract.
</td></tr>
</table>
</center><p>

One important link found on the preview page (located just the preview
image) is labeled "Reference".  This is a link to the abstract in a
related published article.  These abstracts are provided by another
astronomical data provider, the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)
[<a href="#note9">9</a>].  This link helps facilitate the connection
between the data and the science it represents.  In cooperation with
the ADIL, the ADS provides similar links between the abstracts and
related data in the ADIL.  Thus, users browsing abstracts at
the ADS site can easily access the data that went into that article
stored in the ADIL.  <p>

It is interesting to note that many of the astronomical data providers
available on the network have similar schemes for searching and
browsing data.  However, the details of the data access differ greatly
because they are tailored to the particular data type they serve.
Thus, it is difficult to find all the information available everywhere
about "supernova"; currently, one must visit each site and use their
interface to conduct a search.  Efforts are underway to address this
problem which I will discuss in the follow-up article.
<p>
<a name="browse">
<h3>New Methods for Browsing</h3></a>
<p>
The standard ADIL scheme for browsing is a kind of <em>server-side
browsing</em>.  In this type of browsing, the server filters the data
and its metadata into a presentation in HTML format.  The ADIL has
been exploring other techniques for browsing its contents.  One
technique is the use of imagemaps for "visually searching" through a
collection of images.  For example, the Library contains a survey of
molecular gas in the Milky Way Galaxy made up of 720 images.  To
browse this collection, the user can access the survey's Project Page
[<a href="#note10">10</a>].  The image shown there represents the entire
portion of the sky covered by the survey.  By clicking on a location
in the image map, one can get a list of nearby images.  <p> 

The advent of Java allows us to explore techniques for <em>client-side
browsing</em>.  As an example, we have developed a Java Applet for
browsing large images</a> in the Library [<a href="#note11">11</a>].
This applet presents two views: a subsampled view of the image on the
left and a "zoomed" image on the right.  The zoomed view can be
updated by clicking on locations in the subsampled view.  The applet
also tracks coordinate positions as the user moves the mouse over the
image.  From our explorations of Java, we have found a number of
operations that are common to browsing all kinds of scientific images.
This has led to a project at NCSA to develop a package of reusable
Java classes for browsing scientific images.  This package, called the
Horizon Image Data Browser Package [<a href="#note12">12</a>] is
currently available as an alpha release.  A production release is
expected by Summer 1998.  <p>

The ADIL has also been exploring VRML as a way of browsing images.
As a 3-D equivalent to a GIF image, VRML can be used to create static
visualizations of 3D images.  The Library contains a number of
VRML visualizations [<a href="#note2">2</a>].  In addition, we are now
testing a VRML Server [<a href="#note13">13</a>] that allows users to
create their own 3D visualizations of images in the ADIL.  <p>
<a name="adding">
<h3>Adding to the Library's Collection</h3></a>
<p>
The ADIL is more than a tool for astronomers looking for images to
augment their research.  It is also useful for authors who wish to
share their images with the community.  While many of the Library's
images come from observatories, the core of the collection comes from
individual authors.  The ADIL provides a way to upload the images to
the Library, along with any supporting data, where it can be processed
and made available to the Library users.  <p>

Authors deposit images into the Library in the form of collections we
refer to as "projects".  Normally, an author would make a deposit at the
end of some scientific study when the resulting publication is going
to press; all the fully processed images associated with that paper
would make up the project.  The main requirements for making a deposit
are:

<ul>
<li> the project must include at least one FITS image.
<li> the project must be associated with a scientific publication that describes the purpose and results of the study that generated the images.
<li>the images must be fully processed; raw or uncalibrated images should not be included.  
</ul>

The point of these requirements is to ensure that the images are in a
form that is useful to others for further analysis and research.  This
means that users who download the image must be able to consult the
related literature to understand the scientific and observational
context of the images to interpret them properly.  They must also be
sufficiently calibrated and processed so that the user need not have
expertise processing that particular type of image in order to get
useful information from it.  <p>

In addition to the FITS images, the author can also include other
kinds of data files related to the project.  This could include table
data or special visualizations of the data, such as GIF images,
PostScript figures, animations, or VRML renderings.  <p>

When the author is ready to deposit, he or she first fills out an
on-line submission form.  Then, the author may either manually FTP the
files to the ADIL anonymous FTP server or, if running on a UNIX
platform, can download a customized script that uploads all the files
automatically.  <p>

When a project is processed and placed on the Library's "shelves", it
is given a unique <em>codename</em> (e.g. <code>95.RP.01</code> for
the first project deposited by Raymond Plante in 1995).  When this
codename is appended to a standard URL base (e.g.
<a href="http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/document/95.RP.01">
http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/document/95.RP.01</a>), the
corresponding Project Page can be accessed directly.  Items within the
project also have codenames (e.g. 95.RP.01.02 for the second image in
that project).  Thus, every item in the library can be accessed via a
unique URL.  We encourage authors to cite these URLs in their
published articles.  For example, one might refer to an animation
sequence that illustrates a feature of the data that cannot be
conveyed as well with traditional 2D visualizations. 
<p>
<a name="backend">
<h3>Behind the Desk: the Library Backend</h3></a>
<p>
For more information about what goes on "behind the desk" at the ADIL,
consult the "Overview of the ADIL System" [<a href="#note14">14</a>].
In summary, when an author makes a deposit to the Library, a
collection of programs, the "Electronic Librarian", engages to process
the deposit.  Metadata are extracted from FITS files and the inputs
from the submission form and loaded into the database system
(PostgreSQL) used for searching for images.  The files are then
archived in long term storage and moved to the "Library Shelves",
making them available over the Web.  Although this process is largely
automated, the Human Librarian still plays an important role.  The
metadata, which allow the image to be located in a search, are not
always contained in the FITS file or the submission form filled out by
the user.  The metadata that can be extracted might also be
inaccurate.  The human, therefore, is important for catching typos and
making sure the metadata that get loaded into the database make sense.

The ADIL storage model employs primary, secondary, and tertiary
storage to hold the data.  The primary storage are locally mounted
hard drives containing the database, metadata used for constructing
Preview Pages on-the-fly, and GIF preview images.  These are kept on
disk all the time for immediate user access.  The secondary storage is
comprised of fourteen gigabytes of local disk operated as a cache and
which is used to store the actual FITS images.  If the user downloads
an image, the system first looks for it in the cache; if it is not
there, it is automatically transferred from the tertiary (long-term)
storage and delivered to the user.  The cache's purging policy is
designed to remove the largest files that have not been accessed
recently first.  <p>

The ADIL uses the NCSA Mass Storage System (MSS) for its tertiary,
long-term storage.  This system is based on a bank of fast IBM Magstar
tape drives (loaded by a robotic juke box) and more than 285 Gigabytes
of its own disk cache.  The drives feature a data rate of
9 Megabytes/second, and they can seek to any position in their
10-Gigabyte tapes in less than 60 seconds.  The MSS is connected to
the ADIL server with an FDDI network connection providing
100 Megabits/second transfer rates.  Because of the cache's purging
policy, transfer from MSS usually happens for only the larger images.
Given the performance of the MSS, the bottleneck during the download
of a large file to a remote workstation is almost always the Internet
itself.  <p>

<a name="publish">
<h3>Data Archiving and Data Publishing</h3></a>
<p>
Prior to the Web and the ADIL, sharing data with one's colleagues was
a difficult task.  If an astronomer needed copy of someone else's
data, he would have to contact the author of the data directly.
Unless the author had been working with the data recently, she might
have to go to considerable effort to locate the data on tape, make a
copy, and then send it to the colleague who made the request.  Given
the effort necessary, there was a good chance that the data would not
get transferred in a timely period--if at all.  <p>

Today, there are a number of centers distributing data over the
network, including image data.  Some serve as archives for raw or
unprocessed data (such as the ASCA X-ray Telescope archive
[<a href="#note15">15</a>]) while others serve data that are
essentially fully processed and ready for analysis.  An example of the
latter is the NASA SkyView archive [<a href="#note16">16</a>] which
serves data from a number of large survey projects.  It is important
to note that it is not the goal ADIL to mirror data that is available
from other (permanent) archives.  Such archives are usually associated
with large observatories or projects (such as NASA space observing
missions) which can afford to include data repository as part of the
overall mission.  However, many images that produce published results
come from smaller observatories that do not have publicly available
archives.  A resource like the ADIL is particularly important to
astronomers conducting smaller-scale surveys, such as a recent
chemical study of the Taurus Molecular cloud which includes images of
over 20 different chemical species [<a href="#note17">17</a>].  Such
comprehensive projects can form the cornerstone of many future studies
as long <em>as the data can be effectively distributed.</em> <p>

The availability of a variety of astronomical data on-line is already
beginning to affect the way astronomers do research.  At this time,
the ADIL contains about 5,000 images representing over 13 gigabytes of
data.  These numbers are small compare to the library's capacity as
well as its potential as a research tool; however, as the collection
grows, the power of the Library will become more apparent.  With a
large variety of data available, astronomers can carry out
multi-frequency studies of objects or a class of objects, comparing
previously observed data with new data.  Many questions in science can
only be effectively addressed when a large amount of data exists,
spanning many different objects, positions in the sky, or frequency
bands.  Previous observations are also very valuable in planning new
projects.  <p>

The unique URLs for ADIL items provide a way to link the data to other
information on the Web including the scientific literature.
Transparent links between the literature and the data serve to pull
the data into the publishing process.  We envision a major shift in
the norms of publishing in which data is published at same time as a
refereed article.  <p>

This future, of course, requires a cultural change within the
community.  Admittedly, many scientists might feel overly exposed to
scrutiny if their images were available in an analyzable format.
Some are concerned that publishing the data might "give away" research
they might do in the future.  Such concerns may never go away,
preventing some data from ever becoming public.  Nevertheless,
astronomers are becoming more accustomed to having easy access to data.
I, therefore, see that having one's images available on-line will help
promote the scientific results they produced, because other
researchers that make use of the images are obligated to cite the
previous work.  In the end, a resource like the ADIL helps to complete
the loop of scientific investigation: easy access to previous data
makes it easier pose new questions and initiate new studies.  <p>

					<h3 class="line">Background</h3>

						<div class="span4">
							<p align="left">Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy.&nbsp;In addition, education may improve people's lives in such areas as health, civic participation, political interest and happiness. Studies show that educated individuals live longer, participate more actively in politics and in the community where they live, commit fewer crimes and rely less on social assistance.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Years in education</em></p>
<p align="left">In a fast-changing knowledge economy, education is about learning skills for life. But how many years of school, college, or training will future generations expect to have? The answer is that on average in the OECD,&nbsp;<strong>people can expect to go through about 18 years of education</strong>, judging by the number of people between the ages of 5 and 39 currently in school. Results range from about 14 years of education in Colombia, to over 20 years in Australia.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Educational attainment</em></p>
<p align="left">Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to have a good quality of life. Highly-educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends, typically because educational attainment makes an individual more attractive in the workforce. Lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained.</p>
<p align="left">Furthermore, the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. This shift in demand has made an upper secondary degree, or high-school degree, the minimum credential for finding a job in almost all OECD countries.&nbsp;High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>On average, about 79% of adults aged 25-64 within the OECD have completed upper secondary education</strong>. In 33OECD countries and the Russian Federation,&nbsp;<strong>60% or more of the population aged 25 to 64 has completed at least upper secondary education</strong>. In some countries, the opposite is true: in Colombia, Mexico and Turkey, 57% or more of the population aged 25 to 64 have not completed upper secondary education. Women are, however, more likely to complete a tertiary or university degree than men in most OECD countries, a reversal of the historical pattern. On average across OECD countries,&nbsp;<strong>42% of women aged 25-64 attain a tertiary education compared with 35% of men</strong></p>
						</div><!-- /span4 -->

						<div class="span4">
							<p align="left"><em>Students' skills</em></p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students near the end of their compulsory education (usually around age 15) have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies, particularly in reading, mathematics and science.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="left">In 2018, PISA tested students from 79&nbsp;countries, including OECD countries, Brazil, the Russian Federation and South Africa. The students were tested on their reading ability, their skills in maths and level in sciences. Research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school or in post-formal education.&nbsp;<strong>The average student in the OECD area scored 488</strong>. On average in the OECD,&nbsp;<strong>girls scored 491 compared with 485 for boys.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Estonia is the highest-performing OECD country, with average PISA scores of 526, followed by Japan and Korea with 520 points. The lowest performing OECD country, Colombia, has an average score of 406. This means that the gap between the highest and lowest performing OECD countries is 120 points.</p>
<p align="left">The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students. InCanada, Estonia, Finland and Ireland for&nbsp;example, students tend to perform well regardless of their social background. In Israel and Luxembourg however, the gap between the students with the lowest socio-economic background and the students with the highest socio-economic background reaches more than 120 points, suggesting students' socio-economic background tends to have an impact on their results.&nbsp;<strong>On average across OECD countries, there is a widening 89-point difference in PISA scores between the students with the highest and lowest socio-economic background.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><em>&ldquo;Childcare support and child-minder service&rdquo; pilot project</em></p>
<p align="left">In 2013 the Latvian government launched the &ldquo;Childcare support and child-minder service&rdquo; pilot project to help parents finance childcare for children aged 1.5-4 years who do not have access to public childcare. The financing was provided until the end of 2015 in order to solve the problem of long waiting lists for public kindergarten registration.</p>
<p align="left">Given that family troubles and insufficient family support networks are the major causes of children dropping out of primary school, a pilot project in the Latvian city of Cēsis aimed to reduce dropout rates and improve the social support system for families and children. Through the&ldquo;Hand-in-hand for child support&rdquo; project, 28 people were trained to work directly with parents in early childhood education, care institutions and primary schools. The overall objective of the 2008-10 project was to develop mechanisms that detect when support for students and their families is needed, and to ensure that these students and families receive timely assistance. The project worked to improve co-operation between students, parents, schools and other local government institutions in order to solve various everyday issues regarding children and their families.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Collaborating to advance skills</em></p>
<p align="left">The South African government and non-governmental organisations have engaged in a number of initiatives to develop skills. The Massive Open Online Varsity (MOOV) project provides greater access to quality education through online courses from across the world. MOOV centres were set up in 12 public libraries in Johannesburg, targeting poor areas. Each centre accommodates 50 students and there are no fees or entry requirements. In the first 12 months after the project was launched, 8 000 students were registered and over 500 certificates from accrediting institutions were earned.</p>
<p align="left">The National Skills Fund is primarily used for investment in education and training, skills infrastructure development and skills development research. Examples of projects co-funded by the Fund include the Itukise Internships for Unemployed Graduates Programme and a dual-track apprenticeship pilot. The Itukise programme offers a paid 12-month internship in the private sector to help unemployed graduates get relevant work experience. In the first two years, around 1 500 people were placed in 169 companies. The dual-track apprenticeship pilot is based on the German and Swiss systems, combining school-based and workplace-based training. First implemented on three sites, the pilot has helped both colleges and employers, but more needs to be done to encourage employers to participate.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Increasing education resources</em></p>
<p align="left">The Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Development Initiative (ASIDI) programme was a one-off project to upgrade the infrastructure of 400 schools. The programme was expanded to address shortages of learning materials such as textbooks. Between 2013/14 and 2014/15 the share of learners with access to required textbooks in all grades and subjects increased from 92% to close to 100% coverage. Gauteng province has also committed to expanding the use of technology in education. It has started a pilot using smart boards, tablets and the requisite connectivity in selected schools in poor areas. Smart board technology is also available for grade 12 teaching in all public schools in the province.</p>
<p align="left">Teacher shortages are a longstanding problem in South Africa. To encourage more students into the teaching profession, the Funza Lushaka bursary programme for teaching studies has been increased by just under ZAR 100 million. This has supported the entry of nearly 10 000 newly qualified teachers into the system since 2013.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money.</p>
<p align="left">Australians can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>20.4 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, more than the OECD average of 18 years and the highest level in the OECD.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Australia,&nbsp;<strong>84% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in Australia scored 499 in reading literacy, maths and sciences,&nbsp;</strong>above the OECD average of 488.&nbsp;The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em>Improving mental health and well-being of students</em></p>
<p align="left">KidsMatter encourages partnerships between education, early childhood, and health and community sectors to improve children's mental health and well-being.</p>
<p align="left">KidsMatter Early Childhood is run in preschools, kindergartens and long day care services. This programme supports early childhood education and care practice and connects educators, children, families, management, and community and health professionals.</p>
<p align="left">KidsMatter Primary uses a whole-school approach to develop and implement evidence-based mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention strategies. The framework consists of four key areas: positive school community; social and emotional learning for students; parenting support and education; and early intervention for students experiencing mental health difficulties.</p>
<p align="left">Initially piloted in 101 schools in 2007-08, KidsMatter has been expanded after an evaluation found a general improvement in student mental health and well-being, including optimism, coping skills, and behaviours. Teacher capacity and knowledge were also enhanced, providing greater support for children and their families.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Helping youth stay in school</em></p>
<p align="left">Austria's Youth Coaching programme helps kids stay in school and re-engages those who have already left. Youth Coaches help participants set targets and offer support services such as consultations and educational counselling. External experts such as social workers and psychologists are also consulted when necessary. These support services are available to young people in their ninth school year, youth not in employment, education or training (NEETs) under the age of 19, and young people with a disability or special educational needs under the age of 25. The programme is organised in a three-step process that must be completed within one year.</p>
<p align="left">Though still in its trial phase, Youth Coaching is functioning as a useful hub for carers. Of the participants in the programme, only 7% have dropped out and 85% have successfully achieved outcomes in line with their goals. More harmonisation of the programme and better outreach methods are needed to improve the programme.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Reforming education for better outcomes </em></p>
<p align="left">Though educational attainment in Belgium is high, it has slowed in recent years and too many young people do not successfully complete upper-secondary school. Both the French and Flemish Communities are engaging in educational reforms to better integrate migrants and address the current slowdown in school completion.</p>
<p align="left">The French Community is currently rolling out a reform programme on compulsory education (2015-2025), which grants schools and teachers with greater autonomy and requires underperforming schools to draw up plans to tackle low achievement, provide on-the-job teacher training, and improve social, cultural and pedagogical diversity training. The Flemish government is implementing a &nbsp;reform to enhance teacher training and modernise secondary education. The region has also already recruited extra language support in pre-primary, primary and secondary education to help migrant children succeed. These initiatives all include upgrades to vocational education to better match skills with the labour market. They are considered a step in the right direction in improving outcomes and preserving Belgium&rsquo;s comparative advantage in education.</p>

Targeted programmes have been successful supporting vulnerable populations attain higher levels of education.</p>
<p align="left">For example, the Pathways to Education Program helps youth from underprivileged communities complete secondary education. Parents, community agencies, volunteers, local school boards and secondary schools work collaboratively to provide four main types of support: academic tutoring, group and career mentoring, advocacy, and financial aid.</p>
<p align="left">In 2001, Pathways to Education was launched as a pilot in Toronto's Regent Park neighbourhood. By 2013, the programme expanded to an additional 12 neighbourhoods, including Aboriginal communities. A 2010 evaluation of the first five cohorts to participate in Pathways found that dropout rates fell from an exceptionally high 56% to less than 11.7%. Other positive results include reduced absenteeism rates, increased representation in the academic stream, and higher graduation and postsecondary education rates. In 2011/12, the amount of Pathways graduates enrolled in postsecondary education grew to 75%, compared to 61% of non-participants from the same neighbourhood.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. Chileans can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>17.4 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, similar to the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Chile,&nbsp;<strong>67%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Investing in youth</em></p>
<p align="left">Despite improvements in enrolment rates &ndash; nearly all children aged 5-17 are in school &ndash; performance and access to quality education is uneven. Chile's government has taken important measures to invest more in early childhood education and care, make schools more inclusive and reshape teacher careers. It is also promoting policies to improve access to quality tertiary education for students from medium and low socio-economic backgrounds. Recent education reforms aim to create better opportunities for vulnerable populations. Key objectives include: building more inclusive schools; reshaping teachers' careers; strengthening early childhood education and care; increasing the quality of primary, secondary and tertiary education; and reducing skill gaps across socio-economic groups.</p>
<p align="left">A law making kindergarten universal was enacted in 2013, and the government has made expanding early childhood education a high priority. The recently passed Inclusion and Equity Law stops the selection of student by public and private subsidised schools, a practice that disproportionately placed students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in poor performing schools. The law also disallows for-profit schools, eliminates co-payments, and increases funding for vulnerable students using a voucher system. The cessation of these practices is expected to narrow inequities by improving access to quality education.</p>

<p align="left">Estonia's Life-Long Learning Strategy 2014-2020 fixes measurable targets in areas such as life-long learning participation, the number of people with vocational qualifications, digital skills, the use of digital technology and equal opportunities. Progress is also measured by targets in labour market outcomes and numeracy and literacy skills. Multiple programmes are expected to work together to achieve these targets.</p>
<p align="left">It is too early to examine successes as programmes are still being developed and implemented. A nation-wide survey will be conducted to measure satisfaction every two years. The Strategy is expected to spur learning opportunities for people with weak labour market performance. Plans include changes in: assessment and evaluation principles, teacher training, content and volume of education programmes, and educational research. The government will work in co-operation with employers to better match skills learned at school to employer needs. The Adult Education Act sets quality standards and increases the visibility of adult training. The legislative base for launching a co-ordinated system that includes future skills forecasting and matching with labour market needs was also created.</p>

<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Most concretely, having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. Finns can expect to go through close to&nbsp;<strong>19.8&nbsp;years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, more than the OECD average of 18 years and one of the highest levels in the OECD.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market.

                        <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Highly respected teachers</em></p>
<p align="left">The trust that teachers enjoy in Finnish society is deserved and reflects the very high quality of their training. Finland has raised the social status of its teachers to a level where there are few occupations with higher status. University professors are among the most highly regarded of all professionals, and even the word for teacher is the same for school teachers as for university professors. In 2010, there were more than 10 applicants for each of the 660 available slots on university courses for training primary schoolteachers, making teaching one of the most sought-after professions.</p>
<p align="left">As a result of this competitive climate, teaching is now a highly selective occupation in Finland, with highly skilled, well-trained teachers spread throughout the country. While teachers in Finland have always enjoyed respect in society, a combination of raising the bar for entry and granting teachers greater autonomy over their classrooms and working conditions than their peers enjoy elsewhere has helped to raise the status of the profession. Teachers have earned the trust of parents and the wider society by their demonstrated capacity to use professional discretion and judgment in the way they manage their classrooms and respond to the challenge of helping virtually all students become successful learners.</p>
<p align="left">Since the 1980s, the Finnish system of accountability was redeveloped entirely from the bottom up. Teacher candidates are selected, in part, according to their capacity to convey their belief in the core mission of public education in Finland, which is deeply humanistic as well as civic and economic. The preparation they receive is designed to build a powerful sense of individual responsibility for the learning and well-being of all the students in their care. During their careers, they must combine the roles of researcher and practitioner. Teachers in Finland are not only expected to become familiar with the knowledge base in education and human development, but are also required to write a research-based thesis as the final requirement for the Master&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Encouraging entrepreneurship</em></p>
<p align="left">The Innolukio initiative encourages creative thinking and entrepreneurship at the general upper secondary school level. After-school activities include weekly exercises, videos, competitions and learning materials to support creativity. These experiences help students gain the knowledge and skills necessary for future work tasks.</p>
<p align="left">First implemented as a local initiative Innolukio has grown to include 320 upper secondary schools and 110 000 students by 2012/13. Success factors include the innovative learning environments, active use of advocates, successful management of publicity and focus on entrepreneurship education. The project also connects students to universities and businesses.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. The French can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>16.6 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, less than the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In France,&nbsp;<strong>81%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, above the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in France scored 494 in reading literacy, maths and sciences,&nbsp;</strong>above the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Preparing youth for employment</em></p>
<p align="left">French Second Chance Schools help young adults between 18 and 25 improve their skills to get a job. These schools target youth who have been out of school for over a year and do not have a diploma or qualifications. Students are offered individual education plans to boost their literacy, numeracy and ICT skills. This is complemented by a work placement to gain labour market skills and strong links with employers.</p>
<p align="left">Second Chance Schools were established in 107 local areas and reached 15 115 students by 2015. Evaluations show that the potential long-term effects of these schools on youth employability are promising. Over a three year period, 58% of students in the metropolitan area exited these schools with a labour market option in training (20%), jobs (17%), apprenticeships (12%), and subsidised employment (9%).</p>
<p align="left"><em>Developing employment through apprenticeships</em></p>
<p align="left">The Education Act 2013 aims to double number of students combining education with employment by 2020. Students in France can begin an apprenticeship at a variety of levels, including upper secondary, two-year post-secondary, bachelor and masters level qualifications. Enterprises offering apprenticeships receive tax credits and social security exemptions.</p>
<p align="left">Apprenticeships have grown in popularity, particularly at the tertiary or upper secondary level. For example, 75% of apprentices hired on the&nbsp;<em>contrat de professionalisation</em>, an apprenticeship-type contract for older workers and jobseekers, had at least an upper secondary qualification. By contrast, apprenticeships are much more difficult to access for young students and workers with lower qualifications. Apprenticeships account for only about a third of all vocational students in secondary education. Evidence shows that employment rates are higher for apprentices that have combined training in a company with study in an apprentice training centre compared to other graduates from vocational schools. The government plans to expand the access to apprenticeships at vocational secondary schools, notably at the lower-secondary level, strengthen links with enterprises and develop better guidance for students. This is the right approach to make apprenticeships more accessible for those who are most likely to benefit.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Best practices in vocational education and training (VET)</em></p>
<p align="left">Germany&rsquo;s successful vocational education model, based on a dual-apprenticeship system, has a long history and is widely respected. High school students can choose to either pursue academic upper secondary education at the end of compulsory education or follow a vocational path. The vocational stream includes a full-time vocational school or the dual-apprenticeship system.</p>
<p align="left">In the dual system, students divide their time between workplace training and training at school. The school provides both general education and occupation-specific education, while employers supervise and offer workplace training. Both the government and employers are highly engaged and have a central role in designing education. The involvement of employers in the dual system also means that the programmes can be adapted to meet local needs. The government regulates job quality through standardised, binding national training curricula so that the short-term needs of employers do not hinder the educational and economic goals of the system. Apprenticeship contracts are also protected by collectively agreed wages. In 2014, 48% of German upper secondary students were enrolled in vocational programmes, of which 86% participated in the dual-apprenticeship system.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><em>Boosting STEM skills</em></p>
<p align="left">The Little Scientists&rsquo; House initiative prioritises early childhood skills development in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The initiative was launched in 2016 to create enthusiasm among children for natural sciences and technology, promote co-construction in education processes, and promote basic competencies, such as learning, language, fine motor skills and social skills. Interest in STEM is encouraged through workshops and promotion days, as well as activities and educational programmes for day-care organisations through new local networks.</p>
<p align="left">Following an initial pilot involving 50 preschools in Berlin, the initiative was expanded across Germany into more than 20 000 preschools, daycare centres and primary schools. The Little Scientists&rsquo; House initiative is expected to extend its activities to a total of 47 000 institutions.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. The Irish can expect to go through about&nbsp;<strong>17.9 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, in line with the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>85%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in Ireland scored 505 in reading literacy, maths and sciences</strong>, above the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em>Helping students succeed</em></p>
<p align="left">The Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) plan is an ongoing national policy for educational inclusion. It targets disadvantaged children through a standardised system that identifies each school&rsquo;s socio-economic level. Resources and support are then offered to schools, school clusters and/or communities through an integrated School Support Programme based on their level of need. Initiatives include: early childhood education, targeted student-teacher ratios, the professionalisation of school leaders and teachers, access to an administrative principal, measures to target deficits in literacy and numeracy, additional funding for books and libraries, guidance counselling, and facilitated access to higher education.</p>
<p align="left">Results show that these initiatives have had a positive impact on reading and mathematics scores in both urban and rural schools. School completion rates also rose from 68.2% (for 2001-07 cohorts) to 80.1% (for 2006-12 cohorts). Evaluations are planned to pinpoint which aspects of the policy lead to the best outcomes and to improve the programme.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Effective vocational education and training</em></p>
<p align="left">Israel&rsquo;s post-secondary vocational education and training (VET) system is diverse, with relatively good labour market outcomes for graduates. Options include one-year technician studies and two-year practical engineering programmes, a wide range of shorter vocational courses under the Ministry of Economy, and professional certifications. These certifications can sometimes be taken&nbsp;at the end of an education programme, and sometimes as a stand-alone examination.</p>
<p align="left">There are also many vocational programmes at the bachelor's level and above in universities and other tertiary academic institutions. Bearing in mind the range of these different options, as well as diverse private sector sources, and targeted programmes directed at disadvantaged groups, the system offers options for most of the relevant client groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em>Changing educational practices</em></p>
<p align="left">Following the March 2011 earthquake in the Tohoku region, in northern Japan, the national, regional and local governments, together with the OECD, launched the OECD-Tohoku School project, to help students and teachers in the region strengthen 21st century skills, internationalisation and bottom-up innovation.</p>
<p align="left">The Tohoku School project has resulted in an open "innovation framework" characterised by distributed leadership, encouragement of internal diversity in local initiatives, voluntary experimentation with new pedagogies, and a strengthened sense of ownership among the participants. For example, in northern Fukushima, the project has begun to inspire changes involving external partners, such as business leaders and international partners, and encouraged co-operation between schools and the communities around them. Teachers work with their students and their communities on a problem threatening the livelihood of local farmers, as rumours about pollution have made it have to sell food grown there. Students and farmers worked together towards a solution, finally coming up with a fruit jelly, which has been selling well throughout Japan. For the farmers, this has meant a new future and hope, and for the students it has facilitated a shift from exam-focused academic study towards entrepreneurship, critical thinking, creativity and engaging with the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em>Combining work and school experience</em></p>
<p align="left">The Vocational High-School Advancement Plan (2010-15) aimed to build vocational schools based on industrial needs and sector-specific skills, favouring work over college admission after high-school graduation. Improving the quality and relevance of vocational education in Korea is a priority as the average employment rate of junior college graduates and specialised vocational high-school graduates was only 61% and 41%, respectively, in 2013.</p>
<p align="left">A cornerstone of the Plan was the creation of Meister schools, which allow students to combine work and study, based on the German craftsmen training model. There are now 41 Meister schools in Korea, with more than 16 000 students, and six more planned for 2016-17. The job placement rate for Meister school graduates is more than 90%, compared to only 44% for traditional vocational high schools.</p>
<p align="left">A second initiative is the Work-Study Dual System, which aims to involve 70 000 students/workers and 10 000 companies in an apprenticeship system, launching programmes in vocational high schools, junior college states and universities. As the majority of participating firms are SMEs, the system faces financial challenges. To limit the fiscal cost as the programme expands, it should be reformed to make it more profitable to firms and students; SMEs could establish joint training centres, for example.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Reforming education</em></p>
<p align="left">Mexico has implemented various reforms in recent years to improve educational attainment and outcomes. These reforms have prioritised a competence oriented curriculum, the professionalisation of educators, and made the evaluation and assessment system more transparent and accountable.</p>
<p align="left">Mexico has introduced mandatory full time education for all children aged 4-15 and is aiming for universal coverage by 2022. To support this transition Mexico has promoted a Full Time Schools Program, which should be fully implemented by 2018. The programme is expected to reach 40 000 schools and benefit approximately five million students.</p>
<p align="left">Although comparatively low for OECD countries, Mexico's educational attainment and outcomes have improved since 2000. Enrolment rates among 15-29 year-olds increased from 42% to 53% in 2012. Upper secondary graduation rates increased by 14 percentage points over the same period. Since 2003, PISA scores in mathematics have also improved among boys and girls by 30 and 26 points respectively.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Networks for better outcomes</em></p>
<p align="left">The Learning and Change Networks strategy brings schools, kura (Maori-language immersion schools), communities, professional providers and ministry officials together to improve schooling, blended learning and cultural responsiveness. First piloted in 2012 with 5 networks representing 45 schools and kuras, the strategy now includes about 55 networks involving around one-fifth of all schools and kuras. By removing, rather than creating, silos these networks bring New Zealand closer to achieving targets for student achievement. A key goal is to reach near universal achievement of the National Certificate of Education Achievement Level 2 qualification by 18-year-olds by 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><em>New teaching roles</em></p>
<p align="left">To improve achievement for all students, New Zealand introduced in 2015 four new roles within schools: Executive Principal, Expert Teacher, Lead Teacher and Change Principal. The roles provide teachers with opportunities for advancement within the classroom and embed a system-wide means of sharing expertise across schools. Each role attracts significant additional remuneration for a fixed term (apart from Lead Teachers, which are permanent roles) and helps recognise the most effective teachers and principals. The roles are underpinned by professional standards.</p>
<p align="left">Communities of schools work together to identify and strive to achieve specific objectives. Each community of schools has an Executive Principal and an allocation of Expert and Lead Teachers.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to these new roles, all schools are given additional funding to provide classroom release time so that teachers can work with the expert and lead teachers on professional practice.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Facilitating access to early childhood education and care</em></p>
<p align="left">Norway has implemented a number of reforms to help parents from low-income families put their children in kindergarten, giving young children better access to early childhood education and care (ECEC). The 2004-09 reform first introduced a regulation lowering fees by 35% across all kindergartens by 2014. Between 2004 and 2012, participation of 1-5 year-olds in ECEC increased markedly.</p>
<p align="left">In 2015, a new regulation brought fees down to a maximum of 6% of family income for low-income families, reducing fees for families in need, while higher-income families paid the maximum fee. This was coupled with the right to 20 hours of free kindergarten per week for 3-5 year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p align="left">These changes have not yet been fully evaluated, but it has been observed that the number of years in kindergarten is associated with children&rsquo;s scores on literacy tests in first grade. Among children with at least four years of kindergarten, only 15% scored low, compared to nearly 40% of children with between 0-2 years in ECEC. The availability of free 20 hours per week of ECEC increased the participation of minority-language children by 15% and has already led to better results on mapping tests in the first and second grades compared to those who did not take part in the programme. These early results suggest that outcomes will continue to improve for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Training&nbsp;school leaders</em></p>
<p align="left">Norway introduced a leadership training and development programme in 2009 to improve the effectiveness of school leaders. The programme provides training to school leaders, with priority to those who have been in their position for less than two years. The training focuses on five key areas: pupils&rsquo; learning outcomes and learning environment, management and administration, co-operation and organisational development, development and change, and the leadership role. Based on experience and on evaluations of the programme, there is now greater involvement among school providers/owners and organisations of school leaders, greater integration of skills training, and more knowledge-sharing among participants.</p>

<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. Poles can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>17.6 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, in line with the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Poland,&nbsp;<strong>93%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, much higher than the OECD average of 79% and one of the highest rates in the OECD.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Improving education quality</em></p>
<p align="left">Thanks to reforms in education Poland&rsquo;s ranking in the OECD&rsquo;s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has improved significantly since 2000. Originally below average, the country&rsquo;s scores gradually increased to above average in all subjects by 2009. Not only did the number of low-performing students fall and high-performing students rise, but between-school variations in performance also shrank.</p>
<p align="left">Evaluations show that the key reforms in reaching these positive results were: delaying tracking into vocational streams, providing more hours of language instruction, introducing externally evaluated examinations at the end of every stage of education, changing teachers&rsquo; pay structure and decentralising curriculum development to the local level (while keeping standards at the national level). This example of best practice in improving education outcomes could help other countries reform their education systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em>&ldquo;School clusters&rdquo; for better results across regions&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="left">Shortcomings in Portugal&rsquo;s education system were brought to light following the OECD&rsquo;s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results in 2000. Key challenges were concentrated in primary schools in rural areas, and in town and cities, many schools were overcrowded putting stress on teachers. Limited resources and strain on schools resulted in many disadvantaged students in repeating grades and even dropping out of school.</p>
<p align="left">Sweeping reforms soon followed after a national debate on how to best address the needs of students and teachers. Among the most successful was the creation of school clusters which bring between 5-10 schools together under a single educational project. Working together, the Ministry of Education and municipalities create clusters considering unique characteristics specific to school sizes, student needs, as well as geographical and demographic factors. By broadening the number of available staff and facilities, school clusters have helped improve the services and support available to students.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em>Strengthening links between schools and businesses</em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;Secondary schools in the Slovak Republic are often vocationally oriented, but sometimes isolated from the labour market. A 2015 reform on vocational education and training (VET) introduced a dual system based on close collaboration between employers and vocational schools.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;Under this system, employers cover the costs of training in the workplace, while the schools maintain the responsibility of teaching theoretical and general subjects. To encourage employers to provide a high-quality experience for students and best match needed skills to education, a number of incentives and control mechanisms have been put in place. These include per-student tax exemptions for employers, direct employer influence on educational content at the school level, certifications for employers entering the dual system to confirm their ability to provide training, and control of educational and training processes in the workplace by designated employees of the partner school, and external control by the State Inspectorate.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;These efforts to support more practical learning via more work-based experiences are a step in the right direction to better aligning student skills with labour market needs. Following monitoring and evaluation in the coming years, further action is planned in consultation with all parties.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. The Spanish can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>17.9 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, in line with the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Spain,&nbsp;<strong>63%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Focusing on student well-being for better results</em></p>
<p align="left">In Spain&rsquo;s northwest region, Castile and Leon, students have been showing outstanding results compared to the country average. In PISA 2015 they scored high on average and only 5% of students were low achievers in science, reading and mathematics, compared to 13% of students across OECD countries. In 2004, Castile and Leon implemented the School Learning Environment plan, which focusing on well-being, including anti-bullying procedures, recognition for schools with best practices, and a school environment co-ordinator. Nearly all publicly funded schools are monitored and report on their learning environment plan twice a year. Student survey results from 2007-08 show that bullying is much lower in the region, only affecting 1 in 40 students compared to 1 in 26 students in Spain as a whole. Castile and Leon is continuing these efforts by adopting a more systematic, participative and integrated approach to update their plan, for example, by introducing a targeted anti-bullying plan.</p>

<p align="left">The national programme Plug In aims to halve the level of dropouts who fail to complete upper secondary school, from 24% to 12% by 2017. Plug In operates through more than 100 projects at local or regional level, to cater to specific needs of at risk students in different communities. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions co-ordinates at national level.</p>
<p align="left">For example, certain projects provide students with individual support and tutoring, mental health support, and links to specialised services.

<p align="left"><em>Helping students complete education</em></p>
<p align="left">Swiss university dropout rates are high (around 30%), with overrepresentation of students who graduated high school in certain cantons and among foreign students. This suggests that the quality of high school education is lower in these cantons. An inter-cantonal agreement was thus introduced to harmonise scholarships for upper secondary and tertiary education. This reform is expected to help disadvantaged students complete secondary school and access higher education.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Improving equality in PISA scores</em></p>
<p align="left">T&uuml;rkiye&rsquo;s performance in mathematics, reading and science has improved markedly since it first participated in PISA in 2003 when Turkey was among the lowest-performing OECD countries. For example, the average maths score rose from 423 points in 2003 to 448 points in 2012 &ndash; an improvement equivalent to more than half a year of schooling.</p>
<p align="left">Much of this improvement was concentrated among students with the greatest socioeconomic and educational needs. The initial driving force behind these improvements was the Basic Education Programme (BEP), launched in 1998, which included a compulsory education law. Since the launch of this programme, the attendance rate among primary students increased from around 85% to nearly 100%, while the attendance rate in pre-primary programmes increased from 10% to 25%.</p>
<p align="left">Several projects implemented over the past decade have also addressed equity issues. These include, the Girls to Schools Now campaign, that aims to ensure that all girls aged 6 to 14 attend primary school; a registry to identify non-schooled children; the Education with Transport programme, which benefits students who have no access to school; and the Complementary Transitional Training Programme, which tries to ensure that 10-14 year-olds acquire a basic education even if they have never been enrolled in a school or if they had dropped out of school.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><em>Technological advances in education</em><br /> <br /> Students in&nbsp;T&uuml;rkiye can expect to have fully computerised classes by 2017. Launched in 2010, the FATIH Project will equip 42 000 schools and 570 000 classes with the latest education technologies. Examples include tablet computers, interactive whiteboards and high speed internet. To make full use of these changes, 800 000 teachers will receive in-service training about the educational usage of these technologies and e-content will be developed for each course.<br /> <br /> By September 2014 the FATIH Project had already provided 732 800 tablet computers, 432 288 interactive whiteboards, 45 653 printers and document cameras, and high speed internet infrastructure to 3 362 schools. So far 105 000 teachers have received in-service training and various educational resources are accessible through a new e-content web portal (<a href="http://www.eba.gov.tr/">www.eba.gov.tr</a>). Once implementation is complete the FATIH project will undergo an evaluation of student and teacher satisfaction as well as the usage of the new education technologies.</p>

<p align="left">Made in Sheffield is a local project that helps students gain the skills that employers need and want. Participating students can access work tasters, classes, project-based learning, apprenticeships and part time work while still in school. A Skills Passport helps students focus on the skills partner employers seek, such as higher level technical skills. In the 2013/14 school year, four new sectors were added to the programme along with 150 student ambassadors.<br /> <br /> Many students participating in the project have improved and diversified their knowledge and skills. For example, girls represent 55% of the students enrolled in Computer Sciences, compared to an industry rate of less than 10%, and approximately 50% of the students enrolled in Engineering/Manufacturing. Boys are also diversifying their skills, with 50% in the Sheffield Teaching Hospital. Evaluations show students are very satisfied and are more likely to find employment or apprenticeships after completing the programme.<br /> <br /> The London Mayor's Apprenticeship Campaign together with the National Apprenticeship Service, created more than 170 000 apprenticeships in London between 2010 and 2014. In 2015 the Mayor doubled funding, from GBR 1 500 to GBR 3 000, for the Apprenticeship Grant for Employers and announced the introduction of a fund for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

                        <h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. People in the United States can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>17.3 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>,&nbsp;similar to the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In the United States,<strong>&nbsp;92% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, much higher than the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD&rsquo;s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in the United States scored 495 in reading literacy, maths and sciences</strong>, above than the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Cradle-to-career education</em></p>
<p align="left">Harlem Children's Zone (HCZ) is a set of interventions that began in the late 1990s with the goal of improving outcomes for children in New York City's Harlem neighbourhood. HCZ seeks to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty for children and families in Central Harlem through a continuum of interventions that spans a child's life. Support begins with The Baby College, a series of workshops for parents of children ages zero to three. The Baby College GRADS, a newer home visitation initiative encourages involvement in the broader programme by offering enticements such as free childcare, a weekly raffle and free diapers or nappies. It continues with high-quality preschool programmes charter academies that serve the students across primary and secondary education population, after-school programming, social services, and health and community-building programmes.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Second chance for school drop-outs</em></p>
<p align="left">YouthBuild USA is a "second chance" programme in the United States targeting 16-24 year-olds from low-income backgrounds who dropped out of school. It is an intensive programme (lasting 8 to 12 months) which provides construction-related training, educational services, counselling, and leadership development opportunities.</p>
<p align="left">The programme has expanded rapidly over time, and there are currently 273 YouthBuild programmes in 46 states, Washington, DC, and the Virgin Islands engaging approximately 10 000 young adults per year. A detailed and rigorous evaluation of the programme is underway. Building on the success of the YouthBuild USA programmes, the model has been adapted and replicated around the world (YouthBuild International), including in Brazil, where the programme is targeted at youngsters aged 18-24 living in the underserved Complexo do Alem&atilde;o, in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

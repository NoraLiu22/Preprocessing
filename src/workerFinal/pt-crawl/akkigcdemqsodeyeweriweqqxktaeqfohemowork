<H1>Lunar Nomenclature</H1>

<H3>This page is <A HREF="http://www.planet4589.org/astro/lunar">http://www.planet4589.org/astro/lunar</A></H3>

Here I present (as of the original writing in 2004) the most complete public digital list of named lunar features.
I have created a digital version of the list of lunar craters
in the <A HREF="RP-1097.pdf">NASA Catalog of Lunar Nomenclature</A> (NASA-RP-1097, Andersson and
Whitaker 1982, hereafter AW82). Most of the data herein is now included
in Jenny Blue's official <A HREF="http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov">[usgs.gov]</A>
list.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Craters.AW82">Craters.AW82</A> contains
name, latitude, longitude and diameter in km for each crater
listed in the first table of AW82. There may be some typos;
please let me know if you find any discrepancies between this list and
AW82.
<P>

<P>
<LI><A HREF="Craters">Craters</A> is a merge of the AW82 list 
with the list
on the USGS site http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/.
Since the publication of AW82 there have been a number of changes
to lunar nomenclature and this merge brings the data up to date circa 2007.
<P>
The file contains name, latitude,
longitude, diameter, feature type, citation for first description (incomplete),
citation for first use of nomenclature (incomplete). It uses
the same convention as the USGS for diacritical marks (e.g. |: for umlaut).
<P>
In the 2023 revision, an additional column has been added with the unicode versions of the crater names.
<P>
<LI><A HREF="Notes">Notes</A> describes in detail the
choices I made in this merging process.
<P>

<P>
<LI><A HREF="Features">Features</A> is in the same format as Craters
and contains the list of all non-crater named features, derived from
the USGS list.
<P>
<P>
<LI><A HREF="Craters.kml">Craters.kml</A> is a KML file containing the positions
of everything in both the Craters and Features lists, suitable for loading into
Google Moon.
<P>


<P>
<LI><A HREF="Crossids">Crossids</A> lists 
correspondences between old and new names.
<P>

<P>
<LI><A HREF="Refs">Refs</A> gives a key to the nomenclature citations
used in the Craters and Features files.

<P>
Thanks to Chuck Wood, Jenny Blue, Alan Baxter and Jim Mosher for comments
and corrections.

Jonathan McDowell, 2004 Mar 8. (Some typos corrected 2005 Apr and updates
added 2006 Oct; some duplicates removed and the Crossids file improved on
2007 Mar 30 and Jul 15).

	<p>
		The owner's original name for this vessel was <strong>SAMPAJAY</strong>.&nbsp; 
		Since the vessel was fully commissioned 
		in 2015, she sails as the<strong>
		AMANDIRA</strong> under charter to Aman Resorts, whose aim is always to 
		offer the highest level of luxury to 
		those who have the good fortune to join them onboard. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The 38m design shown here is a larger 
		and greatly improved version of my <a href="phinisi.htm">36m Pinisi, Silolona</a> 
		design (developed in 2001).&nbsp; It is closely styled after my
		<a href="50m_phinisi.htm">50m 
		Sailing Pinisi</a> design (developed in 2007) and my
		<a href="30m_phinisi.htm">30m Pinisi, Datu Bua</a> design (developed in 
		2008).&nbsp; They have all been modeled 
		after the traditional <strong>Indonesian Sailing </strong><b>
		Pinisi.&nbsp; </b>The <b>
		AMANDIRA </b>is the most recent of the fleet, and brings forth the best 
		features from among our prior Pinisi and KLM designs.</p>
	<p>
		First though, a clarification is in order...&nbsp;
		It is common among charter operators to quote a vessel's length in terms 
		of everything that "sticks out" even including the flag pole...!&nbsp; However that practice is incorrect and 
		is quite misleading.&nbsp; For example on the <strong>AMANDIRA</strong> the length from the tip of the bowsprit to 
		the end of the farthest object astern is approximately 52 meters, which is 
		likely to be the 
		length most often quoted.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is the length of the "boat 
		part" that is of primary importance to the naval architect; to the 
		builder; and to the classification society.&nbsp; This is ordinarily 
		taken as being the 
		length over the range of the weather deck, which in this case is 38 meters...!&nbsp; 
		Quite a difference...!</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;Particulars are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>52 Meters "Sparred Length"</li>
		<li>38 Meters Length on Deck (125')</li>
		<li>30 Meters Loaded WL Length</li>
		<li>10 Meters Moulded Beam</li>
		<li>3.8 Meters Loaded Draft</li>
		<li>372 Metric Tons Loaded Displacement</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The emphasis of this design has been to 
		create a highly traditional sailing Pinisi for construction by local 
		craftsmen in Indonesia; to involve worldwide standards with regard to 
		structure and stability; to provide sailing performance in keeping with a traditional sailing 
		vessel; and in so doing to provide a degree high luxury to the charter 
		guests who travel onboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;</p>

		<h3>The Interior Layout</h3>
	<p>
		For the <strong>
		AMANDIRA</strong>, comfort and privacy have been my primary goals in designing the 
		interior layout.&nbsp;&nbsp; At 38m length on deck, this design is large 
		enough to accommodate four luxury Guest Cabins below forward, plus a large Owner's Cabin 
		on deck aft.&nbsp; On deck amidships there is a comfortable Guest Lounge.&nbsp; Each cabin has 
		its own private en-suite head and shower, and all 
		accommodation spaces are air conditioned.&nbsp; For comfortable sailing in the 
		tropics, excellent ventilation has been given the highest priority.
	</p>
	<p>
		To best understand the vessel's interior please see the layout views in the links given above 
		and the Interior Profile below.  The 
		following walk-through should clarify whatever is not readily apparent in those images... </p>

		<h3>Below Decks</h3>
	<p>
		Right forward below the main deck is the forepeak which contains a Chain 
		Locker and Bosun's Locker. Aft of that is a Tour-Guide or Stewardess 
		Cabin and Laundry. Just aft of the Laundry are four luxury-sized Guest Staterooms, each with en-suite 
		Head and Shower.&nbsp;
		Aft of the Guest Suites is the Engine Room, sized to contain the various support systems for chartering, including two main generators, a 
		'pony' generator, dive compressor, large capacity reverse osmosis 
		system for fresh water, pumps, electrical panels, etc. 
		Aft of the Engine Room are the Galley and Crew Cabins.&nbsp; In all, accommodations are provided for 14 crew.  Aft of the 
		Crew Cabins on the Galley-deck is a Cool-Room for food 
		supplies. </p>

		<h3>Main Deck </h3>
	<p>
		The forward Main Deck is the primary socializing area during the day.&nbsp; 
		At night it is a favorite place to party 
		and to sleep under the stars.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just aft of amidships on the Main Deck is a Lounge for guest dining that is protected from the weather.&nbsp; 
		The Lounge contains the on-board entertainment system and a large flat-screen display.&nbsp; A stairway 
		leads directly from the Lounge forward and down to the Guest Suite hallway below.&nbsp;
		Aft of the Lounge and a git higher higher up is the Bridge.  From the Aft Deck, a stairwell 
		leads down to the Galley and Crew Cabins.  This stairwell also provides ready access to the engine 
		room from the Bridge. Right aft within the Aft House is a large Owner's 
		Cabin, opening onto the privacy of the aft deck.&nbsp; Forward of the 
		Owner's Cabin is a generous Head and Shower that spans the full width of 
		the Deck House.&nbsp; </p>

		<h3>Sails, Power, Range</h3>
	<p>
		The sail rig is relatively "modern" by comparison to the usual Indonesian Pinisi, even though it has 
		a quite  
		traditional appearance.  The rig is taller than would usually be the case 
		among Indonesian vessels, which allows for a more effective sail area.  
		The spars were designed as steel tube.  With tapers at the ends they appear to any casual observer to be traditional 
		wooden spars.  Steel however provides the strength needed in order to achieve adequate sail area and is 
		quite easily fabricated.  The sails are all modern Dacron, halyards are three strand soft laid Dacron, 
		halyard and sheet blocks have wood cheeks and ball bearings for low friction hauling, 
		and in general the rig is 
		arranged for easy handling. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike the traditional Bugis schooners which use "standing" gaffs and loose footed sails 
		that are brailed up to 
		the mast and gaff, we have instead arranged for the gaffs to be hauled aloft Western style.&nbsp;  In this way 
		the sails can remain bent onto the spars, allowing the sails to be very easily reefed.  With booms on all primary sails, 
		there is no drama when tacking.  A generous "crosstrees" platform is placed at the base of each topmast, 
		allowing safe handling of the tops'ls as well.</p>
	<p>
		With robust galvanized steel standing rigging, this is indeed "modern" by local Indonesian standards - the 
		objective being to have good sailing performance and easy handling.  For calm spots... the engine is sized for 
		approximately 10.5 to 11 knots under power.  The engine is an 830 hp Yanmar - a heavy duty slow turning 
		industrial-strength marine diesel manufactured for the SE Asian market.</p>
	<p>
		Fuel tankage is approximately 30,700 liters.  Range under power will be between 1,950 and 2,400 NM 
		(depending on vessel speed).&nbsp; But having been designed for top 
		performance under sail, range is essentially unlimited. 
		<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>More Information...?</h3>
	<p>
		An interesting article on our work with these vessels appeared in the 
		New York Times, called
		<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/fashion/22iht-ACAYPIN.html?pagewanted=all">The Traditional Pinisi - And Then Some</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Connoisseur's 
		website calls <strong>AMANDIRA</strong>
		<a href="http://www.connoisseurs.me/inspiration/146/amandira-the-dreamboat-of-indonesia">
		The Dreamboat of Indonesia</a>.&nbsp; As an Aman Resorts vessel
		<a href="https://www.aman.com/resorts/amanwana/amandira"><strong>
		AMANDIRA</strong></a> will no doubt be appearing often in the yachting 
		press of Asia.</p>
	<p>
		For another taste of what is possible with these craft, please see our
		<a href="kapal_layar_mesin_36.htm">36m Dunia Baru</a> web page where you 
		will find several outstanding as-built images.</p>
	<p>
		If this or a similar Pinisi  / luxury sailing yacht is of interest, we offer a thorough design service.  
		Our preference is to take advantage of traditional Indonesian 
		boatbuilding methods to the maximum extent possible, and to bring the 
		structure up to Classification Society standard.  We offer our custom design 
		services so that we can modify any of these vessels to suit a variety of requests.

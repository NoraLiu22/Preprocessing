I have not read your new book. Uh It's still on preorder and you didn't send me a review copy, but I need to sell books. But I'm looking at the table of contents here and there are a lot of chapters. But I know they're very short chapter 48 and 49 are called Bad Bosses and Good Bosses. Which chapter am I in? You know, you know, Alice Allen was a great boss. He hired me, he hired me when I was a young kid. Nobody else would have hired me to do that job. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, I wanna talk about the, the your second start up axios because you started it on. The concept was a simple two words, smart, brevity. And I think about that all the time because it really goes against the grain of journalistic culture. I mean, we're here at Mahal knows this. Well, we're here at Fortune which has had a hard time, the transition from a magazine to digital. We've done it now. But it took a long time. And that was partly because the reporters and writers here thought that the highest form of journalism was a 11,000 word magazine story. And the notion that you can be brief and, and feed people information that they need in a very smart way at the same time, uh may sound pretty straightforward to people, but it's not, it's not in our business at all. One of the things I taught myself to do is stop writing or thinking about journalism the way that I want it to be and start listening to the customer. And I was watching what was happening in terms of consumption with people in positions of power or just ordinary consumers. And I noticed that almost no one was reading anything and they were, they were hunting and pecking and they were often reading the first couple of paragraphs or they were gravitating towards newsletters instead of stories even when they were paying a premium to buy that product. And so by the time we started, we said, listen, like there is like there's an efficiency revolution. People want their information tighter. Uh But they also are going to need to know more across more topics. If they want to be really successful professionally, they need to, they're gonna have to understand technology and information consumption and politics and cultural trends. And so that's where the smart brevity came up with. We need really intelligent coverage on on important topics but delivered as efficiently as humanly possible. And we were pretty confident that that was gonna work almost instantly. It did like it, it, it, it instantly kind of just hit the sweet spot of where especially people who are in the professional class, who are consuming content. It just met the moment and I remember like knowing that we like we were on to something bigger than I realized in the first couple of months, I was getting hundreds of emails from readers saying thank you, you're saving me time. You're respecting my intelligence trying to make me smarter faster. I was like, damn, those are the exact same words we're using internally. I never communicated that externally. And it showed that we, we had product market fit and you know, that blossomed into, you know, a book on smart brevity. It blossomed into a company that we split off where we, we, we train companies to be able to communicate internally using smart brevity. And we now use A I to power that. And so like that, one kind of fundamental observation led to a lot of different kinds of enterprises which has been like really fun and and adventurous having worked with you 25 years ago. I'm not at all surprised that you went on to uh to found two successful media companies, but I am a little surprised to see you become a self help guru. Uh you know, and it's not just leadership. It's like life hacks, diets, meditation, what's going on there. Uh You're not the only one who's surprised. I'm kind of surprised by that. To be honest, it's, it started with, we were trying to figure out a way to work with our audience on things that weren't so heavy. So we started ending the night with this thing called Finish line where it's like something fun, something uplifting because you're doom scrolling all day. As part of that is, I started to write a couple of columns about lessons learned, being a, being a manager and having kept those notes and the response was just humbling. It was like overwhelming. It, it was clear people were interested in it. And so I just sort of kept going with that. And most of it is about how to get ahead of work, how to get ahead in your profession, how to be a better manager, how to be a better leader. But like the older I get, um, you know, Alan, you and I aren't spring chickens anymore, right? You start to think of a lot younger that surround it, right? That like I'm only really good as a CEO if I've got my crap together with my wife and my family and my, my health and my diet. So I, I have started to write a little bit more about that. I, you know, again, part of it is because like I'm a writer to your question. Earlier, the, you know, I have this weird spinal disorder where over time my spine is gonna turn into one, one fused brick. It's run in my family for generations. And so I've had to become maniacal about, about fitness. And so I've used that to be, you know, whatever, that kind of sucks. But here's the things that, like, I've been able to do that aren't medicinal that are able to, like, help, continue to be really healthy uh at my age. So I'll pass that along, seems to resonate. I pass a little bit more along. And so, yeah, that, that wasn't a twist that I expected and, and, and, you know, I didn't expect to write a book on all this stuff. But given that it does seem to be helpful to some people and like in, in all seriousness, like the high school college stuff, like having been such a bad student, having come from kind of just a normal small town in the Midwest. I part of writing the book is to hopefully get it to people that aren't in New York and Washington and to say, hey, listen, you could be wherever the hell you are going to a community college because of how awesome this country is. Like, you could go on to start companies or be a CEO or interview a president. Like if I could, I guarantee you, you're more impressive as an 18 year old than I was. And so like, it's possible and that's a, that's a big theme of the book. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the packs that, that have worked for you and just maintaining that, uh, wellness, I guess, and, and the kind of, um, you know, balance that you need to do your job as a CEO. Well, I mean, I think all this stuff is particular to your passions and your own habits and your own circumstance. But like, for me, I've realized like, listen, if I'm gonna run a company and I'm going to be the chairman of another technology company and I'm gonna try to write books. I can only do that if I'm performing optimally. And so like, for me personally, I created what my, my wife always rolls her eyes when I say this. But like my happiness matrix, which is I have this idea of, ok, I work best if like my relationship with my wife is good. My relationship with my kids is attentive. My relationship with my parents is strong. If I'm working out, I'm getting enough time to fly fish. If I'm spending enough time on my face and whenever I'm off, I know that if I, one of those buckets is off and so I'm constantly in my mind doing an inventory if I feel off. Like, oh man, I guess I haven't like, paid enough attention to the kids or I haven't paid enough attention to going off and golf or fly fish or whatever it is that gives me, uh, sanity. And so I think that more than anything has really helped. Uh, and then two is just who you surround yourself with. Like, we've all been at companies where you work with people who just suck the life out of you. And if there's one thing I'm most proud of about axios is at 550 people, we don't have any of those people. I've become really good at being able to sniff out even high achievers who are bad people and, and, and executing them, like getting them out of the company as quickly as possible. And it has this weird effect where like when your energy is all positive and you're dealing with smart people who are high achieving, but they're in it for the right reasons. It just has a psychic effect on you because you're not spending your time going like God, why was that person? A jerk or man, that person is a drag or I don't want to be anywhere near that person. And when you don't have that, I think the combination of those two things has helped me, like, really enjoy the work that I do. But I think be better at the work that I do.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1714509143852,"updatedAt":1714568693820,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1714521600000,"duration":{"value":497,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f","name":"These are the skills LinkedIn’s CEO thinks will be most valuable in an AI future","slug":"these-are-the-skills-linkedin’s-ceo-thinks-will-be-most-valuable-in-an-ai-future","shortDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","longDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","seoTitle":"These are the skills LinkedIn’s CEO thinks will be most valuable in an AI future","seoDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","socialTitle":"These are the skills LinkedIn’s CEO thinks will be most valuable in an AI future","socialDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","tags":[{"name":"linkedin","type":"tag","label":"LinkedIn"},{"name":"ai","type":"tag","label":"AI"},{"name":"automation","type":"tag","label":"automation"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"},{"name":"jobs","type":"tag","label":"jobs"},{"name":"future_jobs","type":"tag","label":"future jobs"},{"name":"jobs_market","type":"tag","label":"jobs market"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

Um I'm two for two. I'm reframing both your questions now. So, thanks. Uh We're, we're so excited that that's, that's what the people we interview do all the time. We're really just props the questions we ask are your relative and when you reframe a question, it helps you provide the kind of answer you wanted to provide. So, yeah, go ahead. What do you have? Uh Do you have a question for my answer? Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, you know, there are lots of people who are worried that A I is gonna eliminate jobs, maybe their job. There are others who say, oh, it'll eliminate some jobs, but it'll create even more. And all of us are just speculating but you have the data. So what is your data show where, where are skills and jobs uh in less demand and what skills and uh are in more demand as we move into this profound technological change. It's really important for people to change the way you think about jobs jobs historically been thought about as a title. Um But fundamentally, if you can take a different view, which is jobs as a set of tasks, your job is a set of tasks. My job is a set of tasks. Everybody's job to be done is a set of tasks. And when you can start to really break down, every job is a set of tasks, you can then take the next step to understand where technology can help either augment uh or make certain tasks more efficient or certain tasks are going to be just completely automated. Then you start to realize that, oh, you know what, like if your job is just a set of tasks that is going to be automated, you need to start looking for a new job. So one of the things that we're doing across linkedin is taking every role in the world and doing a score of certain jobs as tasks and, and understanding that, hey, there's certain jobs like, you know, a lot of copywriting or translation type jobs where the majority of the task to do those jobs are tasks that can be automated. So, you know, it's important to start thinking about a new job. The majority of jobs though in the world are the types of jobs where you know AAA specific portion of those tasks will be automated and you need to learn how to leverage those tools to help in that part of your job. But still a lot of human skills are needed for uh for the majority of the job. Yeah. So give us some examples of skills that you think are going to be more valuable in the future because of what's happening now. First and foremost, it, it is really important to learn, learn, learn your way into using these A I tools. It's only going to help you in whatever job that you're doing to, you know, be able to leverage these tools to help you be more productive. My big bet is on people skills. Um you know, learning how to build people skills, communicating, um knowing what to do when your camera falls off of your computer during a podcast interview, which, which is just so our listeners know just happened to run and he did a total of glimpse right in the middle of the interview is gone. Yeah. Uh EQ communication, collaboration, creativity. That's a place where, um you know, I, I would be putting a lot of time and effort. Um if I was just entering the workforce or thinking about what the future might look like. And then I think that there's this concept which is for so long we've been taught or thought about the importance is to build for stability. And I think the future is more about building for agility instead of stability, uh being able to adapt, being able to, you know, take on something new the way I did my job last year is gonna be the way I'm gonna do my job this year. So I think a lot of that goes into what I would at least be thinking about right now entering the workforce, or at least I'm thinking about for myself transitioning, you know, through a leadership job that's always changing as well. So, what role do college degrees play in all of this? Are they important for different reasons? Because, um it's not just the skills that you accrue through a degree, maybe not just a four year degree. Um But, but it's also eq right, the last part is spot on, especially on the EQ side. And, you know, I'm not sure that outside of um being with a group of people doing work or being with people at a school, et cetera, there, there's been a real strong way to teach, um you know, a lot of people skills besides just kind of being in that environment. But I think it's an area of opportunity that, you know, society, we need to really figure out um in terms of, you know, college degrees in general, I think degrees are uh important in so far as they contain the set of skills that are really important and necessary um to be productive in society. Historically, recruiters would use degrees as you know, the the way to assess or find talent because we had no better view to do it. So for example, you, you see a lot of recruiters do things like, well, I just want to see candidates that, you know, went to Princeton, someone went to Princeton. They must be smart. Um, or they have, you know, you know, or, or previous company, this person used to work at Google, they must be smart as well. And when you only look at, I don't know the, the degree or the pedigree on its own as, as the post goes underneath it, two things happen. Number one, everyone's looking at the same group of talent because all the recruiters do the same search some people who, you know, used to work at Google and went to Princeton, like everyone's looking at this tiny group of people which does not create a very equitable or efficient labor market. Um And number two, it turns out that, you know, often times those degrees alone aren't signal enough for what needs to be, you know, done inside of the job. So we've been pushing a lot on, you know, skills are the currency, the actual skills that need to be done and it falls in line really well with this idea of the future about looking at jobs, set of tasks, as opposed to just the job title itself. I think across the board requiring require ourselves to go a level deeper in terms of what are the actual, you know, skills or tasks to be done instead of just relying on the, you know, the name of the degree alone. But, um, I really think you're on to something that with the EQ point and that's something we need to figure out.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1713972124339,"updatedAt":1713972613831,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713972613831,"duration":{"value":415,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a","name":"Why Chewy’s CEO leads with a Disney mindset: “You just feel like you're part of a dream world”","slug":"why-chewy’s-ceo-leads-with-a-disney-mindset:-“you-just-feel-like-you're-part-of-a-dream-world”","shortDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","longDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","seoTitle":"Why Chewy’s CEO leads with a Disney mindset: “You just feel like you're part of a dream world”","seoDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","socialTitle":"Why Chewy’s CEO leads with a Disney mindset: “You just feel like you're part of a dream world”","socialDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","tags":[{"name":"chewy","type":"tag","label":"Chewy"},{"name":"fortune_500","type":"tag","label":"Fortune 500"},{"name":"chewy_s","type":"tag","label":"Chewy’s"},{"name":"sumit_singh","type":"tag","label":"Sumit Singh"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"},{"name":"alan","type":"tag","label":"Alan"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Leadership Next","Heroes"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

It's pretty awesome. Everyone brings when it comes to the office. I mean, the amount of we, we were, you know, we were thinking, how are we going to get any work done? And, and how do you kind of keep all these pets in check? But believe it or not, it's, it's everybody behaves and it just works like sheer chaos. We've had, we've had, you know, besides dogs and cats, we've had potbellied pigs and we've had hamsters and welcome to leadership next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, the Chewy was founded as a food and supplies company. We would serve you your food, we would, you know, ship you your dog collars and beds and all that stuff. But there's much more to a pet's journey than that pet's life cycle than that. There's an entire health vertical, there are non healthcare services. And then what, why just pet parents think about the community that services, pet, right? You're, you're the veterinarian, the groomer, the trainer, the dog park friend, right. Looking for content servicing pet, et cetera, et cetera. And we said, well, why should we only be stand for customers? Let's stand for partners. And what that tells you is from a business mindset. What it was saying was we should be a B to cab to B company, et cetera. So if you put that together, Alan, you not only get a mission and purpose that people can get behind, you get the strategy of the organization and at any point, you can look at that and say, well, where are you trending in fulfilling that, that, that this, this journey? And it's meant to be enduring. So, over the last six years, we've really built out our health vertical and so we're very proud of that. So we've connected food supplies and health. We've built out B to C services, B two B services for veterinarians. And so we're super proud and so we, and we've just entered Canada as our first International Forest. We all know Ecommerce is a tough business. Um Just tell us a little bit more about your philosophy, the underlying philosophy for customer service and customer loyalty. You know, I'm a product of consumer tech experience forward companies, Dell being one, you know, Amazon being the other. And so when I got to Chewy, right, I was like, well, great. It's just a customer service or customer care team. And this is the journey. Sometimes you as a leader need to observe and evolve to be able to truly assimilate through what is a gold nugget in the foundation or the growth of a company stage? And I looked at our customer care and I experienced it and as I experienced our customer care, you know, I did not think about any customer care organization. I thought about Disney, my experience when I walked through a Disney Park and how we feel in the way that, you know, you, you just feel like you're a part of a dream world, like being welcomed. I compared Chuy to the best hospitality resorts in the way that you are served in the way that you are treated in the way that you received and in the way that you're you're respected when you walk through the best hospitality resorts. So that's the mindset in the way that we approach customer service, right? So if I were to summarize this from a business point of view, I would say Chewy is uh you know, we are delivering the scale and convenience of e-commerce, but at the best personalized service or a high touch, personalized service, you should expect that the best local neighborhood pet store. Can you share the story real quick of um this incident? That kind of went viral where somebody is a customer's pet died and you send a message and tell the story. We have what we call surprise and delight uh moments uh where we want to be with the customer's life cycle or journey through the highs and lows of pet parenting. And this moment that you're referring is a low of pet parenting when somebody's pet passed away and when that happens, right. I we, we get to know we send flowers, right. We send, because at that moment, we are sympathetic, empathetic, we send flowers, we send greetings, handwrit cards. And you know, that moment is a very special moment because most companies will not invest, you know, X number of dollars to be able to pick up flowers to send to customers and be there right in that moment for them and posts like these. That's not the only thing we do. We send you handwrit birthday cards, we send you welcome cards. We will send you surprise and delight. We work with over 1000 local artists where we will send you hand drawn pet portraits which you cannot buy from us. They will show up to your doorstep, surprise and delight. And let me tell you this when you get a hand drawn pet portrait of your beloved pet. I have you for life on the customer service side for a company. That's so, you know, so much of your DNA and and your culture is around customer loyalty and it's really like high touch customer service. You're talking about handwrit notes, like not a lot of e-commerce companies do that. How do you look at the opportunities with some of these A I powered chat bots A I agents um help with customer service without diluting everything that you guys stand for. It is natural to assume that technology and personalization or technology and creativity are are conflicting with each other. And I think what we have to realize is that human beings are great at creativity, they always will be and technology is great, is great at delivering scale. And so you have to marry these up smartly, right? Our our local artists or our handwrit notes in a way that we assimilate through the language, right? Is, is a very personalized mechanism that we are seeking to keep. At the same time, I can automate all of the segmentation of customers, the targeting of customers, the identification of those cohorts. I can also automate how I pick up the right portrait when a customer uploads a pet profile and pass it on to my artist pretty digitally and pretty seamlessly. So I've essentially eliminated process waste without really taking out creativity from the system. I want to, we're, we're developing something called uh a tool like uh which is called CS R buddy. It is meant to be a friend to the customer service uh or the customer care team and what it's essentially AAA Prompter tool, it downloads, it has all information about the customer. It has a knowledge base which will marry content to, to let them have more intelligent conversations. We try not to hire from deeply ingrained CS contact centers because because we we, we, because we have to untrain them to get them to unlearn the bad habits of getting the customer off the phone. We want to pick up your phone in two rings or less. Right. And so we, we, we tell our agents just have a conversation.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1713365842731,"updatedAt":1713366065796,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713366065796,"duration":{"value":402,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302","name":"How AI can help solve housing supply challenges—and do it sustainably","slug":"how-ai-can-help-solve-housing-supply-challenges—and-do-it-sustainably","shortDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","longDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","seoTitle":"How AI can help solve housing supply challenges—and do it sustainably","seoDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","socialTitle":"How AI can help solve housing supply challenges—and do it sustainably","socialDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","tags":[{"name":"leadership_next","type":"tag","label":"Leadership Next"},{"name":"ai","type":"tag","label":"AI"},{"name":"andrew_anagnost","type":"tag","label":"Andrew Anagnost"},{"name":"autodesk","type":"tag","label":"Autodesk"},{"name":"factory_os","type":"tag","label":"Factory Os"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"},{"name":"mia","type":"tag","label":"Mia"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Leadership Next","Heroes"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

All right. Ok. That's very California. It's a material that stores carbon. All right, it's very durable and can actually be shaped into anything you want it to be rather than using a plastic facade or something like that. It's actually a wonderful material. And can you eat it? I wouldn't recommend it. Ok. It's an industrial fungus. We've been doing these for a long time. I do not believe I've ever heard those two words put, put together before industrial fungus. So I'm gonna have to think about that one for a long time. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, a lot of what your product is used for is very creative, right? From designing buildings to special effects like you said. Yeah, totally. So, so on that on that front, you know, how far can this go? And what do you see on the creative side, the design side, what's the role of, you know, 10, 20 years out? What are humans still doing? How are, how are we still in the picture? Yeah. So we, we see a very collaborative future between A I and the human user. We do not, we do not see an adversarial relationship here. Does the A I ultimately put fewer people on each project. I guarantee you there will be fewer people on each project that builds or make something in the world in the future, but we'll be able to do more projects. And I think that matters over the next 20 years, you look to the future, the world is gonna be somewhere between eight and 10 billion people depending on which, which estimate you take right now. If, if you look at that, we're gonna be adding anywhere between 35 and 45 Tokyo's to the world every year between now and then. OK, that, that's a lot of new people, that's a lot of new infrastructure. So fundamentally, the industries we serve have a massive capacity problem and that capacity problems connected to. There's not enough money people or material to make and remake everything that needs to be made and remade without either destroying the planet or not being able to make it at all. Because you, you just can't have the capacity So we're very much focused on that capacity problem. And I'm gonna just share this stat from, from auto desk from you guys. Um that says that by 2030 96,000 new affordable homes must be built every day. So I'm curious actually on a more global level, what that looks like and tell us a little bit more about just the role that you think auto desk can play here that you're getting to the concept of why it's so important to apply industrial processes, these things. Because right now, if we try to make all those buildings with the current wasteful processes, we're, we're going to do some pretty damaging things with all of that housing required and one it, it's going to be expensive as well. Now, by the way, just to be perfectly clear, the cost of building a business isn't all that goes into making a particular housing project expensive. There are other things that come in there. However, the cost of building something is a big driver. So when you have to drive down the cost and you have to minimize the amount of material used because there's just not enough material to build all these things in a sustainable way. So if we can help people make repeatable choices that don't make the building ugly because this is the tension between the architecture profession and, and some of the things that we want to do with design technology is the goal is not to standardize everything and make it look like the same thing over and over again. Heaven forbid the goal is to help people minimize what they're doing and make choices that actually minimize the amount of material or the type of material in, in really interesting ways and drive down the cost per unit. You did an interesting interview with our fortune colleague, Diane Brady. Uh last year, she was working at a, at a different f publication at the time. But uh one of the things you said, really caught my attention, you said that that governments have a tendency to swing hard left or hard, right? And you're worried that they may try and slam the nail on A I and let other parts of the world run off with the innovation. Uh How do you think we're doing on that front? I, I think we're doing absolutely nothing. OK. Uh You know, and this is a, this is a problem here. OK? Because, you know, I'm not anti regulation. I think we need some regulation. We need rational regulation. Europe tends to overregulate the US, tends to under regulate when Miha and I talked, I, I told her that I thought the advertising model was one of the worst things that ever happened to tech. And there was a real reason why I said that and it's important as we think about A I when the advertising model started to create these tech giants and bigger isn't always better. Let's be very clear here. Just because something creates a huge tech company doesn't necessarily mean it's awesome. Ok, when the ads model took over, it created a disconnected for a long time, hadn't existed, it separated the needs of the end user from the needs of the customer. Most tech had been directly focused on the needs of the end users for its entire history. Then all of a sudden the customer was now the advertiser, not the end user. So here we are, we're heading into the world of A I. We already have this disconnect between the human using the technology and the person who is uh who is being uh the source of income for the technology. And now we're gonna lay our A I on and A IA I can either be a force for enhancing humanity or can be disconnected from the goals of humanity. I'm very nervous in the structure we have around certain large tech companies right now that there's going to be an increasing disal between the human centered needs and the the needs of the people that are funding the machine.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1712757466056,"updatedAt":1712759976301,"irisTag":"technology","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1712707200000,"duration":{"value":383,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6","name":"Aflac CEO Dan Amos explains why he bet the company on a duck","slug":"aflac-ceo-dan-amos-explains-why-he-bet-the-company-on-a-duck","shortDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","longDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","seoTitle":"Aflac CEO Dan Amos explains why he bet the company on a duck","seoDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","socialTitle":"Aflac CEO Dan Amos explains why he bet the company on a duck","socialDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","tags":[{"name":"aflac","type":"tag","label":"Aflac"},{"name":"fortune_500","type":"tag","label":"Fortune 500"},{"name":"insurance","type":"tag","label":"Insurance"},{"name":"warren_buffett","type":"tag","label":"Warren Buffett"}],"categories":[{"name":"Series","type":"category","label":"Series"},{"name":"Magazine_Videos","parentName":"Series","label":"Magazine Videos","type":"category"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Fortune Magazine Features"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photograph by Kendrick Brinson for Fortune","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Much too much.

You know, I guess I never thought of. I'm going to be a CEO if I'm honest, I always, even from a young age, thought I would be leading something. I didn't know what. Yeah, I think II I tell, you know, I tell this funny story. I um it's a bit embarrassing but at six years old, I had an attache case as, as my bag. So I think, I think that says it all. Welcome to leadership next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, we are a B to B company so we don't deal directly with the consumer. So right there, the consumer directly does not know us. Uh we deal with our lenders and they deal with the consumer so that by definition is always an issue. Um but most consumers don't understand that the lender who probably originated that mortgage is not the one who continues to own that mortgage. It's probably not the one who is servicing the mortgage. Um I think what we are trying to do is build that awareness through our home education programs. More and more we are filling that void for the consumer and we're leading into our mission and our charter, I mean, our duty to serve is to make the housing system more fair, more equitable. And I think the consumers are starting to become aware that something is changing. So for example, when I think about our strategy today, first of all, number one job is liquidity in the market and the pandemic is just a great example of why that is so important. But our two strategic objectives are how do we make the housing system more fair and more sustainable? And we look at everyone from renters to home buyers, to homeowners and it's about sustainable whatever you might have a renter or a homeowner. And uh we are making it more fair by using technology. So for example, before, if you were a renter in this country, your rent did not count today through technology. Fannie Mae is taking that at risk. And if we, if the consumer shows it through their bank statements, we can tell what probably is a rent payment, the regularity of that payment and we could make that consumer eligible. So it's huge and that's you can qualify people instead of a credit score, qualify them on a rent that did not exist two years ago. And it's something Fannie may led the charge. We started with renters, we went to our landlord partners and said, we're willing to pay for it because what are the tests that the concept? And today, I'm happy to say over 500,000 rental units are reporting their rent payments. Um On the home ownership side, we have qualified for 5000. Now, homeowners that did not have cio scores, those that didn't have a FICO score, have one today and those that did have seen an increase of like 38 points that's quite meaningful. So, you know, one thing we've learned is that housing payment is a housing payment, whether it rental payment or principal and interest payment and we're making that count. So it's those types of innovation that I'm hopeful. Job number one for a CEO is to make sure your story is told and people understand that and I am very committed to doing that. You are the only Latina CEO on the Fortune 500. So tell us more about your background and how it informs your leadership today at Fanny Mae. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'm I'm the only but I I'm so I'm so um it won't be for long because again, the Latino cohort is and women also, but the Latino cohort is having a lot of gains educationally and otherwise. So as I mentioned, I grew up in, in Brooklyn, my family there. I am Puerto Rican. My parents came to the mainland in the 19 fifties, like many Puerto Rican, the Puerto Rican diaspora for a better life. And I grew up in a very optimistic household and, and at my kitchen table, I heard like probably many American families do today, talked about a good job. Education was like, you know, that's why neither of my parents at the time had gone to college. So an education and saving for a home. And I still remember when I was five years old, um they bought their first home. I still remember the first night I slept in my room and I think that's informed a lot of what I do. You must have had moments along the way, coming up through Wall Street where you were sitting in a room surrounded by a bunch of guys and where you said to yourself, this system is never gonna allow me to get to the top. That's, that's not true. And, you know, it's the kind of thing where again, um look, I um in 19 nineties, there were very few women um in finance and law and banking and I, I never saw that as a, as an obstacle. You know, if anything, I was in the room, I worked so darn hard. I was really trying to figure out the man woman thing. I just did my job and did it well and did project finance for the 1st 10 years. And then I went to J PM. I, I ran a state housing finance agency for three years then went to JP Morgan had an incredible career there. You know, were there times when I was the only woman in the room. Absolutely. But I still did my work really well. And I think if anything, one of the great things of my position now at my age, you know, I could, I could help change how people think the face of leadership is changing. And I am just so excited to be part of that.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1710868948548,"updatedAt":1710928813862,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1710928813862,"duration":{"value":336,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28","name":"This CEO immigrated to America with “nothing” before scaling a $12.6 billion energy empire","slug":"this-ceo-immigrated-to-america-with-“nothing”-before-scaling-a-$12.6-billion-energy-empire","shortDescription":"Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi lived and went to school in an oil refinery in Iran in the 1950s.","longDescription":"Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi lived and went to school in an oil refinery in Iran in the 1950s.","seoTitle":"This CEO immigrated to America with “nothing” before scaling a $12.6 billion energy empire","seoDescription":"Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi lived and went to school in an oil refinery in Iran in the 1950s.","socialTitle":"This CEO immigrated to America with “nothing” before scaling a $12.6 billion energy empire","socialDescription":"Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi lived and went to school in an oil refinery in Iran in the 1950s.","tags":[{"name":"air_products","type":"tag","label":"Air Products"},{"name":"hydrogen","type":"tag","label":"Hydrogen"},{"name":"iran","type":"tag","label":"Iran"},{"name":"leadership_next","type":"tag","label":"Leadership Next"},{"name":"seifi_ghasemi","type":"tag","label":"Seifi Ghasemi"},{"name":"stanford_university","type":"tag","label":"Stanford University"},{"name":"the_united_states","type":"tag","label":"the United States"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photograph courtesy of Getty Images","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"c52ffd33-4119-4adf-b092-16b0a591eb28/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"You, you grew up in Iran, you were educated, began your education in Iran.

We used to call this era of breeding as selecting the best over the last few years, we have transitioned into designing the best we are using machine learning to predict what kind of a genome or what kind of a seed variety will give us the characteristics that we care about in the environment. They are going to be grown. My name is Fanny Chali and I lead the data sciences within the plant breeding organization at Bayer. We focus on developing new seed varieties for our raw crops as well as vegetable crops. What we are trying to do is continue to advance the grades that we care about the most historically, that can be a very cumbersome process and depend on your luck to find the ones that you want to advance. But with A I, you can get very targeted and you can get very specific from very early on in the process. So that will save you both the resources and then it will also increase the probability of finding the trait that you care about. We are just trying to make sure that we are collecting as much data across all of those different variables. We use the genomic information of the seed varieties and we apply a machine learning model to predict what their performance in the field would look like. So instead of testing these varieties in the feed, you are testing them by predicting what this means from a grower perspective. Ultimately, is they can get the seed varieties that they care about one year in advance. What it means from a payer perspective is we are able to run this operation efficiently because we haven't used one year of field testing. Uh and the resources corresponding to that. And if you think about it from a planet perspective, I think we have been using this approach for about 10 years now and in this 10 years, uh we have replaced close to 20,000 acres of seed testing just in North America. So not having to run a feed plan and being able to use predicted information to advance material in a breeding pipeline can lead to resource savings across these different aspects. Whether it is land, water, nitrogen or even crop protection. If you look at our population, the numbers are increasing by 2050 we are looking at close to 10 billion people globally. The arable land is decreasing in order to meet this demand and do it in a way that is sustainable. We need to continue to discover new seed products that help us mitigate this challenge and that's what plant reading is about.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709753928188,"updatedAt":1709821814085,"irisTag":"technology","sponsorTag":"making-business-better","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1709769600000,"duration":{"value":182,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82","name":"This CEO is so passionate about solving energy transition he hasn’t taken a vacation in 20 years","slug":"this-ceo-is-so-passionate-about-solving-energy-transition-he-hasn’t-taken-a-vacation-in-20-years","longDescription":"“If hydrogen is the only solution and we are the largest hydrogen company, it is our responsibility to do that,” Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi said on Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast.","seoTitle":"This CEO is so passionate about solving energy transition he hasn’t taken a vacation in 20 years","socialTitle":"This CEO is so passionate about solving energy transition he hasn’t taken a vacation in 20 years","socialDescription":"“If hydrogen is the only solution and we are the largest hydrogen company, it is our responsibility to do that,” Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi said on Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast.","tags":[{"name":"hydrogen","type":"tag","label":"Hydrogen"},{"name":"clean_energy","type":"tag","label":"Clean Energy"},{"name":"net_zero","type":"tag","label":"net zero"},{"name":"air_products","type":"tag","label":"Air Products"},{"name":"seifi_ghasemi","type":"tag","label":"Seifi Ghasemi"},{"name":"ii","type":"tag","label":"II"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

Oh, jeez, I'd like to stop and go play golf for uh go fishing or, I mean, you seem very driven and there's a lot of time ahead of you on this uh uh uh on this Hydrogen challenge, you're gonna keep at it. I'm absolutely going to keep at it and I'll have no issue disclosing my age by September. I will be 80 young to be president. I love what I'm doing. I do not have an any other hobbies. I really work seven days a week and vacation. The last time I took a vacation, I was for our 35th anniversary, which was in 2004. II. I love, I really love what I'm doing. And believe me, I have more energy and I travel more and I work harder than when I was 40 years old. So I am amazed and impressed, but I do kind of want you to take a vacation at this point. I hope my wife is not listening to this podcast. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm mia Air products was founded in 1940. So we are about 84 years old and uh our founding father, what he did was that in 1940 he went to the steel companies and said that, look, you are using a lot of oxygen rather than making oxygen yourself. I have a new invention with the oxygen compressor. I can come and invest, make oxygen for you and sell it to you over the fence just like as if you are buying electricity over the fence and people like that, and that is how our business got started. Then in the late 19 fifties, when the Russians sent their sputnik up into the air, the US government decided that, well, we need to have a serious space program and in order to have that you needed liquid hydrogen to put these rockets in there. So they commissioned their products and we were the first company to come up with liquid hydrogen. We developed the technology. So it's now more than 64 years that we are producing hydrogen. So our business is atmospheric gasses, then hydrogen, which is now a significant part of our business. And we are by far the largest producer of hydrogen. A lot of people think hydrogen uh may be part of the answer to our energy problem, the energy transition. I know you've made big investments in this area. Uh How quickly do you think they're gonna pay off? How close are we to having hydrogen products? That can replace the fossil fuels we're using now. Well, uh obviously, the speed that they, that they move forward depends on the customers deciding when they want to convert. But if the world wants to move to taking action to reduce global warming, there is no other option but hydrogen, hydrogen has always been and will always be our only source of energy. There is no other source of energy right now, we produce a lot of hydrogen but the CO2 goes into the air. So you either need to use hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen and capture the CO2 and sequester it or you need to make green hydrogen, which is use electricity to break down water to make green hydrogen. Right now, we are executing significant projects both in green and blue. How quickly before green hydrogen is a competitive uh energy source for uh the global economy. Well, when you say competitive, if uh you have to use it, then it is it, it is, it is not the the transition, it is not an economic transition. This is not as if you are going to go from wood to coal and you say, or coal to oil and you say it's cheaper that either the world has to do something about the CO2 that they put into the air. And it is a requirement that you cannot put CO2 or if you put CO2, there is a significant tax that is what is going to drive this thing because you cannot sit back and say I want clean hydrogen which competes with dirty hydrogen or dirty fuel. It's just not going to happen. So you have to have a mechanism to justify the additional cost because of the benefit which is by a mechanism, you need subsidies or taxes. Basically. No, we are not going to go to a low carbon board. If you do not have the support of the governments to encourage using it, it's not going to happen by itself. You've been very aggressive about this. You've pushed far further than the market wants you to push uh how much is it within the control of companies to push this energy transition forward? 100% a company like us, we had, I mean, it's not easy to go and convince your board that I'm going to invest $8.5 billion in Saudi Arabia and I don't have any customers. So we discuss these things very openly. And the fundamental thing is if we turn out to be right, that is then they are the leader and being and they will make a lot of money, maybe not next year, but 10 years from now. Well, absolutely. And the best example of it is I was involved in these discussions 20 years ago about electric cars because my company was making lithium for electric cars, previous company, previous company. And every time I talk to investors at that time, you know, electric cars. That's the dream. And they would go and talk to Mercedes and GM who were telling them that is. And besides that, if electric cars are going to happen, it's four wheels and a motor, we can do it better than somebody else. Now, we are 24 years later and we have a company with a market cap of 500 billion. And those people who say it's not going to happen have a market cap of 50 billion. And by being the first mover, they have developed the brand and all of that. So we think that in business, if you never take a risk, you never do anything. So you have to make a judgment, you have to have it what you watch call and then put your resources and make it happen.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709743757046,"updatedAt":1709748864086,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1709748856845,"duration":{"value":422,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f","name":"Why Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods doesn’t believe we can get to net zero by 2050","slug":"why-exxon-mobil-ceo-darren-woods-doesn’t-believe-we-can-get-to-net-zero-by-2050","shortDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve its decarbonization goals.","longDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve its decarbonization goals.","seoTitle":"Why Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods doesn’t believe we can get to net zero by 2050","seoDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve its decarbonization goals.","socialTitle":"Why Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods doesn’t believe we can get to net zero by 2050","socialDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve decarbonization goals.","tags":[{"name":"exxon_mobil","type":"tag","label":"Exxon Mobil"},{"name":"exxonmobil","type":"tag","label":"ExxonMobil"},{"name":"exxon","type":"tag","label":"exxon"},{"name":"net_zero","type":"tag","label":"net zero"},{"name":"climate_change","type":"tag","label":"Climate Change"},{"name":"carbon_capture","type":"tag","label":"Carbon Capture"},{"name":"darren_woods","type":"tag","label":"Darren Woods"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune - Photo provided by Exxon Mobil.","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"People don't fully appreciate the scale of the industry that we're in today. And so I think, you know, the recognition back to your question a about how long will it take? You gotta come back to the size of the existing energy system today. It is big. It will take time to replace. But my point is we got to get started on it. But I would say, you know, I can't believe you, you voluntarily went back to Allen's question, your job. I'm a glutton for what can I say? Welcome to leadership next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia Darren Woods. Thanks so much for joining us. Sorry, you couldn't be here in person. Uh We were hoping to do this in person but the snow got in the way. It's good to be with you all. I appreciate you accommodating the, the weather. Yeah, the, the, the snow was here, by the way, not there in Texas. That's right. Look, I, I want to start by asking you the big question, the kind of meta question there are a lot of people out there who believe that that an oil company like Exxonmobil making hundreds of billions of dollars off of selling oil and gas. And a CEO like yourself who's making tens of millions off of that business can't possibly be serious about addressing climate change. Tell me why they're wrong. Sure. I would start with the premise that we're an oil company. I think, you know, as I've taken this job and focused on what's made us successful over the 140 years that we've been in business, it's come down to our ability uh to take technology and develop products that meet society's needs. So at our heart, we're a technology company, maybe a little different than some of the technology companies are out there today and that we basically focus our technology on transforming molecules and they happen to be hydrogen and carbon molecules. And so while uh today, a large part of that, uh that technology goes to making products that are combusted, we also have one of the largest chemical businesses in the world that makes a variety of products that go into uh into society that basically supports modern living. And so our view is our job is to basically take our capabilities in this space and address the needs of society and as those needs evolve. So do our business. I mean, one point I always make Allen is if you go back to the beginnings of our company, we started basically making kerosene to replace whale oil for lamps, electricity came along. Uh Ford Motor came along, started building cars, we started making gasoline. Uh during the war, we started making beetle rubber. And so as the needs of society have evolved, so has our company and they all come back to our ability to, to manage these molecules, these hydrogen carbon molecules. And so as we look at the transition and the next wave of things that society needs, which is a lower emissions uh world that to decarbonize the, the, the society that we have today. The question that we've asked ourselves is how can we bring our capabilities and skills to bear on solving that problem? And I'm pleased that, yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry, I was gonna say I I'm today, you know, if you go back a little bit in time, the only answer was when solar and EVs which clearly have a role to play and are necessary, but they're not sufficient. One of the things I've been pleased with uh with the Biden administration is the recognition that there's a broader set of solutions needed, a set of solutions that involve the molecule side of the equation as well as the electron side of the equation. Since we're in the molecule business that opens the door for us in carbon capture and storage, uh biofuels hydrogen, a number of opportunities in that space which we now can contribute to as that need grows. And as the markets develop, we, we want to talk about all those things. Today, we want to talk about hydrogen biofuels, what you're doing in lithium, what you're doing in carbon capture. But I do think part of the reason that people are a little skeptical or a lot skeptical about this conversation is because of, of the history that your company has before your, your time as CEO obviously. But the history your company has in climate denial, misinformation. I'm, I'm, I'm old enough to remember Herb Schmertz uh and the, the information campaigns that uh that he ran h how do you address that? History? Well, I think we've been very focused on going forward and what are the opportunities for us to contribute in that space? I think some of the perception out there, we could spend a lot of time debating and arguing that was 3030 years ago. I mean, today the world has moved on, the, the understanding of this challenge has moved on. And I think for where, where we are today is how can we contribute to a solution set, not debate the past. And that's basically what we're trying to do is leverage our capabilities and solve for what society needs. It's no different than what we've done for the last 140 years. We're leveraging the same core competencies, same core capabilities and figuring out how we can use those to advance products that society needs. And frankly, I think today our strategy is pretty robust to whatever the future holds. However quickly the world transitions, our company's position basically contribute. So like a lot of other companies, of course, um you've committed to net zero within a certain time frame, you have a shareholder group that is pushing you to do more, to move faster um to cut greenhouse gasses. Can you talk a little bit about what you are doing and also why you feel why you're pushing back against this particular shareholder group? Sure, I I would just start in terms of our push back to the shareholder. Has nothing to do with the environment or ESG that's not the basis of our uh dispute with that shareholder. But I'll come back to that in a minute. Frankly, what we've looked at is again, with this view, we recognize the challenges associated with, with climate change. We recognize the need to decarbonize and reduce emissions and we're very focused on doing it. If you look at the progress that we've made and what we share in our, in our proxy every year is the progress that we're making with respect to reducing our own emissions. Our scope one and scope two emissions, we've committed to decarbonize to get to net zero in our permanent operation where we're rapidly growing production to demonstrate that in a world of uh growing production that you can reduce your own emissions. And we've got a net zero commitment, a plan to 20 by 2030 to get to Net zero. As you know, we've announced an acquisition of uh pioneer and we've committed to bring their Net zero pledge in 2050 forward to a net zero plan by 2035 we have significantly reduced our methane emissions. Uh We're basically working around the world to reduce our own emissions and then we're providing products to help uh third parties reduce their emissions. So we're starting a carbon capture and storage business. We have three commercial contracts with hard to carbonized sectors. A steel company, an industrial gas company and uh ammonia production company. Now we'll capture 5 million tons per annum of their CO2. That is the equivalent of all the EV sold in the US to date the impact of that reduction on just three deals that we've done. We've acquired Denbury, which is the largest uh CO2 pipeline in the US to act as the spine to allow us to capture more CO2. And so uh making significant progress there, we're building a biofuels plant up in Canada. Uh We've got plans and are developing the world's largest low carbon hydrogen plant that plant alone would basically meet 10% of the Biden administration's low carbon hydrogen ambition. Uh We got plans on when we're working through on that, that will produce low carbon hydrogen and ammonia to help third parties back out their emissions. And as you pointed out, we've got a lithium business again, tapping into our capabilities to understand the subsurface drill uh extract uh liquids. In this case, water extract a lithium from the water and reinject that uh water. It's a lower cost of production for lithium than that exists out there today. And it's a much, much lower uh environmental footprint uh than the current methods. And so we can have a domestic US supplied lithium source to go into this electrification effort. Uh That is more environmentally friendly and more cost effective. And so a number of things that we're pursuing and as the markets develop, we are in a position to continue to lean into that and to bring our capabilities and skills to bear. Yeah, I just want to ask you about that as the markets develop, sorry to interrupt. But, but, but that's an interesting point. I mean, the question is, you know how much of this investment in alternatives is enough? Some people will argue that the European oil companies invest a larger share of their total investment dollars in in renewables than Exxon Mobil does. I mean, how, how do you decide what the right amount of effort is to drive this transition? I think that's a hollow argument. I think the first thing I would point to when you look at the levels of investment is you, you're comparing investments in wind and solar, which are technologies going into an established market with an established demand and an established pricing structure uh that's regulated and people get returns And so our view is we don't bring any real capabilities to that space. Those are, that's the electron solution that I mentioned. We don't bring capabilities other than a checkbook. And so we don't see the ability to generate a above average returns for our investors. And so we, while we recognize the need for that, we don't think it's an appropriate use of Exxonmobil's uh capabilities. We're focused on areas where there aren't solutions where we're going to decarbonize, help decarbonize harder to carbonize industries where today they don't have readily available solutions that wind and solar won't be effective at meeting their needs. So we're, we're basically concentrating our effort in that space. We're starting businesses from scratch. So I think when you look at the investment level, you have to look at it in the context of what is the opportunity set that you're investing in. We're building businesses from brand new. It's going to take time to get those businesses up and going. But somebody needs to do that. And so I think that the comparison of what we're investing in uh businesses that don't exist today versus people who are investing in businesses and sectors that do exist is a false comparison. Likewise, it's false comparison to say we're going to look at the oil and gas industry, which is an enormous industry with enormous demand and look at what you're spending in that space versus what you're spending in an area where there's basically nothing exists today. Again, a false comparison with time. If the market develops and grows and and replaces traditional energy system, my expectation is our investment will be just as big there. But we're at a much earlier part of the development curve in that space. And that is reflective of the investments we're making. I just give you one fact Allen, if you look at what we are spending in reducing emissions, it's the equivalent on an annual basis of one third of what the EU sepa spends to manage the uh environment for the whole of the US. I mean, that's a substantial amount of money for a company going into a sector in a bus, a value chain of business that doesn't exist today. And Darren, just to, I go back real quick to the shareholder question. I know you wanted to address that. Can you explain a little bit of you said push back is not because of the efforts and the plans to, to cut greenhouse gasses, but I what's going on? So make maybe just a little bit of context for that. You know, over the last 10 years, we've had 100 and 40 shareholder proposals submitted about half of those are from activist investors or activist shareholders. And I would make the distinction between the activists versus investors in our company and the difference. The key difference is the activists don't have an economic interest in the outcomes uh that they're proposing or in the uh returns that the company generates. Uh of that uh half of those uh proposals that have been submitted, roughly half of those have been submitted by just three activist groups. And so uh these individuals, while we talk about, we are, we are, I would tell you as a company very, very focused on shareholder rights. In fact, we like small shareholders. We've prided ourselves on the fact that our company has a very large base of small shareholders and we work really hard to keep them engaged and to bring them to the table and to exercise their rights and to, and to voice their concerns and their and their views. Uh We have a uh extensive outreach program. We try to bring them into the annual meeting so that I would say that we recognize the importance of the shareholders voice and wanna cater to the shareholders who are real investors who have an interest in seeing this company successful in generating return on their investments. We feel feel a huge responsibility to that. We don't feel a responsibility for activists that hijack that process, a legitimate process and frankly abuse it to, to uh advance an ideology that's inconsistent with the well being of the company. And I would tell you in this case for our June of capital and follow this. First of all, both of those proponents have publicly expressed the desire to basically diminish Exxonmobil's business and to stop the production of oil and gas. That's contrary to the, the benefit of most of our shareholders. Um They have um submitted this proposal in the past. This is the third time it was submitted last year when it was submitted, it got just over 10% of the vote under sec rules that that proposal should be, that proposal should be um excluded if it doesn't have, didn't have 15% of the vote. But the S ECs interpretation of that has led to uh basically allowing these proposals to come in time and time again. So the shareholders have reviewed that and have spoken on that topic and their scope three target, their, their proposal ask us to reduce SCOPE three, which is essentially the emissions of our customers and the way that we would have to do that is to reduce the sales of oil and gas. Uh So that's getting right into the heart of what we're doing. And our, the uh follow, this has been very clear that their objective is to get us to stop selling oil and gas. Uh That's basically what we do as a business. And so you've got a proponent getting right into the heart of the business sec rules should exclude that as well as ordinary business. And it is micromanaging. And so we're taking issue with the fact that the sec its interpretation of the current regulation is allowing this to abuse and we're looking for relief from that abuse, which we think is actually in the best interest of all of our shareholders and, and, and by the way, the best interests of society, I mean, stop oil and gas is not, not gonna be good for the world at this point in history. You're absolutely right. If you think about what we sell, we sell LNG, every ton of LNG we sell, basically backs out of coal, uh coal burning somewhere in the world. Typically, we're sending our LNG out to, to uh uh Asia. And so, you know, today there is an advantage to the products that we sell and, and by the way, the money that we're using there and the capabilities that we've built doing that we're now using for the transition. And so I think it's, you know, you, you don't want to force you, they're working a supply issue when the problem is in the demand side of the equation. And we're trying to balance the two, be the most responsible operator. So that as long as the world needs these products, you've got a company that you can rely on to do it, environment as environmentally friendly as possible as we continue to work for opportunities to diversify and decarbonize Mahal. I just wanna quickly follow up on that though. So you're saying that follow this and Arjuna are very different than say Engine One. I mean, Engine One was referred to as an activist when they came after your board. Yeah, I think again, this is, that's completely, that's, that's another I'd say kettle of fish, so to speak. Uh Engine number one basically was out to make a name for itself. Uh It did not have a specific agenda uh for Exxonmobil and to change at Exxonmobil other than to bring new directors onto the board, I would point out Alan if you look at Engine number One, while they were successful at bringing uh three directors onto the board, and those three directors came in without an an an engine one agenda, but more of an agenda to make sure that the company could be as successful as possible as we spent the year that they came in getting them briefed up on our strategy. Uh The basis of our strategy, why we were making the decisions that we were making when it came time to approve our plan that year in November, all three of those activist investors endorsed our plan 100%. And as we reviewed the strategy and rolled our strategy out that was endorsed. And so I would tell you maybe contrary to the, the perception out there, bringing those investors, those board members on that were keenly focused on making sure Exxonmobil was doing all it could to be successful and having them conclude that yeah, we were and that the plans that we had in place and the strategy we had developed was exactly doing it basically strengthened our board and their resolve for us to continue down the path that we were on. And so it's been a, a benefit to the company, maybe contrary to, to reinforce the path that we are on, contrary to maybe what many people thought out there. And we should note, um I think some of these same groups are also um you know, pushing for similar things uh at other companies. It is not Exxon Mobile specific. Um It's also at Shell and, and, and uh let, let me ask you a question that, that draws on your technical expertise and your analysis. Uh because you're now heavily invested in all sides of this transition. You see what's happening in hydrogen, you've made this big investment in carbon capture and storage. Uh You're now an investor in lithium. So you're part of the uh electrical economy. How long is this going to take? What is 2050 anywhere near a realistic goal? And if it's not 2050 when is it going to happen, what does your analysis show? So I'll start with the end and, and work my way forward with your question. And frankly, I don't know when the end is gonna come. I think 2050 from what you see today, what's being done today, the infrastructure investments that are being made. We're not on the path to 2050. I think most objective analysis would tell you that uh we've waited too long to open the aperture on the solution sets in terms of what we need as a society to start reducing emissions. And we're not investing nearly enough in the technology. Today's technology will not solve this problem. Uh And the reason is uh there's a cost issue here and if you look at the the solutions being offered, the the you know, the dirty secret that nobody talks about is how much is all this going to cost and who's willing to pay for it. And if you look at the policies that are being put out the way the governments are advancing this, the cost is very implicit, it's not an explicit cost. Now, we have, we have tabled proposals with the US, governments and governments around the world that there are mechanisms to get out there and start down this path using existing technology. But you need to make the cost transparent and the people who are generating the emissions need to be aware of and pay the price for that for generating those emissions. That's ultimately how you solve the problem. The issue today is it's too expensive. People can't afford it and they know governments around the world rightly know that their constituents. We'll have real concerns with that. And so we've gotta find a way to get the cost down to, to grow the utility of the solution set and make it more available and more affordable so that you can begin this transition. And so today, I would tell you, uh, we're not on that path. Uh, the policies that are being put in place aren't aggressive enough and don't incentivize the right kind of actions to, to be successful here. But if not 2050 win. I mean, what do you, what path are we on? Where? Tell me Allen, when, when is, when are people going to be willing to pay for a carbon reduction? Because today we have opportunities to make fuels with lower carbon in it. But people aren't willing to spend the money to do that. There are businesses aren't willing to spend it a week today. Make sustainable aviation fuel for the airline business, but the airline companies can't afford to pay for what it will cost to make sustainable aviation fuel. And so the challenge, when will they, when will it be economic? Are you saying never? This is the issue. This is, I think this is the value of the IRA which is you gotta start down, you gotta start with something you have to catalyze the work catalyze the investment, get started on the technology curve to see if you can uh innovate if all the technology and get the cost down. And I can't predict if we'll be successful in that space or not. What I can say is we haven't society as a whole, hasn't been doing enough of it and frankly uh society. And I'd say that the activists, the, the, the the dominant voice in this discussion have tried to exclude the industry that has the most capacity and the highest potential for helping with that some of these technologies. And so uh how quickly will the technology uh discoveries come? The innovation comes? How quickly can we scale those things? How low can we get the cost? I frankly can't answer that, but I do know there's a lot of work that needs to be happening today to make that uh give us a chance of success. I'll give you one example. We're investing in direct air capture. We're, we're using the technology that we have this molecule expertise that I talked to you about to figure out if there's new ways new technologies that we can use to directly capture carbon from the air. We've just built a pilot plan or prototype that we're, we're working on trying to cut the cost in half which by the way will still be too expensive. But we want to get down on that curve and there are a lot of companies out there trying to, to advance the technology in this space. How quickly will they, you know, will they succeed? I, I don't know the answer to that but Mahal just before we leave this, but you mentioned the Ira, you know, I don't think that's got nearly the, the attention that it probably deserves in this debate. You're getting huge subsidies to do that, aren't you the, the, the, the way that the government is incentivized and trying to catalyze investments, space is through subsidies. And the challenge you make the point, they are huge subsidies because the cost of doing this today is high. And if you're going to, if you're going to uh drive significant investments at a scale that even gets close to moving the needle, it's going to cost a lot of money. And so I think the government today is trying to incentivize that to get things moving. But I would tell you, building a business on government subsidy is not a long term sustainable strategy. We are not, we, we, we don't support that. Uh We're, we have committed ourselves to um use the IRA to try to get started on that. But at the same time, we're advocating to move to market market forces uh either through regulation prices on carbon. Different, there are different mechanisms out there today. The challenge with all those solutions that is the cost of that ultimately bears its explicitly bears itself in the price of products out there. And that's where the challenge comes. And so today you can, you'd rather just, you'd rather just have a straight tax on carbon. I think if you price car carbon, put, put a carbon price out there or regulate the carbon intensity of products uh that, that will drive the markets to start innovating and find solutions rather than having the government craft unique policy to incentivize different levels of investment in different technology spaces. I think, you know, that's I've accepted that as a, a bridge to get to an ultimate solution. But ultimately, the markets have to work in this space. If we don't get the markets to work in this space, we will not be successful as a society to, to decarbonize. So, um let's talk about an area where we have seen consumer behavior shift somewhat. Um The EV space and I know you guys are, we mentioned earlier, you mentioned a few times you're in the lithium business now. Um there's been a slowdown in demand though. So what do you see going forward in the EV space? And how does it impact you? Well, I would tell you. So, first of all, from our perspective, we don't, we, we, I don't have a view, I don't have a bias one way or the other. Again, it comes back to what does the market want. And we've always felt like from the very beginning when we were doing the analysis that, that people were extrapolating from very small sample sizes are very small, you know, data sets into this ev growth. So we never believe that, you know, just like any other product you're, you're moving through segment, consumer segments and tiers that as you penetrate those segments change and their motivations and abilities and desires, all that begins to, you know, so they're always felt like we're extrapolating too, too small of a set. So I felt like in the past, the projections were too high. And uh and I think we're projecting now, we've, we've had this, this lull and people now are kind of doom and gloom. And I don't believe that either. Frankly, I think, you know, my mind, we're planning for long term that the electric vehicles will have a role to play. Uh they'll penetrate uh to a certain level in society and the costs have to continue to come down. Our view is, you know, frankly, the reason we're in lithium is because we can provide our skill sets to a product that the, that the world's gonna need as we electrify, generally speaking, and battery usage goes up. And so we see long term demand for lithium. And then our view is we can produce that uh at a lower cost and more and more environmentally friendly footprint. And therefore there's an advantage that we can bring to that space. That's why we're interested in lithium trying to predict exactly what the sales are. I would tell you, I don't think we're any better than anybody else out there. I would just say we don't get too caught up in the hyperbole. We didn't get overly excited when people were saying it was gonna go through the moon and we're now not, you know, overly depressed that people are saying that the thing stalled and we're not gonna take, I think that the answers is somewhere in between there and society will figure that out. And our view is we'll be there with a product that that's gonna be needed to make that successful and, and you're able to, to extract it also from the United States currently and there's, there's even more that we're finding. So, um can you also kind of talk about what that means in terms of, you know, obviously, we're seeing across the board with manufacturing, uh a lot of incentives also to manufacture domestically. Um What does it mean for the company and, and for the country? So I think, you know, our, our, there's clearly this view that, you know, as you think about moving into new technologies, new products that you want to have a secure source of supply. Uh Our view is, and I think that's true with lithium, certainly true with energy and, and oil and gas in our business. And our view is, you know, I I think the right answer for any one country or one segment of society or, or business is to have diversified supplies. I would tell you from our perspective, it's not about making sure that it only happens within the US. It's really making sure that you have options and availability. You don't find yourself tied to any one single source of supply or dominated by a single source of supply that basically just like in business, you know, gives that supplier power and, and you wanna try to uh you know, not be found, found to be basically dependent on any, any one single entity out there. So I think domestic supply is important from that standpoint, we're not committing ourselves to domestic supply. We're really, this is a, this is a um an extraction process that I think again, it has a lot of benefits to what uh technology currently exists out there. One that we have a capability in, but it will be dictated in terms of where you do it based on where those resources reside. You gotta have a concentration of lithium in this brine water to make it economically feasible. The, the acres that we have in Arkansas that we're trying to develop, has that concentration makes it economically viable. And therefore we're developing that there are other opportunities around the US and around the world that will look to basically develop as well and pace that with the growth in, in the lithium uh demand and the supply that comes on. Uh Darren, I, I'd let you go back to this question of how long is this all going to take? Because I don't believe we've quite Alan needs a year. He needs a month and a day. I can't, I can't give that to you. I don't know the answer to that. But, but, but let me ask you this, uh I am 100% in agreement with you that we would all be better off if we had effective governments that could put a price on carbon and, and, and create a market that you could compete in. Uh that provides the right incentives to get us there. We don't have effective government. We're not, and we're not, we don't seem to be headed in that direction. Uh The IRA, as you pointed out, it may not have been the way you would do it, but it was a big, big deal. I don't know how many more things like that you're gonna get. So I guess the, the question I have for you is in that environment, what is the responsibility of Exxonmobil to push the market forward to push us towards a solution? Uh And how far are you willing to go in doing that? So I think, you know, this is the challenge we have uh a whole set of responsibility. One of is to advance technology, provide solutions that help society achieve its objective. That's clearly an object. We also have an objective and responsibility to our shareholders. We have to balance those objective sets. I think unlike a lot of activist groups and and ideologues that are out there who can focus on a single variable or a single cause. That's a luxury that we don't have. So we have to figure out how we can strike the right balance offer solutions that meet these growing needs, develop technologies. And we do do that. We have invested in these technologies. I I mentioned to you the direct air capture that we're doing. I mentioned the things that we're doing in carbon capture and stores. Those are all things that are very early in the stages that frankly today won't be viable long term uh businesses if society doesn't, doesn't start to put a value on decarbonization. And so to a certain extent, it's a little bit like exploration uh in our upstream business is that we see an opportunity we're managing and mitigating the downside uh and positioning ourselves for the upside. I think that's the most that you can ask for a public company out there. But how much of how much of an effect of the, the IRA subsidies have on, on your business? Oh I I would tell you uh if you, if you look at the lithium business, there's an established market and price out there. So it's not directly part of the IRA subsidies, but it is driven by evs which are part of the Ira subsidies and so indirectly the subsidies are behind the lithium business, the carbon capture and storage business. I would say the incentives to do that are all driven through the government, the the low carbon hydrogen. Again, uh there's not a market out there to sell low carbon hydrogen to a third party without the government subsidies, uh biofuels that we're investing in, in, in Canada as an example, are driven through regulation. And so I would tell you today, there's not a viable market where uh consumers step in and are willing to pay a premium for low carbon products. That's the reality of what we face today. I get, I can't drive demand and I can't, I can't make customers pay more for a product that has uh less carbon in. So you're a fan of the IRA. Our view is it's, it's an important bridge to get things started. So my mind is, yes, you gotta have, the government has to play a role. I would have used, I would have had the government play a different role. But to the extent that's what they chose to, they make the political decisions. They're answerable to answerable to the people. I don't, I, I don't pretend to be uh I am answerable to my shareholders and investors not to the general public. So the government has its role, makes its decisions and that construct, we're trying to be a, a positive force to demonstrate that this can actually work. And to start down that learning curve, whether we'll be successful as a society with that remains to be seen. But to your, your, your broader question of when we don't know the answer to that, what we've been looking at are the signpost, what has to happen in, in order for us to get onto this path. And so we have a very active um a process of monitoring um you know, investment in infrastructure. You know, if you're gonna electrify the whole country you, you gotta have transmission systems and distribution systems. Do we see the permits going into those things? Uh Do we see the advances in scale technology? There's a lot of things that we're watching. Do you see a market developing many, many things that we're looking at? And frankly, if you look at those sign posts, you don't see the activity. And I would tell you, my view is we got to move away from our governments and politicians talk talking in aspirational terms and uh building um the narrative based on hope and roll your sleeves up and start doing some real math here about what's the, how are we gonna get from where we're at to where we want to go to? What's it gonna take? How much is it gonna cost, who's best positioned to do that and actually start building a, a feasible plan that balances all the competing forces out there rather than ignoring the constraints and challenges and focusing on the hope and aspirations that in my mind will never solve the problem. And we're not doing enough of that as a world as, as a society. I don't see many governments anywhere sitting down and actually tackling these issues and inviting the right people in industry and government to roll their sleeves up and start building a plan to accomplish what, what they uh what the world basically needs. That's a great sign post. Look for you. Tell me when that starts to happen. I tell you we're on the path. So he sang September 5th, I think 2050. We, we have been advocating, I, I tell you that we have volunteered with every government uh that we engage with that when they're ready to do that, we're ready to sit down and, and contribute our piece. I'm not, I don't pretend that we have all the answers. I just think that we can, we can contribute uh asking many other companies and when they're ready for a contribution, a serious contribution, a serious conversation, they wanna do real, they wanna bring the engineers to the table, use data and analysis to figure out how we solve it. We're here, we're there, we're ready. Uh And we've been volunteering to do that for some time now and I would tell you some countries, some countries must be doing that. Some countries are doing that as you go around the world. I would tell the US with the Ira. They've been, I would tell you very constructive discussions with the US administration around. How do you bring the Ira? How do you translate the legislation and the practical regulations that incentivize industry to do these things? And we're, we're bringing our perspective again, I'm not suggesting that our perspective is necessarily the only perspective or the right perspective, but it is one that is based on a very deep understanding of our industry and the technical capabilities required to achieve some of these objectives. And so we're trying to be a positive constructive force here, positivity and, and, and constructive conversations uh with government between private sector and government sound like a pretty good thing. Um So we'll take, we'll take it. Um I want to ask you a question just about you and, and your leadership. Um You've been with the company for a long time. You are driving this transition and transformation currently, but I've seen it go through multiple changes over the decades and, and just give us a little bit of your take of, you know, what is the Exxon Mobil culture? How is it shifted and how is it not shifted? What, what are kind of the, the core, um you know, values or aspects of the culture that you feel like are really consistent. I think a lot of people don't know this, but I don't know anything about it. No, I think you're right. I think, and frankly, I, I, as I came into this job, one of the things that I guess upset me the most was that the perception of our company doesn't match the reality of the people who are in it and the hard work they do uh every day. And so one of my objectives is to basically try to help the outside world better understand our company and the people that work here and the work we do. And I would just point to, you know, probably the most explicit step that we took was the, I don't know if you um the C NBC uh engagement that we had with David Faber, where we, I invited him to come in and all I asked him to do was be objective. Uh And we gave him access to anywhere he wanted to go talk to any people in our company. And my view was if people on the outside got to see who we were, what we did and how our people approach their jobs, that that would start to um change some of the perception, recognizing it's a very long road to go on. And so that was the first effort. But if you ask, we have a set of core values and one that I've grown up with, they haven't changed. Uh We're trying to express them more effectively externally, but I would start with one that's I think for me has been critical for my entire career. In fact, what's brought me to this company is integrity, not just being honest and ethical, but uh being intellectually honest and saying the hard things and taking positions on what we believe on based on the facts and not jumping on bandwagons or subscribing to popular narratives. If we don't believe those are the right things, I would tell you a second, really critical um value for us is courage of conviction is that once you figured out the right thing, once you've done the assessment and you've got an answer. You've got to stand up and talk about it, you can't be afraid to go against the conventional wisdom. And I would tell you in this job, certainly, I felt the, the, uh the pressure to conform and I know what it feels like to stand against the, the popular narrative. But our view is if you've done the analysis, right? If you, if you have done it objectively, if you're not letting your emotions bias your thinking, but instead are kind of coming back to what is it gonna take to be successful for the long term that ultimately things come back around? Uh And, and you're proven that the path was the correct one. And then the third uh one that I would just mention is, you know, resilience that you, you gotta be in this for the long haul and you've gotta stand the pressure. And I would tell you, uh you know, those three of our five core values that we talk about with all of our employees. And, and so when you come here, we, we're not, we're not promising an easy uh career, but we're, we're promising a rewarding one and one that you can feel good about the first job I had in this company long time ago. Uh My first supervisor had gave me two pieces of advice that I've lived with since that time. And the first one was if you're ever doing something that you'd be embarrassed for your mother to read about on the front page of the paper, stop doing it. And I have lived with that my entire and that is really good advice. And the second one he told me was every morning you gotta get up and look yourself in the mirror and make sure you like what you see. And I just would tell you, you know, do, do the right thing for the right reasons in the right way and uh the rest will come with it. And so, I mean, that is, I would tell you, you go across, we have very committed people focused on uh doing the right thing in the right way for the right reasons. And um and they're making a difference and we have made a difference. If you look at our industry, I think it's hard to point to any industry that has uh progressed human living standards around the world. And uh we take great pride in that, but we're not, we're not um buried by that or married to that idea. The idea is that the world changes, things evolve. We've got a capability. Our job is to continue to contribute to society and basically help people uh achieve prosperity to improve living standards. And our, our people take great pride in our ability to do that. And we are, you know, going through a transition, but it will be a long one. This people don't fully appreciate the scale of the industry that we're in today. And so I think, you know, the recognition back to your question now about how long will it take? You gotta come back to the size of the existing energy system today? It is big, it will take time to replace. But my point is we gotta get started on it. But I would say, you know, I can't believe you, you voluntarily went back to Allen's question. I'm a g for punishing. What can I say? The, the, the other thing, Darren, I, that, that uh uh that uh notion that you don't want to read anything and you don't want your mother to read anything in the paper. It sort of depends on what paper she's reading too. My mother is not a good litmus test for that, by the way because she thinks her son does no wrong. So, but I just, I would just finish up the, those three I gave you the two more kind of our core values. Uh One is care, care about what you're doing and why you're doing it. And um uh care for the people that you work with, the communities that you're in and the environment. Uh we feel very strongly about that. And I think if you had the chance to be one of our operations, you would clearly see that. And the, the fifth one that we hold ourselves is excellence that we hold ourselves to a high standard. We expect a lot of ourselves and of our people. And when we don't uh meet this, this high expectations, uh we challenge ourselves to get better and those are the five core values I think, uh most everybody in our company, uh believe in and, and resonates with them. But I, but I wanna say we appreciate the fact that you have taken a different approach towards conversing with. I wouldn't say the public with the media on these things. I really appreciate the fact that you've come, uh, here today and spent so much time with us on, on this issue. I just have to ask you, I mean, this is a big, complicated, difficult transition. You're under a lot of, uh, pressure, a lot of pushback that you've talked about. What do you do to relax? I mean, do you watch Hallmark movies? Do you, I mean, what, what, you know, I have, uh, the, I have a, a lot of, uh, I put a lot of priority in my family. And so, uh, that's probably what I would tell you. I've never brought work home to my family. I try to keep them separated from the things I do day in day. And so when I come home, we, unless I want to, which is very rare. Uh, we don't talk about work. Uh, we talk about, you know what's happening in their lives. I've got three kids, I've got three grandkids, got another one on the way. And so I've, when I'm not at work, uh, I'm with the family and, and I, I try to get away and, uh, I like to go outside. We spend a lot of time outside. Uh, I've got some, some property in the hill country of Texas. I like to get away from. So I think getting clear my mind and I don't get too weighed down. I try to disconnect from the world. I'm not a social media guy. I'm not on the internet all the time. II, I just feel like that, uh, your Children, your Children and grandchildren aren't harassing you about why you aren't going faster to, uh, deal with the energy transition. I think my, my grandchildren are too young to that. We'll see when they get a little bit older than my old. The oldest is four. So I think she's not quite up to that argument yet. But, you know, I given how she is today, I'm pretty sure at some stage she gonna give me, she will give me a run for my money. But I think my kids, they know they know, uh, what I stand for. They've grown up with me. You know, we've always believed in sitting around the kitchen table. And so despite long work hours, my wife and kids always accommodated that we always sat down for dinner when I was in town and I would tell you our dinners were always long and we always talked and always challenged them. You know, my gift to them is independent thinking and listen carefully, understand what people are saying, but make sure that you make your own decisions and you have a basis for doing that. And I think over the years, I don't, can't think of a topic that we didn't, we haven't touched on and, and discussed. So my, my kids know why I do the things that I do and they know, uh, you know, the, the company that I work for and represent is very aligned with those principles and the values that I have as an individual. And so, uh they know they know what I'm doing to try to help solve this problem for the world. Well, Darren, thank you so much for sitting with us, as Alan said, we really appreciate you taking the time and, um, telling us so much about the company, both, you know, the transformation, the culture and, and all of it. Thank you. Happy to do it, enjoy the conversation and, uh, look forward maybe seeing you sometime in New York.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709044376934,"updatedAt":1709072475176,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1708992000000,"duration":{"value":2653,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731","name":"How $4 Billion CEO Is Leveraging Remote Work and Globalization to Prove Both Are Alive and Well","slug":"how-$4-billion-ceo-is-leveraging-remote-work-and-globalization-to-prove-both-are-alive-and-well","shortDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","longDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","seoTitle":"How $4 Billion CEO Is Leveraging Remote Work and Globalization to Prove Both Are Alive and Well","seoDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","socialTitle":"How $4 Billion CEO Is Leveraging Remote Work and Globalization to Prove Both Are Alive and Well","socialDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","tags":[{"name":"ai","type":"tag","label":"AI"},{"name":"remote_work","type":"tag","label":"remote work"},{"name":"return_to_office","type":"tag","label":"return to office"},{"name":"globalization","type":"tag","label":"globalization"},{"name":"globalization_partners","type":"tag","label":"Globalization Partners"},{"name":"nicole_sahin","type":"tag","label":"Nicole Sahin"},{"name":"fort","type":"tag","label":"Fort"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Illustration by Fortune.

As soon as this podcast. That is awesome. Thank you so much. I love that. Welcome to Leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia after years of helping Silicon Valley's high growth companies expand internationally, I thought there had to be a much easier way to help companies hire talent in new markets without setting up branches and subsidiaries in each country. My vision was to just set up one company in each country and give all of our customers access to it so that they could quickly and easily be able to hire talent in each country while being compliant with the local labor hr and tax laws and then also building technology on top to make it automated. How is it that you're doing so well? At a time when in theory, globalization is in retreat, I think that there is a movement or like the idea of, hey, you know, I want to buy for my local grocer. I wanna, I wanna grow my food in my backyard and I, and I think that's wonderful and people do it or I want to buy American. But the reality is, is that our, our, our entire economic ecosystem is so interwoven so closely together that if any, any size, any business of any scale ultimately has people and talent from all over the world and you just can't build an enterprise level business or even any, any high growth company has talent from all over the world. So I just don't see it. I don't see, I don't believe that globalization is in reverse. What are the, the kind of up and coming hubs so that, that you're seeing India is really interesting and compelling. I mean, that country has been just such a marvel to watch from a business perspective in the early two thousands companies were always outsourcing there and it was, it was considered like cheap talent now what we're seeing and especially in the last five years, the digital economy and, and like the, the modernization of the economy that they've built from the ground up in country is really incredible. Now, we're seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland, for example. And it's just, it's awesome to see like a whole nation come online in, in the course of a of a couple of decades. Can you talk about how A I is accelerating what you're doing? So the vast majority of our business can be fully automated. I think about 95% of our business can be automated. And that's because on boarding an employee in a country, it's like the same questions every time. How many, how many vacation days does this person need? What's the benefits requirements? So a lot of that can just be managed through A I, we use A I within our product platform, we call it JIA and it's the first of its kind global Intelligence assistant, which basically makes it faster and easier for companies to hire, manage and, and manage all of their global legal hr and tax compliance globally. In combination with our platform, I'm curious to hear a little bit about your path to founding the company um because it wasn't a traditional path when I was right out of college, I thought I wanted to be an anthropologist and I went and lived in the highlands of Northern Guatemala and lived with an indigenous family. We're getting to this now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was that the first global Globalization partners office in the highlands of Guatemala? I think it was probably where it was seated all in, for sure. Anyway, I was hanging out in this village in the northern highlands of Guatemala trying to follow in the footsteps of an anthropologist from the 19 fifties, Maude Oaks. And after a certain period of time, I realized that being a twentysomething year old young blonde woman, trying to study shamanic traditions in the northern highlands of Guatemala and learn an ancient language. Nobody had ever heard of probably was better for National Geographic than real life. And um not as, not as fun as I thought it was gonna be. I left Guatemala and I ended up applying for business school shortly after that and, and got an MB A in international management shortly after that was um advising the high growth companies in the early two thousands, like uh Netsuite and Tesla and Inane and was ultimately like an outsourced international compliance advisor, helping them set up their companies and, and, and manage their headcount all over the globe. And in doing that, I was managing lawyers and tax advisors and accountants in like 60 different countries. Um and kind of doing the same thing over and over again. And I just thought if I could build this once in a way that every company could have access to it, I would have a much more scalable business platform.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1708112258147,"updatedAt":1708426813793,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1708426813793,"duration":{"value":272,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"cee737f4-d281-4774-a196-9c49d43acb17","name":"Blackbird.AI CEO on helping humans stop harmful AI","slug":"blackbird.ai-ceo-on-helping-humans-stop-harmful-ai","shortDescription":"Compass, a “context product” launched by Blackbird, uses gen AI to help people check posts and other online media for misinformation and disinformation.","longDescription":"Wasim Khaled believes that “human beings are not yet ready” for the warped realities that can be spread through harmful AI.

What's the one headline that we're not seeing about A I? There are so many headlines out there about A I, I'm trying to think which one is not really being covered. I think the one that I would like to see and we're seeing a little bit more play there is that the degree to which A I can be used for good versus evil is not based on the morality of the A I, but in the morality of the user, it is a human problem, not an A I problem. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, what does Blackbird A I do for me? So if we are equipping uh analysts and uh threat intelligence teams to get a better sense of what are the mechanisms behind this narrative attack. So most people perceive that as something that just happened and we show them, OK, there might be a bot network, for example, that was deployed, that is amplifying and driving the reach of that particular narrative. And if you think about it, every organization has a narrative and every narrative has a counter narrative. And so it is the seeding of all of these counter narratives that are tearing down the messaging that that company wants to put out there in the world uh that we really enable them to see. So I think what keeps you up at night when it comes to A I, I would say it's not just A I, but it's the application of A I to harmful acts, particularly in our space that is about warped realities. And uh I would say that the biggest problem today around those work realities and the utilization of A I to drive them is that as a society, human beings aren't yet ready to question every single thing that they see, whether I not even just see but see, hear uh read. And so the fact that we have to question our reality on everything that we look at and try to perceive is extremely disturbing. And I think about also what our younger Children, you know, I'm, I'm a father and, and I think about like the world that they're growing up in without that appeal to be able to know uh if what they're seeing or looking at is artificial or manipulated. And so that concerns me and that's really why we do what we do keeps me up to. There is reason to be hopeful because the same types of technologies that frankly are making the problem worse can be used as a, as a defensive measure or a kind of illuminating uh product as well. February 14th is Valentine's Day. Actually, we're launching a product. It's something we call compass. Uh we call it compass because it helps you see the way a little bit more. It is a context product. And so you can give it a question, you can give it a link or a post or a meme or even a link to a video and it will use our generative A I models and all of the risk signals we've developed for our enterprise customers around bot activity and, and, and harmful communities. And it will tell you as much non biased kind of two sided context along with sources and, and where that came from as well as summarizing points like a, like a chat GP T and uh and, and we think that's something that could be incredible for people who help the average person discern the truth. Why put it out on Valentine's Day? Is there a message there or is it a coincidence? It is for the love of what we do?","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1707853040364,"updatedAt":1707908413816,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1707908413816,"duration":{"value":227,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}}]}}],"section":"Hero","state":"Published","index":0},{"id":"094fe6ba-dbcb-42ce-aa5a-c3a150ffa8bf","displayPage":"/videos","name":"Founders Forum 2023","viewportSize":{"web":5},"type":"PLAYLIST_TRAY","source":{"from":"PLAYLIST_SOURCE","playlistName":"Founders Forum 2023"},"items":[{"type":"PLAYLIST_ITEM","playlist":{"name":"Founders Forum 2023","type":"Playlist","state":"Published","premium":false,"posterImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/Playlists%2FFounders%2520Forum%25202023%2FImages%2FposterImage-ver1.jpg","videosOrderedByUser":[{"videoId":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179","name":"A.I. is uncovering the secrets of your body's microbiome","slug":"a.i.-is-uncovering-the-secrets-of-your-body's-microbiome","longDescription":"Jona founder Leo Grady thinks pairing A.I. capabilities with the evolving science around the microbiome can lead to big health improvements—and be the basis for a successful business.","seoTitle":"A.I. is uncovering the secrets of your body's microbiome","seoDescription":"Jona founder Leo Grady thinks pairing A.I. capabilities with the evolving science around the microbiome can lead to big health improvements\n","socialTitle":"A.I. is uncovering the secrets of your body's microbiome","socialDescription":"Jona founder Leo Grady thinks pairing A.I. capabilities with the evolving science around the microbiome can lead to big health improvements—and be the basis for a successful business.","tags":[{"name":"leo_grady","type":"tag","label":"Leo Grady"},{"name":"jonah","type":"tag","label":"Jonah"},{"name":"biopharma","type":"tag","label":"BioPharma"},{"name":"crohn","type":"tag","label":"Crohn"},{"name":"jona_health","type":"tag","label":"Jona Health"},{"name":"a_i_","type":"tag","label":"A.I."}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":3,"key":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/HLS/video-ver3_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":3,"key":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/SRT/captions-ver3.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I think if you're not continuing to learn and continuing to grow as, as both a person and as an entrepreneur, then you're probably in the wrong place. Jonah is building these large language models on the microbiome specifically because the microbiome is so complex and the science is evolving very quickly. Every single month, more than 2000 papers are being published in PUBMED on the microbiome. No human being can read all of those papers but a large language model can and what these papers are showing is that the microbiome really underpins so much of human health, not just G I and autoimmune conditions, but cancer, obesity, liver disease, diabetes, even Parkinson's Alzheimer's depression anxiety. And so we have the opportunity to really bring this world's knowledge to interpreting a microbiome test and evolve that toward the clinical mainstream. So we're starting with a wellness product that is cash pay. And so selling that really through two channels. One is through uh concierge medicine, integrated medicine, functional medicine where patients are are paying cash for excellent services that really go beyond the normal mainstream of of clinical medicine. And then we're also selling direct to consumer on our website. As we move forward, our goal is to go beyond the current literature and build a whole platform of microbiome data and an A I layer on top of that. And then from that platform, be able to build whole new diagnostics, whole new therapeutics and uh and really work with the life sciences industry, the BioPharma industry, even the food and beverage industry to take this information to make better medications and better food. So I've had a number of people in my family who have Crohn's disease, colitis, celiac undiagnosed G I issues. And as I've watched them go on this journey of, of trying to get a diagnosis or even when they have a diagnosis, trying to manage these diseases, trying to understand what they can eat, what drugs are going to work for them. The demand and the need out there is, is real. And I think it's something that's very energizing and motivating for both myself and the team. You know, the funny thing is I've never actually been at the earliest stage of a company before. You know, when I joined, when I finished my phd, I joined Seamen. It was 400,000 employees, right? The ninth largest employer in the world. And then heart flow. When I joined, there were 50 when we grew to about 500. When I joined page, there were about 15 and we grew to about 100 and 70. But this stage is actually quite a bit different. And so my, my comfort zone is probably like, you know, a year from now when, when we have a little bit further, we're a little further along with processes. So just, you know, all of that initial stuff, setting up payroll in the beginning and, and all of that, um, were things I hadn't done before. I think you need conviction on what you're doing and it needs to be something that you wake up every day and, and want to do.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691612631114,"updatedAt":1692716922672,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691625600000,"duration":{"value":224,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"socMed":false,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c","name":"This couple is on a mission to create helpful A.I., and they are starting in the grocery store","slug":"this-couple-is-on-a-mission-to-create-helpful-a.i.,-and-they-are-starting-in-the-grocery-store","shortDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","longDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","seoTitle":"This couple is on a mission to create helpful A.I","seoDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","socialTitle":"This couple is on a mission to create helpful A.I., and they are starting in the grocery store","socialDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","tags":[{"name":"nasrin_mostafazadeh","type":"tag","label":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh"},{"name":"omid_bakhshandeh","type":"tag","label":"Omid Bakhshandeh"},{"name":"quinn","type":"tag","label":"Quinn"},{"name":"verneek","type":"tag","label":"Verneek"},{"name":"a_i_","type":"tag","label":"A.I."},{"name":"iran","type":"tag","label":"Iran"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"We've been obsessed with making human language, the new machine language and we literally couldn't let go of it. And I'm so thrilled that the technology is finally working. Our mission is to build the most helpful A I that augments human knowledge for anyone anywhere at any time. What we have done is to build this A I platform that can basically make these very seamless interfaces that you can put on top of any digital environment, any data that you have in any shape or form and make you as a consumer to make better, faster decisions using voice and text interfaces. So the very first use case that we could spin off of our platform happens to be in the shopping domain. So in the commerce, so e-commerce or physical retail and brick and mortar stores. So what Quin shopping A I does is it follows, it helps you get answer to your personalized questions with the most accurate up to date. In, for example, uh Mama four can ask, what is the healthiest peanut butter I can buy that costs under $4 in this particular store. And then Quinn literally immediately spontaneously gives you the very particular peanut butter. That is why health metrics, the healthiest, the questions could range from that being about product as store to any store questions, just customer service questions like when you close the store, what is your return policy could be about? Recipes could be like, I'm looking to cook, you know, meal that costs under $20 and my kids hate fish. So something that we have found is that in the places that it has been launched right now is most loved by store associates themselves. They love it. And this is helping them to do the real job better, make the store run, better manage the inventory better. So, so bringing that gap of like knowledge and helpfulness all together, it just helps everyone. The hardest problem for A I is actually the easiest one for human being. So there's this thing called paradox that tells you that's language capabilities and doing basic reasoning that a three year old child can do is the easiest for humans, but the hardest for machines. So we including myself, I switch gears, working on language A I ever since. And so the rest of this kind of history, we like all, all of our time, like all the time that we had back in Iran, we were like kind of working extremely hard to make sure that we can like accomplish like the biggest thing that we can accomplish. We were always like looking for the what is the biggest opportunity and biggest opportunity for us was the hardest problem. And the hardest problem just, just going after the hardest problem every time that we could, we thought that we might be able to solve that problem that we came to us 10 years ago to do our phd and kind of go after our dreams. And right now we are sitting here say that having started a company, especially in the middle of the pandemic has been the hardest thing we've ever done. And the most rewarding one as well at the same time, it's just been incredibly satisfying to go through this roller coaster that it is to uh basically navigate your way to, to start something from scratch. And if you really don't love it, you will fail. The only reason we are doing what we are doing is that we obsessively love it. If you don't love it every day that you wake up, it's gonna be a tough journey.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691615339380,"updatedAt":1691660714207,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691660714207,"duration":{"value":229,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6","name":"Startup Ameelio believes helping inmates succeed after prison starts with a simple phone call","slug":"startup-ameelio-believes-helping-inmates-succeed-after-prison-starts-with-a-simple-phone-call","shortDescription":"Founder and CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism and ultimately reduce the prison population.","longDescription":"Founder and CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism and ultimately reduce the prison population.","seoTitle":"Ameelio believes helping inmates starts with a phone call","seoDescription":"CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism","socialTitle":"Startup Ameelio believes helping inmates succeed after prison starts with a simple phone call","socialDescription":"Founder and CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism and ultimately reduce the prison population.","tags":[{"name":"uzoma_orchingwa","type":"tag","label":"Uzoma Orchingwa"},{"name":"startup_ameelio","type":"tag","label":"Startup Ameelio"},{"name":"founder","type":"tag","label":"Founder"},{"name":"criminal_justice_foundation","type":"tag","label":"Criminal Justice Foundation"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I had no experience in startups. I was a philosophy undergrad. I didn't know anything about running a business. All ideas seem crazy before you succeed. Emilia is a non profit technology company that is working to fundamentally transform incarceration. So what we do is we build a free to use communication and education, software and hardware that we provide to incarcerated people, completely free of charge. A communication suite, a full communication suite and that includes video calls, voice calls, e messaging. But the unique thing about what we do because often get questions like, hey, can zoom do this. One of the biggest challenges in this space is that every security is of vital importance to the primary correction clients we work with. So we have to build in a ton of security features that allows them to, you know, safely manage their facilities, enabling access to the outside for the incarcerated has been proven to reduce recidivism. There's an abundance of studies that show that more contact with love. One can have an up to 56% reduction in incarceration. So imagine, you know, someone's incarcerated, they're away from their families. They're in an eight by 10 cell and they can't be able to communicate with their families. It causes an extreme amount of distress. But you also learn that it's one of the real major cause of in prison violence and future recidivism is idle time and lack of hope. My parents were both college educated, college and education was always something that I was expected to do and accomplish. But a lot of my friends were from single parent households, parents who had been incarcerated, brothers have been incarcerated, or the vast majority of them actually ended up being incarcerated. And that really kind of set me off on this path, this academic path to understand the system, understand what's going wrong. And to figure out solutions to solve it. As a nonprofit, we need to find of philanthropic capital, get off the ground. So in the early days, you know, especially with Criminal Justice Foundation, it was almost impossible to get funding because their assumption was that this, this industry is so predator or so monopolized that, you know, what is a small tech nonprofit going to be able to do? But the way we actually crystallized it was COVID hit prisons had to shut down on prison visitation. So remote communication, virtual communication became so vitally important and we were able to break in. And then we're because we had that, that use case a case study, we were then able to kind of expand into other departments and other counties across the country. One piece of knowledge that I wish I knew back when I was starting. Emilio is to not dwell in the uncertainties because you're going to learn it. You know, if you really want to be a fund, you really have a passion and vision to build something. Be relentless all the way through.

It has led to the clearing of an amount of land equivalent to the size of South America and Africa combined and it emits more greenhouse gasses than the entire transportation sector. So how do we make food as we continue to grow in our population in a way that doesn't break the planet air protein is focused on being a part of that solution. In 2005, I was one of the many people who went to New Orleans after hurricane Katrina hit and that experience impacted me in many different ways. One of the ways is that I knew that my work had to have an impact in this world and fast forward a few years, the fact that I'm trained as a scientist I began to think about and study what the climate, climate scientists have been saying about the fact that these types of weather events were going to be more intense and more frequent seeing when I was there in 2005. Just how that affected people's lives directly made me want to be a part of the solution. So ultimately, we built Air protein as a way to try to be a part of the solution. We were very creative with the science, but with the name, we're very straightforward, we make protein from air. And so how does one do that? You might ask? Well, it's based on work done by NASA during the space program where they were trying to figure out how to feed astronauts on long space journeys. This is back in the sixties and seventies during the Apollo Space Program. And as you can imagine, if you're on a long journey to Mars or a distant planet, you don't have acres and acres of farmland to deal with. So you have to figure out how to feed astronauts in a way that's super resource efficient use what you have available and it can grow quickly, very quickly, very fast. And so the process that we have, we are commercializing based on their pioneering work is a process that's very similar to fermentation. But the difference is there's no agricultural inputs whatsoever. We use elements of the air, air, water and energy and we make protein from that, we have raised 107 million to date in the beginning. People ask is this science fiction, you know, is this real? Can it be real? How can you make protein from air? So we had to prove it. So the challenges are always initially around demonstrating that this was actually possible. And once we demonstrated it, it was possible. That's when we were able to start building this ecosystem and that we're getting more and more companies and partners as is really around the table to help us create the future that we're working to create. And we've just opened our first air farm in San Leandro, California where we're excited to bring to the world a way of making nutritious proteins with no arable land, no farmland, no agricultural inputs required whatsoever. George Bernard Shaw has this quote that goes something like the reasonable person adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable person persists in trying to adapt the world to him or herself. And therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable person. As a founder, we're doing things that haven't been done before. And so as there are these highs and low lows along the way, it's important for founders to keep their eyes on the prize and inspire the people around them and tap into what inspire them and bring them along on the journey. The only way to predict the future is to create it. And so the future that I'm working to create is a future where more and more and eventually all of our protein is sustainably sourced. The first day when I was able to take a bite of air protein was a day that I realized that this can have the impact that we wanted to have","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691616364964,"updatedAt":1691660713956,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691660713956,"duration":{"value":222,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"connect":false,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044","name":"What to do when your dream career is not so dreamy","slug":"what-to-do-when-your-dream-career-is-not-so-dreamy","shortDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","longDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","seoTitle":"What to do when your dream career is not so dreamy","seoDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","socialTitle":"What to do when your dream career is not so dreamy","socialDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","tags":[{"name":"kathryn_minshew","type":"tag","label":"Kathryn Minshew"},{"name":"temp","type":"tag","label":"Temp"},{"name":"jennifer_garner","type":"tag","label":"Jennifer Garner"},{"name":"the_muse","type":"tag","label":"The Muse"},{"name":"cia","type":"tag","label":"CIA"},{"name":"nicosia_cyprus","type":"tag","label":"Nicosia Cyprus"},{"name":"the_regional_security_department","type":"tag","label":"the Regional Security Department"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":5,"key":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/HLS/video-ver5_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":5,"key":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/SRT/captions-ver5.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I could write a book on the mistakes that I made as an early stage founder.

And I realized very quickly this is not actually what I thought it was this this job while I have so much respect for, it probably isn't as great of a fit for my personality and my aspirations. And so I spent, you know, a few months feeling really lost and adrift, like a lot of people do early in their career and I was trying to figure out what is it that I want. And online job sites were so transactional. They were incredibly boring. They just, they just had lists of jobs and what I was interested in was like, what does a company really like to work for it? And so I started the muse to help give other people access to the resources and the information and the insight about companies that I didn't have. Myself. I started working on the business in the summer of 2011. And we launched that fall, we had a very, very simple site at the beginning because we had no money. You know, I was 25 with a big dream and very very few resources to pull it off. And so the very first version of the news that was called the Daily News, it actually just had career advice and then we added in the company profiles a few months later and job listings a few months after that today, the Muse has 5 to 7 million people every single month who come to the dot com to apply to jobs, research companies and get career advice. And we work with about 20% of the Fortune 500. I wish I could tell my younger self, you know, uh it, it's just really hard to build a business, it's really hard to raise capital. And so just because it's hard for you doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. I think I took on a lot of, you know, self blame because I felt like, oh, if I could just find the right thing to say, it would be, it would be easy. Also, you know, when I was raising for the first time in 2011, 2012, even for a few years around, then people weren't very open about the challenges. So a lot of the entrepreneurs on stage would say, you know, oh, I had this great idea and then I just raised a bunch of money and, you know, now look, we're successful and I've loved the trend towards entrepreneurs, being more honest about the challenges. I also think that I have a really high degree of comfort with being wrong. You know, I recognize that there's a lot that I don't know. And so I think that's both allowed me to pivot and adapt quickly. It's allowed me to learn from others and to create space for other people to come together and contribute their ideas. For me. I think being really, really open to what you're not good at or you're, you're not an expert in is a very powerful thing when you're trying to build something new.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691612513483,"updatedAt":1691660714502,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691660714502,"duration":{"value":210,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}}]}}],"section":"Regular","state":"Published","index":1},{"id":"1b00c075-a894-4c53-85b6-4582050c945f","displayPage":"/videos","name":"The Ground Up","viewportSize":{"web":2},"type":"PLAYLIST_TRAY","source":{"from":"PLAYLIST_SOURCE","playlistName":"The Ground Up"},"items":[{"type":"PLAYLIST_ITEM","playlist":{"name":"The Ground Up","type":"Series","state":"Published","premium":false,"description":"In The Ground Up we sit down with entrepreneurs to get the story on how they were able to build a successful business.","posterImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/Playlists%2FThe%2520Ground%2520Up%2FImages%2FposterImage-ver1.jpeg","videosOrderedByUser":[{"videoId":"ac1f281f-1c40-4969-99ca-1cac131f540b","name":"How I made over $220M in sales as the daddy of the Scrub Daddy","slug":"how-i-made-over-$220m-in-sales-as-the-daddy-of-the-scrub-daddy","shortDescription":"On store shelves, customers might only see a bright yellow smile waiting to add some shine to the kitchen.

Scrub Daddy is the only sponge that changes texture just based on the temperature of the water. That means it could be a soft sponge or a hard sponge in hot or cold water. Now when it's soft, it gets all the way into cups, bowls and mugs. And when it's hard, it can scrub through even the most burned on messes in seconds. And cut! But did you know the real story behind that smiley face? Well, you're about to find out in this next episode of The Ground Up. That man you just saw was Aaron Krause, founder and CEO of Scrub Daddy, the smiley face sponge company that started in Folcroft, Pennsylvania, and has filled cleaning shelves since the episode of Shark Tank aired in October 2012. And since then, they moved to an enormous facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey that features office spaces, a television studio, a warehouse, Koi pond, and a store for people to buy their products. Some kids that we encountered in the shop acted like it was Christmas Day. No, I just play one on TV. And ready guys? Cleaning is something that is mundane and is boring and people don't enjoy. And when you make it more fun and you make it really effective, you have something that really clicks with people's psyche. And Scrub Daddy is actually my hand. The original Scrub Daddy runs for $4 at stores and on their website, but select products can run as high as $38. And if you think you've met every product from the sponge dynasty, think again. We even put Aaron to the test. We make Daddy, Mommy, Sponge, Scour, Eraser, Dish Daddy, PowerPaste, Barbecue Daddy, Scour Daddy Steel, Straw Cleaner, Microfiber towels, Streakless Cloths, Scrub Daddy Cif, Scrub Daddy toilet scrubbing system, Tangerine Clean, PowErase Gel. Believe it or not, Aaron missed a few. There's also Big Daddy, Daddy Caddy, Sponge Caddy, Soap Daddy, Cart Daddy and Screen Daddy. That's a long way of saying that there's a ton of products in the Daddy family, over 80 as of today. And with all of these products online and on store shelves, the company has racked in over $220 million in sales for 2023 with no sign of slowing down. We have the best sponge in the world. It's worth every dime that we charge for it. And the profit that we make on it sustains this business and is what's led us to grow so rapidly, because we're able to reinvest over and over and come out with new products. But how did Aaron and Scrub Daddy get here? Well, let's rewind back to when he was just a little kid in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. Both of my parents are physicians. At 10 years old, my dad started teaching me to wash the dishes, which is actually how I end up being in a sponge company. I was about 10 years old and I was laying in bed and I was, like, staring at the light switch going, \"Oh my God, I need a way to turn that off.\" The next day I got a bunch of wheel casters and dental floss because that was the longest piece of rope I could find. And I hooked up this whole pulley system so I could turn the lights on and off from my bed. And that was, like, the first time I realized that I could come up with a crazy idea, build something and change my world. And from then, I literally started looking at the world completely different. Before the Daddy of the Scrub Daddy was making his fortune washing dishes and kitchenware, he was making money washing something much bigger. I've been washing cars since I was a kid. Became a professional car washer when my dad told me I could make $10 a car. Started washing cars in the neighborhood. I had been washing cars throughout all of high school to make money. And I just decided I was just going to start my own car washing business. Aaron went on to Syracuse University and graduated with a degree in psychology. In October 1992, he returned home to start his car washing business. While he was proud to be his own boss, some of his family didn't receive the news too well. My dad said \"You know, son. I just paid $100,000 for your education in psychology. What are you going to do with your life?\" I said, \"Well, I've been washing cars my whole life. I think I'll wash cars.\" My mom was crying. My grandmom said, \"Just disown him.\" And my dad said, \"Son, you have till the end of the summer to make it a real business and get it out of my garage.\" And that's exactly what Aaron did. But not only that, Aaron kept his innovative side going while working at the car wash. It was in 1994 when I invented my first big invention and got a patent on it. And that was for a buffing pad for polishing cars. It was all by hand. It was detailing. Four years into it, I basically damaged a car and I didn't think it was my fault. I thought it was the shape of the pad. And I just immediately, I had this idea of, like, why is the pad cylindrical? It should have edges. And why doesn't it have a recess in the back where the backing plate would be protected? And I literally went around and started asking the distributors. \"I'm looking for a pad that looks like this.\" And they were like, \"I never heard of that.\" After the second guy, I said, \"Forget I mentioned it.\" And I went and got a patent attorney and I filed for my first patent. That was how I learned about polyester urethane foams. Polyester urethane foam, which became a key part of Scrub Daddy, is a flexible, open-cell foam with a range of qualities. It's known for its ability to compress, resist mildew, and insulate. I got a crash course education in every company in the world that makes urethane foams because we started buying those foams and making them into buffing pads. It wasn't for years and years and years later that I found the Scrub Daddy material, which is a very, very unique, highly engineered polymer. And at that time, it was only made by one company in Germany. And this company in Germany sent me this rock hard material that was yellow. I started cleaning my hands with it and it was unbelievable how well it worked, how easily it rinsed clean. With the help of German foam manufacturer FoamPartner, Aaron could modify the pore size and density of his buffing pad. I realized instantly we had a home run. We put some ads in some trade magazines. In three months, we were selling buffing pads all over the United States. And within six months, we were selling it all over the world. Scrub Daddy now calls this material FlexTexture. In 1995, Aaron sold his car washing business and turned his focus to a new venture. Dedication To Detail, a buffing pad manufacturer. This is our first office. Actually, this is the second office. When they sent me the material, I basically cut a rectangular shape, like a traditional sponge, and I just started scrubbing my hands with it. What you find out is that this is an uncomfortable way to hold a sponge. Like, this is not the shape of your hand. Actually, that's the shape of your hand. And it turns out that a circle is the easiest thing to hold on to while you're scrubbing your hand. And then I was like, \"You know, I don't want to go around my fingers. I'll just cut a hole in it. And I'll just cleaning my fingers. It's so much easier.\" Then, I was like, \"You know what? I need to get underneath the nails.\" So I took a knife and I cut some ridges. I cut another hole so I could put two fingers in and grab it. So it had these two eyes, what looked like hair, and it started to look like a little face. Aaron says he stopped selling the foam after a year because of low sales in the auto market. And on September 3, 2008, Dedication To Detail was bought out by multi-national manufacturer 3M. Aaron's sponges ended up sitting at the back of the factory for five years until March 2011 when they found a new life. My wife started nagging me to clean the lawn furniture. And I just took the traditional sponge that I had, which is yellow on one side and green on the other. And I just started to scrub the mold. And it actually scratched the paint off. That's when I remembered this box of this hard plastic scrubbers that we had. And I brought them home and I made a bucket of warm, soapy water because I don't want to work in really cold environment. And when I dunked this rock hard circular sponge that looked like it had hair on it with two eye holes, it got totally soft. And we didn't know that. We hadn't designed that or built that in. That was when I had told this company in Germany to make the material stiffer and denser. That was a byproduct of it. But when it got into warm water, it's like a thermoplastic and it started to get soft. When I took it out and I started to scrub the furniture with it, because it was 50 degrees outside, I could feel it crystallizing in my hands. And the harder it got, the better it scrubbed. But then it was filthy dirty. When I put in the warm water and it got soft, it rinsed out totally clean. And I was like, \"Wow, what is this?\" And I thought I was gonna be throwing these things away. So I left it at my sink. And that night, I started doing the dishes. And I saw it and I picked it up. And I thought, \"Huh, I wonder how this will wash the dishes.\" And it wasn't scratching anything. I'm like, \"This is unbelievable. Where is the flaw? Where is this not going to work?\" And then I picked up a mug. And I realized where it's not going to work. And as I went to put it down, I saw the two eye holes. And I put my fingers into the eyes. And I went all the way into the bottom of the cup and it cleaned the sides at the same time it cleaned the bottom. And then I pulled it out. And I looked at it and I thought, \"Why would you ever hold onto a sponge if the sponge would hold on to you?\" Wait, hold on a second. If I cut a smile in this thing, I could clean the silverware on both sides. I took a knife, cut the smile, put the spoon in and squeezed and pulled it. And I could hear the angels start to sing. The next morning, as the angels ascended back to heaven, Aaron shared his rediscovery with coworkers at the factory. When we sold the company to 3M, they didn't even want it. They thought it was a worthless product and they carved it out of the deal and left it with me because it was so worthless. I said, \"I'll tell you what. Everybody take it home and we'll reconvene in two weeks. Go wash your dishes and come back and tell me. And when they came back, it was clear. Everybody was like, \"This is the greatest dishwashing tool in the world.\" And with the confirmation from his coworkers, Aaron knew he needed to act fast. Aaron personally invested $150,000 into the smiling sponge. He also secured a patent for the shape, design and features of the sponge. But Aaron strategically left out details of the scrubbers material composition, which was its main selling point. When you patent the material, I need to tell you what it's made of, how we make it, all the processes of doing it. And I just told everybody how to copy our exclusive material that only one company knows how to make at this point. If you want to go and try and do it like 100 companies have tried already to copy Scrub Daddy, and it failed miserably. I'm not going to make it easier for them. Let's put it that way. These are both knockoffs. And we'll test it against our regular products. And you can tell right away what's a piece of junk and what's Scrub Daddy. So it's easy to identify when there's a knock off in the market. By August 2011, Aaron knew it was time for Scrub Daddy to hit the shelves. Thanks to a friend who owned five local grocery stores, he pitched Scrub Daddy for about eight hours a day. Nearly every day of the week. He did all this while still serving as a developer and consultant at 3M. But he knew he could do more. He knew he had to leverage the local press. They put on the front page of the Sunday Inquirer in the business section. They said, \"He's the daddy of the Scrub Daddy.\" The website exploded. The phone's lit up. And we started selling a sponge almost two or three minute. The next thing I know, I get a call from a guy who says, \"Have you ever thought about selling this on QVC?\" I was like, \"The women's shopping network? Like, no one watches that.\" He's like, \"Oh, you'd be surprised.\" We went in and we did a little pitch. And they said, \"We love it. And we want you to be the on air person.\" I was like, \"Absolutely not. I'm not going on TV. I don't know how to do that. Next thing you know, I'm in front of the bright lights. And the cameras are coming on. And I am frozen and I'm scared and we don't sell well. It's pretty awful. I went home, I was despondent. I remember just feeling, like, I had one chance to be on TV and I blew it. The broker calls me up and says, \"You're not going to believe this. I just got a call from the buyer and the producer and they loved your energy and they wished that you had more time to talk. They're going to give you another shot.\" I went back on QVC and I told the next host, \"This is probably my last show. Anything that you can do to help me, I will be so appreciative.\" And she said, \"Aaron, I'm gonna go wow, wow, wow. And you just go and do your thing.\" Scrub Daddy became a hit on QVC. And so did Aaron. His confidence on camera convinced him to test out the waters on another big network. I went home and I was bragging to my wife that I was supposed to be on TV. And she was like, \"Oh, shut up. You're an idiot. And our favorite show is coming on called Shark Tank.\" And I watched these guys come in. They had beer flavored ice cream. And it was the worst pitch. They didn't know their numbers. Their product was horrible. I mean, they got eviscerated by Mr. Wonderful. And I said, \"What a bunch of idiots. How do you go on a national TV show and you don't know your numbers? You don't know your product. You misrepresent your company and yourself. I could go on that show and kill the sharks. Actually, how do you go on Shark Tank? Oh, look at that. There's a website. You just fill out this form. Hey. Dear sharks, I'm Aaron Krause from Philadelphia. I've been on QVC, and by the way, here's a link to my last QVC show. Three months later, Aaron received a call from a California number he didn't recognize. I'm an ice hockey coach. My phone was ringing. So I answer the call and it's Shark Tank. And then they assigned me two producers and said, \"We will have a call with you every week. We don't want you to get excited. There's 50,000 applicants and all we do now is have calls with people. But let's pretend that we're gonna let you on Shark Tank. Give me your pitch. I was like, \"Hi, sharks. I'm Aaron Krause from Philadelphia and I'm the daddy of the Scrub Daddy. Today, I'm looking for a $500,000 investment in exchange for 10% equity in the Scrub Daddy business. So they said, \"Okay. That's great. That was seven minutes. We're gonna call you next week. Take it down to six minutes.\" I remember the last time she said there was about 500 people left. And the next time they called, they said, \"Aaron, this will be our last call.\" And I was like, \"You're kidding me? That was literally, like, two months of, like, hiding in corners and doing... No one could know that I was talking to Shark Tank by the way. It was totally confidential. I said, \"Really? That was so much effort and work.\" They said, \"Oh no, because we're flying you out to Los Angeles. The next pitch you're going to do is going to be in front of 30 producers from ABC and Sony.\" Aaron didn't let his opportunity on Shark Tank go to waste. He knew he had one shot to make Scrub Daddy explode positively in the public consciousness. When you're going on Shark Tank, you're not just trying to give the sharks. You're literally demonstrating for seven to 10 million people. You wanted them to also support you. I memorized every one of our numbers, all of our cost of goods sold, all of our customer acquisition costs. I went and studied all the sharks. After getting through the initial pitch with show producers, they put Aaron's preparation to the test when they made an unexpected change. The day of the show, the producer comes in, like, \"Aaron, you ready to go? I'm like, \"I was born ready for this. Let's go.\" He goes, \"Oh no, no, no. We got about another hour. But listen, we subbed Barbara out for this new lady. They call her the queen of QVC and have you ever heard of her? Lori Greiner?\" I was like, \"No. Even though I've been on QVC, like, four times, I never heard of her.\" I walked into Shark Tank going, \"Don't talk about QVC. Don't talk about QVC.\" And I prepared for every thing that someone could say to me. And I prepared to never make a response that made me look arrogant. First one who went out was Herjavec. Herjavec said, \"I don't see the retail vision. I'm out.\" In my mind, I said, \"You're not the brightest, are you dude? Like, really? You don't see the retail vision? Like, look at this smiley face sponge.\" I was like, \"Alright, don't say that to him.\" I said, \"I understand.\" But I meant, \"I understand that you have no idea what you're talking about.\" Then Cuban was the next one out and Cuban said, \"But I'm not a scrub pimp. So I'm out.\" And I was like, \"That hurts, Mark. I wanted to work with you so bad.\" And then, of course, Mr. Wonderful came up. I watched every episode of Shark Tank four times. And then I made a flowchart. So the line goes: Mr. Wonderful asks about the valuation, and you answer it like this. And it goes either this way or this way, right. And that one goes this way, or this way. And I had flowcharts for all of the sharks and how it was going to go. And with Mr. Wonderful, they all ended with him telling me he was out. And so I was like, \"You know what? I'm never letting that happen.\" I'm waiting for him to say some nasty thing to me. And the first thing he does is make the worst offer ever for 50% of the company. And I knew exactly where this was going. So I'm like, laughing. I'm like, \"Yeah, just keep enjoying it. Look around. This is really gonna happen. Ready? Do it.\" Alright, you're out. But there was still one shark Aaron had to face. Lori's like, \"Where are you selling this now?\" I'm like, \"Oh, like some local supermarkets and like some television network?\" \"Oh, like a TV shopping network?\" \"Something like that.\" \"Which one?\" \"Like, I've been on QVC, like, four times, you know, over the last four months.\" And she's like, \"Really? And I'm like, \"I know she's going out. Should I just tell her she's out now?\" And instead she goes, \"You know what? Your pitch was flawless. It was like a QVC pitch. And I know all the little tricks that people do to make things look better on TV. And I watched you really closely. No one else watched it like I did. You didn't use one sponge and one weight and change the texture. You used two different sponges and two different weights. So either one of their sponges is hard, and the other one is soft, or one of the weights is heavy, and the other one's light. I think your whole thing is a scam.\" And I'm like, \"No, no, it's 100% real.\" She goes, \"Okay, if it's real, the sponge that you just gave me, I want to come down and I want to change the texture.\" And I'm like, \"Come on down.\" And she dips it in the hot water. She dips it in the cold water. And the sharks are all screaming, \"Lori! Lori, does it work? Does it work?\" And we're standing this close and she looks at me. She goes, \"Oh my god, it's magic.\" And I'm looking at her going, \"Oh my God, you might be my shark. I can't wait for that to air on national TV because it vindicated everything that I was saying.\" And the night that I air on Shark Tank. I'm waiting for this moment, which never happens. They cut it out of the show. I called the producer and said, \"How could you do that?\" He said, \"Aaron, the show was over in the first two minutes. When you and Lori looked at each other, everyone would have known that you guys were going to be together. I'll go to 20. You got a deal. Got a deal. Alright. Good. Aaron left Shark Tank with $200,000, double what he asked for. That is awesome. And a 20% equity stake deal with Lori Greiner. After the episode aired, the sales just started going through the roof. QVC sales started going through the roof. Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond, Walmart called us. We didn't even have to call them and the product just started flying off the shelves. Aaron's life changed forever. In just 24 hours, Scrub Daddy hit a million dollars in sales. And to keep up with the success, in 2014. Aaron left his position at 3M to focus on Scrub Daddy full time. His new partnership with Lori Greiner would propel Scrub Daddy to new heights, but only with the right vision. Alright, ready? So this is my favorite background. And that's me on Shark Tank as one of the sharks. It started out a little bit, I don't wanna say rocky. But the truth is, like, she had a vision and she said it on the show, she wanted to do an infomercial. It wasn't the direction that I wanted to go because I felt an infomercial is, like, a flash in the pan. Like, you do the Snuggie. And it sells for, like, eight months. And then it's over. And then I explained to her my vision that I wanted to be on the shelves competing with all the other sponge companies. And she said, \"Listen, that is a long road. And it's hard. And if you want to do it, I'm with you. But if you want to sit back and just collect a check, that's the fastest way to get this thing to market.\" And I said, \"I want to do the long way. And I've done it before and I think I can do it again.\" And she said, \"Alright, I guess that's it. We're gonna do it.\" That was the one disagreement that we had. And after that, she was great to work with. She has been an absolute PR train. She goes on to all these shows and talks about how much she loves Scrub Daddy. The thing about Lori and that I really love and respect about her the most, she just knows that I know how to run this thing. And that she's like, \"Aaron, you are a rock star. And if you need my help at all, I'm here for you. And so most of our conversations are mostly friendship stuff. As Scrub Daddy's sales climbed over the years, in March 2021, Aaron decided to expand the brand and open a new facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey, which is about six miles away from Philadelphia. He knew that his vision included more than just the original Scrub Daddy. The new campus allows Aaron and his team to continue working on product innovation. The vision was never one product. If you sit still in business, someone's coming to eat your lunch. We're starting with one product. That launches the company. Once Mommy rolled in, we literally started just inventing new products every year. We do it all in house. I have an engineering department. We have what's called an ideation meeting, where we sit around and talk about what are the needs that we see in the market. And then we look for new channels. We can do everything from laminating to vacuum forming to taking slices of the material to test. Crushing tests. And then we have all these 3D printers. Right now, we're in the middle of printing something. I think it's going to be for the toilet wand. And this is our barbecue grill brush. And everything had to be invented. Everything from the handle to this material to how are they actually going to put this material together. Part of Scrub Daddy's innovative edge is keeping sustainability at their forefront. This is our solar wall. This is actually living, growing plants. And this shows you the amount of energy that we've created lifetime. 124,000 gallons of gas has been saved. Our sponge is literally the longest lasting most durable sponge on the market. And that in itself is sustainable. Like, the regular sponge you're using for a couple of days, and it smells horrible. And they're literally just going into the landfill every couple of days. Ours are lasting for many months. Second thing is we started a recycling program at Scrub Daddy. So you can send your sponge back to us and we give you a $2 credit which pays for all your shipping costs to buy another sponge on our store. And we send them to an industrial recycling facility. They burn hotter than coal. This is a very specific recycling facility where they capture all the emissions. We also make an Eco Daddy. It's made out of recycled water bottles and coconut fibers. And we're sustainable because we're powered off of all solar. We make so much energy that we actually power homes in the neighborhood because we don't use it all. And eight of us now drive electric cars, including me, and we drive our cars off of the sun. If there's one thing Aaron would do differently, it would be to bite the bullet on pricing he felt he deserved. I made all my mistakes in my previous businesses. Luckily, none of them put me out of business. But in my last company, I made one of the most critical mistakes that any entrepreneur can make. I went after volume and played price war when I had the best-in-class product. I had all these patents on buffing pads. And I would compete with everybody out there for the lowest price just so I could keep my volumes up. As for Aaron, he has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. We're actually in the process right now of expanding all over Europe and actually acquiring our European distributor. We have much bigger global presence in five years. There's a lifecycle for businesses. I don't think I want to do this until I'm 90. But at some point, I think we will become an acquisition target for a much larger company. As long as it's the right partner, and they leave us alone, and they let us continue to run the brand, then it's something that I may entertain down the road. And if there's anyone that will let Aaron know about his past mistakes, his family is there to tell him about it. He grew up in a family of five and everyone but him earned a PhD. He says they would often shun him for his career path as he was growing up. For the longest time, I was ridiculed as the black sheep of the family that, you know, I didn't go on to a profession, like, Doctor, lawyer, accountant. Unfortunately, my mom has advanced Alzheimer's, so she doesn't know anything about the business at all. Which is... And that is kind of sad because she also was a huge influence on me growing up and she was constantly the one pushing me in education. And she had a funny way of always motivating me to do stuff. And I wish that she could see the business at this level. My dad's still alive and he's doing great. He's very healthy in his 80s. And I talked to him all the time about the company. And now, I'm the only one in our family that has patents. And I can tell you my dad is awful proud. And today, Aaron says he doesn't feel like the black sheep of the family. Instead, he feels like the golden goose. The reason I'm sitting exactly where I am right now is because of everything that's happened to us. They are all learning experiences. They're things that make us stronger and make us work harder. We know better the next time it comes around. Come on. It's a smiley face sponge company. Look around, like. Hey, are you happy? Did you hear that? We're going with the OG yellow. Who's the king now? I won myself my own product.","srtFormat":{"videoId":"ac1f281f-1c40-4969-99ca-1cac131f540b","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"ac1f281f-1c40-4969-99ca-1cac131f540b/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"The following is not a paid advertisement. Scrub Daddy is the only sponge that changes texture just based on the temperature of the water. That means it could be a soft sponge or a hard sponge in hot or cold water. Now, when it's soft, it gets all the way into cups, bowls and mugs and when it's hard, it can scrub through even the most burned on messes in seconds. But did you know the real story behind that smiley face or you're about to find out in this next episode of the Ground Up? That man you just saw was Aaron Kraus founder and CEO of Scrub Daddy. The Smiley Face sponge company that started in full crop Pennsylvania and has filled cleaning shelves since the episode of Shark Tank aired in October 2012. And since then, they moved to an enormous facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey that features office spaces, a television studio, a warehouse Koi pond and a store for people to buy their products. Some kids that we encountered in the shop acted like it was Christmas Day. No, I just play one on TV. And ready guys. Cleaning is something that is mundane and is boring and people don't enjoy. And when you make it more fun and you make it really effective, you have something that really clicks with people's psyche and scrub. Daddy is actually my hand. The original Scrub Daddy runs for $4 at stores and on the website. But select products can run as high as $38. And if you think you've met every product from the Sponge dynasty, think again, we even put to the test we make. Daddy mommy sponge scour eraser dish daddy power paste, barbecue daddy, scour daddy steel straw cleaner, microfiber towels, streak less cloth scrub daddy sy scrub daddy, toilet scrubbing system, dandelion clean power era gel. Believe it or not, Aaron missed a few. There's also big daddy daddy caddy sponge caddy. Sub daddy, car daddy and daddy. That's a long way of saying that there's a ton of products in the Daddy family over 80 as of today. And with all these products online and on store shelves, the company has racked in over $220 million in sales for 2023 with no sign of slowing down. We have the best sponge in the world. It's worth every dime that we charge for it and the profit that we make on it sustains this business and is what's led us to grow so rapidly because we're able to reinvest over and over and come up with new products. But did Aaron and Scrub daddy get here. Well, let's rewind back to when he was just a little kid in Wynwood, Pennsylvania. Both of my parents are physicians. At 10 years old, my dad started teaching me to wash the dishes, which is actually how I ended up being in a sponge company. I was about 10 years old and I was laying in bed and I was like staring at the light switch going. Oh my God. I need a way to turn that off. The next day I got a bunch of wheel casters and dental floss because that was the longest piece of rope I could find. And I hooked up this whole pulley system so I could turn the lights on and off from my bed. And that was like the first time I realized that I could come up with a crazy idea, build something and change my world. And from then I literally started looking at the world completely different before the daddy of the scrub, daddy was making his fortune washing dishes and kitchenware. He was making money washing something much bigger. I've been washing cars since I was a kid, became a professional car washer. When my dad told me I could make $10 a car started washing cars in the neighborhood. I'd been washing cars throughout all of high school to make. I and I just decided I was just going to start my own car washing business. Aaron went on to Syracuse University. And graduated with a degree in psychology in October 1992. He returned home to start his car washing business while he was proud to be his own boss. Some of his family didn't receive the news too well. My dad said, you know, son, I just paid $100,000 for your education in psychology. What are you going to do with your life? I said, well, I've been washing cars my whole life. I think I'll wash cars. My mom was crying, my grandma said, just disown him and my dad said, so, you know, until the end of the summer to make it a real business and get it out of my garage. And that's exactly what Aaron did, but not only that, Aaron kept his innovative side going while working at the car wash. That was in 1994 when I invented my first big invention, I got a patent on it and that was for a buffing pad for polishing cars. It was all by hand. It was detailing four years into it. I basically damaged a car and I didn't think it was my fault. I thought it was the shape of the pad. And I just immediately, I had this idea of like, why is the pad cylindrical? It should have edges and why doesn't it have a recess in the back where the backing plate would be protected? And I literally went around and started asking the distributors. I'm looking for a pad that looks like this. And they were like, I never heard of that. After the second guy I said, forget I mentioned. And I went and got a patent attorney and I filed for my first patent. That was how I learned about polyester, urethane foam, polyester, urethane foam, which became a key part of scrub daddy is a flexible open cell foam with a range of qualities. It's known for its ability to compress, resist mildew and insulate. I got a course education in every company in the world that makes urethane foams because we started buying those foams and making them into buffing pads. It wasn't for years and years and years later that I found the Scrub Daddy material, which is a very, very unique, highly engineered polymer. And at that time, it was only made by one company in Germany and this company in Germany sent me this rock hard material that was yellow. I started cleaning my hand and it was unbelievable how well it worked, how easily it rinsed clean with the help of German phone manufacturer. Phone partner, Aaron could modify the pore size and density of his buffing pad. I realized instantly we had a home run. We put some ads in some trade magazines. In three months, we were selling buffing pads all over the United States and within six months we were selling it all over the world Scrub Daddy. Now calls this material flex texture in 1995 Aaron sold his car washing business and turned his focus to a new venture, dedication to detail a buffing pad manufacturer. This is our first office. This is the second when they send me the materials. I basically cut a rectangular shape like a traditional sponge and I just started scrubbing my hands with it. What you find out is that this is an uncomfortable way to hold a sponge like this is not the shape of your hand. Actually, that's the shape of your hand. And it turns out that a circle is the easiest thing to hold on to while you're scrubbing your hands. And then I was like, you know, I don't want to go around my fingers. I'll just cut a hole in it and I'll just clean my fingers. It's so much easier. Then I was like, you know what I need to get underneath the nail. So I took a knife and I cut some ridges. So I cut another hole so I could put two fingers in and grab it. So it had these two eyes, what looked like a hair and it started to look like a little face. Aaron says he stopped selling the after a year because of low sales in the auto market. And on September 3rd, 2008 dedication of detail was bought out by multinational manufacturer three M. Aaron Sponges ended up sitting at the back of the factory for five years until March 2011 when they found a new life, my wife started nagging me to clean the lawn furniture and I just took the traditional sponge that I had, which is yellow on one side and green on the other. And I just started to scrub the mold and it actually scratched the paint off. That's when I remember this box of this hard plastic scrubbers that we had and I brought them home and I made a bucket of warm soapy water because I didn't want to work in a really cold environment. And when I dumped this rock hard circular sponge that looked like it had hair on it, two eye holes, it got totally soft and we didn't know that we hadn't designed that or built that in. That was when I had told this company in Germany to make the material stiffer and denser that was a by product of it. But when it got into warm water, it's like a thermoplastic and it started to get soft. But when I took it out and I started to scrub the furniture with it because it was 50 degrees outside. I could feel it crystallizing in my hands and the harder it got, the better it scrubbed. But then it was filthy, dirty. When I put it in the warm water and it got soft, it rinsed out totally clean. And I was like, wow, what is this? And I thought I was going to be throwing these things away. So I left it at my sink and that night I started doing the dishes and I saw it and I picked it up and I thought, huh, I wonder how this will wash the dishes and it wasn't scratching anything. I'm like, this is unbelievable. Where is the flaw, where is this not going to work? And then I picked up a mug and I realized where it's not gonna work. And as I went to put it down, I saw the two eye holes and I put my fingers into the eyes and I went all the way into the bottom of the cup and it cleaned the sides. At the same time, it cleaned the bottom and then I pulled it out and I looked at it and I thought, why would you ever hold on to a sponge if the sponge would hold on to you? Wait, hold on a second. If I cut a smile in this thing, I could clean the silverware on both sides. I took a knife, cut the smile, put the spoon in, squeeze and pulled it. And I could hear the angels start to sing the next morning as the angels ascend it back to heaven. Aaron shared his rediscovery with co workers at the factory. When we sold the company at three, they didn't even want it. They thought it was a worthless product and they carved it out of the deal and left it with me because it was so worthless. I said, I'll tell you what, everybody take it home and we'll reconvene in two weeks. Go wash your dishes and come back and tell me. And when they came back, it was clear everybody was like, this is the greatest dishwashing tool in the world. And with the confirmation from his co workers, Aaron knew he needed to act fast. Aaron personally invested $150,000 into the smiling sponge. He also secured a patent for the shape design and features of the sponge. But Aaron strategically left out details of the scrubber's material composition, which was his main selling point. When you patent the material, I need to tell you what it's made of how we make it all the processes of doing it. And I just told everybody how to copy our exclusive material that only one company knows how to make at this point. If you want to go and try and do it like 100 companies have tried already to copy Scrub Daddy and have failed miserably. I'm not going to make it easier for them. Let's put it that way. These are both knockoffs and we'll test it against our regular products. And you can tell right away what's a piece of junk and what's scrub daddy. So it's easy to identify when there's a knock off in the market by August 2011. Aaron knew it was time for scrub daddy. To hit the shelves. Thanks to a friend who owned five local grocery stores. He pitched Scrub daddy for about eight hours a day, nearly every day of the week. He did all this while still serving as a developer and consultant at three M. But he knew he could do more. He knew he had to leverage the local press. They put on the front page of the Sunday. Inquire in the business section who said he's the daddy of the scrub daddy. The website exploded, the phones lit up and we started selling a sponge almost two or three a minute. The next thing I know, I get a call from a guy who says, have you ever thought about selling this on QVC? And I was like the women's shopping network? Like no one watches that he's like, oh, you'd be surprised. We went in and we did a little pitch and they said we love it and we want you to be the on air person. I was like, absolutely not. I, I'm not going on TV. I don't know how to do that. Next thing, you know, I'm in front of the bright lights and the cameras are coming on and I am frozen and I'm scared and we don't sell well. It's pretty awful. I went home. I was despondent. I remember just feeling like I had one chance to be on TV. And I blew it. The broker calls me up and says, you're not gonna believe this. I just got a call from the buyer and the producer and they loved your energy and they wish that you had more time to talk. They're going to give you another shot. I went back on QVC and I told the next host, this is probably my last show. Anything that you can do to help me, I will be so appreciative. And she said, Aaron, I'm going to go, wow. Wow. Wow. And you just go and do your thing. Scrub Daddy became a hit on QVC. And so did in his confidence on camera, convinced him to test out the waters on another big network. I went home and I was bragging to my wife that I was supposed to be on TV. And she was like, oh, shut up, you're an idiot. And our favorite show was coming on called Shark Tank. And I watched these guys come in, they had beer flavored ice cream and it was the worst pitch. They didn't know their numbers. Their product was horrible. I mean, they got a eviscerated by Mr Wonderful. And I said, what a bunch of idiots. How you go on a national TV show and you don't know your numbers. You don't know your product. You misrepresent your company and yourself. I could go on that show and Kill The Sharks actually. How do you go on Shark Tank? Oh, look at that. There's a website you just fill out this form. Hey dear Sharks. I'm Aaron Krause from Philadelphia. I've been on QVC. And by the way, here's a link to my last Q BC show. Three months later, Aaron received a call from a California number. He didn't recognize. I'm an ice hockey coach. My phone was ringing, so I answered the call and it's Shark Tank and then they assigned me to producers and said we will have a call with you every week. We don't want you to get excited. There's 50,000 applicants and all we do now is have calls with people. But let's pretend that we're going to let you on Shark Tank. Give me your pitch. And I was like, hi Sharks. I'm Aaron Kraus of Philadelphia and I'm the daddy of a scrub daddy today. I'm looking for a $500,000 investment in exchange for 10% equity in the scrub daddy business. So they said, ok, that's great. That was seven minutes and we're gonna call you next week. Take it down to six minutes. I remember the last time she said there was about 500 people left and the next time they called, they said, Aaron, this will be our last call. And I was like, you're kidding me. That was literally like two months of like hiding in corners and doing no one could know that I was talking to Shark Tank. By the way, it was totally confidential. I said, really? There was so much effort in work. They said, oh no, because we're flying you out to Los Angeles. The next pitch you're going to do is going to be in front of 30 producers from ABC and Sony Aaron didn't let his opportunity on shark tank go to waste. He knew he had one shot to make scrub daddy explode. Positive. I in the public consciousness when you're going on a shark tank, you're not just trying to get the sharks. You're literally demonstrating for 7 to 10 million people. You wanted them to also support you. I memorized every one of our numbers. All of our cost of goods sold all of our customer acquisition costs. I went and studied all the sharks. After getting through the initial pitch with show producers, they put Aaron's preparation to the test when they made an unexpected change. The day of the show, the producer comes in like Aaron, you ready to go? I'm like I was born ready for this. Let's go. He got about about another hour. But um listen, we subbed Barbara out for this new lady. They call her the queen of QVC. And have you ever heard of her, Laurie Greer? I was like, no, even though I've been on QVC like four times, I never heard of her. I walked into a shark tank going, don't talk about QVC, don't talk about QVC and I prepared for everything that someone could say to me and I prepared to never make a response that made me look arrogant. The first one that went out was Hershey. Hershey said, I don't see the retail, I, in my mind, I said, you're right. Brightest. Are you dude? Like really? You don't see the retail vision, like look at the smiley face. But I was like, all right, don't say that to him. I said, I understand but I meant, I understand that you have no idea what you're talking about. Then Cuban was the next one out. And Cuban said, but I'm not a scrub pimp. So I'm out and I was like, that hurts Mark. I wanted to work with you so bad. And then of course, Mr Wonderful came up, I watched every episode of Shark Tank four times and then I made a flow chart. So the line goes, Mr Wonderful, asked about the valuation and you answer it like this and it goes either this way or this way, right? And that one goes this way or this way. And I had flow charts for all the sharks and how it was going to go. And with Mr Wonderful, they all ended with him telling me he was out. And so I was like, you know what, I'm never letting that happen. I'm waiting for him to say some nasty thing to me. And the first thing he does is make the worst offer ever for 50% of the company. And I knew exactly where this was going. So I'm like laughing. I'm like, yeah, just keep it joy. Look around. This is really gonna happen. Ready? Do it. All right, you're out. But there was still one shark, Aaron had a face. Laurie is like, where are you selling this? Now? I'm like, oh, like some local supermarkets and, uh, like some television network, you know? Oh, like a TV, shopping network, something like that. Which one I've been on Q BC, like four times, you know, over the last four months. And she's like, really? And I'm like, I know she's going out, she said, I just tell her she's out now and instead she goes, you know what your pitch was flawless. It was like a QVC pitch. And I know all the little tricks that people do to make things look better on TV. And I watched you really closely. No one else watched it like I did. You didn't use one sponge and one weight and change the texture. You use two different sponges and two different weights. So either one of the sponges is hard and the other one's soft or one of the weights is heavy and the other one's light. I think your whole thing is a scam. And I'm like, no, no, it's 100% real. She goes ok. If it's real, the sponge that you just gave me, I want to come down and I want to change the texture and I'm like, come on down and she dips it in the hot water. She dips in the cold water and the sharks are all screaming. Laurie. Laurie. Does it work? Does it work? And we're standing this close and she looks at me and she goes, oh my God, it's magic. And I'm looking at her going, oh my God. You might be my shark. I can't wait for that to air on National TV, because it vindicated everything that I was saying. And the night that I air on shark tank, I'm waiting for this moment which never happens. They cut it out of the show. I called the producer and said, how could you do that? He said, Aaron, the show is over in the first two minutes when you and Laurie looked at hr everyone would have known that you guys were going to be together. I'll go to 20 we got a deal. We got a deal. Aaron left shark tank with $200,000 double what he asked for that is awesome. And a 20% equity stake deal with Laurie Grenier. After the episode aired, the sales just started going through the roof QVC sales started going through the roof bed bath and beyond Wal Mart called us. We didn't even have to call them and you know, probably to start, you know, fly off the shelves. Aaron's life changed forever in just 24 hours. Scrub daddy hit a million dollars in sales and to keep up with the success in 2014, Aaron left his position at three M to focus on Scrub Daddy full time. His new partnership with Laurie Grenier would propel Scrub Daddy to new heights, but only with the right vision. All right, ready. So this is my favorite background. And that's me on Shark Tank as one of the sharks. It started out a little bit. I don't want to say Rocky, but the truth is like she had a vision and she said it on the show, she wanted to do an infomercial. It wasn't the direction that I wanted to go because I thought an infomercial is like a flash in the pan. Like you do the snuggie and it sells for like eight months and then it's over and then I explained to her, my vision that I wanted to be on the shelves competing with all the sponge companies. And she said, listen, that is a long road and it's hard. And if you want to do it, I'm with you. But if you want to sit back and just collect a check, that's the fastest way to get the sign to market. And I said, I want to do the long way. I've done it before and I think I can do it again. And she said, all right, I guess that's it. We're going to do it. That was the one disagreement that we had. And after that, she was great to work with. She's been an absolute pr trained. She goes on to all these shows and talks about how much she loves scrub daddy. The thing about Laurie and that I really love and respect about her the most. She just knows that I know how to run this thing and that she's like Aaron, you are a rock star and if you need my help at all, I'm here for you. And so most of our conversations are mostly friendship stuff as Scrub Daddy sales climbed over the years in March 2021 Aaron decided to expand the brand and open a new facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey, which is about six miles away from Philadelphia. He knew that his vision included more than just the original Scrub Daddy. The new campus allows Aaron and his team to continue working on product innovation. The vision was never one product. If you sit still in business, someone's coming to your life. We're starting with one product that launches the company. Once mommy rolled in, we literally started just inventing new products every year. We do it all in house. I have an engineering department. We have what's called an ideation meeting where we sit around and talk about what are the needs that we see in the market. And then we look for new channels, we can do everything from laminating to vacuum forming, to taking slices of the material, to test crushing tests. And then we have all these 3d printers right now, we're in the middle of printing something. I think it's gonna be for the toilet wand. And this is our barbecue grill brush and everything had to be invented. Everything from the handle to this material to how are they actually going to put this material together? Part of scrub. Daddy's innovative edge is keeping sustainability at their forefront. This is our solar wall. This is actually living growing plants and this shows you the amount of energy that we've created lifetime 124,000 gallons of gas has been saved. Our sponge is literally the longest lasting most dal sponge on the market and that in itself is sustainable like the regular sponge you're using for a couple of days and it smells horrible and they're literally just going on the landfill every couple of days. Ours are lasting for many months. Second thing is we started a recycling program at scrub Day so you can send your sponge back to us and we give you a $2 credit which pays for all your shipping costs to buy another sponge on our store and we send them to an industrial recycling facility. They burn hotter than coal. This is a very specific recycling facility where they capture all the emissions. We also make an Eco Daddy, it's made out of recycled water bottles and coconut fibers and we're sustainable because we're powered off of all solar. We make so much energy that we actually power homes in the neighborhood because we don't use it all. And eight of us now drive electric cars, including me and we drive our cars off of the sun. If there's one thing Aaron would do differently, it would be to bite the bullet on pricing. He felt he deserved. I made all my mistakes in my previous businesses. Luckily none of them put me out of business. But in my last company, I made one of the most critical mistakes that any entrepreneur can make. I went after volume and played price war. When I had the best in class product, I had all these patents on buffing pads and I would compete with everybody out there for the lowest price just so I could keep my volumes up. As for Aaron, he has no intention of slowing down any time soon. We're actually in the process right now of expanding all over Europe and actually acquiring our European distributor. We have much bigger global presence in five years. There's a life cycle for businesses. I don't think to do this until I'm 90. But at some point, I think we will become an acquisition target for, you know, a much larger company as long as it's the right partner and they leave us alone and they let us continue to run the brand, then it's something that I may entertain down the road. And if there's anyone that will let Aaron know about his past mistakes. His family is there to tell him about it. He grew up in a family of five and everyone but him earned a phd. He says they would often shun him for his career path as he was growing up for the longest time, I was ridiculed as the black sheep of the family that, you know, I didn't go on to a profession like doctor, lawyer accountant. Unfortunately, my mom has advanced Alzheimer's so she doesn't know anything about the business at all, which is that. And that is kind of sad because she also was a huge influence on me growing up. And she was constantly the one pushing me in education. And she had a funny way of always motivating me to do stuff. And I wish that she uh she could see the business at this level. My dad's still alive and he's doing great. He's very healthy in his eighties and I talk to him all the time about the company and now I'm the only one in our family that has patents. And I can tell you my dad is awful proud. And today Aaron says he doesn't feel like the black sheep of the family. Instead, he feels like the golden goose. The reason I'm sitting exactly where I am right now is because of everything that's happened to us. They are all learning experiences, they are things that make us stronger, make us work harder. Uh We know better, the next time it comes around. Come on, it's a smiley face sponge company. Look around like, hey, are you happy? I couldn't be happier. Did you hear that? We're going to OG Yellow. Who's the king? Then? I want myself my own product.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1705081210413,"updatedAt":1706888836202,"irisTag":"features","videoPublishDate":1706888836202,"duration":{"value":1491,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"18a736a9-835b-4d14-a4b9-47b5bb99a83b","name":"How I raised $50K in 9 days to open a bar showing only women’s sports","slug":"how-i-raised-$50k-in-9-days-to-open-a-bar-showing-only-women’s-sports","shortDescription":"Jenny Nguyen was sick of watching women’s games on mute at sports bars, so she opened her own.

I'm the founder and owner of the sports bra here in Portland Oregon. It's a women's sports bar. When you walk into a sports bar, traditional sports bar, you expect 24 7 coverage because there is 24 7 coverage of men's sports. Statistically 95% of all sports that are on tv or men's sports. And so our goal here is to take the 5% that is on tv and just put it on blast. I just knew I wanted to feel familiar. I wanted people to walk in and just feel like it was a regular sports bar. It's just a lot of decor stuff, memorabilia and that kind of that warmth of being in a familiar sports bar kind of dark, a little bit cozy. But then you change what's represented, you change what's on the tv. These are women's team flags. All the athletes are female athletes. That kind of stuff. When people say women's sports aren't popular. It's because people aren't seeing it. It's a bit of a catch 22. It's like, well nobody's watching women's sports. Well, no women's sports remain shown. It's really difficult. It's really difficult. It's like you have to be in an Internet detectives in order to find where to watch women. I was trying to stream the national team game the other day at work with some friends and we couldn't find it. I love the idea that if this place was packed, people driving by walking by talking about it would see that there are women's sports fans and they would see it. They'd hear about it and they'd be like, oh, people are into it. It shouldn't be a novelty, but it is a novelty. There's been women's athletics that have been agreeable on media for years. You know, women's tennis has always been an agreeable sport, you know, that people watched. And I think what, what I saw happen is that I saw women's basketball. Uh and ESPN really developed a strong relationship and we began to see more and more women's basketball. Um you also have that sec, you have the PAC 12, you have so many of those networks now that need more content. And so there's much more women's content available for about 14.5 years. I played pickup basketball with this hodgepodge group of women, we shared a love of sports and so we would go out before or after, um pick up and try to watch games and it was always a chore, you know, always trying to find Bar that was big enough to take a group of 12 and then also who would change the channel for us. And then not only that, but some of the people in our group are vegan, those dietary restrictions are really hard to find at sports bars. And then a large portion of our basketball group are queer folks or non binary folks. And so looking the way we do kind of feels unsafe in a lot of the traditional sports bars, There was one particular moment that stands out in my mind when it kind of clicked and it was in 2018 when our basketball group went to go watch the N. C. Double A women's championship. And I think there was like three seconds left, the game was tied and eric takes one dribble and launches a three pointer right at the buzzer and it goes in. So here we were like a dozen of us just going crazy on our own. I threw my hat across the bar and while I was standing, I realized that no one else in the entire bar was watching our game. So everybody's staring at us like we're absolutely bonkers. Anyway, we're leaving the bar and we're kind of like milling around the parking lot still kind of just high off of the game. And I was just like, oh my God, that was the best game I've ever seen. And one of my friends was just like, yeah, it would have been so awesome if the sound had been on, I hadn't realized that we'd watched the whole game with no sound. Right. Then I said, the only way we're ever going to watch a women's game in its full glory is if we had our own place. And I remember driving home and I was like, oh, we had our own place, what we call it, you know? And the very first name that popped into my head was the sports bras. It just made so much sense. All you're doing is you're taking a sports bar and you're changing the channel on the tv. So it's like a tiny switch and then it just became an inside joke. Whenever we went out to sports bars and we were frustrated with something, we'd be like, oh at the sports bra, this game would be on, oh, it's a sports bra. You know, they have gluten free buns for my burger with the sports bra. We'd never run out of toilet paper in the women's restroom or like all the things that, you know, sports bars kind of fall short on all the time. We got to talking about how when we were kids, if our parents had taken us to a place like a sports bra, how much of a difference that would have made in our lives to have a place that we walked into and felt represented or felt seen once I launched the Kickstarter, it was the first time that I put it out into the world. And by day three I was getting emails from all across the country right away. I had people coming up and being like, thank you for doing this, thank you for being an asian woman who opened a business and then people coming up and being like, oh a lesbian owned bar. I didn't think about it. I was just so focused on the sports bra and getting this off the ground. I created a space that I want to be in. So it is me in the end, but when I was conceptualizing it, I didn't think about it like that. I just wanted it to be a place that I felt good. I thought being a chef would help and I think it has, I mean, I think it's helped me like 0.5% 99 point whatever, 95% I don't know anything about. That was hard reaching out to people asking for help learning as much as possible. I mean, the learning curve for me was like a straight up and down wall for like the last year, I would say doing things with intentionality was really huge for me. And so I thought about how women's sports is underrepresented. And then I thought about what else is underrepresented. And if you want to create a space that's for everybody, you gotta try to represent everybody if we can do that through our menu. If we can do that through our physical space, let's do it. At the very beginning, I reached out to like network streaming services, All these things to get permission to play a bunch of different things that on top of trying to open a business was a lot of work. I felt like it was somebody else's full time job to try to find content. So just women's sports is a national sports media company and they have like hundreds and hundreds of hours of digital media on Youtube. So I reached out to them and I just told them about the sports bra, this concept and they're like, we love what you're doing, what do you need from us. And I was like, I'd love to have your digital content and they were like, okay, what else? Like literally that's how it went and like my heart like burst out of my chest. And then I reached out to ESPN and the same thing happened. I was on a call with seven like female executives from ESPN W and they were just over the moon with the concept. But once the word got out, the roles got reversed, then it was networks streaming services, all of these other things reaching out to us asking us to play their stuff at the very beginning, we definitely had some issues with haters. There was some like right wing blog that came out and I probably got like 45 1 star reviews saying things like oh they wouldn't let me in because I had a beard or oh they spent my burger when they found out I was a man or you know, like just all kinds of ridiculous stuff. One of them said that I held them down and made them watch the W. N. B. A. Playoffs. I would read the comment, I'd be like, oh what do I say back to this guy. And as I was thinking it like 16 other people responded with like way better things than I could have said. And I was just like, Oh the community has got this and that's how it's always been. We were able to be there on their opening night and I think that that was the moment that you could see that Portland was here to lift jenny and her organization up. I get tingles when I think about that night because the line went around the corner, there's definitely a community that just kind of I think was already here and now has a place to gather at the bronze, which is really nice. It feels like a place that I feel really comfortable in a place where I can be myself and watch things that actually are interesting to me and have that not be something that is viewed as an inconvenience to other people, but it's celebrated. People ask me jenny, why hasn't anyone done this before? Seeing how difficult it was for me to get open and get the content and all the, all the stuff that we need to make it a success so far. I don't think it would have been possible five years ago with the content that was on tv or with the investment or the interest in women's support. And I think timing was just right now for it to happen. I honestly think in the next 10 years women's sports could overshadow men's sports as far as popularity goes. I think a company like the sports bra is proving too many other companies within Portland's or outside of Portland that you can have a successful business focusing on women's sports. You know, like the, the NWSL championship game was played on broadcast on CBS and like a ton, almost a million people tuned in and that's a really big deal. So like, it's nice to finally see that. I think the kind of powers that be in sports economics are paying attention to women's sports and starting to recognize the value and we don't need to question whether it's a good idea or not and just commit to supporting women in athletics for real cultural change to happen. And I think women's sports is about cultural change, real cultural change takes, you know, according to Gloria steinem takes about 100 years. And so I think we're about halfway through that as women's sports are shown over time, we get a chance to fall in love with the athletes the same way that we do for men's sports. You know, so we can show women's sports and we can be able to prove that women will watch, men will watch families will watch women playing sports. I've had, I don't know, maybe 70 people reach out asking to open a sports bra in their town or city, um, multiple investors, just hordes of interest. Um, but besides that I've had people reach out who want to open their own thing. That is a women's sports bar. I've had sports bar owners reach out and ask how they can incorporate more women's sports into their sports bar. And so all of these things to me is part of the mission jenny. And the people around this saw a need and they're like, well, we're not gonna wait for anyone to do it, we're just gonna make it happen. So much of what we experience is, what is in existence, right? It's hard to know what the possibilities are if you can't see it. And so I think that having created this space when people come in here, I feel like it opens up a whole new set of possibilities to introduce a women's sports bar where the culture is built around celebrating and empowering and supporting women's sports. It's about time take one","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1677693191907,"updatedAt":1687290240858,"irisTag":"most powerful women","videoPublishDate":1677715200000,"duration":{"value":732,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"5ca666ad-84f4-4d48-bb3e-341e88b23fe3","name":"How I started a $100 million fast casual restaurant called Slutty Vegan","slug":"how-i-started-a-$100-million-fast-casual-restaurant-called-slutty-vegan","shortDescription":"Slutty Vegan founder Pinky Cole dives into her story of how she came up with a provocative way to sell vegan food and turn it into a $100 million brand from the ground up.","longDescription":"Slutty Vegan founder Pinky Cole dives into her story of how she came up with a provocative way to sell vegan food and turn it into a $100 million brand from the ground up.

And at my grand opening, I had about 1200 people, I couldn't believe that so many people would stand out in line to support me and that's when I knew I had something really big. I was on the front page of the New York Times in the food section. Like we built a multimillion dollar business and that was game changing for me. Yeah, Hey, what's up? It's pinky cole. I'm 35 years old and I'm the founder and ceo of the world famous $100 million brand, slutty vegan A. T. L. Born and bred in Atlanta Georgia, having a television background. I said, you know what, I know what people watch when they watch tv, they want stuff that's in your face, racy raunchy, that's going to make them pay attention. But when you think about veganism, veganism has always been known to be pure flavorless, clean, very clean, very green. And I said the two most pleasurable experiences in life is sex and food. If I can make people think about sex and think about food at the same time, I know that I can peel the layer back and educate you about veganism in a way that you've never seen it before. I'm originally from Baltimore Maryland. I grew up in a single parent household. My father did 23 years in prison while my mother worked multiple jobs to make sure that she took care of the family. I can remember my mom working so many jobs and learning how to cook with my grandmother because my mother was always gone working or pursuing her own entrepreneurial endeavors as a musician. My father was and is an entrepreneur even behind bars, he would call me and tell me books to read, he would teach me about stocks, he would teach me how financial independence was the most important thing in this world and I became a hustler at a very young age, I used to throw parties, I used to sell candy, I would sell food when I graduated from college, I didn't have any job lined up except for teach for America and I'm like, I don't want to be a teacher, no shade to the teachers, but I knew that it was in the middle of a recession and I had to figure it out. So I packed up my bags and moved to Houston texas to work at teach for America. I was out there for five days and I realized that I do not want to do this and my friend gave me $40 and I went to the airport and I can remember sitting in the airport with my yorkie Rudy and a guy walked up to me and I was bawling crying and was like, what's wrong with you? And I'm just like, I'm not happy, I don't want to be a teacher inside of the classroom, I'm gonna in other ways and he said I'll be right back. Do you know this man walked away from me and he came back and he gave me $240 just enough money to get me and my dog Rudy home and I never looked back after that. I moved to los Angeles California to be an actress and then I started doing background work and I thought that I was good at it. But then one of my sorority sisters said, listen, you were broke, you need some money, I'm gonna give you a job working in television while I was working at the Maury show. I had this bright idea to open up a jamaican restaurant and don't ask me why I just like a Jamaican restaurant, let's do it. I actually took over somebody's lease and I was paying $2400 a month, which is crazy now because you can barely $2400 a month, that's a light bill. Now. I went to Google and Youtube and I started learning everything I could learn about the restaurant industry, I barely knew what I was doing. I still don't know what I'm doing, but I barely knew what I was doing. I had the restaurant for about two years and then I had a grease fire and literally lost everything in the grease fire. My car got refold, I got kicked out of my apartment, I went flat broke, I got an opportunity to work in tv again, I was working as a casting director and I was done with restaurants, I was working on a Tv show, they had a hiatus and I started delivering for doordash and while I was delivering for doordash, I'm like okay, cool ghost kitchens, I've never heard of ghost kitchens, but I see it happening in L. A. I realized I was just preparing for what I was about to create just a couple of months later and when they asked me to go to Atlanta temporarily to work on the show, it hit me like a light bulb and I came up with this crazy as concept called slutty vegan. I didn't have anything written down, I didn't have a blueprint, I didn't have a business plan, it was just an idea that sounded good. I started slutty vegan as a ghost kitchen, It was like a $5,000 startup cost to start slutty vegan. So I had to get my permits, I had to get the facility which was like $1,200. I had to order my food. I had to get my first employees, I had to set up all of my online digital delivery platforms. A lot of entrepreneurs don't realize that if you really want to grow a company, you have to reinvest everything. When I tell you every single time I was reinvesting, I was not taking any money for myself. At first I was just making sure that my employees were paid and that I had food in my business. The reason why I started a food truck is because the facility told me that I had too many people coming to the building so I had to go, so they put me in a parking lot and I had to find a food truck on the fly, didn't know anything about a food truck. The food truck was $45,000, so I had to put $10,000 down and every single week I was paying like $3400 every single week to make sure that I could pay it off and I paid that off in like like two months, two or three months. I got a DM from somebody on Instagram and he told me that there was a restaurant that they were leaving the restaurant and it was available if I wanted to rent it because of my confidence, I got me at least paying $1,200 and 650 square foot space. And at my grand opening I had about 1200 people. I couldn't believe that so many people would stand out in line to support me and that's when I knew I had something really big. It's the people who are the meat eaters that come to slutty vegan most because one, they want to learn what the hype is about to, they have an idea that they can try this vegan thing and if it's good, maybe I can continue on this path and three slutty vegan is a vibe. Uh I'll be honest, I wasn't the most savvy business person when I started study vegan, but when it came to like price and I'm just like, okay, $16 sounds like it would make sense, that's the price. Like I didn't do any like extra calculations, but I grew as a business owner, I actually met the ceo of shake shack first randy Geraghty and I reached out to him, I'm like, hey, randy, you don't know me, but I got a really popular restaurant in Atlanta and I would love to be able to sit down with you because one thing about pinky cole is, I'm gonna shoot my shot, He responded, we went to lunch and and we built a friendship and ever since then he has been such a great mentor to me. And then a few months later I get a call saying that Danny meyer came to slutty vegan on a late night with a few of his friends and he loved the experience and they wanted to talk. It took a long time to get the investment. It took about nine months slutty vegan will be a billion dollar company from my mouth to everybody's ears is listening to this. Four years ago, slutty vegan was just a ghost kitchen concept and four years later the company is now valued at $100 million when you come to slutty vegan, it's a party, The atmosphere is just amazing, the music is booming through the speakers, the employees are dancing, everybody wants to be a part of that. The fact that I have $100 million business, I still pinch myself every day. Like I'm not talking about a million, I ain't talking about five million, I'm talking about a black woman who owns $100 million business. Forget the fact that I'm just a black woman, a woman, a minority owned business, A woman whose family is from Jamaica who comes from humble beginnings who literally has never had a silver spoon in her mouth. Like you are looking at the new american dream, I don't care if you're black, white, blue, yellow, green, funny vegan, it's for everybody.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1674164687414,"updatedAt":1686689980638,"irisTag":"most powerful women","videoPublishDate":1674086400000,"duration":{"value":560,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d","name":"How we started a company helping 500,000 people In wheelchairs","slug":"how-we-started-a-company-helping-500,000-people-in-wheelchairs","shortDescription":"Award-winning songwriter Barry Dean and brother Jered Dean cofounded LUCI, a company that's changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","longDescription":"Award-winning songwriter Barry Dean and brother Jered Dean cofounded LUCI, a company that's changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","seoTitle":"How LUCI is helping 500,000 people In wheelchairs","seoDescription":"LUCI is changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","socialTitle":"How we started a company helping 500,000 people In wheelchairs","socialDescription":"Award-winning songwriter Barry Dean and brother Jered Dean cofounded LUCI, a company that's changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","tags":[{"name":"luci","type":"tag","label":"luci"},{"name":"accessibility","type":"tag","label":"accessibility"},{"name":"health_care","type":"tag","label":"Health care"},{"name":"rhiannon","type":"tag","label":"Rhiannon"},{"name":"lucy","type":"tag","label":"Lucy"},{"name":"barry_dean","type":"tag","label":"Barry Dean"},{"name":"jered_dean","type":"tag","label":"Jered Dean"},{"name":"success","type":"tag","label":"success"}],"categories":[{"name":"Series","type":"category","label":"Series"}],"section":{"name":"Tech","type":"section","label":"Tech"},"playlists":["The Ground Up"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photograph by Ted Willis and Corey Shepherd for Fortune","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Rhiannon is active, she races in the winter special olympics every year she likes to play indoor soccer, she wants that full life. And so for her to have that full book of memories, she's got to be able to get out and do things and lucy makes it easier and easier and the easier something is, the more we can pack into a day. Lucy is truly an innovative product by the most innovative product I've seen in about 10 years that can really impact clients functionally help them to either drive a power chair where perhaps they couldn't do that at all before or certainly drive it with much better confidence, competence and safety. So it's very exciting. Were the first company in this industry to ever make a smart connected device. Our ability to push out over the air update and have lucy keep getting smarter and smarter over time is a completely new idea in this industry. So lucy is an add on accessory for a power wheelchair that turns a dumb wheelchair into a smart wheelchair. We add sensors in the brain and connectivity to the power wheelchair so that the user has increased independence. That helps not run into things. Not drive off things, connects the user to their team and to the modern world. Obviously its mission. All we're you know, we're dealing with my daughter, his niece going, we need to solve a problem and all her friends, you know that are in the same boat. She has cerebral palsy. She gets a power chair when she's maybe five or about to be five and she touched the trigger. And it the speed had not been a justice. And it took off you know six miles an hour straight into a wall and she was fine. But I then promptly parked in the garage because I was like this is too scary. I wish I could say we sat down and said we're going to start a company. It was absolutely not that it was weird solve a technical problem, build the I. P. And the prototypes and then surely there will be companies that you know that that will do this. My basement became the headquarters of lucy for a while about a year later. I think we got our first three employees and then got an actual space. But yeah Catherine's been the north star from the beginning and then we've added two and met so many amazing people. Rhiannon was born with a rare birth defect called skit successfully. So it's a development delay in the brain and it affects her motor and verbal. Um So she's highly intelligent but you know she's not able to walk. My name is I am 16. I am my high school junior with her skits and hopefully she also has spasticity. So when she's trying to make her body do something sometimes the body will go the opposite direction or her tone will kick in and she'll go full forward and you can see the scars around the house where the chair would get up against and nothing slows it down. There's a lot of injuries in the wheelchair space more than there are people having motorcycle injuries and ending up in the er, 175,000 year. People ending up in the er, because of wheelchair injuries using a power chair is actually tougher than I think a lot of people think it takes learning in order to operate this very heavy device within an environment. These wheelchairs cost as much as a car. They weigh 3 to £500 without the person in them, but there's no modern technology on them. I mean, it's really kind of a boat, battery, some wheels and a joystick. Uh and good luck. The only safety stuff on a wheelchair would be a seatbelt. I mean, we we did crash testing with one of the top independent facilities in the country and they're saying that just running into a wall in one of these chairs at full speed violates the laws set up for cars and forward crashes and there's no bumper, the knees, the feet, your toes, That's the bumper in a wheelchair. I have had some clients I've worked with who have tipped over a chair and maybe broken an arm or injured their head. So, these are very, very serious concerns, Lucy is always looking looking for the clear path and if there's no clear path, it just brings you to a stop. We're seeing now with the users, we have, we're preventing over 10,000 collisions or drop offs, tip overs every week. This is the alpha prototype, the very first prototype, March 2017. It's off the shelf sensors, just whatever I could get from spark fund and find in the garage. It proved the theory that we could do it. So we really quickly went to a beta prototype about a month later. Katherine used this data prototype for a year and a half and during that time we tracked all the data from it learned where it worked and what didn't work well. And so we took all the stuff we learned here and developed what lucy product is without today. So lucy product looks like this. We call this the smart frame and this mounts onto a power wheelchair. And so you take this smart frame mounted down there, it plugs in between the joystick or the drive method and the motors and adds multiple kinds of sensors. So we have cameras um, one on each side of the user and one in the back. And then we have our own type of ultrasonic sensor that we develop and then hidden in here and down on the foot plate of the wheelchair. We have our own proprietary millimeter wave radar. And so take all that put it on the chair and that means your chair doesn't run into things. Doesn't drive off things is connected to the modern world. You can interact with lucy through Alexa through your phone. So turns it into a modern device. So when I first heard about lucy, I have to admit the first time I heard about it all I thought this can't possibly be true. And then when I learned more about it, started seeing some videos and had a chance to finally see lucy, I was really quite amazed that it worked as well as it did. It's an extremely sophisticated system. I was also excited because I work with very complex clients and anything that I can bring to them that helps them to be more functional than they are. I'm all in. We were hoping that it would be safer but it it is so much more with all of the independence and the confidence and watching Ryan and smile as she heads out the back door by herself and just her and ninja her dog and they're just off and they're gonna go for a walk and you're just not worried. It's fantastic Lucy has given me so much confidence. I am able to be more independent and do the things I want to do. She's 16 years old, she doesn't want mom and dad looming over all the time. Now she can go act like a teenager, we have a saying internally which is, life is a team sport. We have different clinicians, we have activity, people, we have specialists involved and doctors, so we set up the, my lucy app so that people can actually set up a team and choose what information to share the right or the driver of the chair can decide. This information needs to go to my doctor. This information needs to go to my caregiver. They can share uh battery status so that an alert goes out and let people know, hey, um, you know, Katherine's at this location, her battery's low, She may get stranded soon. You might want to check in right. One of the next things that we're working on. It sounds really simple, but it's just a pressure monitor for air cushions. That's not a hard tech list. That is just a knowing that there's a problem and getting the tech into the hands of the people that need it. Now that you actually have a computer and connectivity and a smart wheelchair. It becomes a freeing device not just for mobility but also for health. One of the things I'm really excited about that we just announced is the pediatric solution. Now you can get a wheelchair for a very young child with lucy on it once kids start crawling their vision and visual perceptual skills really explode all sorts of the area areas of the brain. Just like if kids don't have this ability to have independent mobility before the age of five, it changes the whole waterfall of development of possibilities for them for their whole life. You can't get that back. I think this is going to really change a lot of people's lives. So lucy is right now getting funded by insurance and Medicaid and the V. A. But usually there's some pushback because it's new technology. So if I recommend a power chair for a client, it's being paid for by an insurance company or by a state Medicaid program or perhaps a federal Medicare program. Well, the problem is something new comes along and there's not room in our current construct for how do we deal with a truly new product once these funders see it that first time in real life, what it can do for that user, we found that people tend to flip pretty quickly to, oh this actually makes a lot of sense. I think they're starting to come around especially on the lucy device because they're starting to see what long term It actually will save them money. Rhiannon is priceless but her equipment around her is $30,000 every time she rolls out the door and goes somewhere. So you obviously you don't want it bouncing off of things. It's been an interesting learning curve for us to learn how to combine the fact that there's that passion, there's that personal need That has built a real company that's really doing things in a real market now. We're at that place of raising our first funding and doing all that and that's going very well. But it's a very different path I think than most companies go on because it's already for sale. It's already in 40 states, you know, I mean hundreds of users, a lot of people see this and it is a mission all company. We have a cause, you know, we talk about moving at the speed of the need, you know, the internally those kinds of things. But the fact of the matter is although suddenly realized this is a real incredible business opportunity as well. There's an assumption that wheelchairs are a real niche that there's not very many people using wheelchairs in the world. And that assumption is wrong. Uh, there's, you know, a million more people in wheelchairs in the US than there are electric vehicles in the US. We have a lot of these conversations about equity. But what is sometimes left off of that scale are people with disabilities. It's a broad range of people. Some of those people will require a power wheelchair to be as independent as possible. It's easy to look down upon people who are less functional than ourselves. And I think we need to remember that one of the beauties of assistive technology. One of the reasons that I enjoy assistive technology so much is it levels the playing field. So now someone who didn't have mobility before can be mobile. You look five years down the road and I think this will be um, inevitable that this technology is on every power wheelchair sold and you'll start seeing a lot of interesting new health and wellness options for wheelchair users, manual and power. There we go, Oh, now you're giving love.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1675364505786,"updatedAt":1686690375997,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1675296000000,"duration":{"value":777,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}}]}}],"section":"Regular","state":"Published","index":2},{"id":"d6879435-d3e5-4030-a079-edd73e2e80ab","displayPage":"/videos","name":"On The Clock","viewportSize":{"web":3},"type":"PLAYLIST_TRAY","source":{"from":"PLAYLIST_SOURCE","playlistName":"On The Clock"},"items":[{"type":"PLAYLIST_ITEM","playlist":{"name":"On The Clock","type":"Series","state":"Published","premium":false,"videosOrderedByUser":[{"videoId":"ed010f01-0843-446f-aedc-ff107d8a45fa","name":"How I make a living as a professional Lego builder","slug":"how-i-make-a-living-as-a-professional-lego-builder","shortDescription":"Eric Hunter is a professional Lego artist and owner of The Art of LeGogh, under which he designs and builds Lego models for private and corporate clients, including Microsoft, New York Life, and Children’s Hospital.","longDescription":"Eric Hunter is a professional Lego artist who designs and builds Lego models for private and corporate clients, including Microsoft, New York Life, and Children’s Hospital.

You really can build anything with these little bricks. I'm Eric Hunter. I'm 53 years old. I'm a professional LEGO artist. Welcome to the art of LEGO. This is my kitchen and here are a few portraits I've designed out of LEGO. This is a mosaic of penny, my roommate. And down here, here's one of me, this is my studio as well. Back here, this whole first floor is one giant room that's been converted into several smaller areas. I actually sleep here. We've got the dining room and then back here is where all the fun happens. This is where I I I store my office right next to my living room. Actually, more like in my living room, I've had models in the 10,000, 90,000 range. And now just last week, I got my biggest commission to date. Actually, a six figure budget. This is the beginnings of a 1 to 1 scale 1968 Camaro S S for the estimate I calculated 245,000 Lego bricks to complete this model. Most of my clients models would probably fall in the between, I'd say 1200 to $3000 range. The budget doesn't have to be that large. If you can make a car this big or you know, as big as you want anything, it's all about scale and then about detail, thousands. As far as how the money is spent, I have three different rates. You of course have to buy the Lego and I have design time and then I have build time and miscellaneous time, which is basically buying organizing and shipping time. I've actually returned money to a client because it didn't cost as much as I thought it was. I'm not here to get rich, you know, I'm here to do what I love this tiny little walkie talkie piece is now usable as an actual walkie talkie human size. What I love about my job is seeing the final model. I love to see it to hold it. It's tangible and then it's done. I don't have to work on it, believe it or not. When I am not working, I will build a Lego set to relax. I like to look at the instructions and flip through the pages and build the model that somebody else designed. Takes the pressure off me. The most challenging thing with working with LEGO models is lighting every brick has a tiny little hair space in between it and it becomes a real challenge to have a fully lit model look good. I think a car is, is definitely the most popular. Just my freelance since 2013, I'd say I've designed between cars and trucks. Probably 2025 different different vehicles. I think people love their cars and they want to immortalize them on their desk. Now, I have a potential client. They want a model of a truck. I ask them to make model in the year, what color they want? After a client has ordered a model, I'll go and digitally design the model in the computer. I usually use a program called LEGO Digital designer. It's a free program by LEGO. After you design the model in there, you can basically rebuild it piece by piece. Once it is approved, I will then go and order the lego. I order from brick link, brick link is basically like ebay for lego. It's anything lego you need. It's new lego or lego. Here in my studio. I personally chose to not keep too much LEGO on hand. I order LEGO as needed for each project as I go and each project ends up with a little over and slowly builds my collection. As everybody knows, storing lego can be a challenge. I choose open top bins and bin cups. I use some like tackle box and tiny drawer storage as well. The building is the fun part. Of course, I glue the models I use methyl ethyl ketone, which is actually any K for short and it's, it's a solvent, it melts the Lego together. It doesn't really glue it together. It's pretty impermeable and very durable. So a model should pretty much last forever. I use many different tools. You name it. I mean, I use belt Sanders, drill presses, planers, Lego rulers. This ruler is a vertical ruler. This ruler is for horizontal measuring. I use glue clamps, I use anything industrial. It really depends on the model on the inside of many of the Lego models I design. There will be infrastructures, there might be a steel frame, there might be access panels, mounting points. But the trick is, it's all on the inside. It's pretty much hidden away the tool that I use most here. Good old mallet, save my fingertips. I have been going with Lego since I was, I would say four years old. This is a book that really inspired me to get more into LEGO as an adult in the back. It shows a picture, a picture that was really inspirational to me. It shows a group of ladies actually who are all the model designers for Lego land in Denmark. They were only accepting creative resumes. And I thought, well, I found a product, what product might I be? And rice crispies? Was it because Eric and Rice, this was a perfect fit. I got a job at Legoland California back in 2005 as an associate, a model associate. It was a dream come true for me. Within about a year's time, I went from associate to designer. At that point, I started designing buildings for Miniland and doing life size sculptures of people and anything else. Legoland Parks might need the tallest Lego model. I was a part of was the Lego Land, Malaysia Petronas Towers model which took about six months. I had 1000 an hour budget to design that I was then responsible for managing and guiding the team to build it. At one point, I believe we had 23 or 24 people in the model shop all working on the same project. I think we ordered 100 and 20,000 Lego one by two pieces for the windows. The final model ended up being just under 33 ft tall for about a four year period. I believe it was the world's tallest Miniland structure. So I actually had a world record. Unofficially after I left Legoland in 2013, I decided to start a Lego design company. My friend Penny, who was actually my roommate in college way back in the late eighties. She said, hey, why don't you come out to Connecticut? I found this really unique place that used to be a mechanic shop for a buick dealership. And it is now my home and my Lego studio. Since I started my company, I have made, I would say upwards of 400 LEGO models for, for clients. Some of my corporate clients have included names like Microsoft New York Life. My latest is Children's Hospital. They really enjoy adding LEGO into their, their world. Back in 2013, it was a one man operation as it is again today. At one point I had eight employees. I really do enjoy being a one man operation because it allows me full control, but it's very limiting. Ultimately, I see growing my company into having a model shop with several employees full time, constantly building all of the designs that I am designing. And of course, I'd help build too when and if I could, I kind of see a little young Richard Nixon in here. So this is actually Pee-wee Nixon.\u003c/p\u003e","srtFormat":{"videoId":"ed010f01-0843-446f-aedc-ff107d8a45fa","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":3,"key":"ed010f01-0843-446f-aedc-ff107d8a45fa/SRT/captions-ver3.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I've had many jobs in my life and I got to say that that designing Lego models is definitely by far the best you really can build anything with these little bricks.

I am a certified C, it's also known as I think the very first idea of beer or c sort of comes off as a person who's drinking beer all day. Unfortunately, it's, it's not as glamorous as that. There's actually a lot of leg work that actually goes into it before the beer actually ever gets presented to the guest. You need to start doing tastings, you need to start doing pairings, you need to start building out beer menus, finding the right glassware, getting the right chillers. I was working at Gastro Pub at the Venetian. There weren't too many people in Las Vegas that actually had such a wide selection of beers. They had a actually on our staff when I started talking to him. I, I started figuring out, you know what, there's so much more to learn about beer than I actually already knew. I knew about IP A si knew about ports. I knew about stouts, but to start talking about beer in a way that was almost like so romantic to become a, I think you really just sort of need to be a beer nerd. At heart, you need to start picking up books. You need to actually start doing your research, your knowledge about all the different styles of beer. You have to know about the srm, the gravity of each beer, how it's been brewed, how it's been made, the history behind it. What it's supposed to taste like being able to talk about it, almost like wine. I think I've tasted about 500 beers now. Maybe even more. There has been one or two instances where I have become slightly inebriated, opening up magnums of chime or doing these fantastic beard tastings, beard dinners. It's just one of the first of the job becoming Saron was probably one of the most difficult tests and exams that I've actually ever come across. There's actually four different certifications. Each one has to be completed before you can go on to the next level. The exam was actually the course of an entire day. It was tasting for a major portion of it. The knowledge and theory portion of it was probably over 50%. And then beer pairing was, I think another 25% of the actual exam. It was an extremely arduous test but very fulfilling. Rewarding. Even after everything was done today, we're here at Hotel Barrier Phuket and we're going to be trying five different beers. We have a really nice, beautiful assortment going from light to dark. This is Gaffle cos this is a very unique solid beer that actually hails from the region of cologne in Germany. Think of champagne. Ok. I would pair this with fried chicken. It would be really nice carbonation just to go ahead and cut through the fat on the chicken. This is Dupont. There's a really nice malt background to it. It is a farmhouse ale so it has a little bit of like a barnyard y sort of characteristic to it. But phenomenal. One of the best pairings of my entire life was actually done with the ce on. I had this particular style with a triple cream cheese, a little bit of honey comb and with a really nice crusty baguette. And that was the absolute moment where the light bulb went off. And I said, wow, pairing beer and food is such a magical experience. This beer is, is trace Fontaine from dust translation. It means three Fountains. The style is an oat goose is actually a blend of three different lambic. One year, two year, three year lambic from Linda. It actually pairs extremely well with a hot lobster roll the butter, the bread, the sweetness of the lobster itself, extremely delightful pairing. This is, it is a Flemish bread coming from Belgium. However, this beer itself is actually brewed in Italy is triple fermented first time in stainless steel and then a in cognac barrels. This beer pairs extremely well with barbecued meats such as brisket and also strawberry cheesecake. So this beer is poo. It's an Imperial Baltic porter hailing from the region of Estonia, it actually comes from the area of the Baltic Sea. Yeah, is much more malt driven. So you have flavors of coffee, chocolate, even really nice rich molasses. This particular beer pairs extremely well with say a coffee crusted steak or even a flourless chocolate cake. When I first started. I thought that 300 beers was the crazy exorbitant amount for a beer list. Now, in days, I mean, I've come across places that are even over 506 100 different skews for beers. CS are definitely more in demand. Now, people are much more in tune to what's in their glass. They want to know more. They want to be able to go ahead and find these fantastic beers and they're asking the right questions. Is there a time that's too early that I drink beer? No, I come from Las Vegas. Absolutely not.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1674676542319,"updatedAt":1689263784416,"videoPublishDate":1674691200000,"duration":{"value":348,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"4d252785-96a2-4670-bfc8-643a2b3cc372","name":"How horses healed my heartbreak and led me to an equine coaching career","slug":"how-horses-healed-my-heartbreak-and-led-me-to-an-equine-coaching-career","shortDescription":"Leah Goldman is a self-described “horse girl” who turned her passion into a career after a devastating breakup.","longDescription":"Leah Goldman is a self-described “horse girl” who turned her passion into a career after a devastating breakup.

I was the child who was the \"horse girl.\" And my love affair with horses started probably before I can remember. My name is Leah Goldman and I am an equine coach. Equine coaches are relatively new to the coaching industry. So turn his head to the left. Head to the left. They're not coming to learn how to ride. They're just coming to learn about themselves in a very unique and different way. What makes this work really powerful is the horse as the mirror. The exercise for you is about creating space, right? And creating boundaries and keeping those boundaries in place. Back, back. Are we having fun? And stop. You can maybe qualify for some of these larger therapeutic programs, which are so wonderful, or you could be interested in riding horses, but there wasn't anything in the middle. This really is quite a long journey of how I got here. I entered into a relationship and spent three years with this man who I thought was going to be my lifelong partner. He had been living a double life and had been in a relationship with somebody else for the entire time that we had been together. And it was a life-altering moment. Two weeks before I had found that out, I hadn't been around horses in a while and was really missing it. And I started riding when I was six. I found a horse that I signed on to lease for the summer. It just all started to come together. So while I was grieving the loss of not only this person who I loved, but you know the loss of this life that I thought I was going to have, I had this space to go to. A lot of what I just needed was somebody to be with me, right? And that somebody was a horse. That's really where my own healing started to begin. I was mentored and trained under a master coach out in Santa Fe, New Mexico. There's five horses. Every single one of them was laying down, except for one. I was like, I just, I think that's the horse that I'm the most connected to. And he walked right by me. And I was like, oh. I was like, of course, like I'm not good enough. And yeah, why would he come over here? And then all of a sudden, I kid you not, he turned around, circled in front of me, dropped to the ground, and dropped his head in my lap. I just, I lost it. I just completely broke down. It does something for you that sometimes people can't give you, right? You're looking for answers or you're searching for something. You're just searching for it and you can't get it you can't find it. And all of a sudden, you have this like powerful, majestic being giving you exactly what you need. And it was just like the two of us in that moment. And it was just like, everything's gonna be okay. I get a lot of people who have lost spouses, some people who have lost pets, and they need a place that they come to where they feel a sense of comfort and safety Let's head into the indoor today. Okay, come on, Booboo, we got some work to do. So before you do that, you know, remember, we want to always set the intention of what we're doing. So to conjure up or bring up things that really fill you with joy, right? That make you feel light, that make you feel warm, and go see what happens. C'mon Boo. When I try to explain it to people, they're often like, \"You're not riding the horse?\" Like no, I'm not riding—I'm never gonna ride the horse. I've never ridden a horse. It's not about that. It's about the being, not the doing. I am a psychotherapist. I sought Leah out because it was the middle of COVID I was seeing 40 patients a week, which is way too many. So getting out of my head, not thinking about my patients. Not wondering about COVID. Not worrying about my kids and all the things that they were missing. I didn't have to do any of that here in any way. It was just about finding peace in myself. I think the lesson for me is that I don't need to hold other people's things quite as tightly as I do sometimes. And as soon as I get here, I'm just centered. Thank you. They're not going to be able to take Saint home. But the hope is that you have a felt sense experience that will remind you when you're not on the farm, and life gets tough or chaotic or stressful, and you can have this moment of like, \"Okay, let me just pretend like I'm in the field with Saint and I'm breathing with Saint.\" And I actually have many people who keep photos of Saint as a reminder, right? To slow down, to breathe, to just take a moment for yourself. I was mid-pandemic diagnosed with a rare chronic illness, called idiopathic subglottic stenosis. Essentially, my body will suffocate itself. I have always told Leah that the doctor saved my life, but Leah and Saint saved my soul. I have my fourth surgery coming up on Monday. Just really trying to get myself in a good position where I'm in the zone and really focused on myself, so I can come back even stronger. There's science behind it, and why this works that I can explain to you. But there's also this other side of it where things happen that I can't explain. Those are the moments, those magical moments a lot of the time that make a huge difference for people. So I'd already earned my credential, my ICF-credential as a certified professional coach, which is the International Coaches Federation, and spent about a year and a half going through that. The equine piece was really just taking my 30 plus years of horse knowledge, and just combining them together. So I had that idea, the summer of 2018. And by 2020, I was launched and ready to go. I mostly see women, although men are welcome to come. It just for whatever reason seems like women are more drawn to this space than men. I have worked with anyone, you know, as young as 18, all the way up to women in their 70s. Somebody who is an equine coach has to be incredibly observant. They have to be incredibly thoughtful. You have to be able to hold both the human heart and the equine heart masterfully. The client has to lead it because I'm here to help them. You'll always hear me check in with the client, \"How are things going? How have you been? You know, we talked about this last time.\" I have probably like 10 to 15 go-tos that I use. Some of them are super short, really simple. Others take a lot longer. Saint is my heart horse. He is a manifestation of a horse that I have dreamed of since I was an adolescent. I remember thinking to myself as a child, \"Someday, I am going to have a horse who has 16 one-hands, who is a chestnut, a gelding, a Warmblood. He's going to have a white blaze, and he's going to have white socks. When I started looking for a horse, I had posted in a Facebook group and a woman messaged me and she said, I think I have the perfect horse for you. And she sent me some photos of him and I was like, 16 one-hands, chestnut horse, gelding, Warmblood, white blaze, white socks. And I was like, \"What's his name?\" She goes, \"Saint.\" And I was like, I can't—I mean, you can't make this stuff up if you tried. It's the perfect name for a horse that's doing this work. Heart Math is a research organization. What they did was they basically discovered that horses sync their heartbeats with one another. So essentially, if a horse is heart rate goes up, it kind of pings to another horse, and that's like, \"Oh, do we need to be on alert? Do we need to be worried about something? Should we start moving?\" What they found was that horses can sink their hearts with humans as well, from up to four feet away. But what that does is it can lower our heart rate. It can also lower our blood pressure, and basically puts us in this state of neutrality, which is just a place of ease. This job has changed my life in every way. In every way. I'm doing what I'm passionate about. I've always wanted to help people. I've always loved horses, I get to combine those two things and I get to give this to others. That's what makes it so worthwhile. You know, when I'm here and I'm doing something for myself, that's when the positivity comes out. Like when I'm with this guy. It kind of just melts everything away.","srtFormat":{"videoId":"4d252785-96a2-4670-bfc8-643a2b3cc372","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"4d252785-96a2-4670-bfc8-643a2b3cc372/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"12, 12.

This was my first ever triple crown at the end of the year. This is actually my eighth triple crown of 2022. This is the biggest trophy I have ever received. I'm Anna Lee Waters. I'm 16 years old and I'm the number one female professional pickle ball player. Mhm. Pickle ball has become so popular because anyone can play, any age can play and any skill level can play. You can have fun, you can be competitive. It's just a sport for everyone with the first pick in the 2023 major league pick a ball draft. The new Jersey fives select Anna Lee Waters so good everywhere on the court. There is no weakness in this young lady, Anna Lee was unquestionably the number one pick I think for everybody in the draft, people are picking men and women and to have a number one pick that was a female player and to have more women's picks in the top 10 than men was really remarkable and says something about pickle ball. She is a young phenom ranked number one in the world, both in singles, mixed doubles and women's doubles. She is the most dominant player in the game at the tournament of champions. I won the most or had the most points in that tournament. I was ranked the number one women's singles player at 14 years old. I feel like the achievement that I'm most proud of didn't actually happen this year. It happened in 2019 when I won nationals with my mom. I remember after we won the match, she like jumped and then she started like running around the court and I was like chasing her, like wanting to hug her and like celebrate with her waters and waters. It was our first huge tournament that we went together. I think I had an out of body experience. We had reached a goal that, you know, that we had set because I never thought of pickleball as a job. But at the same time, like, I guess it kind of is, it's a very fun job, especially this year. A lot of big companies have gotten into the sport. I've also seen a big growth in like celebrity pickleball. I've had a lot of sponsorship opportunities. I have an agent now. I am so young and to, you know, learn as many things as I'm learning and, you know, be a part of sponsorship deals and learning about contracts. Sometimes I'll see like the checks that come in and I'm like, save it. I'm saving, I'm put in the bank. I try not to spend my money. You see someone like Michael Jordan who can like design their own shoe and then I'm sponsored by. So I'm kind of designing a shoe with them. It's just kind of cool that I can be kind of grouped into like an athlete that's making their own shoe, which, which is amazing. Annie and I started playing pickle ball at the exact same day, the exact same second, we evacuated our home in Florida due to a hurricane and we went to visit my father who lived in Pennsylvania and he asked us, you know, do you want to go play pickle ball? And at first we were kind of like, no, because we didn't know what it was. And I was pretty young. I think I was 10. So we thought it was an older person sport, but we went and from the moment we stepped on the court, we were, we were hooked. First time I hit the ball, I was like in love with the sport. We played like three times a day for like two weeks straight while we were up there. From when I first started playing, I played with my grandfather and my mom and I can still play with my grandfather and my mom. It's fun, but it's also embarrassing. Uh, as I got older and older, obviously, I got worse and worse and as she got older, she got better and better. Unfortunately, at the previous national tournament Lee was injured. So when Anna Lee was going into a finals match, she had nobody to warm her up. So I actually warmed her up. I really don't know the outcome of the success of the warm up, but she won. So I guess I did something right. Anna Lee and I play a few times a week. Some of that is playing, some of that is drilling, watching Annaly compete. She's feisty. She's an animal. She's an absolute beast on the court. I'm a full time student, but I am also a full time professional pickleball player. So hopefully I'm gonna make a career out of this. You got that right on his mic. Can you send it to me? Yeah, when I'm home, I usually play pickle ball five days a week. I usually drill like two times a week and then I'll play games three times a week. If I'm drilling, it's around two hours. And if I'm playing games, it can be anywhere from like 2 to 3 hours. And I'm usually in the gym five days a week as well. I would say average in a day, I'm working out like four hours and even on my off days, I'm doing either some kind of cardio or walking. She started off as a soccer player and tennis player converted, I think at 11 and she learned the game went pro at 12 lightning quick hands. Great court awareness, great court coverage. I have a lot of different skill sets from different sports for soccer. It was, it's definitely like the footwork and the fast sprinting and the lateral movement and stuff for tennis. It's definitely the form. The form is very similar if you watch tennis and pickle ball. But there is a big difference between like strategy and pickleball and tennis. So I had to learn that Anna Lee and I had come from tennis and the minute I stepped on the court, I just wanted to hit the ball hard and everybody kept telling us like you're not playing correctly. This isn't how you play. You have to hit soft, you have to hit these dinks. But it's just what came so true to, to me and Anna Lee was this power game. So we just continued with our game. And the next thing you know, we were winning national championships at the pro level and we were known for our aggressive style of play. A lot of people ask the question like, how do you guys play on the court together? Isn't it hard that she's your mom and that she's your daughter is in the dynamic. Weird. But I feel like for us it's the opposite. Like we have this mother daughter intuition where we know where the other one's gonna be on the court. And if we miss a shot, we know the other person is not going to be mad at us. So we just feel like you know, we can play how we want to play. We don't have to worry about disappointing our partner because no matter what happens on the court, we're a family and that's what families do. They stick together. I travel with not only my mom but also my dad win or lose. Me and my family always go out to eat and I have a really special bond with my grandmom. She's been home schooling me from third grade on, I'm in 11th grade. Even before I started playing pickleball, I was home schooling and it just really worked out because I couldn't travel and do all the things that I'm doing with pickleball right now becoming a professional athlete. I am so proud of Anna Lee. Her coaches and her other sports have always told us what an athlete she was and what potential she had. But you still don't necessarily go to like, oh professional athletes. This is probably a very futuristic goal, but I want to play pickle ball in the Olympics one day I grew up watching the Olympics and I think it would be really cool to represent my country. And I also want to see pickleball grow like in other countries. I also want to see pickle ball grow in like high schools and get younger kids involved. And that's something that I'm working on now. So in the beginning of this year, one of my goals was to get a triple crown and I ended up getting eight this year, which was amazing. If I've accomplished the goal, there's still something better you can do. So I feel like next year I'm gonna try to get nine triple crowns, uh, which would be, might be difficult, but I'm gonna try to do it. I'm just really, you know, enjoying the ride and I wanna keep going as long as I can. Uh When we came home, we decided we were going to get a ping pong table. I think we played about two weeks before Anna Lee got so good that nobody wanted to play with her anymore. And I don't think we've played ping pong since.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1680191672609,"updatedAt":1682090342594,"videoPublishDate":1680134400000,"duration":{"value":520,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"fc073e7a-4d82-41eb-849d-0e2f156a0ff6","name":"Meet this NYC meteorologist who's been predicting weather for 40 years","slug":"meet-this-nyc-meteorologist-who's-been-predicting-weather-for-40-years","shortDescription":"Chief Meteorologist Janice Huff shares a behind-the-scenes look at how weather forecasting at NBC 4 New York comes together.","longDescription":"Chief Meteorologist Janice Huff shares a behind-the-scenes look at how weather forecasting at NBC 4 New York comes together.

This is [Studio] 3K and this is where everything happens. I'm Janice Huff. I'm the chief meteorologist at NBC News 4 New York. We are the station scientists, even when it's not the weather, even when it's earthquakes, even when it's—anything that has to do with science, NASA, space, whatever. You have to be a scientist and a presenter, both. We don't use a script because the graphics that we show, like the satellite pictures, radar, and all the other graphics with all the fronts and things and the 10-day and all that—we're basically telling it through through the pictures. I've been doing this job here at NBC in New York for 28 years. I've been in television, weather broadcasting, probably closer to 40 years. This is one of our touchscreen monitors. We can use this for weather, as well as this large monitor right here, also useful. And then over here is our green screen. We stand here and do weather here. It's a big studio with lots of monitors that we take full advantage of. These are not all my clothes. Only this stuff is mine. But we have lots of weather anchors here. So six of us. And between the six of us, we all have clothes back here and lockers, and places to put our shoes. People do recognize me, people always have something to say about the weather. We are extremely accurate, but that's not what people remember. They always remember the one time when you may not get the snowfall right, or you may not get the area that gets the rain versus the snow. And everybody always remembers those times, of course. Blizzards are our big thing here on the East Coast. Forecasting itself is probably one of the biggest challenges. And we are most accurate, at least 90 to 95% of the time. There's very few times when the forecast is doesn't turn out the way we had hoped or the way we have predicted it. There's 10 meteorologists in our family that are helping each other all the time and collaborating, especially when there are big, big storms. We probably have the biggest team of anybody here in this area, we're the envy of most. Janice has such a rich history here. She is so kind and warm and welcoming to everyone. It is just so easy to work with her. And the person you see on camera who's so inviting and warm and welcoming to the viewers, someone who really cares—she's like that off the air. When we have the breaking weather situations, a lot of times that can be serious, but kind of we just watch her and it's just—it comes so easy to her. So I would say kind of, we watch an awful lot of us because it just rolls right off the tongue. She's a pro. She's really ready for anything at any time. We are in the Storm Team 4 Weather Center for NBC. It's right behind our studio walls. Our studio is just on the other side of this wall. It's a team effort. It takes a lot of people to get this act together every day. We have several shows throughout the day, starting with our morning news at 4 a.m. We also have an 11 a.m. newscast. This is where all of the work gets done every day for all of our weather casts that go into each and every newscast. That's all of the forecasting. That's all of the graphics that gets done for the actual weather cast, and all the discussion. And we have our lunch here. We live here pretty much. There are people here practically 24/7. There's only a couple of hours at night when no one's here. We collaborate with Janice. It's pretty much an ongoing conversation between the members of the weather team. We use Microsoft Teams to basically keep everybody abreast of any changes in the forecast. Any interesting tidbits in the forecast that one of us is saying, we'll put it into a team's note so that everybody can see it. Janice is pretty much on call 24/7. I go home and about 11:45 Every night and get right back up at 9:40 in the morning and start all over again. That's interesting. I knew I wanted to be a meteorologist when I was about 10, I think. I discovered the word \"meteorology\" by reading the encyclopedia because back then we didn't have computers at home. That's when I figured out what a meteorologist does. And I loved the weather since I was a little little kid. And so I decided then when I was 10 that that's what I was going to study when I went to college. My degree is a Bachelor of Science in meteorology from Florida State University. My minor is mathematics. Graduating from college, I was the first person in my family to do that. Even though it was many years ago, I still look back on that as a major accomplishment. And to also get a degree in meteorology, which is a major accomplishment for anybody. Once I got to interview President Obama. A bunch of meteorologists, including myself, were picked to come to the White House when he was president and talk about the climate report, the climate assessment. And it was amazing to be there and actually speak to the President about the state of the climate and the weather and be at the White House which is really cool. Definitely as a woman of color, I didn't see people who looked like me doing weather on television when I was growing up in the '60s and '70s. There were a handful of women, one being June Bacon-Bercey, who actually broke that barrier before I did, and became the first African American woman with a degree in meteorology to actually do the weather on TV back in the '70s. So there were a couple of people that came before me. Yet, I never saw her on TV when she was actually on television back then, because she was in Buffalo, New York, and I was in South Carolina. So I didn't see anyone who looked like me doing what I do. That's why I never thought about having a career on TV doing it. I bought this when I was in Tanzania in the Serengeti. We went on vacation. It was more than just going on vacation. It was kind of symbolic, in a way. I've never been to Africa, so. And since the majority of my roots are in Africa, not from that country. But it was my first trip to the motherland, as you say, and it was quite the experience of being in a country where practically everybody looks like you. But that's the flag of Tanzania. And I've wear it all the time. I never take it off. That was in 2018. It's just just a reminder of my trip and when it meant to be there. We expect it to be quiet night tonight. The fun part about this job is just being able to do what I love. It's not really work when you do what you love, right? Most people are never going to be able to say they've worked anywhere for 28 years. But to say that I've worked at 30 Rock for 28 years is a tremendous accomplishment. Of course, there's a little bit of luck involved and things that I have no control over. But that's a huge deal now when I think about it, and I'm really happy that I've been able to be here this long. If you want to be a meteorologist, focus on your studies, math and science.","srtFormat":{"videoId":"fc073e7a-4d82-41eb-849d-0e2f156a0ff6","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"fc073e7a-4d82-41eb-849d-0e2f156a0ff6/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Bye.

Imagine if I was able to give you a drug that would improve your mood, increase your energy, make your immune system stronger, reduce your appetite. Have you live longer? Reduce the chances of you getting type two diabetes or heart disease or maybe even Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Would you take that drug? Of course you would, anyone would. Uh And the thing is is that that drug is for free. It's called sleep. And all you need to do is to know how to do it and to practice it intentionally tips for a good night's sleep. One of the classic uh sleep hygiene tips is to sleep in a cooler bedroom. So you might try that out and see if that improves your sleep. If you have a wearable that tracks sleep, you'll have a objective measure to know whether or not the change that you made. The experiment that you ran will affect the outcome of your sleep. Another tactic this is very common obviously is to use white noise. Some people prefer a fan. Some people like a white noise generator or a pink noise generator or a brown noise. There's all these different kinds of noise. You choose what that is that really works for you and you stick with it. Another tactic that people often use for sleep is sleep supplements. Uh Melatonin, it's the chemical that your body releases in order to kind of start everybody off on the process of going into this glorious symphony of sleep. I personally, I like to take LCN nine and magnesium. I take a kind of a sleep cocktail of three or four pills every night and their supplements, they're just compounds that are both relaxing and restful but also are very conducive to staying asleep. So magnesium is, I think a tried and true tactic for many people definitely works for me. Keep your room quiet and dark. It's not always possible. So, you know, sometimes you can isolate your own uh hearing with earplugs or with an eye mask to keep it dark if you can't keep the room itself dark. And then the last one and this is somewhat, I think counterintuitive for people sleep regularity increasingly is demonstrating that it is an important part of quality sleep. Think about the routine you had as maybe as a baby where your sleep and wake cycles were incredibly, you know, regimented and your body knew how to behave around those. And of course, you have your own sleep cycle, it's called your circadian cycle. But if you are regular and you're hitting that sort of window of falling asleep at the right time every night and waking up at the same time, you're actually going to do a great job of convincing your body your body how to sleep more effectively.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1714486148865,"updatedAt":1714496413921,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1714496413921,"duration":{"value":165,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"eeeade48-1765-40c7-9c0c-21858d43077e","name":"This CEO started running at 45 and now runs multiple races a year","slug":"this-ceo-started-running-at-45-and-now-runs-multiple-races-a-year","shortDescription":"Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar couldn’t run a mile until she started running at 45 and challenged herself to run her first marathon.

I'm like, holy cow. Everyone showed up at five in the morning and it was New York City at its best. And I ran my first half did better than I had expected and have since then have run three marathons and too many halves to count. I love running. I discovered running at 45 years old and maybe it's because I like having a goal or I like having a challenge. I could not run a mile when I first started, started running. What I love about running is, first of all, it's an amazing community. Number two, you're competing with yourself. It's about you setting a goal, whether it's a time goal, whether it's finishing a race, whether it's seeing a new city. So it's all about you and you're sharing with so many others. And what I love about running is it's all ages, all body types. It's young, old coming together for one thing of, of running and to me, wellness is very important. So running to me has been something that I'm not a particularly good runner, but it's something that I feel better after I after I've been on a run, it sounds corny. But I was one of the proudest moments for me when a New York road runners board member, I asked to join their board because I learned how to run at 45. And there are a lot of elite runners on the board, but they thought I was a poster child for running and how great running could be for health, for wellness and just the camaraderie DC is my new hometown. I have been at Fannie Mae for a year, so I have not run a race in the last year. But thanks to the Fannie Mae employees, they told me about the 10 mile Cherry Blossom race in April coming up in DC and I am training for a 10 miler. Come this April.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1712943498959,"updatedAt":1713006013924,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713006013924,"duration":{"value":115,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1","name":"4 productivity hacks from experts","slug":"4-productivity-hacks-from-experts","shortDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","longDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","seoTitle":"4 productivity hacks from experts","seoDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","socialTitle":"4 productivity hacks from experts","socialDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","tags":[{"name":"productivity","type":"tag","label":"productivity"},{"name":"productivity_tips","type":"tag","label":"productivity tips"},{"name":"tips_for_productivity","type":"tag","label":"tips for productivity"},{"name":"life_hacks","type":"tag","label":"life hacks"},{"name":"fortunewell","type":"tag","label":"fortunewell"}],"categories":[{"name":"Fortune_Well","type":"category","label":"Fortune Well"},{"name":"Life","parentName":"Fortune_Well","label":"Life","type":"category"}],"section":{"name":"Health","type":"section","label":"Health"},"playlists":["Fortune Well"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Getty Images","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"status":"pending"},"hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1712863519195,"updatedAt":1713178813876,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713178813876,"duration":{"value":121,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"f99b18bd-bb14-4434-a41c-65ab62531ef7","name":"4 tips to combat seasonal allergies","slug":"4-tips-to-combat-seasonal-allergies","shortDescription":"Pollen season is set to grow longer and more intense due to climate change.

You don't have to be a scientist or an affluent person who has access to special doctors to make an impact on your health span. You can make specific changes that actually help change the trajectory of how you age telehealth is a consumer focused Longevity company whose mission is to help people live healthier for longer by providing solutions including an epigenetic age test, personalized action plans and pro longevity supplements. A lot of people ask me for tips to help lower their epigenetic age or really their body's true age. You know, I think the biggest thing that people can do is get up and move, go take a walk, ask a friend to do a walk with you around the block, take a meeting on the phone and walk around the neighborhood. Movement is significant for aging and definitely can help improve your health span. So when I think about my aging and my wellness routine, I really focus on a couple of things that have the most impact for me which are stress and sleep. So when I wake up in the morning, I do a quick meditation, breath work and yoga, I listen to, I'm calming music and then I start with my day. I also try to get a few breaks throughout the day between meetings to either meditate, listen to music or take a walk. So my job keeps me pretty busy during the week with Zoom calls back to back. But on the weekend, I'm super intentional about getting outside. I'll take my kids to the park, we'll walk as long as the weather will allow us to. And that makes me more content and feels like I'm making great move for my health. One of the things that we've seen in our data at tally is that one of the biggest drivers of healthy aging is actually your relationships, having a really strong bond with your friends, your family, your community, whatever outlet you have to build those bonds with other people and have that interpersonal interaction is actually extremely significant. I've really tried to lean in to my women's group, my family calling old friends and just catching up for a few minutes every day. And I've found that that has led to a lot of positivity and brightness in my day that helps me reduce stress. That helps me feel really great. And all of that actually ties back to healthy aging. I want to live healthier and I want to live longer so that I can spend more time with my kids, with my husband, with our friends and family members. Those are the moments that bake what life is so to be able to live healthier without disease or condition, without ailments and without losing mental capacity. That's why I focus on my health.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1711743925095,"updatedAt":1711744213974,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"Aging-Well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1711744213974,"duration":{"value":157,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"c9a00200-1472-454a-8318-5db7b5e9032f","name":"3 lessons from the happiest countries in the world","slug":"3-lessons-from-the-happiest-countries-in-the-world","shortDescription":"The annual World Happiness Report ranks self-reported happiness scores for nearly 150,000 people in over 140 countries.

And so your skin benefits tremendously from anything you do to take care of yourself, whether that's exercise, proper nutrition and hydration. My name is Heather Wallace and I'm the CEO of cur cur is a skin care company and we make skin care accessible by combining our telehealth dermatology practice and our customized personalized formulas entering cur as a skin care company and really being part of the health and wellness space. It's made me reflect on how I care for myself. And so I take better care of myself today than I did two years ago. I really focus on stackable fitness. So if I have a 30 minute break in the day, I like to get on the treadmill, sweat it out for 20 minutes, feel great and then jump back on to the next zoom call and keep going from there. When it comes to my skin care routine. I've actually realized that I need to treat it very similar to the way I treat my exercise routine, which is just making it snack and fitting it in when I can, I have a really busy day. And every day is different. Sometimes I'm home and working from home many times I'm traveling. So, what I try to do is make sure that I'm taking care of my skin and taking care of myself throughout the day when I can fit it in. So sometimes I wake up in the morning and it's all about kids and sometimes it's all about me. So I try to always exercise at some point early in the day after that, wash my face care for my skin with a three step routine. So I use serum moisturizer and always something for the eyes. I think that's most important from a diet perspective. I think the most important thing for my skin health is definitely water. I'm very focused on protein. So I try to eat as much protein as I can. I wouldn't naturally eat a lot of protein. So my, my favorite new hack is that in the morning, I take my iced coffee and I make a protein shake with my iced coffee and start my day every day with that. When I think about the link between physical fitness, mental wellness and skin care, they're really inherent. Your skin is the largest organ in your body. And so your skin benefits tremendously from anything you do to take care of yourself, whether that's exercise, proper nutrition and hydration. I also know personally, as well as from listening to our many patients and consumers that your skin has such a big impact on how you feel. It's not about how you look, but it's about how you feel about how you look and you face the world with your face. So when you feel good about your skin, you can feel good about yourself.

I'm a health and wellness reporter at Fortune and I'm getting my first AI-powered massage. Come with me. A massage powered by artificial intelligence and robotic arms might sound like something out of science fiction, but automation is disrupting the spa industry with the arrival of companies like Aescape. This is what we like to think of as the world's most advanced massage. So coming in here, you would have booked on an app for finding a table that's available around you in whatever city you might be in. You come in, you put on these cool clothes, you lay down on the table beneath the headrest. There is a touchscreen. We have sensors overhead here that create a 3D model of your body and that's going to show off your body in 3D and let you make all the changes you want to make to the massage. So we're going to have you lie face down here, arms out in front. We're going to maybe adjust that bolster for your feet just a little bit. And headrest, is that comfortable? You want that up, down and out? Do you like a firm massage, medium pressure? How do you like it? I would say medium. Alright, that's where we're going to start and we can always make the changes. We also have some immersive content here. If you just want to be taken away to another place in the middle of the massage, in the middle of the rainforest on a snowy mountain or maybe just in some lovely water. And then most notably over on the right there, we have a pressure control. Why don't you go ahead and give that plus sign a tap a couple of times and you can see it's really responsive, goes up and down very quickly. It will never get frustrated with you. If you want to make a lot of changes or you change your mind or you like it really firm in this spot, but not in that spot. You can see on the circles there just how much pressure is being applied at any point in the time. If you ever need to pause, the button's right at the bottom. There's a button to move on to the next stroke. If there ever reason why you wanted help from someone, there's an assistance button in the lower right corner, a standard massage with Aescape costs $60 and lasts 30 minutes with the company planning to roll out different options and price points for consumers down the line. After my massage. I sat down with founder and CEO Eric Litman to learn more about the product. How was your massage? It was great. I'm a little dazed so we'll see how this interview goes. What were your favorite parts of it? I liked being able to adjust the music, kind of adjust the pressure points and also watch where it was going next and sort of see it as a protocol kind of throughout the 30 minutes. So you founded Aescape in 2017, nearly seven years ago. So, can you talk a little bit about the impetus of beginning the company? So I started this back at a point. I was having serious chronic neck and upper back pain and I spent about eight months of my life needing a massage just about every day, just to be able to do that just to be able to turn my head one day and a bit of either clarity or maybe even a bit of insanity. I thought of going and automating the industry. So we've launched a fully automated massage that's available on demand. You can go and get that massage any time you want at the push of a and you're in complete control of the treatment. So you get to make the decisions about where and how it works on your body and how well it's going to work and it's always going to remember you. So no matter which location of our tables you go to, it'll know your body, it'll know your preferences and it will always just get better. How are you thinking about the safety protocols in a machine like this? Yeah. So we think about it in a bunch of different ways. First off, going back to what I said before you're in control. So if the pressure is too high, pressure is too low at any moment, you can make a change that's on the control side. Then on, on the product side, we've spent the last seven years building this testing on over 5,000 people. Here, we have gone through multiple prototypes, multiple iterations of the software to get to a place where we now think we deliver a great experience for everyone when you were on the table and you had your massage today. How would you, how would you describe the motions you felt on your body? I mean, yeah, it did feel very dynamic and yeah, kind of you didn't even know the difference almost in a way which was interesting. It's a radically different experience than what it is before. Interesting. Yeah, we worked with orthopedic surgeons and therapists to create very clear specifications of what parts of the body can accept, what levels of pressure. And we make sure that all that makes its way into the massage protocols we generate and we notably give you the ability to make the immediate changes that are required outside of pressure. So if you want to stop, there's a pause button. If you, I want to stop. There's a big red button that will make the arm slide away from the table, the arms themselves really important point. They were especially designed not to be that strong. They're perfectly strong for a great massage and that's exactly what they're good at doing, but they're not any stronger and they don't have any ability to hurt you. Some skeptics might argue that an AI- powered massage misses sort of that human touch, emotion, or connection. So what would you say to that? I would say that our massage is designed for people who are looking for a great experience that they can be fully in control of market research we've done has shown a pool of 10 million Americans who would not get a massage from a massage therapist because they're just uncomfortable being in a room with another person or having to deal with somebody who is of another gender that they didn't particularly want for that for that massage. I think over time as people in general become more comfortable with automated services and solutions in their life, even those who loved treatments with therapists will enjoy what we do. But there's another way to think of this. There are 30,000 open positions for massage therapists in the US right now. So the challenge really is helping the industry fill in that gap. Our product is very distinct in that it allows you control over the experience, but it will also over time allow therapists to have control over the experience so they can start to incorporate it as a tool into their practice. So it's both a complement to existing treatments and an opportunity to experience something entirely different. Can you talk a little bit about the price point and where people can find this A I powered massage? So we're launching this initially in Equinox Gyms here in New York City with a planned roll out across the country in the coming months. Price to the consumer will be a starting price point of $60 for a 30 minute session, which we think is a great value. There were two arms applying equal force to the body simultaneously. Therapists when they work on, you will work on one side and walk around and work on the other. So we like to think we're doing twice the work in half the time and the 30 minute massage is equivalent to at least a 60 minute massage with the therapist. So with the initial launch in Equinox in New York, how many machines will be distributed across the city? There'll be 10 machines in the equinox locations. The hope is that we'll be shipping 600 tables in our first year of shipping and in terms of, you know, future expansion, where do you hope that people could sign up and get this service beyond a luxury gym? We're licensing these two hotels to gyms, to spas a, you'll find them in some multifamily dwellings. So condo buildings, apartment buildings, professional sports teams and collegiate teams and even some physical therapy and pain management clinics will have them as well. And sort of in terms of, you know, what you hope that this will become in six months and a year and five years from now, you know, where do you see it kind of in the larger space of wellness? I think the opportunity here really is to democratize more and more health services for consumers and really to bring the opportunity for people to better take care of themselves in ways that make sense in the scope of their lives at price points that are affordable. And we're going to continue to push along that line thinking bigger picture, you know, down the road, what do you think the future of AI and wellness is going to be? I think it's going to underpin just about everything in wellness A I in general right now is transforming diagnostic medicine on the prevention side. People in general are being a lot more thoughtful about taking care of themselves and recognizing that we are collectively living longer. The opportunity now is not just to improve our lifespan, but to improve, improve our health span the time in which we're healthy throughout the course of our life.\u003c/p\u003e","srtFormat":{"videoId":"b9b38829-a921-4532-90ef-48439c919e92","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"b9b38829-a921-4532-90ef-48439c919e92/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Hello, my name is Alexa mchale.

It's kind of this master system that sits underneath many of the other different components of our body. As I got older and I learned about the microbiome and I learned about the brain gut axis. The light bulb kind of went off for me that we need fiber, we need prebiotics and we need nutritional diversity and every human being alive needs those things. In the research. There's really strong ties between microbiome, health and digestion, microbiome, health and immune function, microbiome, health and neurotransmitter health or or mood stability. There's also a strong correlation between fiber and optimal blood sugar response. Historically, hunter gatherer tribes and indigenous communities, they would actually get somewhere between 100 and 200 g of fiber a day. Unfortunately, the average industrialized consumer and the average American maybe gets 10 to 15 g of fiber a day and gets up to 80 g of sugar a day. There's all sorts of barriers for folks around making conversions over to healthier choices. One of the biggest barriers being that all of the food and drinks that they grew up with. So they have like an E an emotional relationship with and that are really addicting and cheap are very, very present and easy to consume. And I think that we see the impacts of junk food on our country's health, right? According to the CDC, 40% of Americans have type two diabetes or prediabetes. 70% of Americans have chronic digestive distress. They're projected to be over a billion people with type two diabetes by 2050. That's not a great trajectory. And what we eat and drink can have a really substantial impact on our health. Lollipop is designed to actually meet that consumer need for something that tastes great and tastes like something that matches their expectations from a soda. Uh but also has empirically backed ingredient, nutritional strategies so that you can essentially have your soda and drink it to. There's a $300 billion health and wellness category and the vast majority of those brands don't do any independent research to figure out if their product is actually conferring benefit to their consumers. And while I'm sure there are are products that are still better than a traditional uh Coke or Pepsi, we have a real opportunity right now to, to not just be a little bit better but to actually be health contributing. And honestly, the health and wellness and consumer package goods sector in my view needs to migrate in that direction for the health and wellness of the American population.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709840391915,"updatedAt":1710270312536,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1710115200000,"duration":{"value":166,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"connect":false,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef","name":"The founder of Solidcore shares her fitness routine","slug":"the-founder-of-solidcore-shares-her-fitness-routine","shortDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","longDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","seoTitle":"The founder of Solidcore shares her fitness routine","seoDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","socialTitle":"The founder of Solidcore shares her fitness routine","socialDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","tags":[{"name":"fitness","type":"tag","label":"fitness"},{"name":"fortunewell","type":"tag","label":"fortunewell"},{"name":"health_and_wellness","type":"tag","label":"health and wellness"},{"name":"wellness","type":"tag","label":"wellness"},{"name":"ceo","type":"tag","label":"CEO"},{"name":"anne_mahlum","type":"tag","label":"Anne Mahlum"},{"name":"ann","type":"tag","label":"Ann"}],"categories":[{"name":"Fortune_Well","type":"category","label":"Fortune Well"},{"name":"Health","parentName":"Fortune_Well","label":"Health","type":"category"}],"section":{"name":"Health","type":"section","label":"Health"},"playlists":["Fortune Well"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Solidcore founder Anne Mahlum","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":3,"key":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/HLS/video-ver3_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":3,"key":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/SRT/captions-ver3.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Now that I'm 43. If you gave me the choice of, hey, Ann, your body can work the way that it wants for the rest of your life versus you can have your body to look however you want to for the rest of your life. But you're going to deteriorate. I would 100% choose option. A Hi, I'm Anne Mallam. I am the founder and former CEO of Salad Core. I'm also an investor and a start up advisor as well as a wanna be volleyball player and fitness and health and health, man. And longevity is a top priority for me. I wake up at six Monday through Friday and I frankly wake up between six and seven, you know, during the weekends, I try to keep my sleep schedule very consistent. So I wake up each morning and I drink water, take my vitamins and have a cup of coffee. And then I head to the gym where I do anywhere from a 20 to 30 minute treadmill workout where I'm altering the incline as well as the speed to try to get my speed up for the volleyball court. And then I am lifting heavy weights and doing core. So, I'm at the gym for about 90 minutes, 56 days a week. And I play volleyball 3 to 4 days a week. I am a morning workout person. Once I love it and enjoy it and it starts my day off on the right foot. When I go in the morning I go around seven. It's do not disturb on my phone. That, that is my hour and a half to me. Oh my God, I have such a healthier relationship with food. I honestly sometimes think back to how often I was thinking about food, what to eat, what not to eat when I can work out my body. And probably years of my life like it was all I thought about my whole identity was wrapped up like I am the girl who's never gonna love her body who's always gonna be trying to fix this thing, but we'll never fix it. So my relationship with food is honestly super healthy. Like last night, frankly, I had a burger and fries and it was no big deal. I know I'm not gonna eat that today and I usually eat the same thing Monday through Friday. I have the same breakfast. I have a smoothie after I work out and I have a non dairy yogurt bowl in the afternoon and then a reasonable dinner. The most important part of my health routine is the consistency doing something once a week isn't going to do anything like staying consistent in what you do. And that's why I'm really bullish on telling folks don't overwhelm yourself. My fiance likes to call it the button when you're like, I'm gonna work out every single day and then you miss a day and you're like it now, I messed up. So I'm just like, not gonna work out at all. That's setting yourself up to fail in a bad way. I stick to the things that I know I can commit to and I don't set myself up to fail.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709838284541,"updatedAt":1709920813956,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1709920813956,"duration":{"value":158,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"9d59d568-f674-4fe0-9151-35d9fde5fe7e","name":"4 tips from relationship experts","slug":"4-tips-from-relationship-experts","shortDescription":"What makes a long, healthy, and successful relationship?

I have not read your new book. Uh It's still on preorder and you didn't send me a review copy, but I need to sell books. But I'm looking at the table of contents here and there are a lot of chapters. But I know they're very short chapter 48 and 49 are called Bad Bosses and Good Bosses. Which chapter am I in? You know, you know, Alice Allen was a great boss. He hired me, he hired me when I was a young kid. Nobody else would have hired me to do that job. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, I wanna talk about the, the your second start up axios because you started it on. The concept was a simple two words, smart, brevity. And I think about that all the time because it really goes against the grain of journalistic culture. I mean, we're here at Mahal knows this. Well, we're here at Fortune which has had a hard time, the transition from a magazine to digital. We've done it now. But it took a long time. And that was partly because the reporters and writers here thought that the highest form of journalism was a 11,000 word magazine story. And the notion that you can be brief and, and feed people information that they need in a very smart way at the same time, uh may sound pretty straightforward to people, but it's not, it's not in our business at all. One of the things I taught myself to do is stop writing or thinking about journalism the way that I want it to be and start listening to the customer. And I was watching what was happening in terms of consumption with people in positions of power or just ordinary consumers. And I noticed that almost no one was reading anything and they were, they were hunting and pecking and they were often reading the first couple of paragraphs or they were gravitating towards newsletters instead of stories even when they were paying a premium to buy that product. And so by the time we started, we said, listen, like there is like there's an efficiency revolution. People want their information tighter. Uh But they also are going to need to know more across more topics. If they want to be really successful professionally, they need to, they're gonna have to understand technology and information consumption and politics and cultural trends. And so that's where the smart brevity came up with. We need really intelligent coverage on on important topics but delivered as efficiently as humanly possible. And we were pretty confident that that was gonna work almost instantly. It did like it, it, it, it instantly kind of just hit the sweet spot of where especially people who are in the professional class, who are consuming content. It just met the moment and I remember like knowing that we like we were on to something bigger than I realized in the first couple of months, I was getting hundreds of emails from readers saying thank you, you're saving me time. You're respecting my intelligence trying to make me smarter faster. I was like, damn, those are the exact same words we're using internally. I never communicated that externally. And it showed that we, we had product market fit and you know, that blossomed into, you know, a book on smart brevity. It blossomed into a company that we split off where we, we, we train companies to be able to communicate internally using smart brevity. And we now use A I to power that. And so like that, one kind of fundamental observation led to a lot of different kinds of enterprises which has been like really fun and and adventurous having worked with you 25 years ago. I'm not at all surprised that you went on to uh to found two successful media companies, but I am a little surprised to see you become a self help guru. Uh you know, and it's not just leadership. It's like life hacks, diets, meditation, what's going on there. Uh You're not the only one who's surprised. I'm kind of surprised by that. To be honest, it's, it started with, we were trying to figure out a way to work with our audience on things that weren't so heavy. So we started ending the night with this thing called Finish line where it's like something fun, something uplifting because you're doom scrolling all day. As part of that is, I started to write a couple of columns about lessons learned, being a, being a manager and having kept those notes and the response was just humbling. It was like overwhelming. It, it was clear people were interested in it. And so I just sort of kept going with that. And most of it is about how to get ahead of work, how to get ahead in your profession, how to be a better manager, how to be a better leader. But like the older I get, um, you know, Alan, you and I aren't spring chickens anymore, right? You start to think of a lot younger that surround it, right? That like I'm only really good as a CEO if I've got my crap together with my wife and my family and my, my health and my diet. So I, I have started to write a little bit more about that. I, you know, again, part of it is because like I'm a writer to your question. Earlier, the, you know, I have this weird spinal disorder where over time my spine is gonna turn into one, one fused brick. It's run in my family for generations. And so I've had to become maniacal about, about fitness. And so I've used that to be, you know, whatever, that kind of sucks. But here's the things that, like, I've been able to do that aren't medicinal that are able to, like, help, continue to be really healthy uh at my age. So I'll pass that along, seems to resonate. I pass a little bit more along. And so, yeah, that, that wasn't a twist that I expected and, and, and, you know, I didn't expect to write a book on all this stuff. But given that it does seem to be helpful to some people and like in, in all seriousness, like the high school college stuff, like having been such a bad student, having come from kind of just a normal small town in the Midwest. I part of writing the book is to hopefully get it to people that aren't in New York and Washington and to say, hey, listen, you could be wherever the hell you are going to a community college because of how awesome this country is. Like, you could go on to start companies or be a CEO or interview a president. Like if I could, I guarantee you, you're more impressive as an 18 year old than I was. And so like, it's possible and that's a, that's a big theme of the book. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the packs that, that have worked for you and just maintaining that, uh, wellness, I guess, and, and the kind of, um, you know, balance that you need to do your job as a CEO. Well, I mean, I think all this stuff is particular to your passions and your own habits and your own circumstance. But like, for me, I've realized like, listen, if I'm gonna run a company and I'm going to be the chairman of another technology company and I'm gonna try to write books. I can only do that if I'm performing optimally. And so like, for me personally, I created what my, my wife always rolls her eyes when I say this. But like my happiness matrix, which is I have this idea of, ok, I work best if like my relationship with my wife is good. My relationship with my kids is attentive. My relationship with my parents is strong. If I'm working out, I'm getting enough time to fly fish. If I'm spending enough time on my face and whenever I'm off, I know that if I, one of those buckets is off and so I'm constantly in my mind doing an inventory if I feel off. Like, oh man, I guess I haven't like, paid enough attention to the kids or I haven't paid enough attention to going off and golf or fly fish or whatever it is that gives me, uh, sanity. And so I think that more than anything has really helped. Uh, and then two is just who you surround yourself with. Like, we've all been at companies where you work with people who just suck the life out of you. And if there's one thing I'm most proud of about axios is at 550 people, we don't have any of those people. I've become really good at being able to sniff out even high achievers who are bad people and, and, and executing them, like getting them out of the company as quickly as possible. And it has this weird effect where like when your energy is all positive and you're dealing with smart people who are high achieving, but they're in it for the right reasons. It just has a psychic effect on you because you're not spending your time going like God, why was that person? A jerk or man, that person is a drag or I don't want to be anywhere near that person. And when you don't have that, I think the combination of those two things has helped me, like, really enjoy the work that I do. But I think be better at the work that I do.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1714509143852,"updatedAt":1714568693820,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1714521600000,"duration":{"value":497,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f","name":"These are the skills LinkedIn’s CEO thinks will be most valuable in an AI future","slug":"these-are-the-skills-linkedin’s-ceo-thinks-will-be-most-valuable-in-an-ai-future","shortDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","longDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","seoTitle":"These are the skills LinkedIn’s CEO thinks will be most valuable in an AI future","seoDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","socialTitle":"These are the skills LinkedIn’s CEO thinks will be most valuable in an AI future","socialDescription":"LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky shares his insights around the job market and talent shifts in a landscape increasingly—and rapidly—shaped by automation.","tags":[{"name":"linkedin","type":"tag","label":"LinkedIn"},{"name":"ai","type":"tag","label":"AI"},{"name":"automation","type":"tag","label":"automation"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"},{"name":"jobs","type":"tag","label":"jobs"},{"name":"future_jobs","type":"tag","label":"future jobs"},{"name":"jobs_market","type":"tag","label":"jobs market"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/b2f69973-6a38-4bca-a31c-e28a8b3fb63f/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

Um I'm two for two. I'm reframing both your questions now. So, thanks. Uh We're, we're so excited that that's, that's what the people we interview do all the time. We're really just props the questions we ask are your relative and when you reframe a question, it helps you provide the kind of answer you wanted to provide. So, yeah, go ahead. What do you have? Uh Do you have a question for my answer? Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, you know, there are lots of people who are worried that A I is gonna eliminate jobs, maybe their job. There are others who say, oh, it'll eliminate some jobs, but it'll create even more. And all of us are just speculating but you have the data. So what is your data show where, where are skills and jobs uh in less demand and what skills and uh are in more demand as we move into this profound technological change. It's really important for people to change the way you think about jobs jobs historically been thought about as a title. Um But fundamentally, if you can take a different view, which is jobs as a set of tasks, your job is a set of tasks. My job is a set of tasks. Everybody's job to be done is a set of tasks. And when you can start to really break down, every job is a set of tasks, you can then take the next step to understand where technology can help either augment uh or make certain tasks more efficient or certain tasks are going to be just completely automated. Then you start to realize that, oh, you know what, like if your job is just a set of tasks that is going to be automated, you need to start looking for a new job. So one of the things that we're doing across linkedin is taking every role in the world and doing a score of certain jobs as tasks and, and understanding that, hey, there's certain jobs like, you know, a lot of copywriting or translation type jobs where the majority of the task to do those jobs are tasks that can be automated. So, you know, it's important to start thinking about a new job. The majority of jobs though in the world are the types of jobs where you know AAA specific portion of those tasks will be automated and you need to learn how to leverage those tools to help in that part of your job. But still a lot of human skills are needed for uh for the majority of the job. Yeah. So give us some examples of skills that you think are going to be more valuable in the future because of what's happening now. First and foremost, it, it is really important to learn, learn, learn your way into using these A I tools. It's only going to help you in whatever job that you're doing to, you know, be able to leverage these tools to help you be more productive. My big bet is on people skills. Um you know, learning how to build people skills, communicating, um knowing what to do when your camera falls off of your computer during a podcast interview, which, which is just so our listeners know just happened to run and he did a total of glimpse right in the middle of the interview is gone. Yeah. Uh EQ communication, collaboration, creativity. That's a place where, um you know, I, I would be putting a lot of time and effort. Um if I was just entering the workforce or thinking about what the future might look like. And then I think that there's this concept which is for so long we've been taught or thought about the importance is to build for stability. And I think the future is more about building for agility instead of stability, uh being able to adapt, being able to, you know, take on something new the way I did my job last year is gonna be the way I'm gonna do my job this year. So I think a lot of that goes into what I would at least be thinking about right now entering the workforce, or at least I'm thinking about for myself transitioning, you know, through a leadership job that's always changing as well. So, what role do college degrees play in all of this? Are they important for different reasons? Because, um it's not just the skills that you accrue through a degree, maybe not just a four year degree. Um But, but it's also eq right, the last part is spot on, especially on the EQ side. And, you know, I'm not sure that outside of um being with a group of people doing work or being with people at a school, et cetera, there, there's been a real strong way to teach, um you know, a lot of people skills besides just kind of being in that environment. But I think it's an area of opportunity that, you know, society, we need to really figure out um in terms of, you know, college degrees in general, I think degrees are uh important in so far as they contain the set of skills that are really important and necessary um to be productive in society. Historically, recruiters would use degrees as you know, the the way to assess or find talent because we had no better view to do it. So for example, you, you see a lot of recruiters do things like, well, I just want to see candidates that, you know, went to Princeton, someone went to Princeton. They must be smart. Um, or they have, you know, you know, or, or previous company, this person used to work at Google, they must be smart as well. And when you only look at, I don't know the, the degree or the pedigree on its own as, as the post goes underneath it, two things happen. Number one, everyone's looking at the same group of talent because all the recruiters do the same search some people who, you know, used to work at Google and went to Princeton, like everyone's looking at this tiny group of people which does not create a very equitable or efficient labor market. Um And number two, it turns out that, you know, often times those degrees alone aren't signal enough for what needs to be, you know, done inside of the job. So we've been pushing a lot on, you know, skills are the currency, the actual skills that need to be done and it falls in line really well with this idea of the future about looking at jobs, set of tasks, as opposed to just the job title itself. I think across the board requiring require ourselves to go a level deeper in terms of what are the actual, you know, skills or tasks to be done instead of just relying on the, you know, the name of the degree alone. But, um, I really think you're on to something that with the EQ point and that's something we need to figure out.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1713972124339,"updatedAt":1713972613831,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713972613831,"duration":{"value":415,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a","name":"Why Chewy’s CEO leads with a Disney mindset: “You just feel like you're part of a dream world”","slug":"why-chewy’s-ceo-leads-with-a-disney-mindset:-“you-just-feel-like-you're-part-of-a-dream-world”","shortDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","longDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","seoTitle":"Why Chewy’s CEO leads with a Disney mindset: “You just feel like you're part of a dream world”","seoDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","socialTitle":"Why Chewy’s CEO leads with a Disney mindset: “You just feel like you're part of a dream world”","socialDescription":"Sumit Singh compares Chewy’s customer service to “the best hospitality resorts.”","tags":[{"name":"chewy","type":"tag","label":"Chewy"},{"name":"fortune_500","type":"tag","label":"Fortune 500"},{"name":"chewy_s","type":"tag","label":"Chewy’s"},{"name":"sumit_singh","type":"tag","label":"Sumit Singh"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"},{"name":"alan","type":"tag","label":"Alan"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Leadership Next","Heroes"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1e01778d-d833-4d05-9561-b5f1e687028a/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

Looking for content servicing pet, et cetera, et cetera. And we said, well, why should we only be stand for customers? Let's stand for partners. And what that tells you is from a business mindset. What it was saying was we should be a B to cab to B company, et cetera. So if you put that together, Alan, you not only get a mission and purpose that people can get behind, you get the strategy of the organization and at any point, you can look at that and say, well, where are you trending in fulfilling that, that, that this, this journey? And it's meant to be enduring. So, over the last six years, we've really built out our health vertical and so we're very proud of that. So we've connected food supplies and health. We've built out B to C services, B two B services for veterinarians. And so we're super proud and so we, and we've just entered Canada as our first International Forest. We all know Ecommerce is a tough business. Um Just tell us a little bit more about your philosophy, the underlying philosophy for customer service and customer loyalty. You know, I'm a product of consumer tech experience forward companies, Dell being one, you know, Amazon being the other. And so when I got to Chewy, right, I was like, well, great. It's just a customer service or customer care team. And this is the journey. Sometimes you as a leader need to observe and evolve to be able to truly assimilate through what is a gold nugget in the foundation or the growth of a company stage? And I looked at our customer care and I experienced it and as I experienced our customer care, you know, I did not think about any customer care organization. I thought about Disney, my experience when I walked through a Disney Park and how we feel in the way that, you know, you, you just feel like you're a part of a dream world, like being welcomed. I compared Chuy to the best hospitality resorts in the way that you are served in the way that you are treated in the way that you received and in the way that you're you're respected when you walk through the best hospitality resorts. So that's the mindset in the way that we approach customer service, right? So if I were to summarize this from a business point of view, I would say Chewy is uh you know, we are delivering the scale and convenience of e-commerce, but at the best personalized service or a high touch, personalized service, you should expect that the best local neighborhood pet store. Can you share the story real quick of um this incident? That kind of went viral where somebody is a customer's pet died and you send a message and tell the story. We have what we call surprise and delight uh moments uh where we want to be with the customer's life cycle or journey through the highs and lows of pet parenting. And this moment that you're referring is a low of pet parenting when somebody's pet passed away and when that happens, right. I we, we get to know we send flowers, right. We send, because at that moment, we are sympathetic, empathetic, we send flowers, we send greetings, handwrit cards. And you know, that moment is a very special moment because most companies will not invest, you know, X number of dollars to be able to pick up flowers to send to customers and be there right in that moment for them and posts like these. That's not the only thing we do. We send you handwrit birthday cards, we send you welcome cards. We will send you surprise and delight. We work with over 1000 local artists where we will send you hand drawn pet portraits which you cannot buy from us. They will show up to your doorstep, surprise and delight. And let me tell you this when you get a hand drawn pet portrait of your beloved pet. I have you for life on the customer service side for a company. That's so, you know, so much of your DNA and and your culture is around customer loyalty and it's really like high touch customer service. You're talking about handwrit notes, like not a lot of e-commerce companies do that. How do you look at the opportunities with some of these A I powered chat bots A I agents um help with customer service without diluting everything that you guys stand for. It is natural to assume that technology and personalization or technology and creativity are are conflicting with each other. And I think what we have to realize is that human beings are great at creativity, they always will be and technology is great, is great at delivering scale. And so you have to marry these up smartly, right? Our our local artists or our handwrit notes in a way that we assimilate through the language, right? Is, is a very personalized mechanism that we are seeking to keep. At the same time, I can automate all of the segmentation of customers, the targeting of customers, the identification of those cohorts. I can also automate how I pick up the right portrait when a customer uploads a pet profile and pass it on to my artist pretty digitally and pretty seamlessly. So I've essentially eliminated process waste without really taking out creativity from the system. I want to, we're, we're developing something called uh a tool like uh which is called CS R buddy. It is meant to be a friend to the customer service uh or the customer care team and what it's essentially AAA Prompter tool, it downloads, it has all information about the customer. It has a knowledge base which will marry content to, to let them have more intelligent conversations. We try not to hire from deeply ingrained CS contact centers because because we we, we, because we have to untrain them to get them to unlearn the bad habits of getting the customer off the phone. We want to pick up your phone in two rings or less. Right. And so we, we, we tell our agents just have a conversation.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1713365842731,"updatedAt":1713366065796,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713366065796,"duration":{"value":402,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302","name":"How AI can help solve housing supply challenges—and do it sustainably","slug":"how-ai-can-help-solve-housing-supply-challenges—and-do-it-sustainably","shortDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","longDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","seoTitle":"How AI can help solve housing supply challenges—and do it sustainably","seoDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","socialTitle":"How AI can help solve housing supply challenges—and do it sustainably","socialDescription":"Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explains that in order to build 96,000 affordable homes by 2030, we need to leverage industrial processes powered by artificial intelligence.","tags":[{"name":"leadership_next","type":"tag","label":"Leadership Next"},{"name":"ai","type":"tag","label":"AI"},{"name":"andrew_anagnost","type":"tag","label":"Andrew Anagnost"},{"name":"autodesk","type":"tag","label":"Autodesk"},{"name":"factory_os","type":"tag","label":"Factory Os"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"},{"name":"mia","type":"tag","label":"Mia"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Leadership Next","Heroes"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/ecb5d414-51c5-4ba2-bc35-19f972bca302/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

All right. Ok. That's very California. It's a material that stores carbon. All right, it's very durable and can actually be shaped into anything you want it to be rather than using a plastic facade or something like that. It's actually a wonderful material. And can you eat it? I wouldn't recommend it. Ok. It's an industrial fungus. We've been doing these for a long time. I do not believe I've ever heard those two words put, put together before industrial fungus. So I'm gonna have to think about that one for a long time. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, a lot of what your product is used for is very creative, right? From designing buildings to special effects like you said. Yeah, totally. So, so on that on that front, you know, how far can this go? And what do you see on the creative side, the design side, what's the role of, you know, 10, 20 years out? What are humans still doing? How are, how are we still in the picture? Yeah. So we, we see a very collaborative future between A I and the human user. We do not, we do not see an adversarial relationship here. Does the A I ultimately put fewer people on each project. I guarantee you there will be fewer people on each project that builds or make something in the world in the future, but we'll be able to do more projects. And I think that matters over the next 20 years, you look to the future, the world is gonna be somewhere between eight and 10 billion people depending on which, which estimate you take right now. If, if you look at that, we're gonna be adding anywhere between 35 and 45 Tokyo's to the world every year between now and then. OK, that, that's a lot of new people, that's a lot of new infrastructure. So fundamentally, the industries we serve have a massive capacity problem and that capacity problems connected to. There's not enough money people or material to make and remake everything that needs to be made and remade without either destroying the planet or not being able to make it at all. Because you, you just can't have the capacity So we're very much focused on that capacity problem. And I'm gonna just share this stat from, from auto desk from you guys. Um that says that by 2030 96,000 new affordable homes must be built every day. So I'm curious actually on a more global level, what that looks like and tell us a little bit more about just the role that you think auto desk can play here that you're getting to the concept of why it's so important to apply industrial processes, these things. Because right now, if we try to make all those buildings with the current wasteful processes, we're, we're going to do some pretty damaging things with all of that housing required and one it, it's going to be expensive as well. Now, by the way, just to be perfectly clear, the cost of building a business isn't all that goes into making a particular housing project expensive. There are other things that come in there. However, the cost of building something is a big driver. So when you have to drive down the cost and you have to minimize the amount of material used because there's just not enough material to build all these things in a sustainable way. So if we can help people make repeatable choices that don't make the building ugly because this is the tension between the architecture profession and, and some of the things that we want to do with design technology is the goal is not to standardize everything and make it look like the same thing over and over again. Heaven forbid the goal is to help people minimize what they're doing and make choices that actually minimize the amount of material or the type of material in, in really interesting ways and drive down the cost per unit. You did an interesting interview with our fortune colleague, Diane Brady. Uh last year, she was working at a, at a different f publication at the time. But uh one of the things you said, really caught my attention, you said that that governments have a tendency to swing hard left or hard, right? And you're worried that they may try and slam the nail on A I and let other parts of the world run off with the innovation. Uh How do you think we're doing on that front? I, I think we're doing absolutely nothing. OK. Uh You know, and this is a, this is a problem here. OK? Because, you know, I'm not anti regulation. I think we need some regulation. We need rational regulation. Europe tends to overregulate the US, tends to under regulate when Miha and I talked, I, I told her that I thought the advertising model was one of the worst things that ever happened to tech. And there was a real reason why I said that and it's important as we think about A I when the advertising model started to create these tech giants and bigger isn't always better. Let's be very clear here. Just because something creates a huge tech company doesn't necessarily mean it's awesome. Ok, when the ads model took over, it created a disconnected for a long time, hadn't existed, it separated the needs of the end user from the needs of the customer. Most tech had been directly focused on the needs of the end users for its entire history. Then all of a sudden the customer was now the advertiser, not the end user. So here we are, we're heading into the world of A I. We already have this disconnect between the human using the technology and the person who is uh who is being uh the source of income for the technology. And now we're gonna lay our A I on and A IA I can either be a force for enhancing humanity or can be disconnected from the goals of humanity. I'm very nervous in the structure we have around certain large tech companies right now that there's going to be an increasing disal between the human centered needs and the the needs of the people that are funding the machine.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1712757466056,"updatedAt":1712759976301,"irisTag":"technology","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1712707200000,"duration":{"value":383,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6","name":"Aflac CEO Dan Amos explains why he bet the company on a duck","slug":"aflac-ceo-dan-amos-explains-why-he-bet-the-company-on-a-duck","shortDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","longDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","seoTitle":"Aflac CEO Dan Amos explains why he bet the company on a duck","seoDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","socialTitle":"Aflac CEO Dan Amos explains why he bet the company on a duck","socialDescription":"The Aflac duck doesn’t have a salary but is \"king of the place,\" Amos says.","tags":[{"name":"aflac","type":"tag","label":"Aflac"},{"name":"fortune_500","type":"tag","label":"Fortune 500"},{"name":"insurance","type":"tag","label":"Insurance"},{"name":"warren_buffett","type":"tag","label":"Warren Buffett"}],"categories":[{"name":"Series","type":"category","label":"Series"},{"name":"Magazine_Videos","parentName":"Series","label":"Magazine Videos","type":"category"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Fortune Magazine Features"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photograph by Kendrick Brinson for Fortune","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"0f720c2f-6276-45a0-aaf5-3e93ea8f4af6/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Much too much.

You know, I guess I never thought of. I'm going to be a CEO if I'm honest, I always, even from a young age, thought I would be leading something. I didn't know what. Yeah, I think II I tell, you know, I tell this funny story. I um it's a bit embarrassing but at six years old, I had an attache case as, as my bag. So I think, I think that says it all. Welcome to leadership next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, we are a B to B company so we don't deal directly with the consumer. So right there, the consumer directly does not know us. Uh we deal with our lenders and they deal with the consumer so that by definition is always an issue. Um but most consumers don't understand that the lender who probably originated that mortgage is not the one who continues to own that mortgage. It's probably not the one who is servicing the mortgage. Um I think what we are trying to do is build that awareness through our home education programs. More and more we are filling that void for the consumer and we're leading into our mission and our charter, I mean, our duty to serve is to make the housing system more fair, more equitable. And I think the consumers are starting to become aware that something is changing. So for example, when I think about our strategy today, first of all, number one job is liquidity in the market and the pandemic is just a great example of why that is so important. But our two strategic objectives are how do we make the housing system more fair and more sustainable? And we look at everyone from renters to home buyers, to homeowners and it's about sustainable whatever you might have a renter or a homeowner. And uh we are making it more fair by using technology. So for example, before, if you were a renter in this country, your rent did not count today through technology. Fannie Mae is taking that at risk. And if we, if the consumer shows it through their bank statements, we can tell what probably is a rent payment, the regularity of that payment and we could make that consumer eligible. So it's huge and that's you can qualify people instead of a credit score, qualify them on a rent that did not exist two years ago. And it's something Fannie may led the charge. We started with renters, we went to our landlord partners and said, we're willing to pay for it because what are the tests that the concept? And today, I'm happy to say over 500,000 rental units are reporting their rent payments. Um On the home ownership side, we have qualified for 5000. Now, homeowners that did not have cio scores, those that didn't have a FICO score, have one today and those that did have seen an increase of like 38 points that's quite meaningful. So, you know, one thing we've learned is that housing payment is a housing payment, whether it rental payment or principal and interest payment and we're making that count. So it's those types of innovation that I'm hopeful. Job number one for a CEO is to make sure your story is told and people understand that and I am very committed to doing that. You are the only Latina CEO on the Fortune 500. So tell us more about your background and how it informs your leadership today at Fanny Mae. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'm I'm the only but I I'm so I'm so um it won't be for long because again, the Latino cohort is and women also, but the Latino cohort is having a lot of gains educationally and otherwise. So as I mentioned, I grew up in, in Brooklyn, my family there. I am Puerto Rican. My parents came to the mainland in the 19 fifties, like many Puerto Rican, the Puerto Rican diaspora for a better life. And I grew up in a very optimistic household and, and at my kitchen table, I heard like probably many American families do today, talked about a good job. Education was like, you know, that's why neither of my parents at the time had gone to college. So an education and saving for a home. And I still remember when I was five years old, um they bought their first home. I still remember the first night I slept in my room and I think that's informed a lot of what I do. You must have had moments along the way, coming up through Wall Street where you were sitting in a room surrounded by a bunch of guys and where you said to yourself, this system is never gonna allow me to get to the top. That's, that's not true. And, you know, it's the kind of thing where again, um look, I um in 19 nineties, there were very few women um in finance and law and banking and I, I never saw that as a, as an obstacle. You know, if anything, I was in the room, I worked so darn hard. I was really trying to figure out the man woman thing. I just did my job and did it well and did project finance for the 1st 10 years. And then I went to J PM. I, I ran a state housing finance agency for three years then went to JP Morgan had an incredible career there.

We used to call this era of breeding as selecting the best over the last few years, we have transitioned into designing the best we are using machine learning to predict what kind of a genome or what kind of a seed variety will give us the characteristics that we care about in the environment. They are going to be grown. My name is Fanny Chali and I lead the data sciences within the plant breeding organization at Bayer. We focus on developing new seed varieties for our raw crops as well as vegetable crops. What we are trying to do is continue to advance the grades that we care about the most historically, that can be a very cumbersome process and depend on your luck to find the ones that you want to advance. But with A I, you can get very targeted and you can get very specific from very early on in the process. So that will save you both the resources and then it will also increase the probability of finding the trait that you care about. We are just trying to make sure that we are collecting as much data across all of those different variables. We use the genomic information of the seed varieties and we apply a machine learning model to predict what their performance in the field would look like. So instead of testing these varieties in the feed, you are testing them by predicting what this means from a grower perspective. Ultimately, is they can get the seed varieties that they care about one year in advance. What it means from a payer perspective is we are able to run this operation efficiently because we haven't used one year of field testing. Uh and the resources corresponding to that. And if you think about it from a planet perspective, I think we have been using this approach for about 10 years now and in this 10 years, uh we have replaced close to 20,000 acres of seed testing just in North America. So not having to run a feed plan and being able to use predicted information to advance material in a breeding pipeline can lead to resource savings across these different aspects. Whether it is land, water, nitrogen or even crop protection. If you look at our population, the numbers are increasing by 2050 we are looking at close to 10 billion people globally. The arable land is decreasing in order to meet this demand and do it in a way that is sustainable. We need to continue to discover new seed products that help us mitigate this challenge and that's what plant reading is about.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709753928188,"updatedAt":1709821814085,"irisTag":"technology","sponsorTag":"making-business-better","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1709769600000,"duration":{"value":182,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82","name":"This CEO is so passionate about solving energy transition he hasn’t taken a vacation in 20 years","slug":"this-ceo-is-so-passionate-about-solving-energy-transition-he-hasn’t-taken-a-vacation-in-20-years","longDescription":"“If hydrogen is the only solution and we are the largest hydrogen company, it is our responsibility to do that,” Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi said on Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast.","seoTitle":"This CEO is so passionate about solving energy transition he hasn’t taken a vacation in 20 years","socialTitle":"This CEO is so passionate about solving energy transition he hasn’t taken a vacation in 20 years","socialDescription":"“If hydrogen is the only solution and we are the largest hydrogen company, it is our responsibility to do that,” Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi said on Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast.","tags":[{"name":"hydrogen","type":"tag","label":"Hydrogen"},{"name":"clean_energy","type":"tag","label":"Clean Energy"},{"name":"net_zero","type":"tag","label":"net zero"},{"name":"air_products","type":"tag","label":"Air Products"},{"name":"seifi_ghasemi","type":"tag","label":"Seifi Ghasemi"},{"name":"ii","type":"tag","label":"II"},{"name":"alan_murray","type":"tag","label":"Alan Murray"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/116f1fdd-1124-4d62-9778-bff81fe90f82/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune.

Oh, jeez, I'd like to stop and go play golf for uh go fishing or, I mean, you seem very driven and there's a lot of time ahead of you on this uh uh uh on this Hydrogen challenge, you're gonna keep at it. I'm absolutely going to keep at it and I'll have no issue disclosing my age by September. I will be 80 young to be president. I love what I'm doing. I do not have an any other hobbies. I really work seven days a week and vacation. The last time I took a vacation, I was for our 35th anniversary, which was in 2004. II. I love, I really love what I'm doing. And believe me, I have more energy and I travel more and I work harder than when I was 40 years old. So I am amazed and impressed, but I do kind of want you to take a vacation at this point. I hope my wife is not listening to this podcast. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm mia Air products was founded in 1940. So we are about 84 years old and uh our founding father, what he did was that in 1940 he went to the steel companies and said that, look, you are using a lot of oxygen rather than making oxygen yourself. I have a new invention with the oxygen compressor. I can come and invest, make oxygen for you and sell it to you over the fence just like as if you are buying electricity over the fence and people like that, and that is how our business got started. Then in the late 19 fifties, when the Russians sent their sputnik up into the air, the US government decided that, well, we need to have a serious space program and in order to have that you needed liquid hydrogen to put these rockets in there. So they commissioned their products and we were the first company to come up with liquid hydrogen. We developed the technology. So it's now more than 64 years that we are producing hydrogen. So our business is atmospheric gasses, then hydrogen, which is now a significant part of our business. And we are by far the largest producer of hydrogen. A lot of people think hydrogen uh may be part of the answer to our energy problem, the energy transition. I know you've made big investments in this area. Uh How quickly do you think they're gonna pay off? How close are we to having hydrogen products? That can replace the fossil fuels we're using now. Well, uh obviously, the speed that they, that they move forward depends on the customers deciding when they want to convert. But if the world wants to move to taking action to reduce global warming, there is no other option but hydrogen, hydrogen has always been and will always be our only source of energy. There is no other source of energy right now, we produce a lot of hydrogen but the CO2 goes into the air. So you either need to use hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen and capture the CO2 and sequester it or you need to make green hydrogen, which is use electricity to break down water to make green hydrogen. Right now, we are executing significant projects both in green and blue. How quickly before green hydrogen is a competitive uh energy source for uh the global economy. Well, when you say competitive, if uh you have to use it, then it is it, it is, it is not the the transition, it is not an economic transition. This is not as if you are going to go from wood to coal and you say, or coal to oil and you say it's cheaper that either the world has to do something about the CO2 that they put into the air. And it is a requirement that you cannot put CO2 or if you put CO2, there is a significant tax that is what is going to drive this thing because you cannot sit back and say I want clean hydrogen which competes with dirty hydrogen or dirty fuel. It's just not going to happen. So you have to have a mechanism to justify the additional cost because of the benefit which is by a mechanism, you need subsidies or taxes. Basically. No, we are not going to go to a low carbon board. If you do not have the support of the governments to encourage using it, it's not going to happen by itself. You've been very aggressive about this. You've pushed far further than the market wants you to push uh how much is it within the control of companies to push this energy transition forward? 100% a company like us, we had, I mean, it's not easy to go and convince your board that I'm going to invest $8.5 billion in Saudi Arabia and I don't have any customers. So we discuss these things very openly. And the fundamental thing is if we turn out to be right, that is then they are the leader and being and they will make a lot of money, maybe not next year, but 10 years from now. Well, absolutely. And the best example of it is I was involved in these discussions 20 years ago about electric cars because my company was making lithium for electric cars, previous company, previous company. And every time I talk to investors at that time, you know, electric cars. That's the dream. And they would go and talk to Mercedes and GM who were telling them that is. And besides that, if electric cars are going to happen, it's four wheels and a motor, we can do it better than somebody else. Now, we are 24 years later and we have a company with a market cap of 500 billion. And those people who say it's not going to happen have a market cap of 50 billion. And by being the first mover, they have developed the brand and all of that. So we think that in business, if you never take a risk, you never do anything. So you have to make a judgment, you have to have it what you watch call and then put your resources and make it happen.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709743757046,"updatedAt":1709748864086,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1709748856845,"duration":{"value":422,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f","name":"Why Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods doesn’t believe we can get to net zero by 2050","slug":"why-exxon-mobil-ceo-darren-woods-doesn’t-believe-we-can-get-to-net-zero-by-2050","shortDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve its decarbonization goals.","longDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve its decarbonization goals.","seoTitle":"Why Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods doesn’t believe we can get to net zero by 2050","seoDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve its decarbonization goals.","socialTitle":"Why Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods doesn’t believe we can get to net zero by 2050","socialDescription":"While Exxon Mobil is investing in low-carbon solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, CEO Darren Woods is not yet convinced the world as a whole has what it takes to achieve decarbonization goals.","tags":[{"name":"exxon_mobil","type":"tag","label":"Exxon Mobil"},{"name":"exxonmobil","type":"tag","label":"ExxonMobil"},{"name":"exxon","type":"tag","label":"exxon"},{"name":"net_zero","type":"tag","label":"net zero"},{"name":"climate_change","type":"tag","label":"Climate Change"},{"name":"carbon_capture","type":"tag","label":"Carbon Capture"},{"name":"darren_woods","type":"tag","label":"Darren Woods"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune - Photo provided by Exxon Mobil.","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"6dc5c3fa-da8f-4001-92fc-834ee7476d9f/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"People don't fully appreciate the scale of the industry that we're in today. And so I think, you know, the recognition back to your question a about how long will it take? You gotta come back to the size of the existing energy system today. It is big. It will take time to replace. But my point is we got to get started on it. But I would say, you know, I can't believe you, you voluntarily went back to Allen's question, your job. I'm a glutton for what can I say? Welcome to leadership next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia Darren Woods. Thanks so much for joining us. Sorry, you couldn't be here in person. Uh We were hoping to do this in person but the snow got in the way. It's good to be with you all. I appreciate you accommodating the, the weather. Yeah, the, the, the snow was here, by the way, not there in Texas. That's right. Look, I, I want to start by asking you the big question, the kind of meta question there are a lot of people out there who believe that that an oil company like Exxonmobil making hundreds of billions of dollars off of selling oil and gas. And a CEO like yourself who's making tens of millions off of that business can't possibly be serious about addressing climate change. Tell me why they're wrong. Sure. I would start with the premise that we're an oil company. I think, you know, as I've taken this job and focused on what's made us successful over the 140 years that we've been in business, it's come down to our ability uh to take technology and develop products that meet society's needs. So at our heart, we're a technology company, maybe a little different than some of the technology companies are out there today and that we basically focus our technology on transforming molecules and they happen to be hydrogen and carbon molecules. And so while uh today, a large part of that, uh that technology goes to making products that are combusted, we also have one of the largest chemical businesses in the world that makes a variety of products that go into uh into society that basically supports modern living. And so our view is our job is to basically take our capabilities in this space and address the needs of society and as those needs evolve. So do our business. I mean, one point I always make Allen is if you go back to the beginnings of our company, we started basically making kerosene to replace whale oil for lamps, electricity came along. Uh Ford Motor came along, started building cars, we started making gasoline. Uh during the war, we started making beetle rubber. And so as the needs of society have evolved, so has our company and they all come back to our ability to, to manage these molecules, these hydrogen carbon molecules. And so as we look at the transition and the next wave of things that society needs, which is a lower emissions uh world that to decarbonize the, the, the society that we have today. The question that we've asked ourselves is how can we bring our capabilities and skills to bear on solving that problem? And I'm pleased that, yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry, I was gonna say I I'm today, you know, if you go back a little bit in time, the only answer was when solar and EVs which clearly have a role to play and are necessary, but they're not sufficient. One of the things I've been pleased with uh with the Biden administration is the recognition that there's a broader set of solutions needed, a set of solutions that involve the molecule side of the equation as well as the electron side of the equation. Since we're in the molecule business that opens the door for us in carbon capture and storage, uh biofuels hydrogen, a number of opportunities in that space which we now can contribute to as that need grows. And as the markets develop, we, we want to talk about all those things. Today, we want to talk about hydrogen biofuels, what you're doing in lithium, what you're doing in carbon capture. But I do think part of the reason that people are a little skeptical or a lot skeptical about this conversation is because of, of the history that your company has before your, your time as CEO obviously. But the history your company has in climate denial, misinformation. I'm, I'm, I'm old enough to remember Herb Schmertz uh and the, the information campaigns that uh that he ran h how do you address that? History? Well, I think we've been very focused on going forward and what are the opportunities for us to contribute in that space? I think some of the perception out there, we could spend a lot of time debating and arguing that was 3030 years ago. I mean, today the world has moved on, the, the understanding of this challenge has moved on. And I think for where, where we are today is how can we contribute to a solution set, not debate the past. And that's basically what we're trying to do is leverage our capabilities and solve for what society needs. It's no different than what we've done for the last 140 years. We're leveraging the same core competencies, same core capabilities and figuring out how we can use those to advance products that society needs. And frankly, I think today our strategy is pretty robust to whatever the future holds. However quickly the world transitions, our company's position basically contribute. So like a lot of other companies, of course, um you've committed to net zero within a certain time frame, you have a shareholder group that is pushing you to do more, to move faster um to cut greenhouse gasses. Can you talk a little bit about what you are doing and also why you feel why you're pushing back against this particular shareholder group? Sure, I I would just start in terms of our push back to the shareholder. Has nothing to do with the environment or ESG that's not the basis of our uh dispute with that shareholder. But I'll come back to that in a minute. Frankly, what we've looked at is again, with this view, we recognize the challenges associated with, with climate change. We recognize the need to decarbonize and reduce emissions and we're very focused on doing it. If you look at the progress that we've made and what we share in our, in our proxy every year is the progress that we're making with respect to reducing our own emissions. Our scope one and scope two emissions, we've committed to decarbonize to get to net zero in our permanent operation where we're rapidly growing production to demonstrate that in a world of uh growing production that you can reduce your own emissions. And we've got a net zero commitment, a plan to 20 by 2030 to get to Net zero. As you know, we've announced an acquisition of uh pioneer and we've committed to bring their Net zero pledge in 2050 forward to a net zero plan by 2035 we have significantly reduced our methane emissions. Uh We're basically working around the world to reduce our own emissions and then we're providing products to help uh third parties reduce their emissions. So we're starting a carbon capture and storage business. We have three commercial contracts with hard to carbonized sectors. A steel company, an industrial gas company and uh ammonia production company. Now we'll capture 5 million tons per annum of their CO2. That is the equivalent of all the EV sold in the US to date the impact of that reduction on just three deals that we've done. We've acquired Denbury, which is the largest uh CO2 pipeline in the US to act as the spine to allow us to capture more CO2. And so uh making significant progress there, we're building a biofuels plant up in Canada. Uh We've got plans and are developing the world's largest low carbon hydrogen plant that plant alone would basically meet 10% of the Biden administration's low carbon hydrogen ambition. Uh We got plans on when we're working through on that, that will produce low carbon hydrogen and ammonia to help third parties back out their emissions. And as you pointed out, we've got a lithium business again, tapping into our capabilities to understand the subsurface drill uh extract uh liquids. In this case, water extract a lithium from the water and reinject that uh water. It's a lower cost of production for lithium than that exists out there today. And it's a much, much lower uh environmental footprint uh than the current methods. And so we can have a domestic US supplied lithium source to go into this electrification effort. Uh That is more environmentally friendly and more cost effective. And so a number of things that we're pursuing and as the markets develop, we are in a position to continue to lean into that and to bring our capabilities and skills to bear. Yeah, I just want to ask you about that as the markets develop, sorry to interrupt. But, but, but that's an interesting point. I mean, the question is, you know how much of this investment in alternatives is enough? Some people will argue that the European oil companies invest a larger share of their total investment dollars in in renewables than Exxon Mobil does. I mean, how, how do you decide what the right amount of effort is to drive this transition? I think that's a hollow argument. I think the first thing I would point to when you look at the levels of investment is you, you're comparing investments in wind and solar, which are technologies going into an established market with an established demand and an established pricing structure uh that's regulated and people get returns And so our view is we don't bring any real capabilities to that space. Those are, that's the electron solution that I mentioned. We don't bring capabilities other than a checkbook. And so we don't see the ability to generate a above average returns for our investors. And so we, while we recognize the need for that, we don't think it's an appropriate use of Exxonmobil's uh capabilities. We're focused on areas where there aren't solutions where we're going to decarbonize, help decarbonize harder to carbonize industries where today they don't have readily available solutions that wind and solar won't be effective at meeting their needs. So we're, we're basically concentrating our effort in that space. We're starting businesses from scratch. So I think when you look at the investment level, you have to look at it in the context of what is the opportunity set that you're investing in. We're building businesses from brand new. It's going to take time to get those businesses up and going. But somebody needs to do that. And so I think that the comparison of what we're investing in uh businesses that don't exist today versus people who are investing in businesses and sectors that do exist is a false comparison. Likewise, it's false comparison to say we're going to look at the oil and gas industry, which is an enormous industry with enormous demand and look at what you're spending in that space versus what you're spending in an area where there's basically nothing exists today. Again, a false comparison with time. If the market develops and grows and and replaces traditional energy system, my expectation is our investment will be just as big there. But we're at a much earlier part of the development curve in that space. And that is reflective of the investments we're making. I just give you one fact Allen, if you look at what we are spending in reducing emissions, it's the equivalent on an annual basis of one third of what the EU sepa spends to manage the uh environment for the whole of the US. I mean, that's a substantial amount of money for a company going into a sector in a bus, a value chain of business that doesn't exist today. And Darren, just to, I go back real quick to the shareholder question. I know you wanted to address that. Can you explain a little bit of you said push back is not because of the efforts and the plans to, to cut greenhouse gasses, but I what's going on? So make maybe just a little bit of context for that. You know, over the last 10 years, we've had 100 and 40 shareholder proposals submitted about half of those are from activist investors or activist shareholders. And I would make the distinction between the activists versus investors in our company and the difference. The key difference is the activists don't have an economic interest in the outcomes uh that they're proposing or in the uh returns that the company generates. Uh of that uh half of those uh proposals that have been submitted, roughly half of those have been submitted by just three activist groups. And so uh these individuals, while we talk about, we are, we are, I would tell you as a company very, very focused on shareholder rights. In fact, we like small shareholders. We've prided ourselves on the fact that our company has a very large base of small shareholders and we work really hard to keep them engaged and to bring them to the table and to exercise their rights and to, and to voice their concerns and their and their views. Uh We have a uh extensive outreach program. We try to bring them into the annual meeting so that I would say that we recognize the importance of the shareholders voice and wanna cater to the shareholders who are real investors who have an interest in seeing this company successful in generating return on their investments. We feel feel a huge responsibility to that. We don't feel a responsibility for activists that hijack that process, a legitimate process and frankly abuse it to, to uh advance an ideology that's inconsistent with the well being of the company. And I would tell you in this case for our June of capital and follow this. First of all, both of those proponents have publicly expressed the desire to basically diminish Exxonmobil's business and to stop the production of oil and gas. That's contrary to the, the benefit of most of our shareholders. Um They have um submitted this proposal in the past. This is the third time it was submitted last year when it was submitted, it got just over 10% of the vote under sec rules that that proposal should be, that proposal should be um excluded if it doesn't have, didn't have 15% of the vote. But the S ECs interpretation of that has led to uh basically allowing these proposals to come in time and time again. So the shareholders have reviewed that and have spoken on that topic and their scope three target, their, their proposal ask us to reduce SCOPE three, which is essentially the emissions of our customers and the way that we would have to do that is to reduce the sales of oil and gas. Uh So that's getting right into the heart of what we're doing. And our, the uh follow, this has been very clear that their objective is to get us to stop selling oil and gas. Uh That's basically what we do as a business. And so you've got a proponent getting right into the heart of the business sec rules should exclude that as well as ordinary business. And it is micromanaging. And so we're taking issue with the fact that the sec its interpretation of the current regulation is allowing this to abuse and we're looking for relief from that abuse, which we think is actually in the best interest of all of our shareholders and, and, and by the way, the best interests of society, I mean, stop oil and gas is not, not gonna be good for the world at this point in history. You're absolutely right. If you think about what we sell, we sell LNG, every ton of LNG we sell, basically backs out of coal, uh coal burning somewhere in the world. Typically, we're sending our LNG out to, to uh uh Asia. And so, you know, today there is an advantage to the products that we sell and, and by the way, the money that we're using there and the capabilities that we've built doing that we're now using for the transition. And so I think it's, you know, you, you don't want to force you, they're working a supply issue when the problem is in the demand side of the equation. And we're trying to balance the two, be the most responsible operator. So that as long as the world needs these products, you've got a company that you can rely on to do it, environment as environmentally friendly as possible as we continue to work for opportunities to diversify and decarbonize Mahal. I just wanna quickly follow up on that though. So you're saying that follow this and Arjuna are very different than say Engine One. I mean, Engine One was referred to as an activist when they came after your board. Yeah, I think again, this is, that's completely, that's, that's another I'd say kettle of fish, so to speak. Uh Engine number one basically was out to make a name for itself. Uh It did not have a specific agenda uh for Exxonmobil and to change at Exxonmobil other than to bring new directors onto the board, I would point out Alan if you look at Engine number One, while they were successful at bringing uh three directors onto the board, and those three directors came in without an an an engine one agenda, but more of an agenda to make sure that the company could be as successful as possible as we spent the year that they came in getting them briefed up on our strategy. Uh The basis of our strategy, why we were making the decisions that we were making when it came time to approve our plan that year in November, all three of those activist investors endorsed our plan 100%. And as we reviewed the strategy and rolled our strategy out that was endorsed. And so I would tell you maybe contrary to the, the perception out there, bringing those investors, those board members on that were keenly focused on making sure Exxonmobil was doing all it could to be successful and having them conclude that yeah, we were and that the plans that we had in place and the strategy we had developed was exactly doing it basically strengthened our board and their resolve for us to continue down the path that we were on. And so it's been a, a benefit to the company, maybe contrary to, to reinforce the path that we are on, contrary to maybe what many people thought out there. And we should note, um I think some of these same groups are also um you know, pushing for similar things uh at other companies. It is not Exxon Mobile specific. Um It's also at Shell and, and, and uh let, let me ask you a question that, that draws on your technical expertise and your analysis. Uh because you're now heavily invested in all sides of this transition. You see what's happening in hydrogen, you've made this big investment in carbon capture and storage. Uh You're now an investor in lithium. So you're part of the uh electrical economy. How long is this going to take? What is 2050 anywhere near a realistic goal? And if it's not 2050 when is it going to happen, what does your analysis show? So I'll start with the end and, and work my way forward with your question. And frankly, I don't know when the end is gonna come. I think 2050 from what you see today, what's being done today, the infrastructure investments that are being made. We're not on the path to 2050. I think most objective analysis would tell you that uh we've waited too long to open the aperture on the solution sets in terms of what we need as a society to start reducing emissions. And we're not investing nearly enough in the technology. Today's technology will not solve this problem. Uh And the reason is uh there's a cost issue here and if you look at the the solutions being offered, the the you know, the dirty secret that nobody talks about is how much is all this going to cost and who's willing to pay for it. And if you look at the policies that are being put out the way the governments are advancing this, the cost is very implicit, it's not an explicit cost. Now, we have, we have tabled proposals with the US, governments and governments around the world that there are mechanisms to get out there and start down this path using existing technology. But you need to make the cost transparent and the people who are generating the emissions need to be aware of and pay the price for that for generating those emissions. That's ultimately how you solve the problem. The issue today is it's too expensive. People can't afford it and they know governments around the world rightly know that their constituents. We'll have real concerns with that. And so we've gotta find a way to get the cost down to, to grow the utility of the solution set and make it more available and more affordable so that you can begin this transition. And so today, I would tell you, uh, we're not on that path. Uh, the policies that are being put in place aren't aggressive enough and don't incentivize the right kind of actions to, to be successful here. But if not 2050 win. I mean, what do you, what path are we on? Where? Tell me Allen, when, when is, when are people going to be willing to pay for a carbon reduction? Because today we have opportunities to make fuels with lower carbon in it. But people aren't willing to spend the money to do that. There are businesses aren't willing to spend it a week today. Make sustainable aviation fuel for the airline business, but the airline companies can't afford to pay for what it will cost to make sustainable aviation fuel. And so the challenge, when will they, when will it be economic? Are you saying never? This is the issue. This is, I think this is the value of the IRA which is you gotta start down, you gotta start with something you have to catalyze the work catalyze the investment, get started on the technology curve to see if you can uh innovate if all the technology and get the cost down. And I can't predict if we'll be successful in that space or not. What I can say is we haven't society as a whole, hasn't been doing enough of it and frankly uh society. And I'd say that the activists, the, the, the the dominant voice in this discussion have tried to exclude the industry that has the most capacity and the highest potential for helping with that some of these technologies. And so uh how quickly will the technology uh discoveries come? The innovation comes? How quickly can we scale those things? How low can we get the cost? I frankly can't answer that, but I do know there's a lot of work that needs to be happening today to make that uh give us a chance of success. I'll give you one example. We're investing in direct air capture. We're, we're using the technology that we have this molecule expertise that I talked to you about to figure out if there's new ways new technologies that we can use to directly capture carbon from the air. We've just built a pilot plan or prototype that we're, we're working on trying to cut the cost in half which by the way will still be too expensive. But we want to get down on that curve and there are a lot of companies out there trying to, to advance the technology in this space. How quickly will they, you know, will they succeed? I, I don't know the answer to that but Mahal just before we leave this, but you mentioned the Ira, you know, I don't think that's got nearly the, the attention that it probably deserves in this debate. You're getting huge subsidies to do that, aren't you the, the, the, the way that the government is incentivized and trying to catalyze investments, space is through subsidies. And the challenge you make the point, they are huge subsidies because the cost of doing this today is high. And if you're going to, if you're going to uh drive significant investments at a scale that even gets close to moving the needle, it's going to cost a lot of money. And so I think the government today is trying to incentivize that to get things moving. But I would tell you, building a business on government subsidy is not a long term sustainable strategy. We are not, we, we, we don't support that. Uh We're, we have committed ourselves to um use the IRA to try to get started on that. But at the same time, we're advocating to move to market market forces uh either through regulation prices on carbon. Different, there are different mechanisms out there today. The challenge with all those solutions that is the cost of that ultimately bears its explicitly bears itself in the price of products out there. And that's where the challenge comes. And so today you can, you'd rather just, you'd rather just have a straight tax on carbon. I think if you price car carbon, put, put a carbon price out there or regulate the carbon intensity of products uh that, that will drive the markets to start innovating and find solutions rather than having the government craft unique policy to incentivize different levels of investment in different technology spaces. I think, you know, that's I've accepted that as a, a bridge to get to an ultimate solution. But ultimately, the markets have to work in this space. If we don't get the markets to work in this space, we will not be successful as a society to, to decarbonize. So, um let's talk about an area where we have seen consumer behavior shift somewhat. Um The EV space and I know you guys are, we mentioned earlier, you mentioned a few times you're in the lithium business now. Um there's been a slowdown in demand though. So what do you see going forward in the EV space? And how does it impact you? Well, I would tell you. So, first of all, from our perspective, we don't, we, we, I don't have a view, I don't have a bias one way or the other. Again, it comes back to what does the market want. And we've always felt like from the very beginning when we were doing the analysis that, that people were extrapolating from very small sample sizes are very small, you know, data sets into this ev growth. So we never believe that, you know, just like any other product you're, you're moving through segment, consumer segments and tiers that as you penetrate those segments change and their motivations and abilities and desires, all that begins to, you know, so they're always felt like we're extrapolating too, too small of a set. So I felt like in the past, the projections were too high. And uh and I think we're projecting now, we've, we've had this, this lull and people now are kind of doom and gloom. And I don't believe that either. Frankly, I think, you know, my mind, we're planning for long term that the electric vehicles will have a role to play. Uh they'll penetrate uh to a certain level in society and the costs have to continue to come down. Our view is, you know, frankly, the reason we're in lithium is because we can provide our skill sets to a product that the, that the world's gonna need as we electrify, generally speaking, and battery usage goes up. And so we see long term demand for lithium. And then our view is we can produce that uh at a lower cost and more and more environmentally friendly footprint. And therefore there's an advantage that we can bring to that space. That's why we're interested in lithium trying to predict exactly what the sales are. I would tell you, I don't think we're any better than anybody else out there. I would just say we don't get too caught up in the hyperbole. We didn't get overly excited when people were saying it was gonna go through the moon and we're now not, you know, overly depressed that people are saying that the thing stalled and we're not gonna take, I think that the answers is somewhere in between there and society will figure that out. And our view is we'll be there with a product that that's gonna be needed to make that successful and, and you're able to, to extract it also from the United States currently and there's, there's even more that we're finding. So, um can you also kind of talk about what that means in terms of, you know, obviously, we're seeing across the board with manufacturing, uh a lot of incentives also to manufacture domestically. Um What does it mean for the company and, and for the country? So I think, you know, our, our, there's clearly this view that, you know, as you think about moving into new technologies, new products that you want to have a secure source of supply. Uh Our view is, and I think that's true with lithium, certainly true with energy and, and oil and gas in our business. And our view is, you know, I I think the right answer for any one country or one segment of society or, or business is to have diversified supplies. I would tell you from our perspective, it's not about making sure that it only happens within the US. It's really making sure that you have options and availability. You don't find yourself tied to any one single source of supply or dominated by a single source of supply that basically just like in business, you know, gives that supplier power and, and you wanna try to uh you know, not be found, found to be basically dependent on any, any one single entity out there. So I think domestic supply is important from that standpoint, we're not committing ourselves to domestic supply. We're really, this is a, this is a um an extraction process that I think again, it has a lot of benefits to what uh technology currently exists out there. One that we have a capability in, but it will be dictated in terms of where you do it based on where those resources reside. You gotta have a concentration of lithium in this brine water to make it economically feasible. The, the acres that we have in Arkansas that we're trying to develop, has that concentration makes it economically viable. And therefore we're developing that there are other opportunities around the US and around the world that will look to basically develop as well and pace that with the growth in, in the lithium uh demand and the supply that comes on. Uh Darren, I, I'd let you go back to this question of how long is this all going to take? Because I don't believe we've quite Alan needs a year. He needs a month and a day. I can't, I can't give that to you. I don't know the answer to that. But, but, but let me ask you this, uh I am 100% in agreement with you that we would all be better off if we had effective governments that could put a price on carbon and, and, and create a market that you could compete in. Uh that provides the right incentives to get us there. We don't have effective government. We're not, and we're not, we don't seem to be headed in that direction. Uh The IRA, as you pointed out, it may not have been the way you would do it, but it was a big, big deal. I don't know how many more things like that you're gonna get. So I guess the, the question I have for you is in that environment, what is the responsibility of Exxonmobil to push the market forward to push us towards a solution? Uh And how far are you willing to go in doing that? So I think, you know, this is the challenge we have uh a whole set of responsibility. One of is to advance technology, provide solutions that help society achieve its objective. That's clearly an object. We also have an objective and responsibility to our shareholders. We have to balance those objective sets. I think unlike a lot of activist groups and and ideologues that are out there who can focus on a single variable or a single cause. That's a luxury that we don't have. So we have to figure out how we can strike the right balance offer solutions that meet these growing needs, develop technologies. And we do do that. We have invested in these technologies. I I mentioned to you the direct air capture that we're doing. I mentioned the things that we're doing in carbon capture and stores. Those are all things that are very early in the stages that frankly today won't be viable long term uh businesses if society doesn't, doesn't start to put a value on decarbonization. And so to a certain extent, it's a little bit like exploration uh in our upstream business is that we see an opportunity we're managing and mitigating the downside uh and positioning ourselves for the upside. I think that's the most that you can ask for a public company out there. But how much of how much of an effect of the, the IRA subsidies have on, on your business? Oh I I would tell you uh if you, if you look at the lithium business, there's an established market and price out there. So it's not directly part of the IRA subsidies, but it is driven by evs which are part of the Ira subsidies and so indirectly the subsidies are behind the lithium business, the carbon capture and storage business. I would say the incentives to do that are all driven through the government, the the low carbon hydrogen. Again, uh there's not a market out there to sell low carbon hydrogen to a third party without the government subsidies, uh biofuels that we're investing in, in, in Canada as an example, are driven through regulation. And so I would tell you today, there's not a viable market where uh consumers step in and are willing to pay a premium for low carbon products. That's the reality of what we face today. I get, I can't drive demand and I can't, I can't make customers pay more for a product that has uh less carbon in. So you're a fan of the IRA. Our view is it's, it's an important bridge to get things started. So my mind is, yes, you gotta have, the government has to play a role. I would have used, I would have had the government play a different role. But to the extent that's what they chose to, they make the political decisions. They're answerable to answerable to the people. I don't, I, I don't pretend to be uh I am answerable to my shareholders and investors not to the general public. So the government has its role, makes its decisions and that construct, we're trying to be a, a positive force to demonstrate that this can actually work. And to start down that learning curve, whether we'll be successful as a society with that remains to be seen. But to your, your, your broader question of when we don't know the answer to that, what we've been looking at are the signpost, what has to happen in, in order for us to get onto this path. And so we have a very active um a process of monitoring um you know, investment in infrastructure. You know, if you're gonna electrify the whole country you, you gotta have transmission systems and distribution systems. Do we see the permits going into those things? Uh Do we see the advances in scale technology? There's a lot of things that we're watching. Do you see a market developing many, many things that we're looking at? And frankly, if you look at those sign posts, you don't see the activity. And I would tell you, my view is we got to move away from our governments and politicians talk talking in aspirational terms and uh building um the narrative based on hope and roll your sleeves up and start doing some real math here about what's the, how are we gonna get from where we're at to where we want to go to? What's it gonna take? How much is it gonna cost, who's best positioned to do that and actually start building a, a feasible plan that balances all the competing forces out there rather than ignoring the constraints and challenges and focusing on the hope and aspirations that in my mind will never solve the problem. And we're not doing enough of that as a world as, as a society. I don't see many governments anywhere sitting down and actually tackling these issues and inviting the right people in industry and government to roll their sleeves up and start building a plan to accomplish what, what they uh what the world basically needs. That's a great sign post. Look for you. Tell me when that starts to happen. I tell you we're on the path. So he sang September 5th, I think 2050. We, we have been advocating, I, I tell you that we have volunteered with every government uh that we engage with that when they're ready to do that, we're ready to sit down and, and contribute our piece. I'm not, I don't pretend that we have all the answers. I just think that we can, we can contribute uh asking many other companies and when they're ready for a contribution, a serious contribution, a serious conversation, they wanna do real, they wanna bring the engineers to the table, use data and analysis to figure out how we solve it. We're here, we're there, we're ready. Uh And we've been volunteering to do that for some time now and I would tell you some countries, some countries must be doing that. Some countries are doing that as you go around the world. I would tell the US with the Ira. They've been, I would tell you very constructive discussions with the US administration around. How do you bring the Ira? How do you translate the legislation and the practical regulations that incentivize industry to do these things? And we're, we're bringing our perspective again, I'm not suggesting that our perspective is necessarily the only perspective or the right perspective, but it is one that is based on a very deep understanding of our industry and the technical capabilities required to achieve some of these objectives. And so we're trying to be a positive constructive force here, positivity and, and, and constructive conversations uh with government between private sector and government sound like a pretty good thing. Um So we'll take, we'll take it. Um I want to ask you a question just about you and, and your leadership. Um You've been with the company for a long time. You are driving this transition and transformation currently, but I've seen it go through multiple changes over the decades and, and just give us a little bit of your take of, you know, what is the Exxon Mobil culture? How is it shifted and how is it not shifted? What, what are kind of the, the core, um you know, values or aspects of the culture that you feel like are really consistent. I think a lot of people don't know this, but I don't know anything about it. No, I think you're right. I think, and frankly, I, I, as I came into this job, one of the things that I guess upset me the most was that the perception of our company doesn't match the reality of the people who are in it and the hard work they do uh every day. And so one of my objectives is to basically try to help the outside world better understand our company and the people that work here and the work we do. And I would just point to, you know, probably the most explicit step that we took was the, I don't know if you um the C NBC uh engagement that we had with David Faber, where we, I invited him to come in and all I asked him to do was be objective. Uh And we gave him access to anywhere he wanted to go talk to any people in our company. And my view was if people on the outside got to see who we were, what we did and how our people approach their jobs, that that would start to um change some of the perception, recognizing it's a very long road to go on. And so that was the first effort. But if you ask, we have a set of core values and one that I've grown up with, they haven't changed. Uh We're trying to express them more effectively externally, but I would start with one that's I think for me has been critical for my entire career. In fact, what's brought me to this company is integrity, not just being honest and ethical, but uh being intellectually honest and saying the hard things and taking positions on what we believe on based on the facts and not jumping on bandwagons or subscribing to popular narratives. If we don't believe those are the right things, I would tell you a second, really critical um value for us is courage of conviction is that once you figured out the right thing, once you've done the assessment and you've got an answer. You've got to stand up and talk about it, you can't be afraid to go against the conventional wisdom. And I would tell you in this job, certainly, I felt the, the, uh the pressure to conform and I know what it feels like to stand against the, the popular narrative. But our view is if you've done the analysis, right? If you, if you have done it objectively, if you're not letting your emotions bias your thinking, but instead are kind of coming back to what is it gonna take to be successful for the long term that ultimately things come back around? Uh And, and you're proven that the path was the correct one. And then the third uh one that I would just mention is, you know, resilience that you, you gotta be in this for the long haul and you've gotta stand the pressure. And I would tell you, uh you know, those three of our five core values that we talk about with all of our employees. And, and so when you come here, we, we're not, we're not promising an easy uh career, but we're, we're promising a rewarding one and one that you can feel good about the first job I had in this company long time ago. Uh My first supervisor had gave me two pieces of advice that I've lived with since that time. And the first one was if you're ever doing something that you'd be embarrassed for your mother to read about on the front page of the paper, stop doing it. And I have lived with that my entire and that is really good advice. And the second one he told me was every morning you gotta get up and look yourself in the mirror and make sure you like what you see. And I just would tell you, you know, do, do the right thing for the right reasons in the right way and uh the rest will come with it. And so, I mean, that is, I would tell you, you go across, we have very committed people focused on uh doing the right thing in the right way for the right reasons. And um and they're making a difference and we have made a difference. If you look at our industry, I think it's hard to point to any industry that has uh progressed human living standards around the world. And uh we take great pride in that, but we're not, we're not um buried by that or married to that idea. The idea is that the world changes, things evolve. We've got a capability. Our job is to continue to contribute to society and basically help people uh achieve prosperity to improve living standards. And our, our people take great pride in our ability to do that. And we are, you know, going through a transition, but it will be a long one. This people don't fully appreciate the scale of the industry that we're in today. And so I think, you know, the recognition back to your question now about how long will it take? You gotta come back to the size of the existing energy system today? It is big, it will take time to replace. But my point is we gotta get started on it. But I would say, you know, I can't believe you, you voluntarily went back to Allen's question. I'm a g for punishing. What can I say? The, the, the other thing, Darren, I, that, that uh uh that uh notion that you don't want to read anything and you don't want your mother to read anything in the paper. It sort of depends on what paper she's reading too. My mother is not a good litmus test for that, by the way because she thinks her son does no wrong. So, but I just, I would just finish up the, those three I gave you the two more kind of our core values. Uh One is care, care about what you're doing and why you're doing it. And um uh care for the people that you work with, the communities that you're in and the environment. Uh we feel very strongly about that. And I think if you had the chance to be one of our operations, you would clearly see that. And the, the fifth one that we hold ourselves is excellence that we hold ourselves to a high standard. We expect a lot of ourselves and of our people. And when we don't uh meet this, this high expectations, uh we challenge ourselves to get better and those are the five core values I think, uh most everybody in our company, uh believe in and, and resonates with them. But I, but I wanna say we appreciate the fact that you have taken a different approach towards conversing with. I wouldn't say the public with the media on these things. I really appreciate the fact that you've come, uh, here today and spent so much time with us on, on this issue. I just have to ask you, I mean, this is a big, complicated, difficult transition. You're under a lot of, uh, pressure, a lot of pushback that you've talked about. What do you do to relax? I mean, do you watch Hallmark movies? Do you, I mean, what, what, you know, I have, uh, the, I have a, a lot of, uh, I put a lot of priority in my family. And so, uh, that's probably what I would tell you. I've never brought work home to my family. I try to keep them separated from the things I do day in day. And so when I come home, we, unless I want to, which is very rare. Uh, we don't talk about work. Uh, we talk about, you know what's happening in their lives. I've got three kids, I've got three grandkids, got another one on the way. And so I've, when I'm not at work, uh, I'm with the family and, and I, I try to get away and, uh, I like to go outside. We spend a lot of time outside. Uh, I've got some, some property in the hill country of Texas. I like to get away from. So I think getting clear my mind and I don't get too weighed down. I try to disconnect from the world. I'm not a social media guy. I'm not on the internet all the time. II, I just feel like that, uh, your Children, your Children and grandchildren aren't harassing you about why you aren't going faster to, uh, deal with the energy transition. I think my, my grandchildren are too young to that. We'll see when they get a little bit older than my old. The oldest is four. So I think she's not quite up to that argument yet. But, you know, I given how she is today, I'm pretty sure at some stage she gonna give me, she will give me a run for my money. But I think my kids, they know they know, uh, what I stand for. They've grown up with me. You know, we've always believed in sitting around the kitchen table. And so despite long work hours, my wife and kids always accommodated that we always sat down for dinner when I was in town and I would tell you our dinners were always long and we always talked and always challenged them. You know, my gift to them is independent thinking and listen carefully, understand what people are saying, but make sure that you make your own decisions and you have a basis for doing that. And I think over the years, I don't, can't think of a topic that we didn't, we haven't touched on and, and discussed. So my, my kids know why I do the things that I do and they know, uh, you know, the, the company that I work for and represent is very aligned with those principles and the values that I have as an individual. And so, uh they know they know what I'm doing to try to help solve this problem for the world. Well, Darren, thank you so much for sitting with us, as Alan said, we really appreciate you taking the time and, um, telling us so much about the company, both, you know, the transformation, the culture and, and all of it. Thank you. Happy to do it, enjoy the conversation and, uh, look forward maybe seeing you sometime in New York.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709044376934,"updatedAt":1709072475176,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1708992000000,"duration":{"value":2653,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731","name":"How $4 Billion CEO Is Leveraging Remote Work and Globalization to Prove Both Are Alive and Well","slug":"how-$4-billion-ceo-is-leveraging-remote-work-and-globalization-to-prove-both-are-alive-and-well","shortDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","longDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","seoTitle":"How $4 Billion CEO Is Leveraging Remote Work and Globalization to Prove Both Are Alive and Well","seoDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","socialTitle":"How $4 Billion CEO Is Leveraging Remote Work and Globalization to Prove Both Are Alive and Well","socialDescription":"“We’re seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland,” says CEO Nicole Sahin, whose company G-P gives employers access to a global talent pool.","tags":[{"name":"ai","type":"tag","label":"AI"},{"name":"remote_work","type":"tag","label":"remote work"},{"name":"return_to_office","type":"tag","label":"return to office"},{"name":"globalization","type":"tag","label":"globalization"},{"name":"globalization_partners","type":"tag","label":"Globalization Partners"},{"name":"nicole_sahin","type":"tag","label":"Nicole Sahin"},{"name":"fort","type":"tag","label":"Fort"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","type":"section","label":"Leadership"},"playlists":["Heroes","Leadership Next"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/935005f2-8794-4382-8cab-dd468ad5d731/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Illustration by Fortune.

As soon as this podcast. That is awesome. Thank you so much. I love that. Welcome to Leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia after years of helping Silicon Valley's high growth companies expand internationally, I thought there had to be a much easier way to help companies hire talent in new markets without setting up branches and subsidiaries in each country. My vision was to just set up one company in each country and give all of our customers access to it so that they could quickly and easily be able to hire talent in each country while being compliant with the local labor hr and tax laws and then also building technology on top to make it automated. How is it that you're doing so well? At a time when in theory, globalization is in retreat, I think that there is a movement or like the idea of, hey, you know, I want to buy for my local grocer. I wanna, I wanna grow my food in my backyard and I, and I think that's wonderful and people do it or I want to buy American. But the reality is, is that our, our, our entire economic ecosystem is so interwoven so closely together that if any, any size, any business of any scale ultimately has people and talent from all over the world and you just can't build an enterprise level business or even any, any high growth company has talent from all over the world. So I just don't see it. I don't see, I don't believe that globalization is in reverse. What are the, the kind of up and coming hubs so that, that you're seeing India is really interesting and compelling. I mean, that country has been just such a marvel to watch from a business perspective in the early two thousands companies were always outsourcing there and it was, it was considered like cheap talent now what we're seeing and especially in the last five years, the digital economy and, and like the, the modernization of the economy that they've built from the ground up in country is really incredible. Now, we're seeing engineers in India being paid the same as engineers in Ireland, for example. And it's just, it's awesome to see like a whole nation come online in, in the course of a of a couple of decades. Can you talk about how A I is accelerating what you're doing? So the vast majority of our business can be fully automated. I think about 95% of our business can be automated. And that's because on boarding an employee in a country, it's like the same questions every time. How many, how many vacation days does this person need? What's the benefits requirements? So a lot of that can just be managed through A I, we use A I within our product platform, we call it JIA and it's the first of its kind global Intelligence assistant, which basically makes it faster and easier for companies to hire, manage and, and manage all of their global legal hr and tax compliance globally. In combination with our platform, I'm curious to hear a little bit about your path to founding the company um because it wasn't a traditional path when I was right out of college, I thought I wanted to be an anthropologist and I went and lived in the highlands of Northern Guatemala and lived with an indigenous family. We're getting to this now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was that the first global Globalization partners office in the highlands of Guatemala? I think it was probably where it was seated all in, for sure. Anyway, I was hanging out in this village in the northern highlands of Guatemala trying to follow in the footsteps of an anthropologist from the 19 fifties, Maude Oaks. And after a certain period of time, I realized that being a twentysomething year old young blonde woman, trying to study shamanic traditions in the northern highlands of Guatemala and learn an ancient language. Nobody had ever heard of probably was better for National Geographic than real life. And um not as, not as fun as I thought it was gonna be. I left Guatemala and I ended up applying for business school shortly after that and, and got an MB A in international management shortly after that was um advising the high growth companies in the early two thousands, like uh Netsuite and Tesla and Inane and was ultimately like an outsourced international compliance advisor, helping them set up their companies and, and, and manage their headcount all over the globe. And in doing that, I was managing lawyers and tax advisors and accountants in like 60 different countries. Um and kind of doing the same thing over and over again. And I just thought if I could build this once in a way that every company could have access to it, I would have a much more scalable business platform.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1708112258147,"updatedAt":1708426813793,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1708426813793,"duration":{"value":272,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"cee737f4-d281-4774-a196-9c49d43acb17","name":"Blackbird.AI CEO on helping humans stop harmful AI","slug":"blackbird.ai-ceo-on-helping-humans-stop-harmful-ai","shortDescription":"Compass, a “context product” launched by Blackbird, uses gen AI to help people check posts and other online media for misinformation and disinformation.","longDescription":"Wasim Khaled believes that “human beings are not yet ready” for the warped realities that can be spread through harmful AI.

What's the one headline that we're not seeing about A I? There are so many headlines out there about A I, I'm trying to think which one is not really being covered. I think the one that I would like to see and we're seeing a little bit more play there is that the degree to which A I can be used for good versus evil is not based on the morality of the A I, but in the morality of the user, it is a human problem, not an A I problem. Welcome to leadership. Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia, what does Blackbird A I do for me? So if we are equipping uh analysts and uh threat intelligence teams to get a better sense of what are the mechanisms behind this narrative attack. So most people perceive that as something that just happened and we show them, OK, there might be a bot network, for example, that was deployed, that is amplifying and driving the reach of that particular narrative. And if you think about it, every organization has a narrative and every narrative has a counter narrative. And so it is the seeding of all of these counter narratives that are tearing down the messaging that that company wants to put out there in the world uh that we really enable them to see. So I think what keeps you up at night when it comes to A I, I would say it's not just A I, but it's the application of A I to harmful acts, particularly in our space that is about warped realities. And uh I would say that the biggest problem today around those work realities and the utilization of A I to drive them is that as a society, human beings aren't yet ready to question every single thing that they see, whether I not even just see but see, hear uh read. And so the fact that we have to question our reality on everything that we look at and try to perceive is extremely disturbing. And I think about also what our younger Children, you know, I'm, I'm a father and, and I think about like the world that they're growing up in without that appeal to be able to know uh if what they're seeing or looking at is artificial or manipulated. And so that concerns me and that's really why we do what we do keeps me up to. There is reason to be hopeful because the same types of technologies that frankly are making the problem worse can be used as a, as a defensive measure or a kind of illuminating uh product as well. February 14th is Valentine's Day. Actually, we're launching a product. It's something we call compass. Uh we call it compass because it helps you see the way a little bit more. It is a context product. And so you can give it a question, you can give it a link or a post or a meme or even a link to a video and it will use our generative A I models and all of the risk signals we've developed for our enterprise customers around bot activity and, and, and harmful communities. And it will tell you as much non biased kind of two sided context along with sources and, and where that came from as well as summarizing points like a, like a chat GP T and uh and, and we think that's something that could be incredible for people who help the average person discern the truth. Why put it out on Valentine's Day? Is there a message there or is it a coincidence? It is for the love of what we do?","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1707853040364,"updatedAt":1707908413816,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1707908413816,"duration":{"value":227,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}}]}}],"section":"Hero","state":"Published","index":0},{"id":"094fe6ba-dbcb-42ce-aa5a-c3a150ffa8bf","displayPage":"/videos","name":"Founders Forum 2023","viewportSize":{"web":5},"type":"PLAYLIST_TRAY","source":{"from":"PLAYLIST_SOURCE","playlistName":"Founders Forum 2023"},"items":[{"type":"PLAYLIST_ITEM","playlist":{"name":"Founders Forum 2023","type":"Playlist","state":"Published","premium":false,"posterImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/Playlists%2FFounders%2520Forum%25202023%2FImages%2FposterImage-ver1.jpg","videosOrderedByUser":[{"videoId":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179","name":"A.I. is uncovering the secrets of your body's microbiome","slug":"a.i.-is-uncovering-the-secrets-of-your-body's-microbiome","longDescription":"Jona founder Leo Grady thinks pairing A.I. capabilities with the evolving science around the microbiome can lead to big health improvements—and be the basis for a successful business.","seoTitle":"A.I. is uncovering the secrets of your body's microbiome","seoDescription":"Jona founder Leo Grady thinks pairing A.I. capabilities with the evolving science around the microbiome can lead to big health improvements\n","socialTitle":"A.I. is uncovering the secrets of your body's microbiome","socialDescription":"Jona founder Leo Grady thinks pairing A.I. capabilities with the evolving science around the microbiome can lead to big health improvements—and be the basis for a successful business.","tags":[{"name":"leo_grady","type":"tag","label":"Leo Grady"},{"name":"jonah","type":"tag","label":"Jonah"},{"name":"biopharma","type":"tag","label":"BioPharma"},{"name":"crohn","type":"tag","label":"Crohn"},{"name":"jona_health","type":"tag","label":"Jona Health"},{"name":"a_i_","type":"tag","label":"A.I."}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":3,"key":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/HLS/video-ver3_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":3,"key":"1155d7f7-acb5-46fd-8a9a-a21ab9723179/SRT/captions-ver3.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I think if you're not continuing to learn and continuing to grow as, as both a person and as an entrepreneur, then you're probably in the wrong place. Jonah is building these large language models on the microbiome specifically because the microbiome is so complex and the science is evolving very quickly. Every single month, more than 2000 papers are being published in PUBMED on the microbiome. No human being can read all of those papers but a large language model can and what these papers are showing is that the microbiome really underpins so much of human health, not just G I and autoimmune conditions, but cancer, obesity, liver disease, diabetes, even Parkinson's Alzheimer's depression anxiety. And so we have the opportunity to really bring this world's knowledge to interpreting a microbiome test and evolve that toward the clinical mainstream. So we're starting with a wellness product that is cash pay. And so selling that really through two channels. One is through uh concierge medicine, integrated medicine, functional medicine where patients are are paying cash for excellent services that really go beyond the normal mainstream of of clinical medicine. And then we're also selling direct to consumer on our website. As we move forward, our goal is to go beyond the current literature and build a whole platform of microbiome data and an A I layer on top of that. And then from that platform, be able to build whole new diagnostics, whole new therapeutics and uh and really work with the life sciences industry, the BioPharma industry, even the food and beverage industry to take this information to make better medications and better food. So I've had a number of people in my family who have Crohn's disease, colitis, celiac undiagnosed G I issues. And as I've watched them go on this journey of, of trying to get a diagnosis or even when they have a diagnosis, trying to manage these diseases, trying to understand what they can eat, what drugs are going to work for them. The demand and the need out there is, is real. And I think it's something that's very energizing and motivating for both myself and the team. You know, the funny thing is I've never actually been at the earliest stage of a company before. You know, when I joined, when I finished my phd, I joined Seamen. It was 400,000 employees, right? The ninth largest employer in the world. And then heart flow. When I joined, there were 50 when we grew to about 500. When I joined page, there were about 15 and we grew to about 100 and 70. But this stage is actually quite a bit different. And so my, my comfort zone is probably like, you know, a year from now when, when we have a little bit further, we're a little further along with processes. So just, you know, all of that initial stuff, setting up payroll in the beginning and, and all of that, um, were things I hadn't done before. I think you need conviction on what you're doing and it needs to be something that you wake up every day and, and want to do.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691612631114,"updatedAt":1692716922672,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691625600000,"duration":{"value":224,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"socMed":false,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c","name":"This couple is on a mission to create helpful A.I., and they are starting in the grocery store","slug":"this-couple-is-on-a-mission-to-create-helpful-a.i.,-and-they-are-starting-in-the-grocery-store","shortDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","longDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","seoTitle":"This couple is on a mission to create helpful A.I","seoDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","socialTitle":"This couple is on a mission to create helpful A.I., and they are starting in the grocery store","socialDescription":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh and Omid Bakhshandeh are the founders of Verneek.","tags":[{"name":"nasrin_mostafazadeh","type":"tag","label":"Nasrin Mostafazadeh"},{"name":"omid_bakhshandeh","type":"tag","label":"Omid Bakhshandeh"},{"name":"quinn","type":"tag","label":"Quinn"},{"name":"verneek","type":"tag","label":"Verneek"},{"name":"a_i_","type":"tag","label":"A.I."},{"name":"iran","type":"tag","label":"Iran"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"09e2ecbc-8fa4-4000-907e-27dcbd82e40c/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"We've been obsessed with making human language, the new machine language and we literally couldn't let go of it. And I'm so thrilled that the technology is finally working. Our mission is to build the most helpful A I that augments human knowledge for anyone anywhere at any time. What we have done is to build this A I platform that can basically make these very seamless interfaces that you can put on top of any digital environment, any data that you have in any shape or form and make you as a consumer to make better, faster decisions using voice and text interfaces. So the very first use case that we could spin off of our platform happens to be in the shopping domain. So in the commerce, so e-commerce or physical retail and brick and mortar stores. So what Quin shopping A I does is it follows, it helps you get answer to your personalized questions with the most accurate up to date. In, for example, uh Mama four can ask, what is the healthiest peanut butter I can buy that costs under $4 in this particular store. And then Quinn literally immediately spontaneously gives you the very particular peanut butter. That is why health metrics, the healthiest, the questions could range from that being about product as store to any store questions, just customer service questions like when you close the store, what is your return policy could be about? Recipes could be like, I'm looking to cook, you know, meal that costs under $20 and my kids hate fish. So something that we have found is that in the places that it has been launched right now is most loved by store associates themselves. They love it. And this is helping them to do the real job better, make the store run, better manage the inventory better. So, so bringing that gap of like knowledge and helpfulness all together, it just helps everyone. The hardest problem for A I is actually the easiest one for human being. So there's this thing called paradox that tells you that's language capabilities and doing basic reasoning that a three year old child can do is the easiest for humans, but the hardest for machines. So we including myself, I switch gears, working on language A I ever since. And so the rest of this kind of history, we like all, all of our time, like all the time that we had back in Iran, we were like kind of working extremely hard to make sure that we can like accomplish like the biggest thing that we can accomplish. We were always like looking for the what is the biggest opportunity and biggest opportunity for us was the hardest problem. And the hardest problem just, just going after the hardest problem every time that we could, we thought that we might be able to solve that problem that we came to us 10 years ago to do our phd and kind of go after our dreams. And right now we are sitting here say that having started a company, especially in the middle of the pandemic has been the hardest thing we've ever done. And the most rewarding one as well at the same time, it's just been incredibly satisfying to go through this roller coaster that it is to uh basically navigate your way to, to start something from scratch. And if you really don't love it, you will fail. The only reason we are doing what we are doing is that we obsessively love it. If you don't love it every day that you wake up, it's gonna be a tough journey.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691615339380,"updatedAt":1691660714207,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691660714207,"duration":{"value":229,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6","name":"Startup Ameelio believes helping inmates succeed after prison starts with a simple phone call","slug":"startup-ameelio-believes-helping-inmates-succeed-after-prison-starts-with-a-simple-phone-call","shortDescription":"Founder and CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism and ultimately reduce the prison population.","longDescription":"Founder and CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism and ultimately reduce the prison population.","seoTitle":"Ameelio believes helping inmates starts with a phone call","seoDescription":"CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism","socialTitle":"Startup Ameelio believes helping inmates succeed after prison starts with a simple phone call","socialDescription":"Founder and CEO Uzoma Orchingwa says making it easy and affordable for inmates to communicate with people outside of prison will cut recidivism and ultimately reduce the prison population.","tags":[{"name":"uzoma_orchingwa","type":"tag","label":"Uzoma Orchingwa"},{"name":"startup_ameelio","type":"tag","label":"Startup Ameelio"},{"name":"founder","type":"tag","label":"Founder"},{"name":"criminal_justice_foundation","type":"tag","label":"Criminal Justice Foundation"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"806b0a58-324d-4367-a1aa-c484e7bbb1f6/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I had no experience in startups. I was a philosophy undergrad. I didn't know anything about running a business. All ideas seem crazy before you succeed. Emilia is a non profit technology company that is working to fundamentally transform incarceration. So what we do is we build a free to use communication and education, software and hardware that we provide to incarcerated people, completely free of charge. A communication suite, a full communication suite and that includes video calls, voice calls, e messaging. But the unique thing about what we do because often get questions like, hey, can zoom do this. One of the biggest challenges in this space is that every security is of vital importance to the primary correction clients we work with. So we have to build in a ton of security features that allows them to, you know, safely manage their facilities, enabling access to the outside for the incarcerated has been proven to reduce recidivism. There's an abundance of studies that show that more contact with love. One can have an up to 56% reduction in incarceration. So imagine, you know, someone's incarcerated, they're away from their families. They're in an eight by 10 cell and they can't be able to communicate with their families. It causes an extreme amount of distress. But you also learn that it's one of the real major cause of in prison violence and future recidivism is idle time and lack of hope. My parents were both college educated, college and education was always something that I was expected to do and accomplish. But a lot of my friends were from single parent households, parents who had been incarcerated, brothers have been incarcerated, or the vast majority of them actually ended up being incarcerated. And that really kind of set me off on this path, this academic path to understand the system, understand what's going wrong. And to figure out solutions to solve it. As a nonprofit, we need to find of philanthropic capital, get off the ground. So in the early days, you know, especially with Criminal Justice Foundation, it was almost impossible to get funding because their assumption was that this, this industry is so predator or so monopolized that, you know, what is a small tech nonprofit going to be able to do? But the way we actually crystallized it was COVID hit prisons had to shut down on prison visitation. So remote communication, virtual communication became so vitally important and we were able to break in. And then we're because we had that, that use case a case study, we were then able to kind of expand into other departments and other counties across the country. One piece of knowledge that I wish I knew back when I was starting. Emilio is to not dwell in the uncertainties because you're going to learn it. You know, if you really want to be a fund, you really have a passion and vision to build something. Be relentless all the way through.

It has led to the clearing of an amount of land equivalent to the size of South America and Africa combined and it emits more greenhouse gasses than the entire transportation sector. So how do we make food as we continue to grow in our population in a way that doesn't break the planet air protein is focused on being a part of that solution. In 2005, I was one of the many people who went to New Orleans after hurricane Katrina hit and that experience impacted me in many different ways. One of the ways is that I knew that my work had to have an impact in this world and fast forward a few years, the fact that I'm trained as a scientist I began to think about and study what the climate, climate scientists have been saying about the fact that these types of weather events were going to be more intense and more frequent seeing when I was there in 2005. Just how that affected people's lives directly made me want to be a part of the solution. So ultimately, we built Air protein as a way to try to be a part of the solution. We were very creative with the science, but with the name, we're very straightforward, we make protein from air. And so how does one do that? You might ask? Well, it's based on work done by NASA during the space program where they were trying to figure out how to feed astronauts on long space journeys. This is back in the sixties and seventies during the Apollo Space Program. And as you can imagine, if you're on a long journey to Mars or a distant planet, you don't have acres and acres of farmland to deal with. So you have to figure out how to feed astronauts in a way that's super resource efficient use what you have available and it can grow quickly, very quickly, very fast. And so the process that we have, we are commercializing based on their pioneering work is a process that's very similar to fermentation. But the difference is there's no agricultural inputs whatsoever. We use elements of the air, air, water and energy and we make protein from that, we have raised 107 million to date in the beginning. People ask is this science fiction, you know, is this real? Can it be real? How can you make protein from air? So we had to prove it. So the challenges are always initially around demonstrating that this was actually possible. And once we demonstrated it, it was possible. That's when we were able to start building this ecosystem and that we're getting more and more companies and partners as is really around the table to help us create the future that we're working to create. And we've just opened our first air farm in San Leandro, California where we're excited to bring to the world a way of making nutritious proteins with no arable land, no farmland, no agricultural inputs required whatsoever. George Bernard Shaw has this quote that goes something like the reasonable person adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable person persists in trying to adapt the world to him or herself. And therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable person. As a founder, we're doing things that haven't been done before. And so as there are these highs and low lows along the way, it's important for founders to keep their eyes on the prize and inspire the people around them and tap into what inspire them and bring them along on the journey. The only way to predict the future is to create it. And so the future that I'm working to create is a future where more and more and eventually all of our protein is sustainably sourced. The first day when I was able to take a bite of air protein was a day that I realized that this can have the impact that we wanted to have","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691616364964,"updatedAt":1691660713956,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691660713956,"duration":{"value":222,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"connect":false,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044","name":"What to do when your dream career is not so dreamy","slug":"what-to-do-when-your-dream-career-is-not-so-dreamy","shortDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","longDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","seoTitle":"What to do when your dream career is not so dreamy","seoDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","socialTitle":"What to do when your dream career is not so dreamy","socialDescription":"Kathryn Minshew tackled the problem by building The Muse, a website originally designed for job seekers.","tags":[{"name":"kathryn_minshew","type":"tag","label":"Kathryn Minshew"},{"name":"temp","type":"tag","label":"Temp"},{"name":"jennifer_garner","type":"tag","label":"Jennifer Garner"},{"name":"the_muse","type":"tag","label":"The Muse"},{"name":"cia","type":"tag","label":"CIA"},{"name":"nicosia_cyprus","type":"tag","label":"Nicosia Cyprus"},{"name":"the_regional_security_department","type":"tag","label":"the Regional Security Department"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","type":"category","label":"Digital Features"}],"section":{"name":"Venture","type":"section","label":"Venture"},"playlists":["Founders Forum 2023"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"FORTUNE","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":5,"key":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/HLS/video-ver5_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":5,"key":"bfc3a91b-3d4c-4b85-89ee-6865bea30044/SRT/captions-ver5.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I could write a book on the mistakes that I made as an early stage founder. And I imagine if most founders were being very candid, they could to, I grew up thinking for several years that I wanted to go into foreign service or the CIA or something kind of international and global. And my family had moved to the Washington DC area when I was 12, 13. And I just got it in my head that I knew what I wanted to do. Um that television show alias starring Jennifer Garner was very big at the time and I thought I want to be her in 2007. I had the chance to work at a US Embassy in Nicosia Cyprus in the Regional Security Department. It was what I thought the job of my dreams. And I realized very quickly this is not actually what I thought it was this this job while I have so much respect for, it probably isn't as great of a fit for my personality and my aspirations. And so I spent, you know, a few months feeling really lost and adrift, like a lot of people do early in their career and I was trying to figure out what is it that I want. And online job sites were so transactional. They were incredibly boring. They just, they just had lists of jobs and what I was interested in was like, what does a company really like to work for it? And so I started the muse to help give other people access to the resources and the information and the insight about companies that I didn't have. Myself. I started working on the business in the summer of 2011. And we launched that fall, we had a very, very simple site at the beginning because we had no money. You know, I was 25 with a big dream and very very few resources to pull it off. And so the very first version of the news that was called the Daily News, it actually just had career advice and then we added in the company profiles a few months later and job listings a few months after that today, the Muse has 5 to 7 million people every single month who come to the dot com to apply to jobs, research companies and get career advice. And we work with about 20% of the Fortune 500. I wish I could tell my younger self, you know, uh it, it's just really hard to build a business, it's really hard to raise capital. And so just because it's hard for you doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. I think I took on a lot of, you know, self blame because I felt like, oh, if I could just find the right thing to say, it would be, it would be easy. Also, you know, when I was raising for the first time in 2011, 2012, even for a few years around, then people weren't very open about the challenges. So a lot of the entrepreneurs on stage would say, you know, oh, I had this great idea and then I just raised a bunch of money and, you know, now look, we're successful and I've loved the trend towards entrepreneurs, being more honest about the challenges. I also think that I have a really high degree of comfort with being wrong. You know, I recognize that there's a lot that I don't know. And so I think that's both allowed me to pivot and adapt quickly. It's allowed me to learn from others and to create space for other people to come together and contribute their ideas. For me. I think being really, really open to what you're not good at or you're, you're not an expert in is a very powerful thing when you're trying to build something new.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1691612513483,"updatedAt":1691660714502,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1691660714502,"duration":{"value":210,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}}]}}],"section":"Regular","state":"Published","index":1},{"id":"1b00c075-a894-4c53-85b6-4582050c945f","displayPage":"/videos","name":"The Ground Up","viewportSize":{"web":2},"type":"PLAYLIST_TRAY","source":{"from":"PLAYLIST_SOURCE","playlistName":"The Ground Up"},"items":[{"type":"PLAYLIST_ITEM","playlist":{"name":"The Ground Up","type":"Series","state":"Published","premium":false,"description":"In The Ground Up we sit down with entrepreneurs to get the story on how they were able to build a successful business.","posterImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/Playlists%2FThe%2520Ground%2520Up%2FImages%2FposterImage-ver1.jpeg","videosOrderedByUser":[{"videoId":"ac1f281f-1c40-4969-99ca-1cac131f540b","name":"How I made over $220M in sales as the daddy of the Scrub Daddy","slug":"how-i-made-over-$220m-in-sales-as-the-daddy-of-the-scrub-daddy","shortDescription":"On store shelves, customers might only see a bright yellow smile waiting to add some shine to the kitchen.

Scrub Daddy is the only sponge that changes texture just based on the temperature of the water. That means it could be a soft sponge or a hard sponge in hot or cold water. Now when it's soft, it gets all the way into cups, bowls and mugs. And when it's hard, it can scrub through even the most burned on messes in seconds. And cut! But did you know the real story behind that smiley face? Well, you're about to find out in this next episode of The Ground Up. That man you just saw was Aaron Krause, founder and CEO of Scrub Daddy, the smiley face sponge company that started in Folcroft, Pennsylvania, and has filled cleaning shelves since the episode of Shark Tank aired in October 2012. And since then, they moved to an enormous facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey that features office spaces, a television studio, a warehouse, Koi pond, and a store for people to buy their products. Some kids that we encountered in the shop acted like it was Christmas Day. No, I just play one on TV. And ready guys? Cleaning is something that is mundane and is boring and people don't enjoy. And when you make it more fun and you make it really effective, you have something that really clicks with people's psyche. And Scrub Daddy is actually my hand. The original Scrub Daddy runs for $4 at stores and on their website, but select products can run as high as $38. And if you think you've met every product from the sponge dynasty, think again. We even put Aaron to the test. We make Daddy, Mommy, Sponge, Scour, Eraser, Dish Daddy, PowerPaste, Barbecue Daddy, Scour Daddy Steel, Straw Cleaner, Microfiber towels, Streakless Cloths, Scrub Daddy Cif, Scrub Daddy toilet scrubbing system, Tangerine Clean, PowErase Gel. Believe it or not, Aaron missed a few. There's also Big Daddy, Daddy Caddy, Sponge Caddy, Soap Daddy, Cart Daddy and Screen Daddy. That's a long way of saying that there's a ton of products in the Daddy family, over 80 as of today. And with all of these products online and on store shelves, the company has racked in over $220 million in sales for 2023 with no sign of slowing down. We have the best sponge in the world. It's worth every dime that we charge for it. And the profit that we make on it sustains this business and is what's led us to grow so rapidly, because we're able to reinvest over and over and come out with new products. But how did Aaron and Scrub Daddy get here? Well, let's rewind back to when he was just a little kid in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. Both of my parents are physicians. At 10 years old, my dad started teaching me to wash the dishes, which is actually how I end up being in a sponge company. I was about 10 years old and I was laying in bed and I was, like, staring at the light switch going, \"Oh my God, I need a way to turn that off.\" The next day I got a bunch of wheel casters and dental floss because that was the longest piece of rope I could find. And I hooked up this whole pulley system so I could turn the lights on and off from my bed. And that was, like, the first time I realized that I could come up with a crazy idea, build something and change my world. And from then, I literally started looking at the world completely different. Before the Daddy of the Scrub Daddy was making his fortune washing dishes and kitchenware, he was making money washing something much bigger. I've been washing cars since I was a kid. Became a professional car washer when my dad told me I could make $10 a car. Started washing cars in the neighborhood. I had been washing cars throughout all of high school to make money. And I just decided I was just going to start my own car washing business. Aaron went on to Syracuse University and graduated with a degree in psychology. In October 1992, he returned home to start his car washing business. While he was proud to be his own boss, some of his family didn't receive the news too well. My dad said \"You know, son. I just paid $100,000 for your education in psychology. What are you going to do with your life?\" I said, \"Well, I've been washing cars my whole life. I think I'll wash cars.\" My mom was crying. My grandmom said, \"Just disown him.\" And my dad said, \"Son, you have till the end of the summer to make it a real business and get it out of my garage.\" And that's exactly what Aaron did. But not only that, Aaron kept his innovative side going while working at the car wash. It was in 1994 when I invented my first big invention and got a patent on it. And that was for a buffing pad for polishing cars. It was all by hand. It was detailing. Four years into it, I basically damaged a car and I didn't think it was my fault. I thought it was the shape of the pad. And I just immediately, I had this idea of, like, why is the pad cylindrical? It should have edges. And why doesn't it have a recess in the back where the backing plate would be protected? And I literally went around and started asking the distributors. \"I'm looking for a pad that looks like this.\" And they were like, \"I never heard of that.\" After the second guy, I said, \"Forget I mentioned it.\" And I went and got a patent attorney and I filed for my first patent. That was how I learned about polyester urethane foams. Polyester urethane foam, which became a key part of Scrub Daddy, is a flexible, open-cell foam with a range of qualities. It's known for its ability to compress, resist mildew, and insulate. I got a crash course education in every company in the world that makes urethane foams because we started buying those foams and making them into buffing pads. It wasn't for years and years and years later that I found the Scrub Daddy material, which is a very, very unique, highly engineered polymer. And at that time, it was only made by one company in Germany. And this company in Germany sent me this rock hard material that was yellow. I started cleaning my hands with it and it was unbelievable how well it worked, how easily it rinsed clean. With the help of German foam manufacturer FoamPartner, Aaron could modify the pore size and density of his buffing pad. I realized instantly we had a home run. We put some ads in some trade magazines. In three months, we were selling buffing pads all over the United States. And within six months, we were selling it all over the world. Scrub Daddy now calls this material FlexTexture. In 1995, Aaron sold his car washing business and turned his focus to a new venture. Dedication To Detail, a buffing pad manufacturer. This is our first office. Actually, this is the second office. When they sent me the material, I basically cut a rectangular shape, like a traditional sponge, and I just started scrubbing my hands with it. What you find out is that this is an uncomfortable way to hold a sponge. Like, this is not the shape of your hand. Actually, that's the shape of your hand. And it turns out that a circle is the easiest thing to hold on to while you're scrubbing your hand. And then I was like, \"You know, I don't want to go around my fingers. I'll just cut a hole in it. And I'll just cleaning my fingers. It's so much easier.\" Then, I was like, \"You know what? I need to get underneath the nails.\" So I took a knife and I cut some ridges. I cut another hole so I could put two fingers in and grab it. So it had these two eyes, what looked like hair, and it started to look like a little face. Aaron says he stopped selling the foam after a year because of low sales in the auto market. And on September 3, 2008, Dedication To Detail was bought out by multi-national manufacturer 3M. Aaron's sponges ended up sitting at the back of the factory for five years until March 2011 when they found a new life. My wife started nagging me to clean the lawn furniture. And I just took the traditional sponge that I had, which is yellow on one side and green on the other. And I just started to scrub the mold. And it actually scratched the paint off. That's when I remembered this box of this hard plastic scrubbers that we had. And I brought them home and I made a bucket of warm, soapy water because I don't want to work in really cold environment. And when I dunked this rock hard circular sponge that looked like it had hair on it with two eye holes, it got totally soft. And we didn't know that. We hadn't designed that or built that in. That was when I had told this company in Germany to make the material stiffer and denser. That was a byproduct of it. But when it got into warm water, it's like a thermoplastic and it started to get soft. When I took it out and I started to scrub the furniture with it, because it was 50 degrees outside, I could feel it crystallizing in my hands. And the harder it got, the better it scrubbed. But then it was filthy dirty. When I put in the warm water and it got soft, it rinsed out totally clean. And I was like, \"Wow, what is this?\" And I thought I was gonna be throwing these things away. So I left it at my sink. And that night, I started doing the dishes. And I saw it and I picked it up. And I thought, \"Huh, I wonder how this will wash the dishes.\" And it wasn't scratching anything. I'm like, \"This is unbelievable. Where is the flaw? Where is this not going to work?\" And then I picked up a mug. And I realized where it's not going to work. And as I went to put it down, I saw the two eye holes. And I put my fingers into the eyes. And I went all the way into the bottom of the cup and it cleaned the sides at the same time it cleaned the bottom. And then I pulled it out. And I looked at it and I thought, \"Why would you ever hold onto a sponge if the sponge would hold on to you?\" Wait, hold on a second. If I cut a smile in this thing, I could clean the silverware on both sides. I took a knife, cut the smile, put the spoon in and squeezed and pulled it. And I could hear the angels start to sing. The next morning, as the angels ascended back to heaven, Aaron shared his rediscovery with coworkers at the factory. When we sold the company to 3M, they didn't even want it. They thought it was a worthless product and they carved it out of the deal and left it with me because it was so worthless. I said, \"I'll tell you what. Everybody take it home and we'll reconvene in two weeks. Go wash your dishes and come back and tell me. And when they came back, it was clear. Everybody was like, \"This is the greatest dishwashing tool in the world.\" And with the confirmation from his coworkers, Aaron knew he needed to act fast. Aaron personally invested $150,000 into the smiling sponge. He also secured a patent for the shape, design and features of the sponge. But Aaron strategically left out details of the scrubbers material composition, which was its main selling point. When you patent the material, I need to tell you what it's made of, how we make it, all the processes of doing it. And I just told everybody how to copy our exclusive material that only one company knows how to make at this point. If you want to go and try and do it like 100 companies have tried already to copy Scrub Daddy, and it failed miserably. I'm not going to make it easier for them. Let's put it that way. These are both knockoffs. And we'll test it against our regular products. And you can tell right away what's a piece of junk and what's Scrub Daddy. So it's easy to identify when there's a knock off in the market. By August 2011, Aaron knew it was time for Scrub Daddy to hit the shelves. Thanks to a friend who owned five local grocery stores, he pitched Scrub Daddy for about eight hours a day. Nearly every day of the week. He did all this while still serving as a developer and consultant at 3M. But he knew he could do more. He knew he had to leverage the local press. They put on the front page of the Sunday Inquirer in the business section. They said, \"He's the daddy of the Scrub Daddy.\" The website exploded. The phone's lit up. And we started selling a sponge almost two or three minute. The next thing I know, I get a call from a guy who says, \"Have you ever thought about selling this on QVC?\" I was like, \"The women's shopping network? Like, no one watches that.\" He's like, \"Oh, you'd be surprised.\" We went in and we did a little pitch. And they said, \"We love it. And we want you to be the on air person.\" I was like, \"Absolutely not. I'm not going on TV. I don't know how to do that. Next thing you know, I'm in front of the bright lights. And the cameras are coming on. And I am frozen and I'm scared and we don't sell well. It's pretty awful. I went home, I was despondent. I remember just feeling, like, I had one chance to be on TV and I blew it. The broker calls me up and says, \"You're not going to believe this. I just got a call from the buyer and the producer and they loved your energy and they wished that you had more time to talk. They're going to give you another shot.\" I went back on QVC and I told the next host, \"This is probably my last show. Anything that you can do to help me, I will be so appreciative.\" And she said, \"Aaron, I'm gonna go wow, wow, wow. And you just go and do your thing.\" Scrub Daddy became a hit on QVC. And so did Aaron. His confidence on camera convinced him to test out the waters on another big network. I went home and I was bragging to my wife that I was supposed to be on TV. And she was like, \"Oh, shut up. You're an idiot. And our favorite show is coming on called Shark Tank.\" And I watched these guys come in. They had beer flavored ice cream. And it was the worst pitch. They didn't know their numbers. Their product was horrible. I mean, they got eviscerated by Mr. Wonderful. And I said, \"What a bunch of idiots. How do you go on a national TV show and you don't know your numbers? You don't know your product. You misrepresent your company and yourself. I could go on that show and kill the sharks. Actually, how do you go on Shark Tank? Oh, look at that. There's a website. You just fill out this form. Hey. Dear sharks, I'm Aaron Krause from Philadelphia. I've been on QVC, and by the way, here's a link to my last QVC show. Three months later, Aaron received a call from a California number he didn't recognize. I'm an ice hockey coach. My phone was ringing. So I answer the call and it's Shark Tank. And then they assigned me two producers and said, \"We will have a call with you every week. We don't want you to get excited. There's 50,000 applicants and all we do now is have calls with people. But let's pretend that we're gonna let you on Shark Tank. Give me your pitch. I was like, \"Hi, sharks. I'm Aaron Krause from Philadelphia and I'm the daddy of the Scrub Daddy. Today, I'm looking for a $500,000 investment in exchange for 10% equity in the Scrub Daddy business. So they said, \"Okay. That's great. That was seven minutes. We're gonna call you next week. Take it down to six minutes.\" I remember the last time she said there was about 500 people left. And the next time they called, they said, \"Aaron, this will be our last call.\" And I was like, \"You're kidding me? That was literally, like, two months of, like, hiding in corners and doing... No one could know that I was talking to Shark Tank by the way. It was totally confidential. I said, \"Really? That was so much effort and work.\" They said, \"Oh no, because we're flying you out to Los Angeles. The next pitch you're going to do is going to be in front of 30 producers from ABC and Sony.\" Aaron didn't let his opportunity on Shark Tank go to waste. He knew he had one shot to make Scrub Daddy explode positively in the public consciousness. When you're going on Shark Tank, you're not just trying to give the sharks. You're literally demonstrating for seven to 10 million people. You wanted them to also support you. I memorized every one of our numbers, all of our cost of goods sold, all of our customer acquisition costs. I went and studied all the sharks. After getting through the initial pitch with show producers, they put Aaron's preparation to the test when they made an unexpected change. The day of the show, the producer comes in, like, \"Aaron, you ready to go? I'm like, \"I was born ready for this. Let's go.\" He goes, \"Oh no, no, no. We got about another hour. But listen, we subbed Barbara out for this new lady. They call her the queen of QVC and have you ever heard of her? Lori Greiner?\" I was like, \"No. Even though I've been on QVC, like, four times, I never heard of her.\" I walked into Shark Tank going, \"Don't talk about QVC. Don't talk about QVC.\" And I prepared for every thing that someone could say to me. And I prepared to never make a response that made me look arrogant. First one who went out was Herjavec. Herjavec said, \"I don't see the retail vision. I'm out.\" In my mind, I said, \"You're not the brightest, are you dude? Like, really? You don't see the retail vision? Like, look at this smiley face sponge.\" I was like, \"Alright, don't say that to him.\" I said, \"I understand.\" But I meant, \"I understand that you have no idea what you're talking about.\" Then Cuban was the next one out and Cuban said, \"But I'm not a scrub pimp. So I'm out.\" And I was like, \"That hurts, Mark. I wanted to work with you so bad.\" And then, of course, Mr. Wonderful came up. I watched every episode of Shark Tank four times. And then I made a flowchart. So the line goes: Mr. Wonderful asks about the valuation, and you answer it like this. And it goes either this way or this way, right. And that one goes this way, or this way. And I had flowcharts for all of the sharks and how it was going to go. And with Mr. Wonderful, they all ended with him telling me he was out. And so I was like, \"You know what? I'm never letting that happen.\" I'm waiting for him to say some nasty thing to me. And the first thing he does is make the worst offer ever for 50% of the company. And I knew exactly where this was going. So I'm like, laughing. I'm like, \"Yeah, just keep enjoying it. Look around. This is really gonna happen. Ready? Do it.\" Alright, you're out. But there was still one shark Aaron had to face. Lori's like, \"Where are you selling this now?\" I'm like, \"Oh, like some local supermarkets and like some television network?\" \"Oh, like a TV shopping network?\" \"Something like that.\" \"Which one?\" \"Like, I've been on QVC, like, four times, you know, over the last four months.\" And she's like, \"Really? And I'm like, \"I know she's going out. Should I just tell her she's out now?\" And instead she goes, \"You know what? Your pitch was flawless. It was like a QVC pitch. And I know all the little tricks that people do to make things look better on TV. And I watched you really closely. No one else watched it like I did. You didn't use one sponge and one weight and change the texture. You used two different sponges and two different weights. So either one of their sponges is hard, and the other one is soft, or one of the weights is heavy, and the other one's light. I think your whole thing is a scam.\" And I'm like, \"No, no, it's 100% real.\" She goes, \"Okay, if it's real, the sponge that you just gave me, I want to come down and I want to change the texture.\" And I'm like, \"Come on down.\" And she dips it in the hot water. She dips it in the cold water. And the sharks are all screaming, \"Lori! Lori, does it work? Does it work?\" And we're standing this close and she looks at me. She goes, \"Oh my god, it's magic.\" And I'm looking at her going, \"Oh my God, you might be my shark. I can't wait for that to air on national TV because it vindicated everything that I was saying.\" And the night that I air on Shark Tank. I'm waiting for this moment, which never happens. They cut it out of the show. I called the producer and said, \"How could you do that?\" He said, \"Aaron, the show was over in the first two minutes. When you and Lori looked at each other, everyone would have known that you guys were going to be together. I'll go to 20. You got a deal. Got a deal. Alright. Good. Aaron left Shark Tank with $200,000, double what he asked for. That is awesome. And a 20% equity stake deal with Lori Greiner. After the episode aired, the sales just started going through the roof. QVC sales started going through the roof. Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond, Walmart called us. We didn't even have to call them and the product just started flying off the shelves. Aaron's life changed forever. In just 24 hours, Scrub Daddy hit a million dollars in sales. And to keep up with the success, in 2014. Aaron left his position at 3M to focus on Scrub Daddy full time. His new partnership with Lori Greiner would propel Scrub Daddy to new heights, but only with the right vision. Alright, ready? So this is my favorite background. And that's me on Shark Tank as one of the sharks. It started out a little bit, I don't wanna say rocky. But the truth is, like, she had a vision and she said it on the show, she wanted to do an infomercial. It wasn't the direction that I wanted to go because I felt an infomercial is, like, a flash in the pan. Like, you do the Snuggie. And it sells for, like, eight months. And then it's over. And then I explained to her my vision that I wanted to be on the shelves competing with all the other sponge companies. And she said, \"Listen, that is a long road. And it's hard. And if you want to do it, I'm with you. But if you want to sit back and just collect a check, that's the fastest way to get this thing to market.\" And I said, \"I want to do the long way. And I've done it before and I think I can do it again.\" And she said, \"Alright, I guess that's it. We're gonna do it.\" That was the one disagreement that we had. And after that, she was great to work with. She has been an absolute PR train. She goes on to all these shows and talks about how much she loves Scrub Daddy. The thing about Lori and that I really love and respect about her the most, she just knows that I know how to run this thing. And that she's like, \"Aaron, you are a rock star. And if you need my help at all, I'm here for you. And so most of our conversations are mostly friendship stuff. As Scrub Daddy's sales climbed over the years, in March 2021, Aaron decided to expand the brand and open a new facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey, which is about six miles away from Philadelphia. He knew that his vision included more than just the original Scrub Daddy. The new campus allows Aaron and his team to continue working on product innovation. The vision was never one product. If you sit still in business, someone's coming to eat your lunch. We're starting with one product. That launches the company. Once Mommy rolled in, we literally started just inventing new products every year. We do it all in house. I have an engineering department. We have what's called an ideation meeting, where we sit around and talk about what are the needs that we see in the market. And then we look for new channels. We can do everything from laminating to vacuum forming to taking slices of the material to test. Crushing tests. And then we have all these 3D printers. Right now, we're in the middle of printing something. I think it's going to be for the toilet wand. And this is our barbecue grill brush. And everything had to be invented. Everything from the handle to this material to how are they actually going to put this material together. Part of Scrub Daddy's innovative edge is keeping sustainability at their forefront. This is our solar wall. This is actually living, growing plants. And this shows you the amount of energy that we've created lifetime. 124,000 gallons of gas has been saved. Our sponge is literally the longest lasting most durable sponge on the market. And that in itself is sustainable. Like, the regular sponge you're using for a couple of days, and it smells horrible. And they're literally just going into the landfill every couple of days. Ours are lasting for many months. Second thing is we started a recycling program at Scrub Daddy. So you can send your sponge back to us and we give you a $2 credit which pays for all your shipping costs to buy another sponge on our store. And we send them to an industrial recycling facility. They burn hotter than coal. This is a very specific recycling facility where they capture all the emissions. We also make an Eco Daddy. It's made out of recycled water bottles and coconut fibers. And we're sustainable because we're powered off of all solar. We make so much energy that we actually power homes in the neighborhood because we don't use it all. And eight of us now drive electric cars, including me, and we drive our cars off of the sun. If there's one thing Aaron would do differently, it would be to bite the bullet on pricing he felt he deserved. I made all my mistakes in my previous businesses. Luckily, none of them put me out of business. But in my last company, I made one of the most critical mistakes that any entrepreneur can make. I went after volume and played price war when I had the best-in-class product. I had all these patents on buffing pads. And I would compete with everybody out there for the lowest price just so I could keep my volumes up. As for Aaron, he has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. We're actually in the process right now of expanding all over Europe and actually acquiring our European distributor. We have much bigger global presence in five years. There's a lifecycle for businesses. I don't think I want to do this until I'm 90. But at some point, I think we will become an acquisition target for a much larger company. As long as it's the right partner, and they leave us alone, and they let us continue to run the brand, then it's something that I may entertain down the road. And if there's anyone that will let Aaron know about his past mistakes, his family is there to tell him about it. He grew up in a family of five and everyone but him earned a PhD. He says they would often shun him for his career path as he was growing up. For the longest time, I was ridiculed as the black sheep of the family that, you know, I didn't go on to a profession, like, Doctor, lawyer, accountant. Unfortunately, my mom has advanced Alzheimer's, so she doesn't know anything about the business at all. Which is... And that is kind of sad because she also was a huge influence on me growing up and she was constantly the one pushing me in education. And she had a funny way of always motivating me to do stuff. And I wish that she could see the business at this level. My dad's still alive and he's doing great. He's very healthy in his 80s. And I talked to him all the time about the company. And now, I'm the only one in our family that has patents. And I can tell you my dad is awful proud. And today, Aaron says he doesn't feel like the black sheep of the family. Instead, he feels like the golden goose. The reason I'm sitting exactly where I am right now is because of everything that's happened to us. They are all learning experiences. They're things that make us stronger and make us work harder. We know better the next time it comes around. Come on. It's a smiley face sponge company. Look around, like. Hey, are you happy? Did you hear that? We're going with the OG yellow. Who's the king now? I won myself my own product.","srtFormat":{"videoId":"ac1f281f-1c40-4969-99ca-1cac131f540b","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"ac1f281f-1c40-4969-99ca-1cac131f540b/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"The following is not a paid advertisement. Scrub Daddy is the only sponge that changes texture just based on the temperature of the water. That means it could be a soft sponge or a hard sponge in hot or cold water. Now, when it's soft, it gets all the way into cups, bowls and mugs and when it's hard, it can scrub through even the most burned on messes in seconds. But did you know the real story behind that smiley face or you're about to find out in this next episode of the Ground Up? That man you just saw was Aaron Kraus founder and CEO of Scrub Daddy. The Smiley Face sponge company that started in full crop Pennsylvania and has filled cleaning shelves since the episode of Shark Tank aired in October 2012. And since then, they moved to an enormous facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey that features office spaces, a television studio, a warehouse Koi pond and a store for people to buy their products. Some kids that we encountered in the shop acted like it was Christmas Day. No, I just play one on TV. And ready guys. Cleaning is something that is mundane and is boring and people don't enjoy. And when you make it more fun and you make it really effective, you have something that really clicks with people's psyche and scrub. Daddy is actually my hand. The original Scrub Daddy runs for $4 at stores and on the website. But select products can run as high as $38. And if you think you've met every product from the Sponge dynasty, think again, we even put to the test we make. Daddy mommy sponge scour eraser dish daddy power paste, barbecue daddy, scour daddy steel straw cleaner, microfiber towels, streak less cloth scrub daddy sy scrub daddy, toilet scrubbing system, dandelion clean power era gel. Believe it or not, Aaron missed a few. There's also big daddy daddy caddy sponge caddy. Sub daddy, car daddy and daddy. That's a long way of saying that there's a ton of products in the Daddy family over 80 as of today. And with all these products online and on store shelves, the company has racked in over $220 million in sales for 2023 with no sign of slowing down. We have the best sponge in the world. It's worth every dime that we charge for it and the profit that we make on it sustains this business and is what's led us to grow so rapidly because we're able to reinvest over and over and come up with new products. But did Aaron and Scrub daddy get here. Well, let's rewind back to when he was just a little kid in Wynwood, Pennsylvania. Both of my parents are physicians. At 10 years old, my dad started teaching me to wash the dishes, which is actually how I ended up being in a sponge company. I was about 10 years old and I was laying in bed and I was like staring at the light switch going. Oh my God. I need a way to turn that off. The next day I got a bunch of wheel casters and dental floss because that was the longest piece of rope I could find. And I hooked up this whole pulley system so I could turn the lights on and off from my bed. And that was like the first time I realized that I could come up with a crazy idea, build something and change my world. And from then I literally started looking at the world completely different before the daddy of the scrub, daddy was making his fortune washing dishes and kitchenware. He was making money washing something much bigger. I've been washing cars since I was a kid, became a professional car washer. When my dad told me I could make $10 a car started washing cars in the neighborhood. I'd been washing cars throughout all of high school to make. I and I just decided I was just going to start my own car washing business. Aaron went on to Syracuse University. And graduated with a degree in psychology in October 1992. He returned home to start his car washing business while he was proud to be his own boss. Some of his family didn't receive the news too well. My dad said, you know, son, I just paid $100,000 for your education in psychology. What are you going to do with your life? I said, well, I've been washing cars my whole life. I think I'll wash cars. My mom was crying, my grandma said, just disown him and my dad said, so, you know, until the end of the summer to make it a real business and get it out of my garage. And that's exactly what Aaron did, but not only that, Aaron kept his innovative side going while working at the car wash. That was in 1994 when I invented my first big invention, I got a patent on it and that was for a buffing pad for polishing cars. It was all by hand. It was detailing four years into it. I basically damaged a car and I didn't think it was my fault. I thought it was the shape of the pad. And I just immediately, I had this idea of like, why is the pad cylindrical? It should have edges and why doesn't it have a recess in the back where the backing plate would be protected? And I literally went around and started asking the distributors. I'm looking for a pad that looks like this. And they were like, I never heard of that. After the second guy I said, forget I mentioned. And I went and got a patent attorney and I filed for my first patent. That was how I learned about polyester, urethane foam, polyester, urethane foam, which became a key part of scrub daddy is a flexible open cell foam with a range of qualities. It's known for its ability to compress, resist mildew and insulate. I got a course education in every company in the world that makes urethane foams because we started buying those foams and making them into buffing pads. It wasn't for years and years and years later that I found the Scrub Daddy material, which is a very, very unique, highly engineered polymer. And at that time, it was only made by one company in Germany and this company in Germany sent me this rock hard material that was yellow. I started cleaning my hand and it was unbelievable how well it worked, how easily it rinsed clean with the help of German phone manufacturer. Phone partner, Aaron could modify the pore size and density of his buffing pad. I realized instantly we had a home run. We put some ads in some trade magazines. In three months, we were selling buffing pads all over the United States and within six months we were selling it all over the world Scrub Daddy. Now calls this material flex texture in 1995 Aaron sold his car washing business and turned his focus to a new venture, dedication to detail a buffing pad manufacturer. This is our first office. This is the second when they send me the materials. I basically cut a rectangular shape like a traditional sponge and I just started scrubbing my hands with it. What you find out is that this is an uncomfortable way to hold a sponge like this is not the shape of your hand. Actually, that's the shape of your hand. And it turns out that a circle is the easiest thing to hold on to while you're scrubbing your hands. And then I was like, you know, I don't want to go around my fingers. I'll just cut a hole in it and I'll just clean my fingers. It's so much easier. Then I was like, you know what I need to get underneath the nail. So I took a knife and I cut some ridges. So I cut another hole so I could put two fingers in and grab it. So it had these two eyes, what looked like a hair and it started to look like a little face. Aaron says he stopped selling the after a year because of low sales in the auto market. And on September 3rd, 2008 dedication of detail was bought out by multinational manufacturer three M. Aaron Sponges ended up sitting at the back of the factory for five years until March 2011 when they found a new life, my wife started nagging me to clean the lawn furniture and I just took the traditional sponge that I had, which is yellow on one side and green on the other. And I just started to scrub the mold and it actually scratched the paint off. That's when I remember this box of this hard plastic scrubbers that we had and I brought them home and I made a bucket of warm soapy water because I didn't want to work in a really cold environment. And when I dumped this rock hard circular sponge that looked like it had hair on it, two eye holes, it got totally soft and we didn't know that we hadn't designed that or built that in. That was when I had told this company in Germany to make the material stiffer and denser that was a by product of it. But when it got into warm water, it's like a thermoplastic and it started to get soft. But when I took it out and I started to scrub the furniture with it because it was 50 degrees outside. I could feel it crystallizing in my hands and the harder it got, the better it scrubbed. But then it was filthy, dirty. When I put it in the warm water and it got soft, it rinsed out totally clean. And I was like, wow, what is this? And I thought I was going to be throwing these things away. So I left it at my sink and that night I started doing the dishes and I saw it and I picked it up and I thought, huh, I wonder how this will wash the dishes and it wasn't scratching anything. I'm like, this is unbelievable. Where is the flaw, where is this not going to work? And then I picked up a mug and I realized where it's not gonna work. And as I went to put it down, I saw the two eye holes and I put my fingers into the eyes and I went all the way into the bottom of the cup and it cleaned the sides. At the same time, it cleaned the bottom and then I pulled it out and I looked at it and I thought, why would you ever hold on to a sponge if the sponge would hold on to you? Wait, hold on a second. If I cut a smile in this thing, I could clean the silverware on both sides. I took a knife, cut the smile, put the spoon in, squeeze and pulled it. And I could hear the angels start to sing the next morning as the angels ascend it back to heaven. Aaron shared his rediscovery with co workers at the factory. When we sold the company at three, they didn't even want it. They thought it was a worthless product and they carved it out of the deal and left it with me because it was so worthless. I said, I'll tell you what, everybody take it home and we'll reconvene in two weeks. Go wash your dishes and come back and tell me. And when they came back, it was clear everybody was like, this is the greatest dishwashing tool in the world. And with the confirmation from his co workers, Aaron knew he needed to act fast. Aaron personally invested $150,000 into the smiling sponge. He also secured a patent for the shape design and features of the sponge. But Aaron strategically left out details of the scrubber's material composition, which was his main selling point. When you patent the material, I need to tell you what it's made of how we make it all the processes of doing it. And I just told everybody how to copy our exclusive material that only one company knows how to make at this point. If you want to go and try and do it like 100 companies have tried already to copy Scrub Daddy and have failed miserably. I'm not going to make it easier for them. Let's put it that way. These are both knockoffs and we'll test it against our regular products. And you can tell right away what's a piece of junk and what's scrub daddy. So it's easy to identify when there's a knock off in the market by August 2011. Aaron knew it was time for scrub daddy. To hit the shelves. Thanks to a friend who owned five local grocery stores. He pitched Scrub daddy for about eight hours a day, nearly every day of the week. He did all this while still serving as a developer and consultant at three M. But he knew he could do more. He knew he had to leverage the local press. They put on the front page of the Sunday. Inquire in the business section who said he's the daddy of the scrub daddy. The website exploded, the phones lit up and we started selling a sponge almost two or three a minute. The next thing I know, I get a call from a guy who says, have you ever thought about selling this on QVC? And I was like the women's shopping network? Like no one watches that he's like, oh, you'd be surprised. We went in and we did a little pitch and they said we love it and we want you to be the on air person. I was like, absolutely not. I, I'm not going on TV. I don't know how to do that. Next thing, you know, I'm in front of the bright lights and the cameras are coming on and I am frozen and I'm scared and we don't sell well. It's pretty awful. I went home. I was despondent. I remember just feeling like I had one chance to be on TV. And I blew it. The broker calls me up and says, you're not gonna believe this. I just got a call from the buyer and the producer and they loved your energy and they wish that you had more time to talk. They're going to give you another shot. I went back on QVC and I told the next host, this is probably my last show. Anything that you can do to help me, I will be so appreciative. And she said, Aaron, I'm going to go, wow. Wow. Wow. And you just go and do your thing. Scrub Daddy became a hit on QVC. And so did in his confidence on camera, convinced him to test out the waters on another big network. I went home and I was bragging to my wife that I was supposed to be on TV. And she was like, oh, shut up, you're an idiot. And our favorite show was coming on called Shark Tank. And I watched these guys come in, they had beer flavored ice cream and it was the worst pitch. They didn't know their numbers. Their product was horrible. I mean, they got a eviscerated by Mr Wonderful. And I said, what a bunch of idiots. How you go on a national TV show and you don't know your numbers. You don't know your product. You misrepresent your company and yourself. I could go on that show and Kill The Sharks actually. How do you go on Shark Tank? Oh, look at that. There's a website you just fill out this form. Hey dear Sharks. I'm Aaron Krause from Philadelphia. I've been on QVC. And by the way, here's a link to my last Q BC show. Three months later, Aaron received a call from a California number. He didn't recognize. I'm an ice hockey coach. My phone was ringing, so I answered the call and it's Shark Tank and then they assigned me to producers and said we will have a call with you every week. We don't want you to get excited. There's 50,000 applicants and all we do now is have calls with people. But let's pretend that we're going to let you on Shark Tank. Give me your pitch. And I was like, hi Sharks. I'm Aaron Kraus of Philadelphia and I'm the daddy of a scrub daddy today. I'm looking for a $500,000 investment in exchange for 10% equity in the scrub daddy business. So they said, ok, that's great. That was seven minutes and we're gonna call you next week. Take it down to six minutes. I remember the last time she said there was about 500 people left and the next time they called, they said, Aaron, this will be our last call. And I was like, you're kidding me. That was literally like two months of like hiding in corners and doing no one could know that I was talking to Shark Tank. By the way, it was totally confidential. I said, really? There was so much effort in work. They said, oh no, because we're flying you out to Los Angeles. The next pitch you're going to do is going to be in front of 30 producers from ABC and Sony Aaron didn't let his opportunity on shark tank go to waste. He knew he had one shot to make scrub daddy explode. Positive. I in the public consciousness when you're going on a shark tank, you're not just trying to get the sharks. You're literally demonstrating for 7 to 10 million people. You wanted them to also support you. I memorized every one of our numbers. All of our cost of goods sold all of our customer acquisition costs. I went and studied all the sharks. After getting through the initial pitch with show producers, they put Aaron's preparation to the test when they made an unexpected change. The day of the show, the producer comes in like Aaron, you ready to go? I'm like I was born ready for this. Let's go. He got about about another hour. But um listen, we subbed Barbara out for this new lady. They call her the queen of QVC. And have you ever heard of her, Laurie Greer? I was like, no, even though I've been on QVC like four times, I never heard of her. I walked into a shark tank going, don't talk about QVC, don't talk about QVC and I prepared for everything that someone could say to me and I prepared to never make a response that made me look arrogant. The first one that went out was Hershey. Hershey said, I don't see the retail, I, in my mind, I said, you're right. Brightest. Are you dude? Like really? You don't see the retail vision, like look at the smiley face. But I was like, all right, don't say that to him. I said, I understand but I meant, I understand that you have no idea what you're talking about. Then Cuban was the next one out. And Cuban said, but I'm not a scrub pimp. So I'm out and I was like, that hurts Mark. I wanted to work with you so bad. And then of course, Mr Wonderful came up, I watched every episode of Shark Tank four times and then I made a flow chart. So the line goes, Mr Wonderful, asked about the valuation and you answer it like this and it goes either this way or this way, right? And that one goes this way or this way. And I had flow charts for all the sharks and how it was going to go. And with Mr Wonderful, they all ended with him telling me he was out. And so I was like, you know what, I'm never letting that happen. I'm waiting for him to say some nasty thing to me. And the first thing he does is make the worst offer ever for 50% of the company. And I knew exactly where this was going. So I'm like laughing. I'm like, yeah, just keep it joy. Look around. This is really gonna happen. Ready? Do it. All right, you're out. But there was still one shark, Aaron had a face. Laurie is like, where are you selling this? Now? I'm like, oh, like some local supermarkets and, uh, like some television network, you know? Oh, like a TV, shopping network, something like that. Which one I've been on Q BC, like four times, you know, over the last four months. And she's like, really? And I'm like, I know she's going out, she said, I just tell her she's out now and instead she goes, you know what your pitch was flawless. It was like a QVC pitch. And I know all the little tricks that people do to make things look better on TV. And I watched you really closely. No one else watched it like I did. You didn't use one sponge and one weight and change the texture. You use two different sponges and two different weights. So either one of the sponges is hard and the other one's soft or one of the weights is heavy and the other one's light. I think your whole thing is a scam. And I'm like, no, no, it's 100% real. She goes ok. If it's real, the sponge that you just gave me, I want to come down and I want to change the texture and I'm like, come on down and she dips it in the hot water. She dips in the cold water and the sharks are all screaming. Laurie. Laurie. Does it work? Does it work? And we're standing this close and she looks at me and she goes, oh my God, it's magic. And I'm looking at her going, oh my God. You might be my shark. I can't wait for that to air on National TV, because it vindicated everything that I was saying. And the night that I air on shark tank, I'm waiting for this moment which never happens. They cut it out of the show. I called the producer and said, how could you do that? He said, Aaron, the show is over in the first two minutes when you and Laurie looked at hr everyone would have known that you guys were going to be together. I'll go to 20 we got a deal. We got a deal. Aaron left shark tank with $200,000 double what he asked for that is awesome. And a 20% equity stake deal with Laurie Grenier. After the episode aired, the sales just started going through the roof QVC sales started going through the roof bed bath and beyond Wal Mart called us. We didn't even have to call them and you know, probably to start, you know, fly off the shelves. Aaron's life changed forever in just 24 hours. Scrub daddy hit a million dollars in sales and to keep up with the success in 2014, Aaron left his position at three M to focus on Scrub Daddy full time. His new partnership with Laurie Grenier would propel Scrub Daddy to new heights, but only with the right vision. All right, ready. So this is my favorite background. And that's me on Shark Tank as one of the sharks. It started out a little bit. I don't want to say Rocky, but the truth is like she had a vision and she said it on the show, she wanted to do an infomercial. It wasn't the direction that I wanted to go because I thought an infomercial is like a flash in the pan. Like you do the snuggie and it sells for like eight months and then it's over and then I explained to her, my vision that I wanted to be on the shelves competing with all the sponge companies. And she said, listen, that is a long road and it's hard. And if you want to do it, I'm with you. But if you want to sit back and just collect a check, that's the fastest way to get the sign to market. And I said, I want to do the long way. I've done it before and I think I can do it again. And she said, all right, I guess that's it. We're going to do it. That was the one disagreement that we had. And after that, she was great to work with. She's been an absolute pr trained. She goes on to all these shows and talks about how much she loves scrub daddy. The thing about Laurie and that I really love and respect about her the most. She just knows that I know how to run this thing and that she's like Aaron, you are a rock star and if you need my help at all, I'm here for you. And so most of our conversations are mostly friendship stuff as Scrub Daddy sales climbed over the years in March 2021 Aaron decided to expand the brand and open a new facility in Pennsauken, New Jersey, which is about six miles away from Philadelphia. He knew that his vision included more than just the original Scrub Daddy. The new campus allows Aaron and his team to continue working on product innovation. The vision was never one product. If you sit still in business, someone's coming to your life. We're starting with one product that launches the company. Once mommy rolled in, we literally started just inventing new products every year. We do it all in house. I have an engineering department. We have what's called an ideation meeting where we sit around and talk about what are the needs that we see in the market. And then we look for new channels, we can do everything from laminating to vacuum forming, to taking slices of the material, to test crushing tests. And then we have all these 3d printers right now, we're in the middle of printing something. I think it's gonna be for the toilet wand. And this is our barbecue grill brush and everything had to be invented. Everything from the handle to this material to how are they actually going to put this material together? Part of scrub. Daddy's innovative edge is keeping sustainability at their forefront. This is our solar wall. This is actually living growing plants and this shows you the amount of energy that we've created lifetime 124,000 gallons of gas has been saved. Our sponge is literally the longest lasting most dal sponge on the market and that in itself is sustainable like the regular sponge you're using for a couple of days and it smells horrible and they're literally just going on the landfill every couple of days. Ours are lasting for many months. Second thing is we started a recycling program at scrub Day so you can send your sponge back to us and we give you a $2 credit which pays for all your shipping costs to buy another sponge on our store and we send them to an industrial recycling facility. They burn hotter than coal. This is a very specific recycling facility where they capture all the emissions. We also make an Eco Daddy, it's made out of recycled water bottles and coconut fibers and we're sustainable because we're powered off of all solar. We make so much energy that we actually power homes in the neighborhood because we don't use it all. And eight of us now drive electric cars, including me and we drive our cars off of the sun. If there's one thing Aaron would do differently, it would be to bite the bullet on pricing. He felt he deserved. I made all my mistakes in my previous businesses. Luckily none of them put me out of business. But in my last company, I made one of the most critical mistakes that any entrepreneur can make. I went after volume and played price war. When I had the best in class product, I had all these patents on buffing pads and I would compete with everybody out there for the lowest price just so I could keep my volumes up. As for Aaron, he has no intention of slowing down any time soon. We're actually in the process right now of expanding all over Europe and actually acquiring our European distributor. We have much bigger global presence in five years. There's a life cycle for businesses. I don't think to do this until I'm 90. But at some point, I think we will become an acquisition target for, you know, a much larger company as long as it's the right partner and they leave us alone and they let us continue to run the brand, then it's something that I may entertain down the road. And if there's anyone that will let Aaron know about his past mistakes. His family is there to tell him about it. He grew up in a family of five and everyone but him earned a phd. He says they would often shun him for his career path as he was growing up for the longest time, I was ridiculed as the black sheep of the family that, you know, I didn't go on to a profession like doctor, lawyer accountant. Unfortunately, my mom has advanced Alzheimer's so she doesn't know anything about the business at all, which is that. And that is kind of sad because she also was a huge influence on me growing up. And she was constantly the one pushing me in education. And she had a funny way of always motivating me to do stuff. And I wish that she uh she could see the business at this level. My dad's still alive and he's doing great. He's very healthy in his eighties and I talk to him all the time about the company and now I'm the only one in our family that has patents. And I can tell you my dad is awful proud. And today Aaron says he doesn't feel like the black sheep of the family. Instead, he feels like the golden goose. The reason I'm sitting exactly where I am right now is because of everything that's happened to us. They are all learning experiences, they are things that make us stronger, make us work harder. Uh We know better, the next time it comes around. Come on, it's a smiley face sponge company. Look around like, hey, are you happy? I couldn't be happier. Did you hear that? We're going to OG Yellow. Who's the king? Then? I want myself my own product.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1705081210413,"updatedAt":1706888836202,"irisTag":"features","videoPublishDate":1706888836202,"duration":{"value":1491,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"18a736a9-835b-4d14-a4b9-47b5bb99a83b","name":"How I raised $50K in 9 days to open a bar showing only women’s sports","slug":"how-i-raised-$50k-in-9-days-to-open-a-bar-showing-only-women’s-sports","shortDescription":"Jenny Nguyen was sick of watching women’s games on mute at sports bars, so she opened her own.

I'm the founder and owner of the sports bra here in Portland Oregon. It's a women's sports bar. When you walk into a sports bar, traditional sports bar, you expect 24 7 coverage because there is 24 7 coverage of men's sports. Statistically 95% of all sports that are on tv or men's sports. And so our goal here is to take the 5% that is on tv and just put it on blast. I just knew I wanted to feel familiar. I wanted people to walk in and just feel like it was a regular sports bar. It's just a lot of decor stuff, memorabilia and that kind of that warmth of being in a familiar sports bar kind of dark, a little bit cozy. But then you change what's represented, you change what's on the tv. These are women's team flags. All the athletes are female athletes. That kind of stuff. When people say women's sports aren't popular. It's because people aren't seeing it. It's a bit of a catch 22. It's like, well nobody's watching women's sports. Well, no women's sports remain shown. It's really difficult. It's really difficult. It's like you have to be in an Internet detectives in order to find where to watch women. I was trying to stream the national team game the other day at work with some friends and we couldn't find it. I love the idea that if this place was packed, people driving by walking by talking about it would see that there are women's sports fans and they would see it. They'd hear about it and they'd be like, oh, people are into it. It shouldn't be a novelty, but it is a novelty. There's been women's athletics that have been agreeable on media for years. You know, women's tennis has always been an agreeable sport, you know, that people watched. And I think what, what I saw happen is that I saw women's basketball. Uh and ESPN really developed a strong relationship and we began to see more and more women's basketball. Um you also have that sec, you have the PAC 12, you have so many of those networks now that need more content. And so there's much more women's content available for about 14.5 years. I played pickup basketball with this hodgepodge group of women, we shared a love of sports and so we would go out before or after, um pick up and try to watch games and it was always a chore, you know, always trying to find Bar that was big enough to take a group of 12 and then also who would change the channel for us. And then not only that, but some of the people in our group are vegan, those dietary restrictions are really hard to find at sports bars. And then a large portion of our basketball group are queer folks or non binary folks. And so looking the way we do kind of feels unsafe in a lot of the traditional sports bars, There was one particular moment that stands out in my mind when it kind of clicked and it was in 2018 when our basketball group went to go watch the N. C. Double A women's championship. And I think there was like three seconds left, the game was tied and eric takes one dribble and launches a three pointer right at the buzzer and it goes in. So here we were like a dozen of us just going crazy on our own. I threw my hat across the bar and while I was standing, I realized that no one else in the entire bar was watching our game. So everybody's staring at us like we're absolutely bonkers. Anyway, we're leaving the bar and we're kind of like milling around the parking lot still kind of just high off of the game. And I was just like, oh my God, that was the best game I've ever seen. And one of my friends was just like, yeah, it would have been so awesome if the sound had been on, I hadn't realized that we'd watched the whole game with no sound. Right. Then I said, the only way we're ever going to watch a women's game in its full glory is if we had our own place. And I remember driving home and I was like, oh, we had our own place, what we call it, you know? And the very first name that popped into my head was the sports bras. It just made so much sense. All you're doing is you're taking a sports bar and you're changing the channel on the tv. So it's like a tiny switch and then it just became an inside joke. Whenever we went out to sports bars and we were frustrated with something, we'd be like, oh at the sports bra, this game would be on, oh, it's a sports bra. You know, they have gluten free buns for my burger with the sports bra. We'd never run out of toilet paper in the women's restroom or like all the things that, you know, sports bars kind of fall short on all the time. We got to talking about how when we were kids, if our parents had taken us to a place like a sports bra, how much of a difference that would have made in our lives to have a place that we walked into and felt represented or felt seen once I launched the Kickstarter, it was the first time that I put it out into the world. And by day three I was getting emails from all across the country right away. I had people coming up and being like, thank you for doing this, thank you for being an asian woman who opened a business and then people coming up and being like, oh a lesbian owned bar. I didn't think about it. I was just so focused on the sports bra and getting this off the ground. I created a space that I want to be in. So it is me in the end, but when I was conceptualizing it, I didn't think about it like that. I just wanted it to be a place that I felt good. I thought being a chef would help and I think it has, I mean, I think it's helped me like 0.5% 99 point whatever, 95% I don't know anything about. That was hard reaching out to people asking for help learning as much as possible. I mean, the learning curve for me was like a straight up and down wall for like the last year, I would say doing things with intentionality was really huge for me. And so I thought about how women's sports is underrepresented. And then I thought about what else is underrepresented. And if you want to create a space that's for everybody, you gotta try to represent everybody if we can do that through our menu. If we can do that through our physical space, let's do it. At the very beginning, I reached out to like network streaming services, All these things to get permission to play a bunch of different things that on top of trying to open a business was a lot of work. I felt like it was somebody else's full time job to try to find content. So just women's sports is a national sports media company and they have like hundreds and hundreds of hours of digital media on Youtube. So I reached out to them and I just told them about the sports bra, this concept and they're like, we love what you're doing, what do you need from us. And I was like, I'd love to have your digital content and they were like, okay, what else? Like literally that's how it went and like my heart like burst out of my chest. And then I reached out to ESPN and the same thing happened. I was on a call with seven like female executives from ESPN W and they were just over the moon with the concept. But once the word got out, the roles got reversed, then it was networks streaming services, all of these other things reaching out to us asking us to play their stuff at the very beginning, we definitely had some issues with haters. There was some like right wing blog that came out and I probably got like 45 1 star reviews saying things like oh they wouldn't let me in because I had a beard or oh they spent my burger when they found out I was a man or you know, like just all kinds of ridiculous stuff. One of them said that I held them down and made them watch the W. N. B. A. Playoffs. I would read the comment, I'd be like, oh what do I say back to this guy. And as I was thinking it like 16 other people responded with like way better things than I could have said. And I was just like, Oh the community has got this and that's how it's always been. We were able to be there on their opening night and I think that that was the moment that you could see that Portland was here to lift jenny and her organization up. I get tingles when I think about that night because the line went around the corner, there's definitely a community that just kind of I think was already here and now has a place to gather at the bronze, which is really nice. It feels like a place that I feel really comfortable in a place where I can be myself and watch things that actually are interesting to me and have that not be something that is viewed as an inconvenience to other people, but it's celebrated. People ask me jenny, why hasn't anyone done this before? Seeing how difficult it was for me to get open and get the content and all the, all the stuff that we need to make it a success so far. I don't think it would have been possible five years ago with the content that was on tv or with the investment or the interest in women's support. And I think timing was just right now for it to happen. I honestly think in the next 10 years women's sports could overshadow men's sports as far as popularity goes. I think a company like the sports bra is proving too many other companies within Portland's or outside of Portland that you can have a successful business focusing on women's sports. You know, like the, the NWSL championship game was played on broadcast on CBS and like a ton, almost a million people tuned in and that's a really big deal. So like, it's nice to finally see that. I think the kind of powers that be in sports economics are paying attention to women's sports and starting to recognize the value and we don't need to question whether it's a good idea or not and just commit to supporting women in athletics for real cultural change to happen. And I think women's sports is about cultural change, real cultural change takes, you know, according to Gloria steinem takes about 100 years. And so I think we're about halfway through that as women's sports are shown over time, we get a chance to fall in love with the athletes the same way that we do for men's sports. You know, so we can show women's sports and we can be able to prove that women will watch, men will watch families will watch women playing sports. I've had, I don't know, maybe 70 people reach out asking to open a sports bra in their town or city, um, multiple investors, just hordes of interest. Um, but besides that I've had people reach out who want to open their own thing. That is a women's sports bar. I've had sports bar owners reach out and ask how they can incorporate more women's sports into their sports bar. And so all of these things to me is part of the mission jenny. And the people around this saw a need and they're like, well, we're not gonna wait for anyone to do it, we're just gonna make it happen. So much of what we experience is, what is in existence, right? It's hard to know what the possibilities are if you can't see it.

And at my grand opening, I had about 1200 people, I couldn't believe that so many people would stand out in line to support me and that's when I knew I had something really big. I was on the front page of the New York Times in the food section. Like we built a multimillion dollar business and that was game changing for me. Yeah, Hey, what's up? It's pinky cole. I'm 35 years old and I'm the founder and ceo of the world famous $100 million brand, slutty vegan A. T. L. Born and bred in Atlanta Georgia, having a television background. I said, you know what, I know what people watch when they watch tv, they want stuff that's in your face, racy raunchy, that's going to make them pay attention. But when you think about veganism, veganism has always been known to be pure flavorless, clean, very clean, very green. And I said the two most pleasurable experiences in life is sex and food. If I can make people think about sex and think about food at the same time, I know that I can peel the layer back and educate you about veganism in a way that you've never seen it before. I'm originally from Baltimore Maryland. I grew up in a single parent household. My father did 23 years in prison while my mother worked multiple jobs to make sure that she took care of the family. I can remember my mom working so many jobs and learning how to cook with my grandmother because my mother was always gone working or pursuing her own entrepreneurial endeavors as a musician. My father was and is an entrepreneur even behind bars, he would call me and tell me books to read, he would teach me about stocks, he would teach me how financial independence was the most important thing in this world and I became a hustler at a very young age, I used to throw parties, I used to sell candy, I would sell food when I graduated from college, I didn't have any job lined up except for teach for America and I'm like, I don't want to be a teacher, no shade to the teachers, but I knew that it was in the middle of a recession and I had to figure it out. So I packed up my bags and moved to Houston texas to work at teach for America. I was out there for five days and I realized that I do not want to do this and my friend gave me $40 and I went to the airport and I can remember sitting in the airport with my yorkie Rudy and a guy walked up to me and I was bawling crying and was like, what's wrong with you? And I'm just like, I'm not happy, I don't want to be a teacher inside of the classroom, I'm gonna in other ways and he said I'll be right back. Do you know this man walked away from me and he came back and he gave me $240 just enough money to get me and my dog Rudy home and I never looked back after that. I moved to los Angeles California to be an actress and then I started doing background work and I thought that I was good at it. But then one of my sorority sisters said, listen, you were broke, you need some money, I'm gonna give you a job working in television while I was working at the Maury show. I had this bright idea to open up a jamaican restaurant and don't ask me why I just like a Jamaican restaurant, let's do it. I actually took over somebody's lease and I was paying $2400 a month, which is crazy now because you can barely $2400 a month, that's a light bill. Now. I went to Google and Youtube and I started learning everything I could learn about the restaurant industry, I barely knew what I was doing. I still don't know what I'm doing, but I barely knew what I was doing. I had the restaurant for about two years and then I had a grease fire and literally lost everything in the grease fire. My car got refold, I got kicked out of my apartment, I went flat broke, I got an opportunity to work in tv again, I was working as a casting director and I was done with restaurants, I was working on a Tv show, they had a hiatus and I started delivering for doordash and while I was delivering for doordash, I'm like okay, cool ghost kitchens, I've never heard of ghost kitchens, but I see it happening in L. A. I realized I was just preparing for what I was about to create just a couple of months later and when they asked me to go to Atlanta temporarily to work on the show, it hit me like a light bulb and I came up with this crazy as concept called slutty vegan. I didn't have anything written down, I didn't have a blueprint, I didn't have a business plan, it was just an idea that sounded good. I started slutty vegan as a ghost kitchen, It was like a $5,000 startup cost to start slutty vegan. So I had to get my permits, I had to get the facility which was like $1,200. I had to order my food. I had to get my first employees, I had to set up all of my online digital delivery platforms. A lot of entrepreneurs don't realize that if you really want to grow a company, you have to reinvest everything. When I tell you every single time I was reinvesting, I was not taking any money for myself. At first I was just making sure that my employees were paid and that I had food in my business. The reason why I started a food truck is because the facility told me that I had too many people coming to the building so I had to go, so they put me in a parking lot and I had to find a food truck on the fly, didn't know anything about a food truck. The food truck was $45,000, so I had to put $10,000 down and every single week I was paying like $3400 every single week to make sure that I could pay it off and I paid that off in like like two months, two or three months. I got a DM from somebody on Instagram and he told me that there was a restaurant that they were leaving the restaurant and it was available if I wanted to rent it because of my confidence, I got me at least paying $1,200 and 650 square foot space. And at my grand opening I had about 1200 people. I couldn't believe that so many people would stand out in line to support me and that's when I knew I had something really big. It's the people who are the meat eaters that come to slutty vegan most because one, they want to learn what the hype is about to, they have an idea that they can try this vegan thing and if it's good, maybe I can continue on this path and three slutty vegan is a vibe. Uh I'll be honest, I wasn't the most savvy business person when I started study vegan, but when it came to like price and I'm just like, okay, $16 sounds like it would make sense, that's the price. Like I didn't do any like extra calculations, but I grew as a business owner, I actually met the ceo of shake shack first randy Geraghty and I reached out to him, I'm like, hey, randy, you don't know me, but I got a really popular restaurant in Atlanta and I would love to be able to sit down with you because one thing about pinky cole is, I'm gonna shoot my shot, He responded, we went to lunch and and we built a friendship and ever since then he has been such a great mentor to me. And then a few months later I get a call saying that Danny meyer came to slutty vegan on a late night with a few of his friends and he loved the experience and they wanted to talk. It took a long time to get the investment. It took about nine months slutty vegan will be a billion dollar company from my mouth to everybody's ears is listening to this. Four years ago, slutty vegan was just a ghost kitchen concept and four years later the company is now valued at $100 million when you come to slutty vegan, it's a party, The atmosphere is just amazing, the music is booming through the speakers, the employees are dancing, everybody wants to be a part of that. The fact that I have $100 million business, I still pinch myself every day. Like I'm not talking about a million, I ain't talking about five million, I'm talking about a black woman who owns $100 million business. Forget the fact that I'm just a black woman, a woman, a minority owned business, A woman whose family is from Jamaica who comes from humble beginnings who literally has never had a silver spoon in her mouth. Like you are looking at the new american dream, I don't care if you're black, white, blue, yellow, green, funny vegan, it's for everybody.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1674164687414,"updatedAt":1686689980638,"irisTag":"most powerful women","videoPublishDate":1674086400000,"duration":{"value":560,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d","name":"How we started a company helping 500,000 people In wheelchairs","slug":"how-we-started-a-company-helping-500,000-people-in-wheelchairs","shortDescription":"Award-winning songwriter Barry Dean and brother Jered Dean cofounded LUCI, a company that's changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","longDescription":"Award-winning songwriter Barry Dean and brother Jered Dean cofounded LUCI, a company that's changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","seoTitle":"How LUCI is helping 500,000 people In wheelchairs","seoDescription":"LUCI is changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","socialTitle":"How we started a company helping 500,000 people In wheelchairs","socialDescription":"Award-winning songwriter Barry Dean and brother Jered Dean cofounded LUCI, a company that's changing an industry by turning “dumb wheelchairs into smart wheelchairs.”","tags":[{"name":"luci","type":"tag","label":"luci"},{"name":"accessibility","type":"tag","label":"accessibility"},{"name":"health_care","type":"tag","label":"Health care"},{"name":"rhiannon","type":"tag","label":"Rhiannon"},{"name":"lucy","type":"tag","label":"Lucy"},{"name":"barry_dean","type":"tag","label":"Barry Dean"},{"name":"jered_dean","type":"tag","label":"Jered Dean"},{"name":"success","type":"tag","label":"success"}],"categories":[{"name":"Series","type":"category","label":"Series"}],"section":{"name":"Tech","type":"section","label":"Tech"},"playlists":["The Ground Up"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photograph by Ted Willis and Corey Shepherd for Fortune","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"e562c76c-acae-4003-8725-90f6f940ed7d/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Rhiannon is active, she races in the winter special olympics every year she likes to play indoor soccer, she wants that full life. And so for her to have that full book of memories, she's got to be able to get out and do things and lucy makes it easier and easier and the easier something is, the more we can pack into a day. Lucy is truly an innovative product by the most innovative product I've seen in about 10 years that can really impact clients functionally help them to either drive a power chair where perhaps they couldn't do that at all before or certainly drive it with much better confidence, competence and safety. So it's very exciting. Were the first company in this industry to ever make a smart connected device. Our ability to push out over the air update and have lucy keep getting smarter and smarter over time is a completely new idea in this industry. So lucy is an add on accessory for a power wheelchair that turns a dumb wheelchair into a smart wheelchair. We add sensors in the brain and connectivity to the power wheelchair so that the user has increased independence. That helps not run into things. Not drive off things, connects the user to their team and to the modern world. Obviously its mission. All we're you know, we're dealing with my daughter, his niece going, we need to solve a problem and all her friends, you know that are in the same boat. She has cerebral palsy. She gets a power chair when she's maybe five or about to be five and she touched the trigger. And it the speed had not been a justice. And it took off you know six miles an hour straight into a wall and she was fine. But I then promptly parked in the garage because I was like this is too scary. I wish I could say we sat down and said we're going to start a company. It was absolutely not that it was weird solve a technical problem, build the I. P. And the prototypes and then surely there will be companies that you know that that will do this. My basement became the headquarters of lucy for a while about a year later. I think we got our first three employees and then got an actual space. But yeah Catherine's been the north star from the beginning and then we've added two and met so many amazing people. Rhiannon was born with a rare birth defect called skit successfully. So it's a development delay in the brain and it affects her motor and verbal. Um So she's highly intelligent but you know she's not able to walk. My name is I am 16. I am my high school junior with her skits and hopefully she also has spasticity. So when she's trying to make her body do something sometimes the body will go the opposite direction or her tone will kick in and she'll go full forward and you can see the scars around the house where the chair would get up against and nothing slows it down. There's a lot of injuries in the wheelchair space more than there are people having motorcycle injuries and ending up in the er, 175,000 year. People ending up in the er, because of wheelchair injuries using a power chair is actually tougher than I think a lot of people think it takes learning in order to operate this very heavy device within an environment. These wheelchairs cost as much as a car. They weigh 3 to £500 without the person in them, but there's no modern technology on them. I mean, it's really kind of a boat, battery, some wheels and a joystick. Uh and good luck. The only safety stuff on a wheelchair would be a seatbelt. I mean, we we did crash testing with one of the top independent facilities in the country and they're saying that just running into a wall in one of these chairs at full speed violates the laws set up for cars and forward crashes and there's no bumper, the knees, the feet, your toes, That's the bumper in a wheelchair. I have had some clients I've worked with who have tipped over a chair and maybe broken an arm or injured their head. So, these are very, very serious concerns, Lucy is always looking looking for the clear path and if there's no clear path, it just brings you to a stop. We're seeing now with the users, we have, we're preventing over 10,000 collisions or drop offs, tip overs every week. This is the alpha prototype, the very first prototype, March 2017. It's off the shelf sensors, just whatever I could get from spark fund and find in the garage. It proved the theory that we could do it. So we really quickly went to a beta prototype about a month later. Katherine used this data prototype for a year and a half and during that time we tracked all the data from it learned where it worked and what didn't work well. And so we took all the stuff we learned here and developed what lucy product is without today. So lucy product looks like this. We call this the smart frame and this mounts onto a power wheelchair. And so you take this smart frame mounted down there, it plugs in between the joystick or the drive method and the motors and adds multiple kinds of sensors. So we have cameras um, one on each side of the user and one in the back. And then we have our own type of ultrasonic sensor that we develop and then hidden in here and down on the foot plate of the wheelchair. We have our own proprietary millimeter wave radar. And so take all that put it on the chair and that means your chair doesn't run into things. Doesn't drive off things is connected to the modern world. You can interact with lucy through Alexa through your phone. So turns it into a modern device. So when I first heard about lucy, I have to admit the first time I heard about it all I thought this can't possibly be true. And then when I learned more about it, started seeing some videos and had a chance to finally see lucy, I was really quite amazed that it worked as well as it did. It's an extremely sophisticated system. I was also excited because I work with very complex clients and anything that I can bring to them that helps them to be more functional than they are. I'm all in. We were hoping that it would be safer but it it is so much more with all of the independence and the confidence and watching Ryan and smile as she heads out the back door by herself and just her and ninja her dog and they're just off and they're gonna go for a walk and you're just not worried. It's fantastic Lucy has given me so much confidence. I am able to be more independent and do the things I want to do. She's 16 years old, she doesn't want mom and dad looming over all the time. Now she can go act like a teenager, we have a saying internally which is, life is a team sport. We have different clinicians, we have activity, people, we have specialists involved and doctors, so we set up the, my lucy app so that people can actually set up a team and choose what information to share the right or the driver of the chair can decide. This information needs to go to my doctor. This information needs to go to my caregiver. They can share uh battery status so that an alert goes out and let people know, hey, um, you know, Katherine's at this location, her battery's low, She may get stranded soon. You might want to check in right. One of the next things that we're working on. It sounds really simple, but it's just a pressure monitor for air cushions. That's not a hard tech list. That is just a knowing that there's a problem and getting the tech into the hands of the people that need it. Now that you actually have a computer and connectivity and a smart wheelchair. It becomes a freeing device not just for mobility but also for health. One of the things I'm really excited about that we just announced is the pediatric solution. Now you can get a wheelchair for a very young child with lucy on it once kids start crawling their vision and visual perceptual skills really explode all sorts of the area areas of the brain. Just like if kids don't have this ability to have independent mobility before the age of five, it changes the whole waterfall of development of possibilities for them for their whole life. You can't get that back. I think this is going to really change a lot of people's lives. So lucy is right now getting funded by insurance and Medicaid and the V. A. But usually there's some pushback because it's new technology. So if I recommend a power chair for a client, it's being paid for by an insurance company or by a state Medicaid program or perhaps a federal Medicare program. Well, the problem is something new comes along and there's not room in our current construct for how do we deal with a truly new product once these funders see it that first time in real life, what it can do for that user, we found that people tend to flip pretty quickly to, oh this actually makes a lot of sense. I think they're starting to come around especially on the lucy device because they're starting to see what long term It actually will save them money. Rhiannon is priceless but her equipment around her is $30,000 every time she rolls out the door and goes somewhere. So you obviously you don't want it bouncing off of things. It's been an interesting learning curve for us to learn how to combine the fact that there's that passion, there's that personal need That has built a real company that's really doing things in a real market now. We're at that place of raising our first funding and doing all that and that's going very well. But it's a very different path I think than most companies go on because it's already for sale. It's already in 40 states, you know, I mean hundreds of users, a lot of people see this and it is a mission all company. We have a cause, you know, we talk about moving at the speed of the need, you know, the internally those kinds of things. But the fact of the matter is although suddenly realized this is a real incredible business opportunity as well. There's an assumption that wheelchairs are a real niche that there's not very many people using wheelchairs in the world. And that assumption is wrong. Uh, there's, you know, a million more people in wheelchairs in the US than there are electric vehicles in the US. We have a lot of these conversations about equity. But what is sometimes left off of that scale are people with disabilities. It's a broad range of people. Some of those people will require a power wheelchair to be as independent as possible. It's easy to look down upon people who are less functional than ourselves. And I think we need to remember that one of the beauties of assistive technology. One of the reasons that I enjoy assistive technology so much is it levels the playing field. So now someone who didn't have mobility before can be mobile. You look five years down the road and I think this will be um, inevitable that this technology is on every power wheelchair sold and you'll start seeing a lot of interesting new health and wellness options for wheelchair users, manual and power. There we go, Oh, now you're giving love.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1675364505786,"updatedAt":1686690375997,"irisTag":"technology","videoPublishDate":1675296000000,"duration":{"value":777,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}}]}}],"section":"Regular","state":"Published","index":2},{"id":"d6879435-d3e5-4030-a079-edd73e2e80ab","displayPage":"/videos","name":"On The Clock","viewportSize":{"web":3},"type":"PLAYLIST_TRAY","source":{"from":"PLAYLIST_SOURCE","playlistName":"On The Clock"},"items":[{"type":"PLAYLIST_ITEM","playlist":{"name":"On The Clock","type":"Series","state":"Published","premium":false,"videosOrderedByUser":[{"videoId":"ed010f01-0843-446f-aedc-ff107d8a45fa","name":"How I make a living as a professional Lego builder","slug":"how-i-make-a-living-as-a-professional-lego-builder","shortDescription":"Eric Hunter is a professional Lego artist and owner of The Art of LeGogh, under which he designs and builds Lego models for private and corporate clients, including Microsoft, New York Life, and Children’s Hospital.","longDescription":"Eric Hunter is a professional Lego artist who designs and builds Lego models for private and corporate clients, including Microsoft, New York Life, and Children’s Hospital.

You really can build anything with these little bricks. I'm Eric Hunter. I'm 53 years old. I'm a professional LEGO artist. Welcome to the art of LEGO. This is my kitchen and here are a few portraits I've designed out of LEGO. This is a mosaic of penny, my roommate. And down here, here's one of me, this is my studio as well. Back here, this whole first floor is one giant room that's been converted into several smaller areas. I actually sleep here. We've got the dining room and then back here is where all the fun happens. This is where I I I store my office right next to my living room. Actually, more like in my living room, I've had models in the 10,000, 90,000 range. And now just last week, I got my biggest commission to date. Actually, a six figure budget. This is the beginnings of a 1 to 1 scale 1968 Camaro S S for the estimate I calculated 245,000 Lego bricks to complete this model. Most of my clients models would probably fall in the between, I'd say 1200 to $3000 range. The budget doesn't have to be that large. If you can make a car this big or you know, as big as you want anything, it's all about scale and then about detail, thousands. As far as how the money is spent, I have three different rates. You of course have to buy the Lego and I have design time and then I have build time and miscellaneous time, which is basically buying organizing and shipping time. I've actually returned money to a client because it didn't cost as much as I thought it was. I'm not here to get rich, you know, I'm here to do what I love this tiny little walkie talkie piece is now usable as an actual walkie talkie human size. What I love about my job is seeing the final model. I love to see it to hold it. It's tangible and then it's done. I don't have to work on it, believe it or not. When I am not working, I will build a Lego set to relax. I like to look at the instructions and flip through the pages and build the model that somebody else designed. Takes the pressure off me. The most challenging thing with working with LEGO models is lighting every brick has a tiny little hair space in between it and it becomes a real challenge to have a fully lit model look good. I think a car is, is definitely the most popular. Just my freelance since 2013, I'd say I've designed between cars and trucks. Probably 2025 different different vehicles. I think people love their cars and they want to immortalize them on their desk. Now, I have a potential client. They want a model of a truck. I ask them to make model in the year, what color they want? After a client has ordered a model, I'll go and digitally design the model in the computer. I usually use a program called LEGO Digital designer. It's a free program by LEGO. After you design the model in there, you can basically rebuild it piece by piece. Once it is approved, I will then go and order the lego. I order from brick link, brick link is basically like ebay for lego. It's anything lego you need. It's new lego or lego. Here in my studio. I personally chose to not keep too much LEGO on hand. I order LEGO as needed for each project as I go and each project ends up with a little over and slowly builds my collection. As everybody knows, storing lego can be a challenge. I choose open top bins and bin cups. I use some like tackle box and tiny drawer storage as well. The building is the fun part. Of course, I glue the models I use methyl ethyl ketone, which is actually any K for short and it's, it's a solvent, it melts the Lego together. It doesn't really glue it together. It's pretty impermeable and very durable. So a model should pretty much last forever. I use many different tools. You name it. I mean, I use belt Sanders, drill presses, planers, Lego rulers. This ruler is a vertical ruler. This ruler is for horizontal measuring. I use glue clamps, I use anything industrial. It really depends on the model on the inside of many of the Lego models I design. There will be infrastructures, there might be a steel frame, there might be access panels, mounting points. But the trick is, it's all on the inside. It's pretty much hidden away the tool that I use most here. Good old mallet, save my fingertips. I have been going with Lego since I was, I would say four years old. This is a book that really inspired me to get more into LEGO as an adult in the back. It shows a picture, a picture that was really inspirational to me. It shows a group of ladies actually who are all the model designers for Lego land in Denmark. They were only accepting creative resumes. And I thought, well, I found a product, what product might I be? And rice crispies? Was it because Eric and Rice, this was a perfect fit. I got a job at Legoland California back in 2005 as an associate, a model associate. It was a dream come true for me. Within about a year's time, I went from associate to designer. At that point, I started designing buildings for Miniland and doing life size sculptures of people and anything else. Legoland Parks might need the tallest Lego model. I was a part of was the Lego Land, Malaysia Petronas Towers model which took about six months. I had 1000 an hour budget to design that I was then responsible for managing and guiding the team to build it. At one point, I believe we had 23 or 24 people in the model shop all working on the same project. I think we ordered 100 and 20,000 Lego one by two pieces for the windows. The final model ended up being just under 33 ft tall for about a four year period. I believe it was the world's tallest Miniland structure. So I actually had a world record. Unofficially after I left Legoland in 2013, I decided to start a Lego design company. My friend Penny, who was actually my roommate in college way back in the late eighties. She said, hey, why don't you come out to Connecticut? I found this really unique place that used to be a mechanic shop for a buick dealership. And it is now my home and my Lego studio. Since I started my company, I have made, I would say upwards of 400 LEGO models for, for clients. Some of my corporate clients have included names like Microsoft New York Life. My latest is Children's Hospital. They really enjoy adding LEGO into their, their world. Back in 2013, it was a one man operation as it is again today. At one point I had eight employees. I really do enjoy being a one man operation because it allows me full control, but it's very limiting. Ultimately, I see growing my company into having a model shop with several employees full time, constantly building all of the designs that I am designing. And of course, I'd help build too when and if I could, I kind of see a little young Richard Nixon in here. So this is actually Pee-wee Nixon.\u003c/p\u003e","srtFormat":{"videoId":"ed010f01-0843-446f-aedc-ff107d8a45fa","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":3,"key":"ed010f01-0843-446f-aedc-ff107d8a45fa/SRT/captions-ver3.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"I've had many jobs in my life and I got to say that that designing Lego models is definitely by far the best you really can build anything with these little bricks. I'm Eric Hunter. I'm 53 years old. I'm a professional LEGO artist. Welcome to the art of LEGO. This is my kitchen and here are a few portraits I've designed at a LEGO. This is a mosaic of penny, my roommate. And down here, here's one of me, this is my studio as well. Back here, this whole first floor is one giant room that's been converted into several smaller areas. I actually sleep here. We've got the dining room and then back here is where all the fun happens. This is where II I store my office right next to my living room. Actually more like in my living room, I've had models in the 100,000 range. And now just last week, I got my biggest commission to date. Actually, a six figure budget. This is the beginnings of a 1 to 1 scale 1968 Camaro Ss for the estimate I calculated 245,000 Lego bricks to complete this model. Most of my clients models would probably fall in the between, I'd say 1200 to $3000 range. The budget doesn't have to be that large. If you can make a car this big or, you know, as big as you want anything, it's all about scale and then about detail thousands. As far as how the money is spent, I have three different rates. You of course, have to buy the Lego and I have design time and then I have build time and miscellaneous time, which is basically buying, organizing and shipping time. I've actually returned money to a client because it didn't cost as much as I thought it was. I'm not here to get rich, you know, I'm here to do what I love this tiny little walkie talkie piece is now usable as an actual walkie talkie human size.

I am a certified C, it's also known as I think the very first idea of beer or c sort of comes off as a person who's drinking beer all day. Unfortunately, it's, it's not as glamorous as that. There's actually a lot of leg work that actually goes into it before the beer actually ever gets presented to the guest. You need to start doing tastings, you need to start doing pairings, you need to start building out beer menus, finding the right glassware, getting the right chillers. I was working at Gastro Pub at the Venetian. There weren't too many people in Las Vegas that actually had such a wide selection of beers. They had a actually on our staff when I started talking to him. I, I started figuring out, you know what, there's so much more to learn about beer than I actually already knew. I knew about IP A si knew about ports. I knew about stouts, but to start talking about beer in a way that was almost like so romantic to become a, I think you really just sort of need to be a beer nerd. At heart, you need to start picking up books. You need to actually start doing your research, your knowledge about all the different styles of beer. You have to know about the srm, the gravity of each beer, how it's been brewed, how it's been made, the history behind it. What it's supposed to taste like being able to talk about it, almost like wine. I think I've tasted about 500 beers now. Maybe even more. There has been one or two instances where I have become slightly inebriated, opening up magnums of chime or doing these fantastic beard tastings, beard dinners. It's just one of the first of the job becoming Saron was probably one of the most difficult tests and exams that I've actually ever come across. There's actually four different certifications. Each one has to be completed before you can go on to the next level. The exam was actually the course of an entire day. It was tasting for a major portion of it. The knowledge and theory portion of it was probably over 50%. And then beer pairing was, I think another 25% of the actual exam. It was an extremely arduous test but very fulfilling. Rewarding. Even after everything was done today, we're here at Hotel Barrier Phuket and we're going to be trying five different beers. We have a really nice, beautiful assortment going from light to dark. This is Gaffle cos this is a very unique solid beer that actually hails from the region of cologne in Germany. Think of champagne. Ok. I would pair this with fried chicken. It would be really nice carbonation just to go ahead and cut through the fat on the chicken. This is Dupont. There's a really nice malt background to it. It is a farmhouse ale so it has a little bit of like a barnyard y sort of characteristic to it. But phenomenal. One of the best pairings of my entire life was actually done with the ce on. I had this particular style with a triple cream cheese, a little bit of honey comb and with a really nice crusty baguette. And that was the absolute moment where the light bulb went off. And I said, wow, pairing beer and food is such a magical experience. This beer is, is trace Fontaine from dust translation. It means three Fountains. The style is an oat goose is actually a blend of three different lambic. One year, two year, three year lambic from Linda. It actually pairs extremely well with a hot lobster roll the butter, the bread, the sweetness of the lobster itself, extremely delightful pairing. This is, it is a Flemish bread coming from Belgium. However, this beer itself is actually brewed in Italy is triple fermented first time in stainless steel and then a in cognac barrels. This beer pairs extremely well with barbecued meats such as brisket and also strawberry cheesecake. So this beer is poo. It's an Imperial Baltic porter hailing from the region of Estonia, it actually comes from the area of the Baltic Sea. Yeah, is much more malt driven. So you have flavors of coffee, chocolate, even really nice rich molasses. This particular beer pairs extremely well with say a coffee crusted steak or even a flourless chocolate cake. When I first started. I thought that 300 beers was the crazy exorbitant amount for a beer list. Now, in days, I mean, I've come across places that are even over 506 100 different skews for beers. CS are definitely more in demand. Now, people are much more in tune to what's in their glass. They want to know more. They want to be able to go ahead and find these fantastic beers and they're asking the right questions. Is there a time that's too early that I drink beer? No, I come from Las Vegas. Absolutely not.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1674676542319,"updatedAt":1689263784416,"videoPublishDate":1674691200000,"duration":{"value":348,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"4d252785-96a2-4670-bfc8-643a2b3cc372","name":"How horses healed my heartbreak and led me to an equine coaching career","slug":"how-horses-healed-my-heartbreak-and-led-me-to-an-equine-coaching-career","shortDescription":"Leah Goldman is a self-described “horse girl” who turned her passion into a career after a devastating breakup.","longDescription":"Leah Goldman is a self-described “horse girl” who turned her passion into a career after a devastating breakup.

I was the child who was the \"horse girl.\" And my love affair with horses started probably before I can remember. My name is Leah Goldman and I am an equine coach. Equine coaches are relatively new to the coaching industry. So turn his head to the left. Head to the left. They're not coming to learn how to ride. They're just coming to learn about themselves in a very unique and different way. What makes this work really powerful is the horse as the mirror. The exercise for you is about creating space, right? And creating boundaries and keeping those boundaries in place. Back, back. Are we having fun? And stop. You can maybe qualify for some of these larger therapeutic programs, which are so wonderful, or you could be interested in riding horses, but there wasn't anything in the middle. This really is quite a long journey of how I got here. I entered into a relationship and spent three years with this man who I thought was going to be my lifelong partner. He had been living a double life and had been in a relationship with somebody else for the entire time that we had been together. And it was a life-altering moment. Two weeks before I had found that out, I hadn't been around horses in a while and was really missing it. And I started riding when I was six. I found a horse that I signed on to lease for the summer. It just all started to come together. So while I was grieving the loss of not only this person who I loved, but you know the loss of this life that I thought I was going to have, I had this space to go to. A lot of what I just needed was somebody to be with me, right? And that somebody was a horse. That's really where my own healing started to begin. I was mentored and trained under a master coach out in Santa Fe, New Mexico. There's five horses. Every single one of them was laying down, except for one. I was like, I just, I think that's the horse that I'm the most connected to. And he walked right by me. And I was like, oh. I was like, of course, like I'm not good enough. And yeah, why would he come over here? And then all of a sudden, I kid you not, he turned around, circled in front of me, dropped to the ground, and dropped his head in my lap. I just, I lost it. I just completely broke down. It does something for you that sometimes people can't give you, right? You're looking for answers or you're searching for something. You're just searching for it and you can't get it you can't find it. And all of a sudden, you have this like powerful, majestic being giving you exactly what you need. And it was just like the two of us in that moment. And it was just like, everything's gonna be okay. I get a lot of people who have lost spouses, some people who have lost pets, and they need a place that they come to where they feel a sense of comfort and safety Let's head into the indoor today. Okay, come on, Booboo, we got some work to do. So before you do that, you know, remember, we want to always set the intention of what we're doing. So to conjure up or bring up things that really fill you with joy, right? That make you feel light, that make you feel warm, and go see what happens. C'mon Boo. When I try to explain it to people, they're often like, \"You're not riding the horse?\" Like no, I'm not riding—I'm never gonna ride the horse. I've never ridden a horse. It's not about that. It's about the being, not the doing. I am a psychotherapist. I sought Leah out because it was the middle of COVID I was seeing 40 patients a week, which is way too many. So getting out of my head, not thinking about my patients. Not wondering about COVID. Not worrying about my kids and all the things that they were missing. I didn't have to do any of that here in any way. It was just about finding peace in myself. I think the lesson for me is that I don't need to hold other people's things quite as tightly as I do sometimes. And as soon as I get here, I'm just centered. Thank you. They're not going to be able to take Saint home. But the hope is that you have a felt sense experience that will remind you when you're not on the farm, and life gets tough or chaotic or stressful, and you can have this moment of like, \"Okay, let me just pretend like I'm in the field with Saint and I'm breathing with Saint.\" And I actually have many people who keep photos of Saint as a reminder, right? To slow down, to breathe, to just take a moment for yourself. I was mid-pandemic diagnosed with a rare chronic illness, called idiopathic subglottic stenosis. Essentially, my body will suffocate itself. I have always told Leah that the doctor saved my life, but Leah and Saint saved my soul. I have my fourth surgery coming up on Monday. Just really trying to get myself in a good position where I'm in the zone and really focused on myself, so I can come back even stronger. There's science behind it, and why this works that I can explain to you. But there's also this other side of it where things happen that I can't explain. Those are the moments, those magical moments a lot of the time that make a huge difference for people. So I'd already earned my credential, my ICF-credential as a certified professional coach, which is the International Coaches Federation, and spent about a year and a half going through that. The equine piece was really just taking my 30 plus years of horse knowledge, and just combining them together. So I had that idea, the summer of 2018. And by 2020, I was launched and ready to go. I mostly see women, although men are welcome to come. It just for whatever reason seems like women are more drawn to this space than men. I have worked with anyone, you know, as young as 18, all the way up to women in their 70s. Somebody who is an equine coach has to be incredibly observant. They have to be incredibly thoughtful. You have to be able to hold both the human heart and the equine heart masterfully. The client has to lead it because I'm here to help them. You'll always hear me check in with the client, \"How are things going? How have you been? You know, we talked about this last time.\" I have probably like 10 to 15 go-tos that I use. Some of them are super short, really simple. Others take a lot longer. Saint is my heart horse. He is a manifestation of a horse that I have dreamed of since I was an adolescent. I remember thinking to myself as a child, \"Someday, I am going to have a horse who has 16 one-hands, who is a chestnut, a gelding, a Warmblood. He's going to have a white blaze, and he's going to have white socks. When I started looking for a horse, I had posted in a Facebook group and a woman messaged me and she said, I think I have the perfect horse for you. And she sent me some photos of him and I was like, 16 one-hands, chestnut horse, gelding, Warmblood, white blaze, white socks. And I was like, \"What's his name?\" She goes, \"Saint.\" And I was like, I can't—I mean, you can't make this stuff up if you tried. It's the perfect name for a horse that's doing this work. Heart Math is a research organization. What they did was they basically discovered that horses sync their heartbeats with one another. So essentially, if a horse is heart rate goes up, it kind of pings to another horse, and that's like, \"Oh, do we need to be on alert? Do we need to be worried about something? Should we start moving?\" What they found was that horses can sink their hearts with humans as well, from up to four feet away. But what that does is it can lower our heart rate. It can also lower our blood pressure, and basically puts us in this state of neutrality, which is just a place of ease. This job has changed my life in every way. In every way. I'm doing what I'm passionate about. I've always wanted to help people. I've always loved horses, I get to combine those two things and I get to give this to others. That's what makes it so worthwhile. You know, when I'm here and I'm doing something for myself, that's when the positivity comes out. Like when I'm with this guy. It kind of just melts everything away.","srtFormat":{"videoId":"4d252785-96a2-4670-bfc8-643a2b3cc372","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"4d252785-96a2-4670-bfc8-643a2b3cc372/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"12, 12. Yeah, I love being around horses for so many reasons. I was the child who was the horse girl and my love affair with horses started probably before I can remember. My name is Leah Goldman and I am an equine coach. Equine coaches are relatively new to the coaching industry. So turn his head to the left head to the left. They're not coming to learn how to ride. They're just coming to learn about themselves in a very unique and different way. What makes this work really powerful is the horse as the mirror, the exercise for you is about creating space, right? And creating boundaries and keeping those boundaries in place back back. Uh Are we having fun and stop? Can maybe qualify for some of these larger therapeutic programs which are so wonderful or you could be interested in riding horses? But there wasn't anything in the middle. This really is quite a long journey of how I got here. I entered into a relationship and spent three years with this man who I thought was going to be my lifelong partner. He had been living a double life and had been in a relationship with somebody else for the entire time that we had been together. And it was a life altering moment. Two weeks before I had found that out, I hadn't been around horses in a while and was really missing it. And I started riding when I was six. I found a horse that I signed on to lease for the summer. It just all started to come together. So, while I was grieving, the loss of not only this person who I loved, but you know, the loss of this life that I thought I was going to have, I had the space to go to a lot of what I just needed was somebody to be with me, right? And not somebody with a horse. That's really where my own healing started to begin. I was mentored and trained under a master coach out in Santa Fe, New Mexico. There's five horses. Every single one of them was laying down except for one. I was like, I just, I think that's the horse that I'm the most connected to. And he walked right by me. And I was like, oh, I was like, I was like, of course, like I'm not good enough. And yeah, why would he come over here? And then all of a sudden I kid you not, he turned around, circled in front of me, dropped to the ground and dropped his head in my lap. I just, I lost it. I just completely broke down. It does something for you that sometimes people can't give you right. You're looking for answers or you're searching for something you're just searching for it and you can't get it, you can't find it. And all of a sudden you have this, like, powerful majestic being giving you exactly what you need. And it was just like the two of us in that moment and it was just like everything is going to be ok. I get a lot of people who have lost spouses. Um some people who have lost pets and they need a place that they come to where they feel a sense of comfort and safety. Let's head into the today. Ok. Come on, boo boo. We got some work to do so before you do that, you know, remember we wanna always set the intention of what we're doing so to conjure up or bring up things that really fill you with joy, right? That make you feel light that make you feel warm and go see what happens. Come on when I try to explain it to people, they're often like I, you're not riding the horse. I'm like, no, I'm not riding. I'm never going to ride the horse. I've never ridden the horse. It's not about that. It's about the being not the doing. I am a psychotherapist. I sought Leah out because it was the middle of COVID. I was seeing 40 patients a week which is way too many. So getting out of my head, not thinking about my patients, not wondering about COVID, not worrying about my kids and all the things that they were missing. I didn't have to do any of that here in any way. It was just about finding peace in myself. I think the lesson for me is that I don't need to hold other people's things quite as tightly as I do sometimes. And as soon as I get here, I'm just centered. Thank you. They're not going to be able to take Saint home. But the hope is that you have a felt sense experience that will remind you when you're not on the farm and life gets tough or chaotic or stressful. And you can have this moment of like, OK, let me just pretend like I'm in the fields of Saint and I'm breathing with Saint. And I actually have many people who keep photos of Saint as a reminder, right? To slow down, to breathe, to just take a moment for yourself. I was mid pandemic diagnosed with a rare chronic illness called idiopathic subglottic stenosis. Essentially, my body will suffocate itself. I have always told Leah that the doctor saved my life, but Leah and Saint save my soul. I have my fourth surgery coming up on Monday, just really trying to get myself in a good position where I'm in the zone and um really focused on myself so I can come back even stronger. There's science behind it and why this works that I can explain to you. But there's also this other side of it where things happen that I can't explain. Those are the moments, those magical moments, a lot of the time that make a huge difference for people. So I had already earned my credential, my IC F credential as a certified professional coach, which is the International Coaches Federation and spent about a year and a half going through that the equine piece was really just taking my 30 plus years of horse knowledge and just combining them together. So I had that idea the summer of 2018 and by 2020, I was launched and ready to go. I mostly see women, although men are welcome to come. It just for whatever reason seems like women are more drawn to this space than men. I have worked with anyone, you know, as young as 18, all the way up to women in their 70's. Somebody who is an equine coach has to be incredibly observant. They have to be incredibly thoughtful. You have to be able to hold both the human heart and the equine heart masterfully, the client has to lead it because I'm here to help them. You'll always hear me check in with the client. How are things going? How have you been? You know, we talked about this last time. I have probably like 10-15, go to that I use. Some of them are super short, really simple. Others take a lot longer. Saint is my my heart horse. He is a manifestation of a horse that I have dreamed of since I was an adolescent. I remember thinking to myself as a child someday, I am going to have a horse who is 16, 1 hand who is a chestnut, a gelding, a warm blood. He's going to have a white blaze and he's going to have white socks. When I started looking for a horse, I had posted in a Facebook group and a woman messaged me and she said, I think I have the perfect horse for you. And she sent me some photos of him and I was like 16 1 hands chestnut horse gelding, warm blood white blaze, white socks. And I was like, what's his name? She goes saint. And I was like, I can't, I mean, you can, you can't make this stuff up if you try. And I'm like, it's the perfect name for a horse that's doing this work. Heart Maths is a research organization. What they did was they basically discovered that horses think their heartbeats with one another. So essentially, if a horse's heart rate goes up, it kind of pings to another horse. And that's like, oh, do we need to be on alert? Do we need to be worried about something we start moving? What they found was that horses can sink their hearts with humans as well from up to 4ft away. But what that does is it can lower our heart rate. It can also lower our blood pressure and basically puts us in this state of neutrality, which is just a place of ease. This job has changed my life in every way, in every way I'm doing what I'm passionate about. I've always wanted to help people. I've always loved horses. I get to combine those two things and I get to give this to others. That's what makes it so worthwhile. You know, when I'm here and I'm doing something for myself.

This was my first ever triple crown at the end of the year. This is actually my eighth triple crown of 2022. This is the biggest trophy I have ever received. I'm Anna Lee Waters. I'm 16 years old and I'm the number one female professional pickle ball player. Mhm. Pickle ball has become so popular because anyone can play, any age can play and any skill level can play. You can have fun, you can be competitive. It's just a sport for everyone with the first pick in the 2023 major league pick a ball draft. The new Jersey fives select Anna Lee Waters so good everywhere on the court. There is no weakness in this young lady, Anna Lee was unquestionably the number one pick I think for everybody in the draft, people are picking men and women and to have a number one pick that was a female player and to have more women's picks in the top 10 than men was really remarkable and says something about pickle ball. She is a young phenom ranked number one in the world, both in singles, mixed doubles and women's doubles. She is the most dominant player in the game at the tournament of champions. I won the most or had the most points in that tournament. I was ranked the number one women's singles player at 14 years old. I feel like the achievement that I'm most proud of didn't actually happen this year. It happened in 2019 when I won nationals with my mom. I remember after we won the match, she like jumped and then she started like running around the court and I was like chasing her, like wanting to hug her and like celebrate with her waters and waters. It was our first huge tournament that we went together. I think I had an out of body experience. We had reached a goal that, you know, that we had set because I never thought of pickleball as a job. But at the same time, like, I guess it kind of is, it's a very fun job, especially this year. A lot of big companies have gotten into the sport. I've also seen a big growth in like celebrity pickleball. I've had a lot of sponsorship opportunities. I have an agent now. I am so young and to, you know, learn as many things as I'm learning and, you know, be a part of sponsorship deals and learning about contracts. Sometimes I'll see like the checks that come in and I'm like, save it. I'm saving, I'm put in the bank. I try not to spend my money. You see someone like Michael Jordan who can like design their own shoe and then I'm sponsored by. So I'm kind of designing a shoe with them. It's just kind of cool that I can be kind of grouped into like an athlete that's making their own shoe, which, which is amazing. Annie and I started playing pickle ball at the exact same day, the exact same second, we evacuated our home in Florida due to a hurricane and we went to visit my father who lived in Pennsylvania and he asked us, you know, do you want to go play pickle ball? And at first we were kind of like, no, because we didn't know what it was. And I was pretty young. I think I was 10. So we thought it was an older person sport, but we went and from the moment we stepped on the court, we were, we were hooked. First time I hit the ball, I was like in love with the sport. We played like three times a day for like two weeks straight while we were up there. From when I first started playing, I played with my grandfather and my mom and I can still play with my grandfather and my mom. It's fun, but it's also embarrassing. Uh, as I got older and older, obviously, I got worse and worse and as she got older, she got better and better. Unfortunately, at the previous national tournament Lee was injured. So when Anna Lee was going into a finals match, she had nobody to warm her up. So I actually warmed her up. I really don't know the outcome of the success of the warm up, but she won. So I guess I did something right. Anna Lee and I play a few times a week. Some of that is playing, some of that is drilling, watching Annaly compete. She's feisty. She's an animal. She's an absolute beast on the court. I'm a full time student, but I am also a full time professional pickleball player. So hopefully I'm gonna make a career out of this. You got that right on his mic. Can you send it to me? Yeah, when I'm home, I usually play pickle ball five days a week. I usually drill like two times a week and then I'll play games three times a week. If I'm drilling, it's around two hours. And if I'm playing games, it can be anywhere from like 2 to 3 hours. And I'm usually in the gym five days a week as well. I would say average in a day, I'm working out like four hours and even on my off days, I'm doing either some kind of cardio or walking. She started off as a soccer player and tennis player converted, I think at 11 and she learned the game went pro at 12 lightning quick hands. Great court awareness, great court coverage. I have a lot of different skill sets from different sports for soccer. It was, it's definitely like the footwork and the fast sprinting and the lateral movement and stuff for tennis. It's definitely the form. The form is very similar if you watch tennis and pickle ball. But there is a big difference between like strategy and pickleball and tennis. So I had to learn that Anna Lee and I had come from tennis and the minute I stepped on the court, I just wanted to hit the ball hard and everybody kept telling us like you're not playing correctly. This isn't how you play. You have to hit soft, you have to hit these dinks. But it's just what came so true to, to me and Anna Lee was this power game. So we just continued with our game. And the next thing you know, we were winning national championships at the pro level and we were known for our aggressive style of play. A lot of people ask the question like, how do you guys play on the court together? Isn't it hard that she's your mom and that she's your daughter is in the dynamic. Weird. But I feel like for us it's the opposite. Like we have this mother daughter intuition where we know where the other one's gonna be on the court. And if we miss a shot, we know the other person is not going to be mad at us. So we just feel like you know, we can play how we want to play. We don't have to worry about disappointing our partner because no matter what happens on the court, we're a family and that's what families do. They stick together. I travel with not only my mom but also my dad win or lose. Me and my family always go out to eat and I have a really special bond with my grandmom. She's been home schooling me from third grade on, I'm in 11th grade. Even before I started playing pickleball, I was home schooling and it just really worked out because I couldn't travel and do all the things that I'm doing with pickleball right now becoming a professional athlete. I am so proud of Anna Lee. Her coaches and her other sports have always told us what an athlete she was and what potential she had. But you still don't necessarily go to like, oh professional athletes. This is probably a very futuristic goal, but I want to play pickle ball in the Olympics one day I grew up watching the Olympics and I think it would be really cool to represent my country. And I also want to see pickleball grow like in other countries. I also want to see pickle ball grow in like high schools and get younger kids involved. And that's something that I'm working on now. So in the beginning of this year, one of my goals was to get a triple crown and I ended up getting eight this year, which was amazing. If I've accomplished the goal, there's still something better you can do. So I feel like next year I'm gonna try to get nine triple crowns, uh, which would be, might be difficult, but I'm gonna try to do it. I'm just really, you know, enjoying the ride and I wanna keep going as long as I can. Uh When we came home, we decided we were going to get a ping pong table. I think we played about two weeks before Anna Lee got so good that nobody wanted to play with her anymore. And I don't think we've played ping pong since.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1680191672609,"updatedAt":1682090342594,"videoPublishDate":1680134400000,"duration":{"value":520,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"fc073e7a-4d82-41eb-849d-0e2f156a0ff6","name":"Meet this NYC meteorologist who's been predicting weather for 40 years","slug":"meet-this-nyc-meteorologist-who's-been-predicting-weather-for-40-years","shortDescription":"Chief Meteorologist Janice Huff shares a behind-the-scenes look at how weather forecasting at NBC 4 New York comes together.","longDescription":"Chief Meteorologist Janice Huff shares a behind-the-scenes look at how weather forecasting at NBC 4 New York comes together.

This is [Studio] 3K and this is where everything happens. I'm Janice Huff. I'm the chief meteorologist at NBC News 4 New York. We are the station scientists, even when it's not the weather, even when it's earthquakes, even when it's—anything that has to do with science, NASA, space, whatever. You have to be a scientist and a presenter, both. We don't use a script because the graphics that we show, like the satellite pictures, radar, and all the other graphics with all the fronts and things and the 10-day and all that—we're basically telling it through through the pictures. I've been doing this job here at NBC in New York for 28 years. I've been in television, weather broadcasting, probably closer to 40 years. This is one of our touchscreen monitors. We can use this for weather, as well as this large monitor right here, also useful. And then over here is our green screen. We stand here and do weather here. It's a big studio with lots of monitors that we take full advantage of. These are not all my clothes. Only this stuff is mine. But we have lots of weather anchors here. So six of us. And between the six of us, we all have clothes back here and lockers, and places to put our shoes. People do recognize me, people always have something to say about the weather. We are extremely accurate, but that's not what people remember. They always remember the one time when you may not get the snowfall right, or you may not get the area that gets the rain versus the snow. And everybody always remembers those times, of course. Blizzards are our big thing here on the East Coast. Forecasting itself is probably one of the biggest challenges. And we are most accurate, at least 90 to 95% of the time. There's very few times when the forecast is doesn't turn out the way we had hoped or the way we have predicted it. There's 10 meteorologists in our family that are helping each other all the time and collaborating, especially when there are big, big storms. We probably have the biggest team of anybody here in this area, we're the envy of most. Janice has such a rich history here. She is so kind and warm and welcoming to everyone. It is just so easy to work with her. And the person you see on camera who's so inviting and warm and welcoming to the viewers, someone who really cares—she's like that off the air. When we have the breaking weather situations, a lot of times that can be serious, but kind of we just watch her and it's just—it comes so easy to her. So I would say kind of, we watch an awful lot of us because it just rolls right off the tongue. She's a pro. She's really ready for anything at any time. We are in the Storm Team 4 Weather Center for NBC. It's right behind our studio walls. Our studio is just on the other side of this wall. It's a team effort. It takes a lot of people to get this act together every day. We have several shows throughout the day, starting with our morning news at 4 a.m. We also have an 11 a.m. newscast. This is where all of the work gets done every day for all of our weather casts that go into each and every newscast. That's all of the forecasting. That's all of the graphics that gets done for the actual weather cast, and all the discussion. And we have our lunch here. We live here pretty much. There are people here practically 24/7. There's only a couple of hours at night when no one's here. We collaborate with Janice. It's pretty much an ongoing conversation between the members of the weather team. We use Microsoft Teams to basically keep everybody abreast of any changes in the forecast. Any interesting tidbits in the forecast that one of us is saying, we'll put it into a team's note so that everybody can see it. Janice is pretty much on call 24/7. I go home and about 11:45 Every night and get right back up at 9:40 in the morning and start all over again. That's interesting. I knew I wanted to be a meteorologist when I was about 10, I think. I discovered the word \"meteorology\" by reading the encyclopedia because back then we didn't have computers at home. That's when I figured out what a meteorologist does. And I loved the weather since I was a little little kid. And so I decided then when I was 10 that that's what I was going to study when I went to college. My degree is a Bachelor of Science in meteorology from Florida State University. My minor is mathematics. Graduating from college, I was the first person in my family to do that. Even though it was many years ago, I still look back on that as a major accomplishment. And to also get a degree in meteorology, which is a major accomplishment for anybody. Once I got to interview President Obama. A bunch of meteorologists, including myself, were picked to come to the White House when he was president and talk about the climate report, the climate assessment. And it was amazing to be there and actually speak to the President about the state of the climate and the weather and be at the White House which is really cool. Definitely as a woman of color, I didn't see people who looked like me doing weather on television when I was growing up in the '60s and '70s. There were a handful of women, one being June Bacon-Bercey, who actually broke that barrier before I did, and became the first African American woman with a degree in meteorology to actually do the weather on TV back in the '70s. So there were a couple of people that came before me. Yet, I never saw her on TV when she was actually on television back then, because she was in Buffalo, New York, and I was in South Carolina. So I didn't see anyone who looked like me doing what I do. That's why I never thought about having a career on TV doing it. I bought this when I was in Tanzania in the Serengeti. We went on vacation. It was more than just going on vacation. It was kind of symbolic, in a way. I've never been to Africa, so. And since the majority of my roots are in Africa, not from that country. But it was my first trip to the motherland, as you say, and it was quite the experience of being in a country where practically everybody looks like you. But that's the flag of Tanzania. And I've wear it all the time. I never take it off. That was in 2018. It's just just a reminder of my trip and when it meant to be there. We expect it to be quiet night tonight. The fun part about this job is just being able to do what I love. It's not really work when you do what you love, right? Most people are never going to be able to say they've worked anywhere for 28 years. But to say that I've worked at 30 Rock for 28 years is a tremendous accomplishment. Of course, there's a little bit of luck involved and things that I have no control over.

All right. So this is our studio and this is where everything happens. I'm Janice Hoff. I'm the chief meteorologist at NBC News for New York. We are the station scientist even when it's not the weather, even when it's earthquakes, even when it's anything that has to do with science, NASA Space, whatever you have to be a scientist and a presenter. Both we don't use a script because the graphics that we show like the satellite pictures, radar and all the other graphics with all the fronts and things and the 10 day and all that, we're basically telling it through, through the pictures. I've been doing this job here at NBC in New York for 28 years. I've been in television. Weather broadcasting probably closer to 40 years. This is one of our three monitors. We can use this for weather as well as this large monitor also use. And then over here is our Green Street. We stand here and do weather here. It's a big studio with lots of monitors that we take full advantage of. These are not all my clothes. Um Only this stuff is mine, but we have lots of weather anchors here. So, uh, six of us and between the six of us, we all have clothes back here and lockers and places to put our shoes. People do recognize me. People always have something to say about the weather. We are extremely accurate, but that's not what people remember. They always remember the one time when you may not get the snowfall, right? Or you may not get the area that gets the rain versus the snow. And everybody always remembers those times. Of course, blizzards are our big thing here on the east coast forecast itself. Probably one of the biggest challenges and we are most accurate at least 90 to 95% of the time. There's very few times when the forecasts doesn't turn out the way we had hoped or the way we have predicted it, there's 10 meteorologists in our family that are helping each other all the time and collaborating, especially when there are big, big storms. We probably have the biggest team of anybody here in this area. We're the envy of, of most Janice has such a rich history here. She is so kind and warm and welcoming to everyone. It is just so easy to work with her and the person you see on camera who's so inviting and warm and welcoming to the viewers, someone who really cares. She's like that off the air when we have the breaking weather situations. A lot of times that can be serious, but kind of, we just watch her and it's just, it comes so easy to her. So I would say kind of, we watch in all a lot of us because it just rolls right off the tongue. She's a, she's really ready for anything at any time. We are in the storm. Team four weather center for NBC. It's right behind our studio wall. So our studio is just on the other side of this wall. It's a team effort. It takes a lot of people to get this act together every day. We have several shows throughout the day, starting with our morning news at four AM. We also have an 11 AM news cast. This is where all of the work gets done every day for all of our weather casts that go into each and every newscast. That's all of the forecasting. That's all of the graphics that gets done for the actual weather cast and all of the discussion. And we have our lunch here. We live here pretty much. There are people here practic 24/7 and there's only a couple of hours at night when no one's here. We collaborate with Janice. It's pretty much an ongoing conversation between the members of the weather team. We use Microsoft teams to basically keep everybody abreast of any changes in forecasts, any interesting tidbits in the forecast that one of us is seeing. We'll put it into a team's note so that everybody can see it. Janice is pretty much on call 24 7. I go home at about 1145 every night and get right back up at 9:45 AM and start all over again. That's interesting. I knew I wanted to be a meteorologist when I was about 10. I think I discovered the word meteorology by reading the encyclopedia because back then we didn't have computers at home. That's when I figured out what a meteorologist does. And I love the weather since I was a little, little kid. And so I decided then when I was 10, that that's what I was going to study when I went to college. My degree is a Bachelor of Science in meteorology from Florida State University. My minor is mathematics. Graduated from college. I was the first person in my family to do that even though it was many years ago, I still look back on that as a major accomplishment and to also get a degree in meteorology, which is a major accomplishment for anybody. Once I got to interview President Obama, a bunch of meteorologists including myself, were picked to come to the White House when he was president and talk about the climate report, the climate assessment. And it was amazing to be there and actually speak to the president about the state of the climate and the weather and be at the White House, which is really cool. Definitely as a woman of color. I didn't see people who looked like me doing weather on television when I was growing up in the sixties and seventies, there were a handful of women, one being June Bacon Bey, who actually broke that barrier before I did and became the first African American woman with a degree in meteorology to actually do the weather on TV, back in the seventies. So there were a couple of people that came before me yet. I never saw her on TV when she was actually on television back then because she was in Buffalo, New York and I was in South Carolina. So I didn't see anyone who looked like me doing what I do. That's why I never thought about having a career on TV, doing it. I bought this when I was in Tanzania in the Serengeti. We went on vacation. It was more than just going on vacation. It was kind of symbolic in a way, I've never been to Africa. So, and since the majority of my roots are in Africa, not from that country, but it was on my first trip to the motherland, as you say. And it was quite the experience of being in a country where practically everybody looks like you. But that's the flag of Tanzania and I wear it all the time. I never take it off. That was in 2018. It is just a reminder of my trip and what it meant to be there. We expect it to be a quiet night tonight. The fun part about this job is just being able to do what I love. It's not really work when you do what you love. Right. Most people are never going to be able to say they've worked anywhere for 28 years. But to say that I've worked at 30 rock for 28 years is a tremendous accomplishment. Of course, there's a little bit of luck involved in things that I have no control over. But that's a huge deal now, when I think about it and I'm really happy that I've been able to be here this long if you want to be a meteorologist. Focus on your studies, math and science.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1680194282813,"updatedAt":1687290213358,"irisTag":"careers","videoPublishDate":1680134400000,"duration":{"value":446,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}}]}}],"section":"Regular","state":"Published","index":3},{"id":"c35364c4-be68-4349-84f8-1a0d64682554","displayPage":"/videos","name":"Fortune Well","viewportSize":{"web":4},"type":"PLAYLIST_TRAY","source":{"from":"PLAYLIST_SOURCE","playlistName":"Fortune Well"},"items":[{"type":"PLAYLIST_ITEM","playlist":{"name":"Fortune Well","type":"VideoTray","state":"Published","premium":false,"videosOrderedByUser":[{"videoId":"0053db5f-269d-4596-b629-796ab6007a4a","name":"5 things to know about supplements","slug":"5-things-to-know-about-supplements","shortDescription":"From capsules and pills to herbs and powders, consumers can often feel overwhelmed by the abundance of supplements available on pharmacy aisles.

Imagine if I was able to give you a drug that would improve your mood, increase your energy, make your immune system stronger, reduce your appetite. Have you live longer? Reduce the chances of you getting type two diabetes or heart disease or maybe even Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Would you take that drug? Of course you would, anyone would. Uh And the thing is is that that drug is for free. It's called sleep. And all you need to do is to know how to do it and to practice it intentionally tips for a good night's sleep. One of the classic uh sleep hygiene tips is to sleep in a cooler bedroom. So you might try that out and see if that improves your sleep. If you have a wearable that tracks sleep, you'll have a objective measure to know whether or not the change that you made. The experiment that you ran will affect the outcome of your sleep. Another tactic this is very common obviously is to use white noise. Some people prefer a fan. Some people like a white noise generator or a pink noise generator or a brown noise. There's all these different kinds of noise. You choose what that is that really works for you and you stick with it. Another tactic that people often use for sleep is sleep supplements. Uh Melatonin, it's the chemical that your body releases in order to kind of start everybody off on the process of going into this glorious symphony of sleep. I personally, I like to take LCN nine and magnesium. I take a kind of a sleep cocktail of three or four pills every night and their supplements, they're just compounds that are both relaxing and restful but also are very conducive to staying asleep. So magnesium is, I think a tried and true tactic for many people definitely works for me. Keep your room quiet and dark. It's not always possible. So, you know, sometimes you can isolate your own uh hearing with earplugs or with an eye mask to keep it dark if you can't keep the room itself dark. And then the last one and this is somewhat, I think counterintuitive for people sleep regularity increasingly is demonstrating that it is an important part of quality sleep. Think about the routine you had as maybe as a baby where your sleep and wake cycles were incredibly, you know, regimented and your body knew how to behave around those. And of course, you have your own sleep cycle, it's called your circadian cycle. But if you are regular and you're hitting that sort of window of falling asleep at the right time every night and waking up at the same time, you're actually going to do a great job of convincing your body your body how to sleep more effectively.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1714486148865,"updatedAt":1714496413921,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1714496413921,"duration":{"value":165,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"eeeade48-1765-40c7-9c0c-21858d43077e","name":"This CEO started running at 45 and now runs multiple races a year","slug":"this-ceo-started-running-at-45-and-now-runs-multiple-races-a-year","shortDescription":"Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar couldn’t run a mile until she started running at 45 and challenged herself to run her first marathon.

I'm like, holy cow. Everyone showed up at five in the morning and it was New York City at its best. And I ran my first half did better than I had expected and have since then have run three marathons and too many halves to count. I love running. I discovered running at 45 years old and maybe it's because I like having a goal or I like having a challenge. I could not run a mile when I first started, started running. What I love about running is, first of all, it's an amazing community. Number two, you're competing with yourself. It's about you setting a goal, whether it's a time goal, whether it's finishing a race, whether it's seeing a new city. So it's all about you and you're sharing with so many others. And what I love about running is it's all ages, all body types. It's young, old coming together for one thing of, of running and to me, wellness is very important. So running to me has been something that I'm not a particularly good runner, but it's something that I feel better after I after I've been on a run, it sounds corny. But I was one of the proudest moments for me when a New York road runners board member, I asked to join their board because I learned how to run at 45. And there are a lot of elite runners on the board, but they thought I was a poster child for running and how great running could be for health, for wellness and just the camaraderie DC is my new hometown. I have been at Fannie Mae for a year, so I have not run a race in the last year. But thanks to the Fannie Mae employees, they told me about the 10 mile Cherry Blossom race in April coming up in DC and I am training for a 10 miler. Come this April.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1712943498959,"updatedAt":1713006013924,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713006013924,"duration":{"value":115,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1","name":"4 productivity hacks from experts","slug":"4-productivity-hacks-from-experts","shortDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","longDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","seoTitle":"4 productivity hacks from experts","seoDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","socialTitle":"4 productivity hacks from experts","socialDescription":"Try these tried-and-true productivity tips the next time you’re trying to chip away at your to-do list.","tags":[{"name":"productivity","type":"tag","label":"productivity"},{"name":"productivity_tips","type":"tag","label":"productivity tips"},{"name":"tips_for_productivity","type":"tag","label":"tips for productivity"},{"name":"life_hacks","type":"tag","label":"life hacks"},{"name":"fortunewell","type":"tag","label":"fortunewell"}],"categories":[{"name":"Fortune_Well","type":"category","label":"Fortune Well"},{"name":"Life","parentName":"Fortune_Well","label":"Life","type":"category"}],"section":{"name":"Health","type":"section","label":"Health"},"playlists":["Fortune Well"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Getty Images","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":2,"key":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1/HLS/video-ver2_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"16806613-4ffe-4a5d-b7ea-29e59ffcb8e1","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"status":"pending"},"hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1712863519195,"updatedAt":1713178813876,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1713178813876,"duration":{"value":121,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"f99b18bd-bb14-4434-a41c-65ab62531ef7","name":"4 tips to combat seasonal allergies","slug":"4-tips-to-combat-seasonal-allergies","shortDescription":"Pollen season is set to grow longer and more intense due to climate change.

You don't have to be a scientist or an affluent person who has access to special doctors to make an impact on your health span. You can make specific changes that actually help change the trajectory of how you age telehealth is a consumer focused Longevity company whose mission is to help people live healthier for longer by providing solutions including an epigenetic age test, personalized action plans and pro longevity supplements. A lot of people ask me for tips to help lower their epigenetic age or really their body's true age. You know, I think the biggest thing that people can do is get up and move, go take a walk, ask a friend to do a walk with you around the block, take a meeting on the phone and walk around the neighborhood. Movement is significant for aging and definitely can help improve your health span. So when I think about my aging and my wellness routine, I really focus on a couple of things that have the most impact for me which are stress and sleep. So when I wake up in the morning, I do a quick meditation, breath work and yoga, I listen to, I'm calming music and then I start with my day. I also try to get a few breaks throughout the day between meetings to either meditate, listen to music or take a walk. So my job keeps me pretty busy during the week with Zoom calls back to back. But on the weekend, I'm super intentional about getting outside. I'll take my kids to the park, we'll walk as long as the weather will allow us to. And that makes me more content and feels like I'm making great move for my health. One of the things that we've seen in our data at tally is that one of the biggest drivers of healthy aging is actually your relationships, having a really strong bond with your friends, your family, your community, whatever outlet you have to build those bonds with other people and have that interpersonal interaction is actually extremely significant. I've really tried to lean in to my women's group, my family calling old friends and just catching up for a few minutes every day. And I've found that that has led to a lot of positivity and brightness in my day that helps me reduce stress. That helps me feel really great. And all of that actually ties back to healthy aging. I want to live healthier and I want to live longer so that I can spend more time with my kids, with my husband, with our friends and family members. Those are the moments that bake what life is so to be able to live healthier without disease or condition, without ailments and without losing mental capacity. That's why I focus on my health.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1711743925095,"updatedAt":1711744213974,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"Aging-Well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1711744213974,"duration":{"value":157,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"c9a00200-1472-454a-8318-5db7b5e9032f","name":"3 lessons from the happiest countries in the world","slug":"3-lessons-from-the-happiest-countries-in-the-world","shortDescription":"The annual World Happiness Report ranks self-reported happiness scores for nearly 150,000 people in over 140 countries.

And so your skin benefits tremendously from anything you do to take care of yourself, whether that's exercise, proper nutrition and hydration. My name is Heather Wallace and I'm the CEO of cur cur is a skin care company and we make skin care accessible by combining our telehealth dermatology practice and our customized personalized formulas entering cur as a skin care company and really being part of the health and wellness space. It's made me reflect on how I care for myself. And so I take better care of myself today than I did two years ago. I really focus on stackable fitness. So if I have a 30 minute break in the day, I like to get on the treadmill, sweat it out for 20 minutes, feel great and then jump back on to the next zoom call and keep going from there. When it comes to my skin care routine. I've actually realized that I need to treat it very similar to the way I treat my exercise routine, which is just making it snack and fitting it in when I can, I have a really busy day. And every day is different. Sometimes I'm home and working from home many times I'm traveling. So, what I try to do is make sure that I'm taking care of my skin and taking care of myself throughout the day when I can fit it in. So sometimes I wake up in the morning and it's all about kids and sometimes it's all about me. So I try to always exercise at some point early in the day after that, wash my face care for my skin with a three step routine. So I use serum moisturizer and always something for the eyes. I think that's most important from a diet perspective. I think the most important thing for my skin health is definitely water. I'm very focused on protein. So I try to eat as much protein as I can. I wouldn't naturally eat a lot of protein. So my, my favorite new hack is that in the morning, I take my iced coffee and I make a protein shake with my iced coffee and start my day every day with that. When I think about the link between physical fitness, mental wellness and skin care, they're really inherent. Your skin is the largest organ in your body. And so your skin benefits tremendously from anything you do to take care of yourself, whether that's exercise, proper nutrition and hydration. I also know personally, as well as from listening to our many patients and consumers that your skin has such a big impact on how you feel. It's not about how you look, but it's about how you feel about how you look and you face the world with your face. So when you feel good about your skin, you can feel good about yourself. And when you feel good about yourself, you have the mental resilience needed to face any challenges that may come at you.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1711037797655,"updatedAt":1711038613830,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1711038613830,"duration":{"value":169,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"b9b38829-a921-4532-90ef-48439c919e92","name":"Here’s what it’s like to get an AI-powered robotic massage","slug":"here’s-what-it’s-like-to-get-an-ai-powered-robotic-massage","shortDescription":"Aescape offers what it touts as “the world’s most advanced massage” featuring robotic arms and an experience users can control themselves.","longDescription":"Aescape offers what it touts as “the world’s most advanced massage” featuring robotic arms and an experience users can control themselves.

I'm a health and wellness reporter at Fortune and I'm getting my first AI-powered massage. Come with me. A massage powered by artificial intelligence and robotic arms might sound like something out of science fiction, but automation is disrupting the spa industry with the arrival of companies like Aescape. This is what we like to think of as the world's most advanced massage. So coming in here, you would have booked on an app for finding a table that's available around you in whatever city you might be in. You come in, you put on these cool clothes, you lay down on the table beneath the headrest. There is a touchscreen. We have sensors overhead here that create a 3D model of your body and that's going to show off your body in 3D and let you make all the changes you want to make to the massage. So we're going to have you lie face down here, arms out in front. We're going to maybe adjust that bolster for your feet just a little bit. And headrest, is that comfortable? You want that up, down and out? Do you like a firm massage, medium pressure? How do you like it? I would say medium. Alright, that's where we're going to start and we can always make the changes. We also have some immersive content here. If you just want to be taken away to another place in the middle of the massage, in the middle of the rainforest on a snowy mountain or maybe just in some lovely water. And then most notably over on the right there, we have a pressure control. Why don't you go ahead and give that plus sign a tap a couple of times and you can see it's really responsive, goes up and down very quickly. It will never get frustrated with you. If you want to make a lot of changes or you change your mind or you like it really firm in this spot, but not in that spot. You can see on the circles there just how much pressure is being applied at any point in the time. If you ever need to pause, the button's right at the bottom. There's a button to move on to the next stroke. If there ever reason why you wanted help from someone, there's an assistance button in the lower right corner, a standard massage with Aescape costs $60 and lasts 30 minutes with the company planning to roll out different options and price points for consumers down the line. After my massage. I sat down with founder and CEO Eric Litman to learn more about the product. How was your massage? It was great. I'm a little dazed so we'll see how this interview goes. What were your favorite parts of it? I liked being able to adjust the music, kind of adjust the pressure points and also watch where it was going next and sort of see it as a protocol kind of throughout the 30 minutes. So you founded Aescape in 2017, nearly seven years ago. So, can you talk a little bit about the impetus of beginning the company? So I started this back at a point. I was having serious chronic neck and upper back pain and I spent about eight months of my life needing a massage just about every day, just to be able to do that just to be able to turn my head one day and a bit of either clarity or maybe even a bit of insanity. I thought of going and automating the industry. So we've launched a fully automated massage that's available on demand. You can go and get that massage any time you want at the push of a and you're in complete control of the treatment. So you get to make the decisions about where and how it works on your body and how well it's going to work and it's always going to remember you. So no matter which location of our tables you go to, it'll know your body, it'll know your preferences and it will always just get better. How are you thinking about the safety protocols in a machine like this? Yeah. So we think about it in a bunch of different ways. First off, going back to what I said before you're in control. So if the pressure is too high, pressure is too low at any moment, you can make a change that's on the control side. Then on, on the product side, we've spent the last seven years building this testing on over 5,000 people. Here, we have gone through multiple prototypes, multiple iterations of the software to get to a place where we now think we deliver a great experience for everyone when you were on the table and you had your massage today. How would you, how would you describe the motions you felt on your body? I mean, yeah, it did feel very dynamic and yeah, kind of you didn't even know the difference almost in a way which was interesting. It's a radically different experience than what it is before. Interesting. Yeah, we worked with orthopedic surgeons and therapists to create very clear specifications of what parts of the body can accept, what levels of pressure. And we make sure that all that makes its way into the massage protocols we generate and we notably give you the ability to make the immediate changes that are required outside of pressure. So if you want to stop, there's a pause button. If you, I want to stop. There's a big red button that will make the arm slide away from the table, the arms themselves really important point. They were especially designed not to be that strong. They're perfectly strong for a great massage and that's exactly what they're good at doing, but they're not any stronger and they don't have any ability to hurt you. Some skeptics might argue that an AI- powered massage misses sort of that human touch, emotion, or connection. So what would you say to that? I would say that our massage is designed for people who are looking for a great experience that they can be fully in control of market research we've done has shown a pool of 10 million Americans who would not get a massage from a massage therapist because they're just uncomfortable being in a room with another person or having to deal with somebody who is of another gender that they didn't particularly want for that for that massage. I think over time as people in general become more comfortable with automated services and solutions in their life, even those who loved treatments with therapists will enjoy what we do. But there's another way to think of this. There are 30,000 open positions for massage therapists in the US right now. So the challenge really is helping the industry fill in that gap. Our product is very distinct in that it allows you control over the experience, but it will also over time allow therapists to have control over the experience so they can start to incorporate it as a tool into their practice. So it's both a complement to existing treatments and an opportunity to experience something entirely different. Can you talk a little bit about the price point and where people can find this A I powered massage? So we're launching this initially in Equinox Gyms here in New York City with a planned roll out across the country in the coming months. Price to the consumer will be a starting price point of $60 for a 30 minute session, which we think is a great value. There were two arms applying equal force to the body simultaneously. Therapists when they work on, you will work on one side and walk around and work on the other. So we like to think we're doing twice the work in half the time and the 30 minute massage is equivalent to at least a 60 minute massage with the therapist. So with the initial launch in Equinox in New York, how many machines will be distributed across the city? There'll be 10 machines in the equinox locations. The hope is that we'll be shipping 600 tables in our first year of shipping and in terms of, you know, future expansion, where do you hope that people could sign up and get this service beyond a luxury gym? We're licensing these two hotels to gyms, to spas a, you'll find them in some multifamily dwellings. So condo buildings, apartment buildings, professional sports teams and collegiate teams and even some physical therapy and pain management clinics will have them as well. And sort of in terms of, you know, what you hope that this will become in six months and a year and five years from now, you know, where do you see it kind of in the larger space of wellness? I think the opportunity here really is to democratize more and more health services for consumers and really to bring the opportunity for people to better take care of themselves in ways that make sense in the scope of their lives at price points that are affordable. And we're going to continue to push along that line thinking bigger picture, you know, down the road, what do you think the future of AI and wellness is going to be? I think it's going to underpin just about everything in wellness A I in general right now is transforming diagnostic medicine on the prevention side. People in general are being a lot more thoughtful about taking care of themselves and recognizing that we are collectively living longer. The opportunity now is not just to improve our lifespan, but to improve, improve our health span the time in which we're healthy throughout the course of our life.\u003c/p\u003e","srtFormat":{"videoId":"b9b38829-a921-4532-90ef-48439c919e92","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":2,"key":"b9b38829-a921-4532-90ef-48439c919e92/SRT/captions-ver2.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Hello, my name is Alexa mchale.

How would you, how would you describe the motions you felt on your body? I mean, yeah, it did feel very dynamic and yeah, kind of you didn't even know the difference almost in a way which was interesting. It's a radically different experience than what it is before. Interesting. Yeah, we worked with orthopedic surgeons and therapists to create very clear specifications of what parts of the body can accept, what levels of pressure. And we make sure that all that makes its way into the massage protocols we generate and we notably give you the ability to make the immediate changes that are required outside of pressure. So if you want to stop, there's a pause button. If you, I want to stop. There's a big red button that will make the arm slide away from the table, the arms themselves really important point. They were especially designed not to be that strong. They're perfectly strong for a great massage and that's exactly what they're good at doing, but they're not any stronger and they don't have any ability to hurt you. Some skeptics might argue that an A I powered massage misses sort of that human touch, emotion or connection. So what would you say to that? I would say that our massage is designed for people who are looking for a great experience that they can be fully in control of market research we've done has shown a pool of 10 million Americans who would not get a massage from a massage therapist because they're just uncomfortable being in a room with another person or having to deal with somebody who is of another gender that they didn't particularly want for that for that massage. I think over time as people in general become more comfortable with automated services and solutions in their life, even those who loved treatments with therapists will enjoy what we do. But there's another way to think of this. There are 30,000 open positions for massage therapists in the US right now. So the challenge really is helping the industry fill in that gap. Our product is very distinct in that it allows you control over the experience, but it will also over time allow therapists to have control over the experience so they can start to incorporate it as a tool into their practice. So it's both a complement to existing treatments and an opportunity to experience something entirely different. Can you talk a little bit about the price point and where people can find this A I powered massage? So we're launching this initially in Equinox Gyms here in New York City with a planned roll out across the country in the coming months. Price to the consumer will be a starting price point of $60 for a 30 minute session, which we think is a great value. There were two arms applying equal force to the body simultaneously. Therapists when they work on, you will work on one side and walk around and work on the other. So we like to think we're doing twice the work in half the time and the 30 minute massage is equivalent to at least a 60 minute massage with the therapist. So with the initial launch in Equinox in New York, how many machines will be distributed across the city? There'll be 10 machines in the equinox locations. The hope is that we'll be shipping 600 tables in our first year of shipping and in terms of, you know, future expansion, where do you hope that people could sign up and get this service beyond a luxury gym? We're licensing these two hotels to gyms, to spas a, you'll find them in some multifamily dwellings. So condo buildings, apartment buildings, professional sports teams and collegiate teams and even some physical therapy and pain management clinics will have them as well. And sort of in terms of, you know, what you hope that this will become in six months and a year and five years from now, you know, where do you see it kind of in the larger space of wellness? I think the opportunity here really is to democratize more and more health services for consumers and really to bring the opportunity for people to better take care of themselves in ways that make sense in the scope of their lives at price points that are affordable. And we're going to continue to push along that line thinking bigger picture, you know, down the road, what do you think the future of A I and wellness is going to be? I think it's going to underpin just about everything in wellness A I in general right now is transforming diagnostic medicine on the prevention side. People in general are being a lot more thoughtful about taking care of themselves and recognizing that we are collectively living longer. The opportunity now is not just to improve our lifespan, but to improve, improve our health span the time in which we're healthy throughout the course of our life.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1710358797181,"updatedAt":1710943245021,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1710288000000,"duration":{"value":495,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"e265ce00-7669-42f9-bc2d-cdb29a32f2c1","name":"Olipop CEO: What to know about the microbiome and gut health","slug":"olipop-ceo:-what-to-know-about-the-microbiome-and-gut-health","shortDescription":"The microbiome is a crucial component of our health, linking the gut with various bodily functions.","longDescription":"The microbiome is a crucial component of our health, linking the gut with various bodily functions.

It's kind of this master system that sits underneath many of the other different components of our body. As I got older and I learned about the microbiome and I learned about the brain gut axis. The light bulb kind of went off for me that we need fiber, we need prebiotics and we need nutritional diversity and every human being alive needs those things. In the research. There's really strong ties between microbiome, health and digestion, microbiome, health and immune function, microbiome, health and neurotransmitter health or or mood stability. There's also a strong correlation between fiber and optimal blood sugar response. Historically, hunter gatherer tribes and indigenous communities, they would actually get somewhere between 100 and 200 g of fiber a day. Unfortunately, the average industrialized consumer and the average American maybe gets 10 to 15 g of fiber a day and gets up to 80 g of sugar a day. There's all sorts of barriers for folks around making conversions over to healthier choices. One of the biggest barriers being that all of the food and drinks that they grew up with. So they have like an E an emotional relationship with and that are really addicting and cheap are very, very present and easy to consume. And I think that we see the impacts of junk food on our country's health, right? According to the CDC, 40% of Americans have type two diabetes or prediabetes. 70% of Americans have chronic digestive distress. They're projected to be over a billion people with type two diabetes by 2050. That's not a great trajectory. And what we eat and drink can have a really substantial impact on our health. Lollipop is designed to actually meet that consumer need for something that tastes great and tastes like something that matches their expectations from a soda. Uh but also has empirically backed ingredient, nutritional strategies so that you can essentially have your soda and drink it to. There's a $300 billion health and wellness category and the vast majority of those brands don't do any independent research to figure out if their product is actually conferring benefit to their consumers. And while I'm sure there are are products that are still better than a traditional uh Coke or Pepsi, we have a real opportunity right now to, to not just be a little bit better but to actually be health contributing. And honestly, the health and wellness and consumer package goods sector in my view needs to migrate in that direction for the health and wellness of the American population.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709840391915,"updatedAt":1710270312536,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1710115200000,"duration":{"value":166,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"connect":false,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef","name":"The founder of Solidcore shares her fitness routine","slug":"the-founder-of-solidcore-shares-her-fitness-routine","shortDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","longDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","seoTitle":"The founder of Solidcore shares her fitness routine","seoDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","socialTitle":"The founder of Solidcore shares her fitness routine","socialDescription":"Anne Mahlum, founder and former CEO of the Pilates-inspired fitness company Solidcore, explains how she stays fit even with her busy schedule.","tags":[{"name":"fitness","type":"tag","label":"fitness"},{"name":"fortunewell","type":"tag","label":"fortunewell"},{"name":"health_and_wellness","type":"tag","label":"health and wellness"},{"name":"wellness","type":"tag","label":"wellness"},{"name":"ceo","type":"tag","label":"CEO"},{"name":"anne_mahlum","type":"tag","label":"Anne Mahlum"},{"name":"ann","type":"tag","label":"Ann"}],"categories":[{"name":"Fortune_Well","type":"category","label":"Fortune Well"},{"name":"Health","parentName":"Fortune_Well","label":"Health","type":"category"}],"section":{"name":"Health","type":"section","label":"Health"},"playlists":["Fortune Well"],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/Images/posterImage-ver1.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/Images/posterImage-ver1-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/Images/posterImage-ver1-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Solidcore founder Anne Mahlum","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"videoId":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef","extension":"m3u8","type":"hlsFormat","version":3,"key":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/HLS/video-ver3_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"videoId":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef","extension":"vtt","type":"srtFormat","version":3,"key":"d8b8a379-de70-4ca5-841e-b0e2031daeef/SRT/captions-ver3.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"Now that I'm 43. If you gave me the choice of, hey, Ann, your body can work the way that it wants for the rest of your life versus you can have your body to look however you want to for the rest of your life. But you're going to deteriorate. I would 100% choose option. A Hi, I'm Anne Mallam. I am the founder and former CEO of Salad Core. I'm also an investor and a start up advisor as well as a wanna be volleyball player and fitness and health and health, man. And longevity is a top priority for me. I wake up at six Monday through Friday and I frankly wake up between six and seven, you know, during the weekends, I try to keep my sleep schedule very consistent. So I wake up each morning and I drink water, take my vitamins and have a cup of coffee. And then I head to the gym where I do anywhere from a 20 to 30 minute treadmill workout where I'm altering the incline as well as the speed to try to get my speed up for the volleyball court. And then I am lifting heavy weights and doing core. So, I'm at the gym for about 90 minutes, 56 days a week. And I play volleyball 3 to 4 days a week. I am a morning workout person. Once I love it and enjoy it and it starts my day off on the right foot. When I go in the morning I go around seven. It's do not disturb on my phone. That, that is my hour and a half to me. Oh my God, I have such a healthier relationship with food. I honestly sometimes think back to how often I was thinking about food, what to eat, what not to eat when I can work out my body. And probably years of my life like it was all I thought about my whole identity was wrapped up like I am the girl who's never gonna love her body who's always gonna be trying to fix this thing, but we'll never fix it. So my relationship with food is honestly super healthy. Like last night, frankly, I had a burger and fries and it was no big deal. I know I'm not gonna eat that today and I usually eat the same thing Monday through Friday. I have the same breakfast. I have a smoothie after I work out and I have a non dairy yogurt bowl in the afternoon and then a reasonable dinner. The most important part of my health routine is the consistency doing something once a week isn't going to do anything like staying consistent in what you do. And that's why I'm really bullish on telling folks don't overwhelm yourself. My fiance likes to call it the button when you're like, I'm gonna work out every single day and then you miss a day and you're like it now, I messed up. So I'm just like, not gonna work out at all. That's setting yourself up to fail in a bad way. I stick to the things that I know I can commit to and I don't set myself up to fail.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709838284541,"updatedAt":1709920813956,"irisTag":"healthcare","sponsorTag":"well","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1709920813956,"duration":{"value":158,"unit":"seconds"},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"9d59d568-f674-4fe0-9151-35d9fde5fe7e","name":"4 tips from relationship experts","slug":"4-tips-from-relationship-experts","shortDescription":"What makes a long, healthy, and successful relationship?

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the average 
  human cultural diet, no doubt, this chimp diet would be far, far healthier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meatarians, in their 
  never-ending, but always irrational and fruitless, attempts to justify human 
  flesh-eating often use the claim that &quot;chimps eat meat, so we should also&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
  doing so, they ignorantly or intentionally ignore the important quantitative 
  and qualitative issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;In stating &quot;chimps eat meat&quot; it 
  is implied that ALL chimps eat meat ALL the time (as would be the case IF flesh 
  was eaten for legitimate nutritional purposes) and that the quantity is significant. 
  &nbsp;Here, the 1.4% shows that flesh is a quantitatively-insignificant portion 
  of the overall diet; especially so, as these data are for the <b>time</b> spent 
  in &quot;feeding on different food types&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;The time spent in 
  catching and eating animal flesh per unit of food consumed would be unrealistically 
  high compared to that invested in obtaining plant-foods, since these do not 
  run away or fight back. &nbsp;Also, that such 'feeding' on flesh is often accompanied 
  by aggressive fighting and squabbling of the chimpanzees themselves over the 
  distribution of the flesh, thus further increasing the time per unit of possible 
  nutrition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meatarians also tend 
  to make the claim that chimp insect-eating represents additional and significant 
  &quot;meat&quot; or animal protein input, but does it?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodall<a name="t"></a> 
  also gives additional information that indicates that the time spent on catching/eating 
  insects, especially termites and ants, is disproportionately large compared 
  to any possible nutritional payoff; thus, the time figure for Insects, above, 
  significantly exaggerates their nutritional significance. &nbsp;&quot;While 
  insects of one sort or another were eaten in all but 6 of the 24 months, the 
  different types were markedly seasonal and <b>only termites</b> made significant 
  contributions to the diet in terms of feeding times. ... The main termite &quot;fishing&quot; 
  season ... is in November. &nbsp;This is the time when the reproductives leave 
  their nests and form new colonies. &nbsp;When chimpanzees see these winged &quot;princes&quot; 
  and &quot;princesses&quot; swarming, they often run to the next and catch them 
  as they emerge.&nbsp;... The chimpanzees also feed on the soldiers and (much 
  less often) the workers, using simple tools to extract them from their underground 
  tunnels. ... A passage yielding only a few termites may, nevertheless, be worked 
  for minutes on end, particularly by females during the dry season.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;... 
  it is not uncommon for a female at this time of year [dry season ljf] to continue 
  fishing for an hour or more even when she is getting only <b>a few termites 
  every ten minutes</b>.&quot; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termites, Macrotermes 
  bellicosus, are the most significant insect consumed in Gombe, representing 
  &quot;87.4% ... and ... 86.3%&quot; of the total time spent on eating insects 
  in the two years documented, and since this feeding is sporadic, highly seasonal, 
  and it peaks in the month of November when the hives split to form new colonies, 
  it is clear that this is opportunistic feeding, and not related to any real 
  nutritional need which would be indicated by daily consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, 
  chimp insect-eating is remarkably similar to humans eating junk-food for social, 
  or opportunistic, rather than legitimate nutritional, purposes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tool use, as with 
  humans, indicates that the activity is purely social/cultural in character and 
  unrelated to any natural nutritional need. &nbsp;The gross overestimate of any 
  possible nutritional significance due to the lack of efficiency of the 'fishing' 
  on the time figures given is revealed, thus drastically reducing the nutritional 
  impact well below that suggested by the 4.1% figure given above. &nbsp;Similarly, 
  for ant eating, &quot;... the mean intake for an adult during a dipping session 
  in about 20 grams&quot;. &nbsp; Since one could gather and eat 20 grams of fruit, 
  leaves, or nuts in only a very few seconds, as opposed to several minutes needed 
  to collect 20 grams of ants, the implied nutritional significance of Insects 
  in the chart, above, is highly exaggerated. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodall also emphasizes 
  the cultural aspects of various feeding behaviors. &nbsp;&quot;There is also 
  evidence that food items commonly eaten by one chimpanzee community are ignored 
  by another despite their availability -- or they are eaten in a different manner.&quot; 
  &nbsp;She also refers to &quot;the traditional food preferences of a community&quot; 
  and states &quot;... youngsters, with their more flexible behavior and their 
  predilection for exploration, are the most likely age class to introduce a new 
  feeding tradition&quot;; thus, emphasizing the necessity of differentiating 
  between the true natural foods of the species and those eaten because of the 
  local culture, just as it is imperative to understand such differences in human 
  diets.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should 
  apply the irrational &quot;logic&quot; of meatarian propaganda to the fact that 
  in very rare occurrences, a chimp will kill and eat a baby chimp, and therefore 
  conclude that meatarians should kill and eat their own young.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
  least, this would solve the global overpopulation crises.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when we examine 
  the way flesh is captured, killed, distributed, and eaten, it becomes readily 
  apparent that chimp flesh-eating is merely a social pathology, just as it is 
  in the human.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/24543?fulltext=true">Stanford</a>, 
  a biological anthropologist and codirector of the Jane Goodall Research Center 
  at the University of Southern California,&nbsp;muses: &quot;Of all the higher 
  primates, only human beings and chimpanzees hunt and eat meat on a regular basis. 
  The similarities pose an intriguing prospect: Might the close evolutionary relationship 
  between chimpanzees and human beings provide some clues to the evolution of 
  our own behavior?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be obvious 
  that IF flesh was a nutritional necessity, as is implied, then ALL non-nursing 
  members of the troop would eat it at ALL times, as they would any other item, 
  or class of items, required in their diet. But the evidence proves that this 
  is NOT the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chimp meat-eating, as with insect-eating, tends 
  to be sporadic and is distributed randomly over the year with most months having 
  no or minimal consumption; there is also no clear seasonal pattern, so unlike 
  Stanford's statement as to it being eaten of a &quot;regular basis&quot;, above, 
  it is certainly not a &quot;regular&quot; item in the chimp diet, and this indicates 
  that this behavior is not related at all to true nutritional needs.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chimpanzees 
  also go on "hunting binges" in which they kill a large number of monkeys and 
  other animals over a period of several days or weeks. Such binges have always 
  been a little mysterious.&quot;[Ibid.]</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For chimpanzees, 
  meat is ... a means to make political bonds and gain access to sexually receptive 
  females. ...&nbsp;As far back as the 1960s, the American primatologist Geza 
  Teleki proposed that the predatory behavior of the Gombe chimpanzees had a strong 
  social basis. The Dutch primatologist Adrian Kortlandt suggested that hunting 
  was a form of social display, in which male chimpanzees revealed their prowess 
  to other members of the community. ...&nbsp;Although Richard Wrangham, of Harvard 
  University, suggested that meat consumption was nutritionally based, he also 
  noticed that certain aspects of their hunting behavior could not be accounted 
  for by nutritional needs alone. ...&nbsp;We might look toward the social aspects 
  of chimpanzee societies to understand their hunting patterns. One clue to the 
  significance of meat in a chimpanzee society comes from the observation that 
  males do most of the hunting. During the past decade, adult and adolescent males 
  made over 90 percent of the kills at Gombe. Although females occasionally hunt, 
  they more often receive a share of meat from the male who captured the prey. 
  &nbsp;This state of affairs sets up an interesting dynamic between males and 
  females. Sometimes a begging female does not receive any meat until after the 
  male copulates with her (even while clutching the freshly killed carcass). ...&nbsp;Such 
  observations suggest that male chimpanzees use meat as a tool to gain access 
  to sexually receptive females.&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of the kill to other 
  male chimpanzees also hints at another social role for meat. &nbsp;The Japanese 
  primatologist Toshisada Nishida and his colleagues in the Mahale Mountains showed 
  that the alpha male Ntilogi distributes meat to his allies but consistently 
  withholds it from his rivals. &nbsp;Such behavior, they suggest, reveals that 
  meat can be used as a political tool in chimpanzee society.&quot;[Ibid.]</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="g1"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodall 
  points out in her section, Eating Meat, &quot;Chimpanzees tear off chunks of 
  meat with their teeth and hands, sometimes using their feet too when strength 
  is required for dividing up the carcass. &nbsp;<b>Almost always</b> each morsel 
  is <b>chewed up together with a wadge of leaves</b>, sometimes dead ones. &nbsp;These 
  wadges, although they may be swallowed, <b>are usually discarded</b> along with 
  any unwanted portion of the meat, such as pieces of bone or skin.&quot; &nbsp;Thus, 
  it seems the chimps are <b>not eating </b>the meat, as is commonly assumed, 
  <b>but extracting the juice</b>, and thus very little protein or fat is actually 
  <b>swallowed</b> or available for nutritional purposes; far less that the amount 
  implied from the feeding times in the above table!! &nbsp;Other individuals 
  &quot;also chew the leaf-meat wadges that have been discarded by their luckier 
  companions.&quot;, clearly a monkey-see-monkey-do process of pure imitation 
  and not related to any real nutritional needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Begging ... 
  is the way <b>most chimps</b> try to get some meat for themselves. &nbsp;Their 
  success depends on a variety of factors, such as the amount of meat involved, 
  the amount the possessor has already consumed, and the relative age, rank, and 
  relationship of the two individuals.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;If meat was a necessary 
  or meaningful source for nutritional input, it would be consumed by <b>all adults</b> 
  on a regular and consistent basis; it simply is not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, given the vanishingly 
  small amount of flesh actually consumed in the average chimp diet, the lack 
  of significant nutritional input supplied by sucking the juice and not swallowing 
  the meat itself, the fact that abundant amounts of proteins and fats are much 
  more readily available in nuts/seeds, the presence of undigested meat in feces, 
  the overwhelming evidence is that chimp flesh-eating is merely a SOCIAL pathology, 
  as it is in the human.&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument that chimp flesh-eating implies 
  that humans &quot;should&quot; or have a &quot;need&quot; for flesh is seen 
  to be totally absurd, and absolutely insupportable by the facts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the evidence 
  of insect or meat remains in chimp feces indicates that these items were not 
  properly digested and assimilated; if they had been, they would not appear in 
  the feces, thus these facts undermine any implied nutritional input from these 
  sources even further.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collagen, the most abundant protein in vertebrate 
  bodies is &quot;insoluble and indigestible&quot;.[<a href="#l">2</a>]</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the argument 
  that chimp flesh-eating or insect-eating is related to any significant nutritional 
  need is seen to be absolutely absurd. &nbsp;In fact, the only items eaten every 
  day throughout the year are fruit and leaves which comprise 81% of the feeding 
  time; these are the staples, and the other &quot;foods&quot; are opportunistic 
  and/or social in character, and thus not related to true, ongoing nutritional 
  needs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, eliminating nutritionally-insignificant 
  items from the average chimp diet, above, we get:</font></p>

</table>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">remarkably similar to diets those who do personal 
  experimentation with raw eating converge on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF the human species 
  had &quot;evolved&quot; or &quot;adapted&quot; to flesh-eating as falsely claimed 
  by most meatarian armchair anthropologists, then the physical tools (claws, 
  sharp teeth, ability to outrun animals,...), the digestive chemistry, and the 
  INSTINCT to do so would have also co-evolved, but there is no evidence that 
  even suggests that these &quot;adaptations&quot;, that are absolutely necessary 
  for any species to be able to catch, eat, and properly digest raw animal flesh, 
  exist in the human. &nbsp;Of course, the &quot;civilized&quot; human, having 
  absolutely NO instinct to catch, kill, tear asunder, and eat RAW animals, which 
  would exist IF we had &quot;evolved&quot; to do so, always cooks his flesh; 
  however, cooking animal protein and fats creates some of the most potent <a href="meatcan.htm">carcinogens</a> 
  known: nitrosamines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, those armchair 
  anthropologists who glibly claim we are/were &quot;scavengers&quot; are welcome 
  to actually test their theory by chowing down on some fresh road-kill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In human nutrition, 
  personal experience, not popular delusions based on insupportable academic assumptions, 
  is the best teacher!</font></p>

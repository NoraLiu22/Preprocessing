<p>The 2023–24 Corporate Plan for the Department of the Senate, which covers the period 2023–24 to 2026–27, is published to meet the requirements of paragraph 35(1)(b) of the <em>Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</em>.</p>
<h2>From the Clerk </h2>
<p>The Department of the Senate provides the secretariat for the Senate and for dozens of parliamentary committees. We arrange their meetings, facilitate their work and report their outcomes. Alongside those activities our core services are described in terms of advice and support. We give senators and others the advice and support they need to participate in meetings of the Senate and committee meetings. We also advise senators on other matters affecting the operation of the Parliament and its committees, and provide administrative advice and support to senators and their staff, particularly in Parliament House.</p>
<p>All of these activities carry with them the challenges of managing unpredictable workloads and deadlines, and ensuring that our advice and support is consistent, professional and impartial; underpinned by expert procedural knowledge. More broadly, we seek to explain the role and work of the Senate, including through public information and education programs. One step away from this, our corporate and executive functions are directed to maintaining our capability to provide the advice and support that sits at the core of our functions.</p>
<p>A complication in planning our work is that, to a large degree, our work and workload is determined by factors beyond our control.</p>
<p>For instance, each of our corporate plans focus on the year ahead but gaze out over four years. This brings the ebb and flow of the electoral cycle into play. An election year typically involves a lull in legislative and committee activity; the next year sees that activity ramp up, and this is generally sustained through the following year. The year just past – the first year of the 47th Parliament – followed that pattern, with committee activity quickly reaching the elevated levels seen in recent years and legislative activity increasing in line with the number of sitting days. We expect to be supporting similar levels of activity throughout the coming year, before it tails off a little in the presumed election year of 2024–25.</p>
<p>Beyond the electoral cycle, our work and workload is largely determined by senators themselves, through the decisions they make – individually and collectively – in relation to their legislative and committee work. To give some examples, the Senate sets its own schedule of sittings, which affects the level of demand for procedural advice. The demand for legislative drafting support depends on the scope the government’s legislative program and the extent to which non-government senators seek our assistance in drafting amendments and private senators’ bills. The Senate delegates to its network of committees a range of scrutiny, accountability and investigative functions. Senators collectively determine the number of operative committees and the nature of their inquiries, in turn driving demand for the advice, administrative support, research and writing undertaken by our committee staff.</p>
<p>The past year has shown how the political composition of the Senate comes into play here. Compared with the previous parliament, the Senate has fewer government senators, more opposition senators and a larger, more diverse crossbench. Having more, and more diverse, party groupings and independent senators typically increases the demand for procedural advice and support, and for assistance in drafting legislative amendments and private senators’ bills. At the same time, we have seen different groupings of senators coming together to initiate more committee inquiries. We expect to see these effects continue in the current year.</p>
<p>In previous plans I have noted the continued trend of the Senate appointing additional select committees outside of the established committee system. A small number of additional committees can be accommodated within the secretariats of standing committees. However, this approach is not possible when large numbers of select committees run concurrently. Last year, the Senate Appropriations, Staffing and Security Committee recognised that recent elevated levels of committee activity have become entrenched, supporting the President’s bid for additional funds for committee support. In the Budget in May this year the government accepted that position, providing ongoing supplementation in the order of $2.2 million. This effectively returns the department’s budget to the funding levels that applied in the previous parliament, which saw a record number of committees appointed.</p>
<p>At the same time, our capacity is affected by other external factors. For instance, last year I noted challenges emerging in the employment market. The advice and support we provide rests on our people; on our capacity to recruit well and support the development and well-being of our staff. As expected, we have seen greater competition for high-performing staff and higher levels of attrition. We have run multiple recruitment rounds over the past year, and expect that this will continue in the medium term. A higher turnover of staff necessitates additional induction, learning and development, and delays in bringing new staff onboard can put pressure on existing staff. Program managers are monitoring these trends and ensuring that gaps are plugged wherever possible. At the same time, it is gratifying to note the number of staff advancing within the department.</p>
<p>A key task over coming months will be the negotiation of a new enterprise agreement for staff. The government’s bargaining framework for non-APS agencies requires the department to have regard to the common terms and conditions that emerge from the APS service-wide bargaining round that is currently on foot. I expect that a key feature of our bargaining process will be determining how to apply those conditions within our environment. As this is the first full
bargaining round for some years, I expect that bargaining representatives will also bring their own ideas to the table. One of our aims throughout the process will be to ensure that the department’s new agreement supports our capacity to attract and retain high performing staff.</p>
<p>Following adoption of an updated policy on diversity and inclusion, we will continue work to develop and implement our new diversity and inclusion action plan. We’ll also continue to work with our colleagues across the Parliamentary Service to implement recommendations of the Set the Standard report. This will include working closely with the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service as it expands its operations pending the expected passage of legislation in the coming months.</p>
<p>We are also planning to participate this year in the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) census, having adopted the approach of taking part every second year. In doing so we will be hoping to replicate the gratifying results from the 2021 census, which reflected a high performing, engaged and motivated workforce, with great clarity about their duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The next four years promise to be a period of continuing challenge in terms of consistent high demand for the services the department provides. Meeting that challenge will involve maintaining institutional capability by ensuring the department attracts, develops and retains staff from the broadest possible talent pool. It also presents particular opportunities to assure the department’s future capability by enhancing the diversity of our staff and ensuring we foster an environment where all staff can best contribute to our work providing the Senate, its committees and senators with advice and support.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Pye<br />
	</strong>Clerk of the Senate</p>
<h2>The Senate secretariat</h2>
<p>The Senate department is the secretariat to the Australian Senate. Our key functions derive from this purpose and our work is substantially driven by the requirements of the Senate and senators.</p>
<p>We provide the secretariat to the Senate – enabling its legislative and accountability activities – and to dozens of parliamentary committees, whose work encompasses the Senate’s scrutiny functions and its exercise of Parliament’s broad investigative powers. In doing so, we provide expert, impartial advice about Senate and committee operations, encompassing their powers, privileges and immunities, and reflecting well over a century of procedural precedent.</p>
<p>With our colleagues from across the Parliamentary Service we also provide specialised advice and logistical support to senators so they may undertake their duties.</p>
<p>We publish the Senate’s records, and produce an array of information resources so that people may understand and engage in its work. These public information activities enhance the transparency of government and, by contributing to a better-informed electorate, promote Australia’s democracy and Parliamentary education.</p>
<p>Our capacity to meet the needs of senators and the Senate rests on our people. Among our key objectives are to recruit well and to enhance the skills and knowledge of our staff through targeted learning and development activities, and by mentoring them in the specialised work we undertake.</p>
<p>We strive to ensure adherence to public governance and accountability requirements, and to meet our accountability obligations to the Senate and senators. Our work supports an institution that performs a key role in maintaining the accountability of the executive, so we are particularly mindful of the need to meet the highest standards of probity. Moreover, our daily interaction with senators provides a constant performance measure.</p>
<p>We succeed in our purpose when the Senate and its committees meet in accordance with their decisions, and when senators and others receive the advice and support they need to participate in those meetings. The mechanisms by which we deliver and assess our services are detailed ahead.</p>
<h3>Program delivery</h3>
<p>In planning terms, the department's purpose is expressed as a single outcome – to provide advisory and administrative support services to enable the Senate and senators to fulfil their representative duties and exercise the legislative power of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>These services are delivered through a single program.</p>
<h4>Program 1</h4>
<p><strong>Advice and support</strong> – Secretariat support for the Senate and its committees, and advice and support to enable senators and others to participate in their meetings.</p>
<h4>KEY ACTIVITIES</h4>
<p>The department’s outcome is delivered under a single program, comprising key activities in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Advice about Senate and committee proceedings</li>
	<li>Secretariat support for the Senate</li>
	<li>Secretariat support for committees</li>
	<li>Administrative advice and support for senators</li>
	<li>Public information and parliamentary education</li>
	<li>Sustaining capability, governance and accountability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MEASURES</h4>
<p>The department's activities enable the Senate and its committees to meet in accordance with their decisions.</p>
<p>Senators (and others) have the advice and support they require to participate in meetings of the Senate and its committees.</p>
<p>Senators are satisfied with the administrative advice and support they receive from the department.</p>
<p>Public information about the work and role of the Senate and its committees and parliamentary education programs are current and accessible to all.</p>
<p>Further information about the department's performance framework is summarised under the heading <em>Performance</em>.</p>
<h3>Structure and roles</h3>
<p>The department is responsible to the Senate through the President of the Senate, Senator the Hon Sue Lines. The administrative head of the department is the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Richard Pye.</p>
<p>The Clerk, Deputy Clerk, Usher of the Black Rod and Clerk Assistants comprise the Program Managers' Group which supports the Clerk to administer the department in an informed, effective and thoughtful manner. To achieve our purpose, the department is structured into seven offices. Their roles and responsibilities are set out in the department's annual work plans and are summarised below:</p>
<p><img height="668" alt="Department of the Senate organisation chart" width="522" src="https://www.aph.gov.au/-/media/05_About_Parliament/54_Parliamentary_Depts/541_Dept_of_Senate/Corporate_plan_1819/Department-OrgChart.png?la=en&hash=81C95A7D8668356BCDAD638EC6FA6FB4092BF049&hash=81C95A7D8668356BCDAD638EC6FA6FB4092BF049" /></p>
<p>The Parliament's website contains further information about the department's <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Department_of_the_Senate">corporate structure and functions</a>.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>The department occupies a unique place in the machinery of government in supporting the Senate; an independent House of Parliament established by the Australian Constitution.</p>
<p>Our work is determined by the Senate and its committees. The character of our work reflects the constitutional role of the Senate as a constituent part of the Parliament, in which the legislative power of the Commonwealth is vested. Our day-to-day tasks have evolved along with the processes the Senate has developed for scrutinising government policies, operations and legislative proposals.</p>
<p>The department is responsible, not to the government of the day, but to the Senate and all senators, and maintains complete impartiality in serving equally senators from all political parties and independent senators. Our approach and values arise from the need to provide non-partisan advice and support to each senator, to each committee on which senators serve and to the Senate as an institution.</p>
<p>The department is subject to the same financial pressures faced by other public sector agencies. The need for innovative, productive responses to budget constraints and changing expectations of senators pose particular challenges. These challenges can be particularly pressing because there is no intrinsic connection between the demand for the department's services and the resources for their delivery.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to working within the constitutional framework and standing orders of the Senate, we work in accordance with the public governance and accountability arrangements set out in the PGPA Act and other legislation in so far as they apply to the parliamentary departments.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>The department is one of four departments of the parliamentary service established under the <em>Parliamentary Services Act 1999</em>, the others being the Department of the House of Representatives, the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) and the Parliamentary Budget Office.</p>
<p>The structure of parliamentary administration is also evolving in response to the Independent Review of Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces (Jenkins Review), whose recommendations encompass the establishment of two new independent offices, the Office of Parliamentarian Staffing and Culture and the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission.</p>
<p>While our perspectives necessarily differ, we work collaboratively with our colleagues to service and support the parliament. The department adheres to the purpose of the <em>Strategic Framework: The parliamentary service</em>, to ensure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Parliament and its committees are supported effectively </li>
	<li>that senators and members are supported to undertake their work </li>
	<li>the community can easily access and engage in the work of the Parliament and parliamentary committees </li>
	<li>that national, international and regional relationships are maintained with other parliaments, parliamentary bodies and organisations </li>
	<li>Australian Parliament House (APH) is sustained as a workplace and national institution </li>
	<li>the parliamentary service is independent and non-partisan. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our capability to provide the highest standards of advice and support to senators, the Senate and its committees is founded upon the knowledge, skill, motivation and professionalism of our staff.</p>
<p>It is supported by our learning and development framework; our approach to workforce planning and recruitment; our priorities in negotiating and implementing employment frameworks; and effective governance structures.</p>
<p>Although difficult to measure, the goal here is institutional continuity. The achievement of this goal lies in the recruitment of exceptionally capable staff, our numbers commensurate with workload and within budgetary constraints; the provision of ongoing staff training and support; and the production of authoritative procedural guides and reference works. A focus on the health and well-being of our staff has been a consistent priority over many years, with the release of a strategy in 2019 followed by updates to associated policies and more recent work to refresh our diversity and inclusion policy and action plans. This focus supports our capacity to attract and retain the staff we need to effectively advise and support senators. Importantly, it also ensures the department provides a supportive environment in which all staff can best contribute. The department will participate in the APSC census in 2024 to gauge employee satisfaction and inform development of a strategic approach to staff retention.</p>
<p>During 2023–24, the department will continue to work closely with parliamentarians, the parliamentary departments and others to implement the recommendations of the Jenkins review. While the department has different employment arrangements to those which apply to the staff of members of parliament, implementation of those recommendations is strengthening our policies and procedures for preventing and addressing workplace bullying and harassment and enhancing our ability to meet our obligations to provide a safe and respectful workplace for our staff.</p>
<p>We uphold the values set out in the <em>Parliamentary Service Act 1999</em>, which are embedded into our systems, practices, procedures and culture, and support our relationship with the Parliament and public. These place the highest value on impartial service to the institution of Parliament. They are essential to the department's performance and support good administration. Our values also underpin our relationships and behaviour and establish the way work is completed.</p>
<p>In the period of this plan and into the future, there will be further investment in the development of our critical capabilities to deliver effective services to the Senate. There will be a continued focus on procedural and legislative support and mentorship of the staff involved. Strong and supportive working relationships, knowledge sharing and the effective capture and dissemination of corporate knowledge through publications and strong record keeping are key elements in the continuing evolution of the management team and staff and ongoing succession planning.</p>
<h3>Information technology</h3>
<p>The ICT and administrative systems we use underpin our ability to support the Senate, committees and senators, and to produce and share information about their work. The department is constantly looking for innovative ways to deliver services, while maintaining the integrity of the advice and support provided.</p>
<p>DPS supports most of the department's ICT systems and works with the department to ensure those systems are updated to harness new capabilities and improve efficiency. The risk of ICT problems interrupting the core work of the Senate is therefore shared with DPS and mitigated through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) (updated in May 2023) and agreed service levels with DPS, business continuity planning, participation in user groups and management committees, and strategic oversight through the Parliamentary ICT Advisory Board. The parliamentary departments have in place an ongoing annual formal assurance process of the services provided by DPS.</p>
<p>In 2023–24 and beyond, the department is looking to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>continue project work to digitise manual processes and enhance the document management systems used by the department</li>
	<li>identify required ICT capabilities to support improved efficiency in the work of the department, the Senate and its committees</li>
	<li>contribute to making ICT Governance arrangements more efficient by implementing the updated MOU</li>
	<li>continue to strengthen our engagement in and oversight of joint ICT projects managed by DPS, and</li>
	<li>work on the management of cyber security as a shared risk with DPS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assurance and accountability</h2>
<p>We strive to deliver services with innovation and efficiency, and to manage risks and resources effectively and accountably. Our services are enabled by our governance and accountability arrangements. </p>
<p>These facilitate the department's work and provide assurance to the Clerk, as its accountable authority, in fulfilling accountability obligations to the Senate, under the <em>Parliamentary Service Act 1999 </em>and under the <em>Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</em>.</p>
<p>The department also works within a strong ethical framework guided by the Parliamentary Service Values, Parliamentary Service Employment Principles and the Parliamentary Service Code of Conduct set out in the <em>Parliamentary Service Act 1999</em>.</p>
<h3>Risk oversight and management</h3>
<p>Risks to the department may arise from circumstances which introduce uncertainty into its capacity to meet its purpose of providing support services to the Senate. Through our risk management strategies, the department aims to ensure that we have in place robust planning and decision making practices that will sustain the department into the future.</p>
<p>The department has a current risk management framework that is fit-for-purpose and consistent with the requirements of the PGPA Act and related policies. The framework acknowledges that the department's application of the Senate Standing Orders, procedures and the Parliamentary Service Values are the foundation of our risk management practices. The framework also includes an articulation of the department's risk appetite and tolerance, and provides guidance to further embed effective risk management practices throughout the department and to support staff to understand their role in risk management. With the release of the revised <em>Commonwealth Risk Management Policy</em>, the framework was reviewed in 2023 to maintain its relevance and appropriateness.</p>
<p>The main vehicle for the ongoing monitoring and treatment of risks is our strategic risk assessment report which the department regularly reviews and updates to address any emerging areas of risk or opportunity. The risk assessment provides a focus for talking about risk and incorporating appropriate mitigation activities in our governance and business processes and is a primary focus of the department's annual internal audit program.</p>
<p>Monitoring the risk assessment, and other risk related matters, is the responsibility of senior management and the strategies to address the department's key risks are considered at each Program Managers' Group meeting. Program Managers regularly report to the department's Audit Committee, which in turn provides advice to the Clerk on the appropriateness of our risk oversight and management.</p>
<h3>Key business risks</h3>
<p>The following table provides a snapshot of the department’s five strategic risk categories at 1 July 2023. The risk ratings are determined after the effective implementation of risk treatment strategies and controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">^ These are shared risks that require a collaborative effort of oversight and management.</p>
<h3>Governance forums and activities</h3>
<p>The department’s capacity to achieve its purpose is supported by effective governance arrangements. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>advice, support and scrutiny provided by a senior management committee, the Program Managers’ Group, chaired by the Deputy Clerk</li>
	<li>a Workplace Consultative Committee through which formal consultation on workplace relations occurs between the department and staff, and</li>
	<li>regular reviews of compliance with relevant legislative requirements and obligations, the results of which are articulated to the various governance bodies of the department.</li>
</ul>
<p>To complement these internal mechanisms, the department’s activities are also scrutinised by both an internal audit service provider and the Australian National Audit Office. In addition, the department’s Audit Committee provides relevant independent advice to the Clerk. The Audit Committee:</p>
<ul>
	<li>reports regularly to the Clerk</li>
	<li>provides independent written advice to the Clerk on the appropriateness of the department’s financial reporting, performance reporting, system of risk oversight and management, and system of internal controls, and</li>
	<li>produces an annual report, which is provided to the President of the Senate and the Appropriations, Staffing and Security Committee as part of the department’s accountability arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We report on the activities and recommendations arising from these forums in our annual reports.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The department's performance framework focuses on our ability to achieve our purpose. We succeed when the Senate and its committees meet in accordance with their decisions, and when senators and others receive the advice and support needed to participate in these meetings. This Plan describes our approach to measuring success.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the department's performance is based upon the degree to which its services meet the requirements of the Senate and its committees, and senators, principally measured against the following criteria:</p>
<p><img alt="Accuracy - advice, programs and information resources are sound. Timeliness - timeliness and availability of advice, programs and resources. Satisfaction of senators - including committees of senators" height="286" width="1000" src="http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/541%20Dept%20of%20Senate/Corporate%20plan/CorporatePlan-evaluation.jpg?la=en&hash=290B688104DB029D5B5AB157289A47CBDA0230B5&hash=290B688104DB029D5B5AB157289A47CBDA0230B5" /></p>
<p>These criteria are the cornerstones of all services and activities provided by the department. The mechanisms for measuring performance are described on pages 14–17, under the heading <em>How performance is measured</em>.</p>
<h3>Factors influencing demand</h3>
<p>The department will also report on the demand for its services. A constant in our planning and reporting has been the recognition that much of the demand for our services shifts in line with levels of Senate legislative and committee activity. Demand is overwhelmingly driven by decisions of the Senate and its committees.</p>
<p>Each year, significant factors include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>the political dynamics of the Senate </li>
 <li>the number of days and hours, and distribution, of the sittings of the Senate </li>
 <li>the legislative workload of the Senate, and </li>
 <li>the number of committees, and their workload. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Monitoring and assessment</h3>
<p>Workload and deadlines are largely dictated by decisions of the Senate and its committees, so it is not always possible to set specific targets. Assessing performance relies on a measurement of the work undertaken and the feedback received from those who rely on these services.</p>
<p>The department monitors its performance through formal and informal channels. Formally, performance is measured through such tools as outputs from management information systems and seminar evaluation forms. Additional formal processes for assessing senators' satisfaction with our work includes the use of targeted surveys designed to elicit feedback from senators and their offices on specific services, providing both quantitative and qualitative information, on our performance. To improve the level of survey responses, the department has established a benchmark and uses the electoral cycle to schedule surveys. Much of the department's work involves contact with senators and their staff, presenting a direct means of eliciting, often informal, feedback about services and performance and an avenue for addressing concerns as they are raised. Senators' comments about the department and its staff, placed on the public record during Senate and committee proceedings, constitute a valuable source of performance information.</p>
<p>The department undertakes an annual case study to illustrate the connection between its work and the activities of the Senate. The subject of the case study is selected early in the financial year and on a rotating basis to ensure transparency, an objective reflection of performance and coverage of all the key activities of the department. If a case study is no longer available for analysis, a replacement will be selected which meets the same criteria. The results of a case study are included in the annual performance statements.</p>
<p>Performance can also be measured through external scrutiny. Senate committees provide opportunities for senators and others to monitor the department's performance. The Clerk and other officers appear at estimates hearings of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee during each round of Senate estimates. This provides an important accountability mechanism by which senators may test advice provided by departmental officers and evaluate the department's performance in a public forum.</p>
<p>The Appropriations, Staffing and Security Committee also has a specific role in relation to the department's appropriations as well as matters concerning the department's structure, staffing and ICT and security arrangements. Quarterly reports on the department's financial performance are provided to the President of the Senate and the Appropriations, Staffing and Security Committee. The Chairs' Committee typically meets biannually providing an opportunity for those senators who chair Senate committees to give feedback on the advice and services provided by the department.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that the department's performance framework continues to be influenced by consideration of internal audit recommendations, results of better practice assessments and the advice of our audit committee. This framework has and will continue to evolve and mature.</p>
<h3>How performance is measured</h3>
<p>The department's purpose is achieved through the delivery of its core services, outlined in the department's 2023–24 Portfolio Budget Statements and summarised on page 4, <em>Program delivery</em>. These services are demand driven and to demonstrate our success, the department will report on the provision of significant services and the feedback received from those who rely on these services.</p>

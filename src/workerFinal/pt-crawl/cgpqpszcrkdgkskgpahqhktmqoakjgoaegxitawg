            <p>
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open (formerly known as Zentralblatt MATH) is the
                world's most comprehensive and longest-running abstracting and
                reviewing service in pure and applied mathematics. It is edited
                by the
                <a href="https://www.euro-math-soc.eu/">European Mathematical Society</a>&nbsp;(EMS), the
                <a href="https://www.hadw-bw.de/">Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en">FIZ&nbsp;Karlsruhe</a>.
                The editorial work is done by the Berlin office of
                FIZ&nbsp;Karlsruhe, which as a member of the
                <a href="https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/home/">Leibniz Association</a>
                is a non-profit company and a recognized organisation serving
                the public interest. Since January 2021, zbMATH&nbsp;Open has been
                available as an open access service.
            </p>

            <p>
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open is set to become a crucial hub in the global
                network of mathematics information. It connects a large variety
                of mathematics-relevant
                information and information services in our open access
                interface, and aim to enable more links through our APIs. More
                details are outlined in
                <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.4171/NEWS/116/12">https://dx.doi.org/10.4171/NEWS/116/12</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, zbMATH&nbsp;Open contains around 5&nbsp;million
                bibliographic entries with reviews or abstracts drawn from more
                than 5,000&nbsp;journals and book series, and some
                200,000&nbsp;books. The coverage, which starts in the 18th
                century, is complete from 1868 to the present day, due to the
                integration of the
                <a href="/?db=jfm">“Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik” data</a>.
                In 2024, mathematically relevant parts of the arXiv were integrated.
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open contains more than one million profiles of
                identified authors connected with various platforms, the
                swMATH information service about mathematical software, about 50 million
                references, links to mathematical research data,
                and connections to various full text and research data platforms or
                Q&amp;A forums like
                <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a>.

            <h3 id="id_1_1">Indexing</h3>
            <p>
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open provides easy access to bibliographic data, reviews and
                abstracts from all areas of pure mathematics as well as
                applications, in particular to natural sciences, computer science,
                economics and engineering. It also covers history and philosophy of
                mathematics and university education. All entries are classified
                according to the <a href="http://msc2020.org">
                Mathematics Subject Classification Scheme (MSC&nbsp;2020)</a>
                and are equipped with keywords in order to characterize their
                particular content.
            </p>
            <p>
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open covers all available published and peer-reviewed
                articles, books, conference proceedings as well as other
                publication formats pertaining to the scope given above that
                present a genuinely new point of view. For the list of journals
                and book series covered see the

            <h3 id="id_1_2">Reviewing</h3>
            <p>
                Published items are initially indexed in zbMATH&nbsp;Open based on metadata provided
                by publishers as pending items. They obtain a stable zbMATH&nbsp;Open&nbsp;ID
                after finalization. This may take several months,
                depending on the reviewing and editorial process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selected articles will be reviewed after the indexing procedure.
                More than 8,000 active expert reviewers from all over the world
                contribute reviews to zbMATH&nbsp;Open.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reviewers are selected by the zbMATH&nbsp;Open editor in charge. The reviews
                are not intended to serve as replacements for peer-reviewing. They
                should instead give a well-balanced description of the content of
                the paper within the context of current developments in the
                corresponding subject area. Reviewers have, in principle, no
                responsibility for checking the correctness or novelty of the
                original, but if they discover that it contains a significant error
                or that it overlaps significantly with other work, they should
                mention the fact. References to related work are always
                appreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every trained mathematician is very welcome to become a reviewer of
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open in their specific field of research, see
                <a href="/frequently-asked-questions/#become_a_reviewer">our FAQ on &quot;Becoming a reviewer&quot;</a> for more
                details.
            </p>
            <h3 id="id_1_3">Mathematics Subject Classification</h3>
            <p>
                The Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) is a classification
                scheme maintained by
                <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/">Mathematical Reviews</a>
                and zbMATH&nbsp;Open. It is used by these reviewing services and many others
                to categorize items in the mathematical sciences literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MSC is updated every 10&nbsp;years, the current version being
                <a href="http://msc2020.org">MSC2020</a>. See the
                <a href="/classification/">classification search</a> or

            <h3 id="id_1_4">Links to full texts</h3>
            <p>
                The service zbMATH&nbsp;Open contains about 4&nbsp;million
                direct links to electronic versions of the indexed
                publications, to the publishers’ websites and/or to electronic
                libraries and repositories with open access to the full texts
                (in particular
                to <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>,
                <a href="http://www.emis.de/ELibM.html">ElibM</a> and
                <a href="https://eudml.org/">EuDML</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Within current electronic library activities, more
                retrospective data of journals are made available, too, even
                prior to 1868, that give also links to full texts. For
                instance, coverage of
                <a href="/serials/520">Crelle’s&nbsp;Journal (Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik)</a>
                has been extended in this way back to Vol.&nbsp;1 (1826).
            </p>
            <p>
                For articles from about 600 journals, lists of references are
                delivered, with links to their zbMATH&nbsp;Open entries as well as their
                electronic versions via <a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="id_1_5">User interface</h3>
            <p>
                The main aim of the zbMATH&nbsp;Open interface is to offer detailed and
                easily accessible information, with the potential to
                incorporate results of recent and future developments.
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open is updated daily with new bibliographic data and
                abstracts. Reviews are also updated on a daily basis after
                initial editorial work has been carried out.
                The final editorial work on reviews and abstracts is subsequently
                done as quickly as possible.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Separated tabs allow for an easy navigation among different
                    search facets: documents, authors, serials, classification
                    codes and software. The search results are interlinked
                    according to the structure of the contents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Results of a query are filtered by authors, journals,
                    classification codes and publication years according to
                    frequency. This functionality helps you to refine your
                    original search as well as to formulate complex queries.
                    For instance, you can now determine who are the most
                    prolific authors in the top mathematics journals or analyse
                    how research topics have evolved over the years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For every author, a profile page with an analysis of their
                    publications according to co-authors, journals and
                    mathematical subjects is generated. The publications are
                    displayed in chronological order as a clickable diagram for
                    easy visualization of the author's scientific output.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serial profiles offer aggregated information on all
                    indexed journals and book series, particularly helpful for librarians or
                    for scientific evaluation purposes.

                This enables a novel information service for mathematical

            <h3 id="id_1_7">arXiv Preprints</h3>
            <p>
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open displays arXiv preprints from a specified set of subcategories
                in the math category. The subcategories are chosen by analyzing how many
                preprints in them have actually been published within the zbMATH&nbsp;Open scope
                in the past. For more details see
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08297">arXiv:2401.08297</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to published articles, preprints are not reviewed and mistakes
                in their metadata are not corrected. Furthermore, withdrawn arXiv preprints
                are displayed following the arXiv policy. If a preprint gets published,
                it is merged with the published version.
                The zbMATH&nbsp;Open entry for a merged preprint disappears and the arXiv version
                will just appear as an additional link.
            </p>
            <p>
                It might happen that a preprint is published in a journal or
                conference that is not in the scope of zbMATH&nbsp;Open. In
                this case, the corresponding zbMATH&nbsp;Open entry will remain
                in its preliminary form. Such cases are limited by the choice
                of the displayed arXiv subcategories, but cannot be ruled out
                completely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Links to arXiv preprints are assigned algorithmically to published articles.
                This algorithm is not perfect and might lead to missing or wrong arXiv links
                at a zbMATH&nbsp;Open document.

                The history of zbMATH&nbsp;Open, from its origins as a monthly compilation of bibliographic data and reviews of mathematical publications to its current status as a comprehensive service in pure and applied mathematics, recounts a fascinating tale that spans decades of intense developments in information services for scientific literature.

            <h3 id="id_3_1">Foundation and early years</h3>
            <p>
                The Zentralblatt für Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete was founded in 1931 with the aim to publish reviews of the entire world literature in mathematics and related areas. Zentralblatt became the second comprehensive review journal for mathematics in Germany after the Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik, established in 1868 and active until the 1940s. Although Zentralblatt had essentially the same agenda as the Jahrbuch, the latter maintained the principles of completeness and classification of all articles of one year, whereas Zentralblatt counted on promptness and internationality.

            <p>
                The initiative for the foundation of a new mathematical reviewing journal came from mathematicians <a href="http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/~portosil/neugebau.html">Otto&nbsp;Neugebauer</a>, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Courant.html">Richard Courant</a>, and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bohr_Harald.html">Harald Bohr</a>, together with the publisher Ferdinand Springer. The rapidly growing number of newly published mathematics works in the 1920s and the scientists’ need for obtaining quick information on recent material motivated the decision to create an alternative service to the Jahrbuch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zentralblatt’s first editorial board consisted of Pavel S. Alexandrov, Julius Bartels, Wilhelm Blaschke, Richard Courant, Hans Hahn, Godfrey H. Hardy, Friedrich Hund, Gaston M. Julia, Oliver Kellogg, Hans Kienle, Tullio Levi-Civita, Rolf H. Nevanlinna, Hans Thirring, and Bartel L. van der Waerden. Otto Neugebauer became the first editor-in-chief, directing Zentralblatt from G&ouml;ttingen, while the editorial office was installed on the premises of the <a href="http://www.springer.com">Springer publishing house</a> in Berlin. Distinguished  mathematicians from various countries belonged to the large group of reviewers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, a large amount of the editorial correspondence documenting the foundational era of Zentralblatt got lost in the turmoil of the Second World War and the post-war period. Nevertheless, it is a fact that within very few years Zentralblatt became a successful journal, with 18 volumes appearing between 1931 and 1938.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Neugebauer directed the new periodical for several years until the political situation in Germany made his position as editor-in-chief unsustainable. In 1933, shortly after the Nazi party rose to power, a law was enacted which banned Jews and political enemies from holding jobs as civil servants. A call to dismiss Courant, Neugebauer, Landau, Bernays, and Noether appeared in a local newspaper and, soon afterwards, Courant escaped to the UK and later moved to New York. Due to this pressure, Neugebauer decided to resign from his post at G&ouml;ttingen University and in 1934 took up a professorship in Copenhagen, from where he continued his work for Zentralblatt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The struggle to produce the reviewing journal became more difficult throughout this period, however, for the Nazis tried to influence the editorial policy. Neugebauer eventually gave up his position as editor-in-chief in 1938 after a series of incidents, including Levi-Civita being dismissed from the editorial board without his knowledge. Following his withdrawal, other letters and telegrams of resignation were sent to Springer by editorial board members Bohr, Hardy, Courant, Tamarkin, and Veblen, and by a very large number of reviewers. English-language contributions to zbMATH&nbsp;Open were greatly reduced by the middle of 1939 and all but gone by the beginning of 1940.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neugebauer moved to the USA in 1939, accepting an offer at Brown University which had been arranged by its dean Roland G. D. Richardson, who was also the secretary of the <a href="http://www.ams.org">American Mathematical Society</a> and saw the opportunity to use Neugebauer's expertise in the American project of founding a reviewing journal of their own. Upon leaving Europe, Neugebauer burnt most of the editorial correspondence of Zentralblatt and records of the journal except for the cumulative index. The first issue of the Mathematical Reviews, the American-based mathematical reviewing journal modeled on Zentralblatt, saw the light in January 1940.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1939 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences">Prussian Academy of Sciences</a> and the <a href="https://dmv.mathematik.de/">German Mathematical Society</a> took over the management of Zentralblatt. Harald Geppert, a mathematician and devoted Nazi, was nominated as managing editor (&quot;Generalredakteur&quot;) of both the Jahrbuch and Zentralblatt, with Ludwig Bieberbach, also a devoted Nazi, as supervising editor. Until 1945, the editorial offices of the two journals continued working independently of each other, but sometimes they shared information, scientific literature and reviews.

                The collapse of Germany after World War II led to a temporary suspension of the work at Zentralblatt. Berlin evolved as a divided city: West-Berlin (sectors of the Western Allies) and East-Berlin (Soviet sector). The Soviet administration took responsibility for the Prussian Academy of Sciences, which was reopened in 1946 as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Academy_of_Sciences_at_Berlin">German Academy of Sciences</a>. Due to the initiative of the Academy and of Springer, Zentralblatt came to life again in 1947, while around the same time it was decided not to revive the Jahrbuch, of which the last volume (covering the year 1942) had been published in 1944.
            </p>
            <p>
                The editor-in-chief was Hermann Ludwig Schmid, who played an important role in the reconstruction of Zentralblatt, reviving contacts with former colleagues, inviting many of them to work again as editors or reviewers and finally succeeding in restarting publication. Following Schmid’s appointment as professor in Würzburg in 1953, Erika Pannwitz, who had worked as an editor for both the Jahrbuch in the 1930s and Zentralblatt since 1947, took over the editorship.

            <h3 id="id_3_4">Zentralblatt – a German-German cooperation</h3>
            <p>
                The construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 caused a renewed division in Zentralblatt. The barrier cut off West-Berlin from the Eastern part of the city, causing many complications for Zentralblatt and its editors. While the editorial office was located in Adlershof (East Berlin) on the premises of the German Academy of Sciences, Zentralblatt’s publishing house Springer and about half of its staff members, including Pannwitz, were located in the Western districts. To make communication and the exchange of material between Zentralblatt’s office and Springer possible, Pannwitz and two other members of staff were given special permits by the German Democratic Republic to enter East Berlin without strict control.

                Together with other West Berlin editors, she set up an
                additional temporary editorial office within the Springer house
                at Heidelberger Platz. The split-up of editorial
                responsibilities for Zentralblatt became official with the
                cooperation agreement between the German Academy of Sciences
                and the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1965.
                The academies agreed to continue Zentralblatt with the editing
                duties to be shared equally by both Berlin offices, with
                printing and distribution to be done by Springer. Walter
                Romberg was in charge of the Eastern editorial board, while
                Pannwitz continued as editor-in-chief of the Western office.
                She stepped down from this position in 1969, and Ulrich Güntzer
                became her successor.
            </p>
            <p>
                This remarkable German-German cooperation lasted until 1977 and
                resulted in Zentralblatt renewing its international standing in
                mathematical reviewing, despite the complicated political
                constellation.

                During the decade of the 1970s the annual production of
                mathematical publications doubled, reaching a volume that could
                no longer be handled by hand. Simultaneously, advances in
                computer science and databases called for a modernization of
                Zentralblatt. Güntzer entered several partnerships with various
                scientific institutions to benefit from their computing
                facilities for the editorial work at Zentralblatt. Bernd
                Wegner, who took over the position of editor-in-chief for the
                West Berlin office in 1974, further developed the ideas of
                technically advancing the service. Recording of the text
                started being done on magnetic tapes and, from these, the
                printed version of Zentralblatt was produced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the reorganization of all information and documentation
                centers in West Germany and the intended integration of
                Zentralblatt into one of these, the Academy of Sciences of the
                GDR, formerly German Academy of Sciences, terminated its
                cooperation contract with the
                <a href="https://www.hadw-bw.de/">Heidelberg Academy of
                Sciences and Humanities</a>.
                The reviewers from the GDR had to quit their services for
                Zentralblatt, and from then on all processing of literature was
                handled solely by the West Berlin editorial staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1979 the West Germany government established the
                Fachinformationszentrum Energie, Physik, Mathematik (the
                current
                <a href="https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en">FIZ&nbsp;Karlsruhe
                &ndash;&nbsp;Leibniz Institute for Information
                Infrastructure</a>) in Karlsruhe. The Zentralblatt Berlin
                office was incorporated as a subsidiary, while the Heidelberg
                Academy of Sciences and Humanities remained responsible for
                content and Springer stayed in charge of printing, marketing
                and distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the political
                circumstances changed again. The Academy of Sciences of the GDR
                was reorganized and some former members of the East Berlin
                editorial office resumed their work for Zentralblatt. The
                Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities,
                FIZ&nbsp;Karlsruhe, and Springer continued as editors and
                publisher. Since 1999 the
                <a href="http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/">European Mathematical
                Society</a> has been involved in Zentralblatt as an
                additional editorial institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The revolutionary developments in information technology and
                computer science enormously helped to improve Zentralblatt’s
                services. The first release of the database as an offline
                version on CD-ROM called CompactMATH was published in 1990.
                Soon afterwards TeX was introduced for the typesetting of
                complex mathematical formulas. The transition of Zentralblatt
                to a service accessible through the Internet was accomplished
                in 1996; the database was named MATH and subsequently renamed
                <a href="https://zbmath.org/">zbMATH</a>.

                In 2004, all records from the Jahrbuch were
                <a href="/?db=jfm" aria-label="articles from JFM within zbMATH Open">digitized and incorporated as an extension to the database</a>.
                Moreover, the complete bibliographic data of
                <a href="/serials/520">Crelle’s&nbsp;Journal (Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik)</a>
                were added starting from its first issue of 1826.
                This makes zbMATH unique as the most comprehensive source of
                mathematical information from 1826 to the present. From 2012 to
                2015 Gert-Martin Greuel was serving as editor-in-chief of
                zbMATH.  This period has been marked by many substantial
                developments to enhance the online service; perhaps most
                notably, he put special emphasis on the addition of the
                software layer, and on significantly improving the author
                database, the integration of reference data, and profile
                functions. Since 2013 zbMATH has had a new logo and look and
                has been distributed only in electronic form.

                Klaus Hulek served as editor-in-chief from 2016 to 2023. This
                period was marked by significant transformations &ndash; most
                notably, the transition to an open service, the integration of
                mathematical research data, and of the arXiv.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a concerted effort by zbMATH stakeholders and based on a
                recommendation by the
                <a href="https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/">Leibniz&nbsp;Association</a>,
                the Joint Science Conference (Gemeinsame
                Wissenschaftskonferenz) agreed in the first week of
                December&nbsp;2019 that the Federal and State Governments of
                Germany would support FIZ&nbsp;Karlsruhe to transform zbMATH
                into an open platform. As a result zbMATH Open has become a
                freely accessible research tool for the mathematical community
                worldwide since January&nbsp;2021.
            </p>

            <p>
                This step was inspired by the International Mathematical
                Union's 2014 vision of a Global Digital Mathematics Library:
                &quot;to provide a coherent and sustainable open platform in which
                all mathematics-relevant information and data can be brought
                together, comprehensively accessed and used free of charge
                under a uniform interface&quot;.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the future, zbMATH&nbsp;Open will connect mathematical
                services and platforms in such a way that considerably more
                content will be available for further research and new research
                questions for collaborative work in mathematics and related
                fields.
            </p>

            <p>
                The qualitative demands of the academic community regarding
                coverage of mathematical literature have not changed over the
                decades since the publication of the first Jahrbuch and the
                foundation of Zentralblatt. The criteria of completeness,
                timeliness and objectivity remain a fundamental goal for
                mathematics reviewing organs. The incorporation of modern
                technologies into the core of the service, including linkage to
                complementary material, semantic enhancement, author
                disambiguation and inclusion of mathematical software, make
                zbMATH&nbsp;Open an indispensable tool for researchers in their search
                for accurate and high-quality information on mathematics
                publications.

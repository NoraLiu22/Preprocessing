      <td bgcolor="#99CCCC"><p>The humanist movement encouraged practitioners to make their own direct observations of medical phenomena.&nbsp; Dissection gave medical school teachers and students an opportunity to view animal (often pigs) and (in some cases) human anatomy firsthand.&nbsp; Rather than rely on the authority of books, dissectors wanted to see the tissues and observe their structure for themselves.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, some of Galen's assertions remained unchallenged.&nbsp; For example, Galen claimed the heart has two principal chambers.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="galenheartab.jpg" width="400" height="590" border="2"></p>
        <p>In Galen's scheme, the heart's  right chamber (<font color="#FF3300">3</font>) receives blood from the liver via the vena cava (<font color="#FF3300">2</font>).&nbsp; The blood seeps into the heart's left chamber (<font color="#FF3300">4</font>) through a series of small nearly invisible pores in the thick wall <em>(septum</em>) separating the two chambers.&nbsp; Although early modern dissectors did not see these pores, they assumed that the pores had to be there.&nbsp; How else could the blood move from one side of the heart to the other?&nbsp; Some assumed the pores to be too small to see.&nbsp; Clearly Galen was a superior observer.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="hundtheartb.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></p>
      <p align="center"><strong><font size="-1">The illustration above shows how German physician Magnus Hundt (c. 1449-1519) depicted the heart in this schematic sketch from his book <em>Antropologium</em> (1501).</font></strong></p>

	  <p>Italian physician Jacobo Berengario da Carpi (c. 1460-1530) dissected hundreds of bodies.&nbsp; In 1523 he published a book of anatomical drawings based on his observations.&nbsp; Here is his depiction of the human heart:</p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="dacarpiheartb.jpg" width="300" height="401" border="2"></p>
	  <p align="left">In 1543, Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) published <em>De Humani Corporus Fabrica</em> (<em>On the Fabric of the Human Body</em>).&nbsp; In his detailed drawing of the human heart, Vesalius showed the pores (R) that he believed were in the wall separating the two chambers even though he was unable to see the pores himself.</p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="vesaliusheartb.jpg" width="400" height="363" border="2"> </p>
	  <p align="left">Vesalius wrote:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p align="left">The septum is formed from the very densest substance of the heart.&nbsp; It abounds on both sides with pits.&nbsp; Of these none, so far as the senses can perceive, penetrate from the right to the left ventricle.&nbsp; We wonder at the art of the Creator which causes blood to pass from right to left ventricle through invisible pores. </p>
	    </blockquote>	  
	  <p align="left">After more dissections and more serious thinking about this perplexing puzzle, Vesalius began to change his mind.&nbsp; In 1555, he wrote:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p align="left">Not long ago I would not have dared to turn even a hair's breadth from Galen.&nbsp; But it seems to me that the septum of the heart is as thick, dense and compact as the rest of the heart.&nbsp; I do not see, therefore, how even the smallest particle can be transferred from the right to the left ventricle through the septum.</p>
      </blockquote>	  
	  <p align="left">Vesalius aroused some controversy by questioning of Galen's view of the heart's structure.&nbsp; But his skepticism and confidence in his own firsthand observations encouraged others to question Galen's authority even further. </p>

<p>All other Authors that have written of the nature of Herbs, give not
a bit of reason why such an Herb was appropriated to such a part of the
body, nor why it cured such a disease.
<p>Truly my own body being sickly, brought me easily into a capacity, to
know that health was the greatest of all earthly blessings, and truly he
was never sick that doth not believe it.
<p>I considered that all medicines were compounded of Herbs, Roots, Flowers,
Seeds, &amp;c., and this first set me to work in studying the nature of
simples, most of which I knew by sight before; and indeed all the Authors
I could read gave me but little satisfaction in this particular, or none
at all.&nbsp;
<p>I cannot build my faith upon Authors' words, nor believe a thing because
they say it, and could wish every body were of my mind in this,-- to labour
to be able to give a reason for every thing they say or do.&nbsp;
<p>They say Reason makes a man differ from a Beast; if that be true, pray
what are they that, instead of reason for their judgment, quote old Authors?&nbsp;
<p>Perhaps their authors knew a reason for what they wrote, perhaps they
did not; what is that to us?&nbsp;
<p>Do <b>we</b> know it?
<p>Truly in writing this work first, to satisfy myself, I drew out all
the virtues of the vulgar or common Herbs, Plants, and Trees, &amp;c.,
out of the best or most approved authors I had, or could get; and having
done so, I set myself to study the reason of them....
<p>I consulted with my two brothers, DR. REASON and DR. EXPERIENCE, and
took a voyage to visit my mother NATURE, by whose advice, together with
the help of DR. DILIGENCE, I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned
by MR. HONESTY, a stranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have
done it....
<p><center>___________
<br><br><i>Instructions for the right use of the book.</i></center>

<p>First, Consider what planet causeth the disease; that thou mayest find
it in my aforesaid Judgment of Diseases.
<p>Secondly, Consider what part of the body is afflicted by the disease,
and whether it lies in the flesh, or blood, or bones, or ventricles.
<p>Thirdly, Consider by what planet the afflicted part of the body is governed:&nbsp;
that my Judgment of Diseases will inform you also.
<p>Fourthly, You may oppose diseases by Herbs of the planet, opposite to
the planet that causes them: as diseases of Jupiter by herbs of Mercury,
and the contrary; diseases of the Luminaries by the herbs of Saturn, and
the contrary; diseases of Mars by herbs of Venus, and the contrary.
<p>Fifthly, There is a way to cure diseases sometimes by Sympathy, and
so every planet cures his own disease; as the Sun and Moon by their Herbs
cure the Eyes, Saturn the Spleen, Jupiter the Liver, Mars the Gall and
diseases of choler, and Venus diseases in the instruments of Generation.

<p>Sydenham was regarded as the leading medical practitioner of his time.&nbsp; Here is an excerpt from his <i>Medical Observations concerning the History
and Cure of Acute Diseases</i> (1676):


<blockquote>A disease, in my opinion, how prejudicial soever its causes
may be to the body, is no more than a vigorous effort of Nature to throw
off the morbific matter, and thus recover the patient.&nbsp; For as God
has been pleased so to create mankind, that they should be fitted to receive
various impressions from without, they could not, upon this account, but
be liable to different disorders; which arise (1) either from particles
of the air, as having a disagreement with the juices, insinuate themselves
into the body, and mixing with the blood, taint the whole frame; or (2)
from different kinds of fermentations and putrefactions of humours detained
too long in the body, for want of its being able to digest, and discharge
them, on account of their too large bulk or unsuitable nature.
<p>These circumstances being so closely interwoven with our constitutions
that no man can be entirely free from them, Nature provides such a method,
and train of symptoms, as may expel the peccant [<font size=-1>disease-causing</font>]
matter that would otherwise destroy the human fabric.</blockquote>
<p>Sydenham was concerned mainly about the practical questions of medical
practice.&nbsp; He ignored Harvey's work on the circulation of the blood
and later wrote:
<ul>No microscope will ever show us the minute passages by which ... the
blood passes from the arteries to the veins.</ul>

    <strong>Lysetta</strong>. Faith, sir, our cat is lately recovered of a fall she had from the top of the house into the street, and was three days without either eating or moving foot or paw; but 'tis very lucky for her that there are no cat-doctors, for 'twould have been over with her, and they would not have failed purging her and bleeding her.
    <p><strong>Sganarel</strong>. Will you hold your tongue, I say? What impertinence is this! Here they come.</p>

The people of the house did what they could, and the distemper increased; but I would not give an inch. The patient died bravely during this dispute.</p>
    <p><strong>M. Fonandr&egrave;s</strong>. 'Twas well done to teach people how to behave, and to show 'em their mistake.</p>
    <p><strong>M. Thom&egrave;s</strong>. A dead man is but a dead man, and of no consequence: but one formality neglected does a great prejudice to the whole body of physicians.</p>

    <p><strong>Sganarel</strong>. Gentlemen, my daughter's oppression increases, pray tell me quickly what you have resolved on.&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>M. Thom&egrave;s</strong>. Sir, we have reasoned upon your daughter's distemper; and my opinion, as for my part, is that it proceeds from a great heat of blood: so I'd have you bleed her as soon as you can.</p>
    <p><strong>M. Fonandr&egrave;s</strong>. And I say that her distemper is a putrefaction of humors, occasioned by too great a repletion, therefore I'd have you give her an emetic.</p>
    <p><strong>M. Thom&egrave;s</strong>. I maintain that an emetic will kill her.</p>
    <p><strong>M. Fonandr&egrave;s</strong>. And I, that bleeding will be the death of her...</p>
    <strong>M. Thom&egrave;s</strong>. Do you remember the man you killed a few days ago?
    <p><strong>M. Fonandr&egrave;s</strong>. Do you remember the lady you sent into the other world three days since?</p>
    <p><strong>M. Thom&egrave;s</strong>. (<em>To Sganarel</em>.) I have told you my opinion.</p>
    <p><strong>M. Fonandr&egrave;s</strong>. <em>(To Sganare</em>l.) I have told you my thoughts. </p>
    <p><strong>M. Thom&egrave;s</strong>. If you don't bleed your daughter out of hand, she's a dead woman.<br>

        <strong>Sganarel</strong>. Which of the two am I to believe, and what resolution shall I take upon such opposite advices? </p>
    <p align="center">
        (<em>He turns to MM. Macroton and Bahys for advice.</em>)</p>
    <p>
        Gentlemen, I conjure you to determine me, and to tell me without passion, what you think the most proper to give my daughter relief.</p>    <p><strong>M. Macroton</strong>. For, sir, to come to fact, I find your daugh-ter has a chro-ni-cal dis-ease, and that she may be in jeo-par-dy if you don't give her some assis-tance; for-as-much as the symptoms which she has are in-di-ca-tive of a fu-li-gi-nous and mor-di-cant va-por, which pricks the mem-branes of the brain; for this va-por, which we call in Greek at-mos, is caus-ed by pu-trid, te-na-ci-ous, and con-glu-tinous humors, which are con-tain-ed in the abdomen.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>M. Bahys</strong>. And as these humors were engendered there by a long succession of time; they are over-baked there, and have acquired this malignity, which fumes towards the region of the brain.</p>        <p><strong>M. Macroton</strong>. So that to draw a-way, loos-en, ex-pel, e-va-cu-ate the said hu-mors, there must be a vi-go-rous pur-ga-tion. But first of all, I think it proper, and it would not be in-con-ve-ni-ent to make use of some lit-tle a-no-dyne me-de-cines; that is to say, lit-tle e-molli-ent and de-ter-sive cly-sters, and re-fresh-ing ju-leps and sy-rups, which may be mix-ed in her bar-ley wa-ter.</p>
          <p>
        <strong>M. Bahys</strong>. Afterwards we'll come to purgation and bleeding, which we'll reiterate if there be need of it.</p>
          <p>
        <strong>M. Macroton</strong>. Not but for all this your daughter may die; but at least you'll have done some-thing, and you'll have the con-so-la-ti-on that she di-ed ac-cord-ing to form.</p>
          <p>
      <strong>M. Bahys</strong>. It is better to die according to the rules than to recover contrary to 'em....</p>

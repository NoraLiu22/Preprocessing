    called the most obscure and difficult to understand of the different versions of the

    known as the <i>houtian</i> (post-heaven) configuration. In the <i>Shuogua zhuan</i>

    sequence is also correlated with one of the eight directions, as in fig. 1 (click on the
    link to the left to see the illustration). The 3x3 grid illustrated in this diagram is
    called the <i>jiugong</i>, or Palace of Nine Halls. A trigram and one of the eight
    directions represent each of eight of the nine halls (in traditional Chinese cartography,
    south is placed at the top of the map rather than north). The direction identifies its
    location in space and the trigram characterizes the <i>qi</i> of that location. The ninth
    hall is the courtyard of the palace.</font></td>

    configuration of trigrams was correlated with a sequence of numbers known as the <i>luoshu</i>,
    or &quot;Luo River writing.&quot; The <i>luoshu</i> is first mentioned in the Confucian <i>Analects</i>,

    FACE="Arial"><i>da you nian</i>, &quot;Great Roving Year&quot; is the means by
    which number and trigram merge. First, the sequence of digits 1 through 9 is repeated 20
    times to match three sixty-term, <i>ganzhi</i> cycles of 180 years called the <i>sanyuan</i>,
    &quot;Tri-epoch.&quot; Since every year has a <i>ganzhi</i> designation, in the Tri-epoch
    everyone's year of birth has a digital correlate from 1 to 9. Each <i>luo</i>
    number has a unique trigram, derived from its <i>houtian</i> correlation (see fig. 2), so
    when the Tri-epoch digit is equated with the <i>luo</i> number, each person has a trigram
    that corresponds to his/her natal year. This is called the <i>minggua</i>, or the natal
    trigram, and it identifies the character of cosmic <i>qi</i> present at the person's
    birth. Finally, the natal trigram is paired with each of the eight directional trigrams in
    the <i>houtian</i> sequence (called <i>zhaigua</i> or hall trigrams). Each of the eight <i>minggua</i>
    therefore has a corresponding eight <i>zhaigua</i>, and these eight groups of eight
    trigrams complete the <i>da you nian</i>. This complement of a natal trigram and its set
    of hall trigrams represents a metaphysical interaction between the individual's natal <i>qi</i>
    and the <i>qi</i> of the environment that surrounds that individual. This conjunction is
    essentially thought of as a transformation of the <i>minggua</i> into the<i> zhaigua</i>

    to facilitate the reader's comprehension of the numerology underlying <i>bazhai</i>

    dynasty cosmograph (click on the link to the left to view the illustration). This
    numerical dial juxtaposes the following four factors: the <i>xiantian</i> and <i>houtian</i>
    sequences of trigrams, the <i>luoshu</i> numbers, and the directions. Around the inner
    dial are arrayed the <i>xiantian</i> trigram names with their <i>luoshu</i> correlates. On
    the square grid are arranged the trigrams of the <i>houtian</i> sequence, along with their
    <i>luoshu</i> numbers from the <i>xiantian </i>dial. On the outer square I have placed the
    cardinal directions. From just these factors, in other words, without five phase theories
    and their mutual orders, we can conduct fengshui readings as sophisticated as those
    outlined above. What makes this possible, however, is the fact that there lies embedded
    within this number dial one more hidden factor, the <i>hetu</i> system of numbers
    mentioned briefly above. More importantly, however, this board will reveal a most

    north. The other half of the disc trigrams are fortunate matches with the remaining four
    trigrams of the grid--specifically, the directions southwest, west, northwest, and
    northeast. These are none other than the <i>dong si zhai</i> and the<i> xi si zhai</i>,
    that is, the Eastern and Western Halls of the Palace of Nine Halls. These two groups of
    four trigrams form an array around the plate that is quite revealing. See figure 6 (click

    eastern and southern (left and top) arms on the one hand (3+2, 8+7, 3+7, 8+2), and the

    equals five (7-2, 8-3, 9-4, 6-1). All of these numbers correspond to trigram pairs whose
    Nine Star auspice is great, lesser, or small <i>fortune</i>. However, when the numbers of

    southern (right and top) arms, or the numbers of the northern and southern (bottom and
    top) arms, or the numbers of the eastern and western (left and right) arms, are added or
    subtracted, never is the sum or difference a multiple of five. All of the numbers on these

    <td width="772"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" color="#000000">The <i>hetu</i> configuration
    of numbers can also account for the rank of auspice among the eight directions. As it
    turns out, relative auspice is a factor of proximity. Each number of the pair of numbers
    that we add or subtract to determine auspice can come from the same arm of the <i>hetu </i>(closest
    in proximity) or from different arms. Different arms can be either adjacent (next closest
    in proximity) or opposite (farthest in proximity). The numbers closest in proximity--those
    pairs sharing the same arm which equal 5 when subtracted--are the most fortunate, so their
    Nine Star auspice is great good fortune. Next, when adjacent arms of the <i>hetu</i>
    conform to the Eastern and Western Halls of the Palace of Nine Halls (that is, the
    east/south and west/north arms), pairs of numbers from these arms always correspond to
    trigram pairs whose Nine Star auspice is good fortune. When adjacent arms of the <i>hetu </i>do
    not conform to the Eastern and Western Halls (that is, the east/north and west/south
    arms), pairs of numbers from these arms always correspond to trigram pairs whose Nine Star
    auspice is misfortune. Finally, pairs of numbers from opposite arms of the<i> hetu </i>(that
    is, the north/south and east/west arms) always correspond to trigram pairs whose Nine Star
    auspice is great misfortune.</font></td>

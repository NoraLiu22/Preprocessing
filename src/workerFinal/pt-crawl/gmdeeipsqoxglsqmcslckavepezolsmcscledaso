<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> Prue Vines<a name="fnB0" href="#fn0">[*]</a></H4>

<i>Background.</i><p>

<i>Mabo v Queensland (No 2</i>)<a name="fnB0a" href="#fn0a">[1]</a> was decided by the High Court in 1992. In that case, as is well known, the High Court, by majority, held that
native title had survived
the annexation of the Murray Islands by Queensland in
1879. In determining this issue the Court had to decide whether native title
was recognised by the common law in Australia generally. Previously, of course,
it had been held that native title was inconsistent
with the feudal doctrine of
tenures which was the basis of the land law of Australia which had been
introduced into the country by
the arrival of British settlers in 1788 and
after.<a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[2]</a> This view was based on an assumption
that sovereignty of the Crown necessarily included ownership or possession of
the land over
which the right to govern existed; and an acceptance of the
doctrine of<i> terra nullius</i>. The High Court's decision that native title
had survived or could survive in certain circumstances arose from a rejection
of both
those views. Briefly, the circumstances in which native title could
survive were where there were traditionally held lands, which
continued to be
held to the present day. Native title was to be ascertained by reference to the
traditional customary law of the
indigenous inhabitants of the area. The
radical title to the land was vested in the Crown, which was burdened with
native title until
the Crown extinguished that title.<a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[3]</a> <p>

The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</i> 1975</a> (Cth) ("Racial Discrimination Act")
protected native title from any extinguishment of title which affected
Aboriginal holders of
native title in a way which was adverse compared with
non-Aboriginal holders of land.<a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[4]</a><p>

Western Australia was the last State of Australia to be settled by the British,
being settled in 1829 as a separate colony from
New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land<a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[5]</a> after South Australia was
settled. Western Australia as a State contains very large amounts of
unalienated Crown land<a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[6]</a> in comparison to other
parts of Australia. It thus was particularly subject to the possibility of
native title claims. <p>

<i>The facts</i><p>

The plaintiff State of Western Australia enacted the <i>Land (Titles and
Traditional Usage) Act </i>1993 (WA) ("Western Australia Act") which purported
to extinguish native title and replace it with statutory rights of traditional
usage. The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act </i>1993</a> (Cth) ("Native Title Act") commenced on
1 January 1994, shortly after the Western Australia Act came into operation on
2 December
1993. The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> defined native title in terms which
incorporated the view of native title outlined in <i>Mabo (No 2).</i><p>

Western Australia was also the defendant in two proceedings brought by
representatives of the Wororra, Yawuru and Martu peoples
of Western Australia.
These actions challenged the validity of the Western Australia Act. The Court
decided to hear all these matters
together.<p>

<p>
<i>The arguments</i><p>

In the High Court, Western Australia argued that the effect of <i>Mabo (No
2</i>) was to establish that the Crown may extinguish native title and that the
survival of native title is a mere presumption rebuttable
by proof of actual
intention of the Crown. The plaintiff's submission was that the history of
Western Australia showed that native
title was either extinguished by the
establishment of a settled colony there or, alternatively, at the latest, by
the Western Australia
Act. The Commonwealth argued that native title survived
the establishment of the colony and that the Western Australia Act was
inconsistent
with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</a> and thus, native title in
Western Australia survived until the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> commenced. Western
Australia further argued that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> was beyond the legislative
power of the Commonwealth parliament, inter alia, because it was not a law with
respect to either the
race power <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s51(xxvi))</a> or the external affairs power
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s51(xxix))</a> given by the Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.<p>

<i>Did the establishment of the colony of Western Australia extinguish native
title?</i><p>

Western Australia argued that the settlement of the colony of Western Australia
was different from the settlement of New South Wales,
which was the focus of
the <i>Mabo (No 2)</i> decision. Western Australia argued that when the British
Crown set up the colony of Western Australia, its intention was to extinguish
native title generally and  not only to acquire sovereignty but to have
ownership of the land. It argued that this could be inferred
from the terms of
the Commission which was given to Governor Stirling, the first Governor. This
Commission provided for the division
and sale of all land in the Colony in so
far as that was then possible. In New South Wales the policy had been to grant
land according
to the value of investment in the colony, but this policy had
proved unsatisfactory and was changed in New South Wales at the same
time as
the Commission was given in Western Australia.<p>

The Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in a joint
judgment with Dawson J generally agreeing) was unanimous
in holding that native
title was not extinguished by the establishment of Western Australia. The Court
rejected the argument that
the establishment of Western Australia was different
from the establishment of other Australian colonies in this respect. The joint
judgment said:<a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[7]</a><p>

...the true inference to be drawn - if not the certain fact - is that the
Aborigines and their title to land were ignored in the
establishment of Western
Australia and that Stirling was intended to exercise the power which a
Sovereign possesses to dispose of
land within the Sovereign territory by such
means as the law of the Sovereign prescribes. The title of Aboriginal peoples
in land
was ignored because, at that time, there was a common opinion (which
<i>Mabo (No 2)</i> holds to be erroneous) that the Aborigines had no legal
interest in land....Once it is realised that the common law theory which
underlay the acquisition of sovereignty in "settled" colonies at the time of
settlement of Western Australia regarded the territory
of a colony inhabited by
indigenous people to be "desert uninhabited", an inference that the British
Crown intended a general extinguishment
of native title cannot be drawn.
Extinguishment would have been seen to be an unnecessary step to take.<p>

The joint judgment held that the presumption remained that native title was not
extinguished by settlement. Dawson J differed slightly
in that he could see no
need for a presumption that the Crown did not intend to extinguish native
title.<a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[8]</a> Thus, native title in Western
Australia has been extinguished only "parcel by parcel".<a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[9]</a> So, native title may still have existed at the time of the
Western Australia Act.<p>

<i>Is the Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act 1993 (WA) consistent with the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</a> (Cth)?</i><p>

The Court also held unanimously that the Western Australia Act was inconsistent
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</a>. The joint judgment said:<p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</a> does not alter the characteristics of native
title, but it confers on protected persons rights or immunities which, being
recognised
by 'the tribunals and all other organs administering justice', allow
protected persons security in the enjoyment of the title to
property to the
same extent as the holders of titles granted by the Crown. <p>

This includes both security of property and entitlement to compensation if
those are guaranteed within the State generally. The
question, therefore, was
whether the rights conferred by s7 of the Western Australia Act ensured the
same security of possession
and enjoyment as those conferred by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial
Discrimination Act</a>. The Court held that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s7</a> rights did not confer the same
security of possession and enjoyment, as those rights could be diminished
pursuant to various Western
Australian Acts.<a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[10]</a>
Nor did the Western Australia Act provide adequate compensation for this
shortfall in security of possession and enjoyment. The Court
also held that s5
of the Western Australia Act which purported to confirm grants of title made
after the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</a> was ineffective. <p>

<i>The Race Power</i><p>

The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> protects native title subject to the stated
exceptions in the Act. It thus<i> </i>removes the common law defeasibility of
native title.<i> </i>The exceptions to the protection of native title include
past and future acts.<a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[11]</a> <i> </i>Western
Australia argued that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> was not supported by the race power.
In order to use the race power, it must be "deemed necessary" that "special
laws" be made for
the "people of any race"<i>, </i>these being the terms of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s51(xxvi)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. That is, there must be special needs or threats
to the people which make the law necessary.<a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[12]</a> This judgment is for Parliament to make. The Court said
"the removal of the common law general defeasibility of title...is sufficient
to demonstrate that the Parliament could properly have deemed that Act to be
'necessary'".<a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[13]</a><p>

The Court said:<p>
...the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> is 'special' in that it confers uniquely on the
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander holders of native title...a benefit
protective
of their native title. Perhaps the Act confers a benefit on all the
people of those races. The special quality of the law thus appears.
Whether it
was 'necessary' to enact that law was a matter for the Parliament to decide
and, in the light of<i> Mabo (No 2</i>), there are no grounds on which this
Court could review the Parliament's decision, assuming it had power to do so.<a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[14]</a><p>

The Court thus held that an Act which protected native title from
extinguishment was a valid Act under the race power.  <p>

<i>Is the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act 1993</a> (Cth) invalid as a law which impermissibly
interferes with the State's legislative power?</i><p>

Western Australia argued that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 11</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">19</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">20</a>, 22, 23, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">28</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">43</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s211.html" class="autolink_findacts">211</a>(2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> were beyond the legislative powers of the
Commonwealth Parliament. The Court rejected the State's submission that the
true character
of the Act is as a law with respect to governments and
governmental activity.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 107</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> provides that the
Parliaments of the States retain the legislative powers vested in them at the
time of federation, except where
power is expressly vested in the Commonwealth,
or, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a> applies. Western Australia thus argued that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>
interferes with the exercise of the powers of the State in an impermissible
way.  To this argument the Court replied that the general
principle is: <p>

If the application of State law to a particular subject matter be expressly
excluded by a valid law of the Commonwealth, a State
law which is expressed to
apply to the subject matter is inconsistent with the Commonwealth law and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> is thereby enlivened. Such a State law is rendered
inoperative not because the Commonwealth law directly invalidates the State law
but by force of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.<a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[15]</a><p>
and <p>
Where it is within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth Parliament to
prescribe an exclusive statutory regime, a Commonwealth
law which merely
expresses an exclusion of the operation of a State law is not construed as an
attempt to invalidate the State law
directly.<a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[16]</a> <p>

The question is, therefore, whether the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> is within the power.
The Court held that it was valid under the race power as a law which protected
native title from extinguishment.
<p>

The Court also rejected the argument that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> attempted to
prescribe which State and Territory laws were valid or invalid, saying rather
that the sections of the Act which prescribe
which State laws were operative
did so purely on the basis of their inconsistency with the Commonwealth law,
and thus, any invalidity
derived from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. One example
considered was the requirement that a State provide compensation for the
extinguishment or impairment of native title
caused by that State's law. The
Court rejected the argument that this singled out the States for an arbitrary
burden. The provision
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> applied to all the polities -
Commonwealth, State and Territories - which could have the effect of impairing
or extinguishing native
title.<p>

<i>Impermissible discrimination against Western Australia</i> <i>and impairment
of its ability to function as a State.</i><p>

Western Australia argued that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> had a greater impact on it
than on the other States and that it was thus discriminated against.  Western
Australia also argued that
the Act impaired the State's ability to function as
a State, arguing that this, thus, contravened the principle in<i> Melbourne
Corporation v The Commonwealth.</i><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[17]</a> The
Court rejected the first limb of the argument shortly, but the second limb
required greater consideration. The State had argued
that the capacity to deal
with land and other resources, particularly mineral resources, in the State was
a fundamental sovereign
function of its government. The Court held that the
second limb of the <i>Melbourne Corporation</i> principle:<p>

...relates to the machinery of government and to the capacity of its respective
organs to exercise such powers as are conferred
upon them by the general law
which includes the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and the laws of the Commonwealth. A
Commonwealth law cannot deprive the State of the personnel, property, goods and
services which
the State requires to exercise its powers and cannot impede or
burden the State in the acquisition of what it requires.<a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[18]</a> <p>

Since the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> does not purport to affect the machinery of
government of the State in any way, it does place the burden of compensation on
the State
but it does so as an incident of the protection of native title which
is valid.<p>

<i>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act 1993</a> (Cth) and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</a>
(Cth)</i><p>

Western Australia argued that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> discriminated in
favour of Aborigines and Torres Straits Islanders and thus offended the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial
Discrimination Act</a>, which was expressly saved by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s7(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>.
The Court held that if there was any discrepancy between the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial
Discrimination Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> (and the Court could not see any
discrepancy), the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> could be regarded as a special measure under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s8</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</a> or as a law which, while making racial
distinctions, was not racially discriminatory.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7(1)</a> did not make the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> subject to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</a><i>.  </i><p>

<i>Section 12 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act 1993</a> (Cth)</i>. <p>

Section 12 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> provides that "subject to this Act, the
common law of Australia in respect of native title has, after 30 June 1993, the
force of
a law of the Commonwealth". The Court held that this part of the Act
was invalid because if the common law is taken to be judge made
law, then s12
offends the separation of powers, as it is an attempt to confer legislative
power on the judiciary.  It would thus
offend the principles in <i>The
Boilermakers' Case.</i><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[19]</a><p>

If the common law is taken to be a changing thing, the section would offend the
race power which is the basis of the validity of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
51(xxvi)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> requires that Parliament must consider such a law
necessary for the people of a race before the law can take effect. This would
no
longer be possible. A law made under the race power must be considered by
Parliament. In relation to the external affairs power,
the Court said that the
"common law relating to native title has no external element which might
attract the support of the external
affairs power".<a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[20]</a> <p>

Further, if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12</a> operated to withdraw effective legislative power to override
the common law from the States, it is an invalid attempt to use <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. This use of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a> breaches <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s107</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 109</a>
is not to be used in this way. It operates only on State laws which were made
in exercise of their powers confirmed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s107.</a> The States retain their power to
override the common law by their legislative acts. However, the invalidity of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12</a> did not affect the validity of any other part of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a>.<p>
 <p>
<i>Decision</i><p>

In the result, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> was held to be valid except for s12, which
was severable. The whole of the Western Australia Act was held invalid as
inconsistent
with both the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/" class="autolink_findacts">Racial Discrimination Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a>.<p>

<i>Comment</i><p>

The High Court's decision in this case has clarified the validity of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act</a> and decisively quashed attempts by State governments to avoid the
implications of <i>Mabo (Nos 1 and 2)</i>. However, this remains the smaller
part of the game. Except in Western Australia, the number of Aboriginal people
who are eligible
to claim native title is a very small proportion of the whole,
because dispossession by the State, however it was achieved, is most
likely to
have disrupted the nexus required with the land to prove native title.<a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[21]</a> Similarly the amount of unalienated Crown
land which is available to be claimed is very small.  As a human rights matter,
the land
funds set up under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[22]</a>, the State and Territory Native Title Acts<a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[23]</a> and the <i>Land Rights Act </i>1983 (NSW) are vital,
albeit a small beginning, and it is on them we should be focussing our
attention.<p>

prohibition against discrimination which involves the placing
on the States of
special burdens or diabilities; and (2) the prohibition against laws of general
application which operate to destroy
or curtail the continued existence of the
States or their capacity to function as governments....The second element of
the prohibition
is necessarily less precise than the first; it protects the
States against laws which, complying with the first element because they
have a
general application, may neverthelelss produce the effect which it is the
object of the principle to prevent." Quoted in <i>WA v Commonwealth</i> at

<a name="fn22" href="#fnB22">[23]</a>     The Native Title Act<i> </i>1994 (NSW)

Australia supported Western Australia in challenging the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/nta1994147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>.  The
Native Title Act<i> </i>1993 (Qld), and <i>Land Titles Validation Act </i>(Vic)
will need to be amended to be consistent with the Commonwealth legislation.
There is a long way to go.

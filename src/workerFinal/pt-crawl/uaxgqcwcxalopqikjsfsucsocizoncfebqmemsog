Crichton either imitated, or indepedently arrived at a very similar premise, to John Brosnan's <i>Carnosaur</i>, a 1984 horror novel about theropod dinosaurs running amock. The science of <i>Jurassic Park</i> was actually based on a very plausible hypothesis of the time - that dinosaurs could be cloned from their <a href="../life/glossary.html#DNA">DNA</a> in the stomachs of gnats and mosquitos embedded in amber, although it was discovered that DNA quickly degrades in amber so the hard science premise is unviable (there are also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_issues_in_Jurassic_Park">inaccuracies</a> regarding the way the dinosars are decsribed). The story not unexpectedly centered on theropod dinosaurs, especially overgrown <a href="#Velociraptor">velociraptors</a>, as scary monsters chasing the protagonists around the theme park, turning door knobs and opening doors.

Reacting to the excessively <a href="#realism">naive realism</a> of the French rationalist philosopher Descartes (who, following a thought experiment (the original "<a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/brainvat/">brain in the vat</a>" experiment) rejected radical doubt and argued not only for the existence of the material world of spatial extension, but also the God of his religion) Kant denied that it was possible to know anything about reality in itself (noumena), all one could know, he argued, are the subjective phenomena we experience. Kant's hyper-agnostic worldview became lmost influential following the decline of Hegellian metaphysics, and as a reaction to the excessive logical positivism and empiricism of the early 20th century. Neo-Kantean idealism is central to the pluralistic and anti-foundationalist worldview of some representatives of <a href="#pragmatism">pragmatist</a> and "<a href="../sociocultural/glossary.html#postmodernism">postmodernist</a>" philosophy. Especially influential here is Wilfred Sellar's Neo-Kantean critique of empiricism (<a href="references.html#Sellars56">Sellars, 1956/1997</a>), which is both a development of positivism and a rejection of naturalistic realism (so these two tendencies need not be opposed), denies the positivist premise that empirical methodology describes a real world "out there" (Sellars refers to the belief in a pre-given objective reality as the "myth of the given"). Instead, all that science, or philosophy, can do, is examine the linguistic and socio-cultural premises behind such beliefs, or test empirical evidence as hypothetical or historical reconstructions, or as patterns or diagrams thrown up by various methodologies which do not provide proof or factual representation of the objective world. In evolutionary science, examples of neo-kantean theorising can be found in <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#phenetics">phenetics</a> and <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#pattern_cladism">Pattern cladism</a> (see <a href="#justso">"just so" story</a>); ironically these are methodologies that tried to totally eliminate subjectivism in favour of extreme empiricism, and hence one would expect them to be the opposite of postmodernism.

<li><i>Naturalistic Panspermia</i> asserts that life <a href="#evolution">evolved</a> on another planet, and was ejected and transferred to Earth by meteorites, or else it originated in deep space from complex molecules found in nebula or comets; the genetic material is then carried to Earth by comets (Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe).</li>
<li><i>Directed Panspermia</i> is the premise that <a href="../sociocultural/glossary.html#intelligence">intelligent</a> extra-terrestrials intentionally seeded other planets with genetic material, even if they didn't travel there themselves. Directed Panspermia was first proposed by Francis Crick, co-discoverer of <a href="../life/glossary.html#DNA">DNA</a></li>
<li><i>Ancient Astronaut hypothesis</i> is the belief that extra-terrestrial astronauts visted Earth in past ages and created the human race through genetic engineering.

Popular proponents include <a href="http://www.daniken.com/">Erich von Danniken</a> and <a href="http://www.sitchin.com/">Zecharia Sitchin</a>.

<div class="glsent"><p><b><a name="paradigm"></a>Paradigm</b> as defined by historian of science Thomas Kuhn as the set of practices that define a scientific discipline at any particular period of time. In his landmark book in <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, Kuhn defines a scientific paradigm as:</p>
<ul>
	<li> what is to be observed and scrutinized</li> 
	<li> the kind of questions that are supposed to be asked and probed for answers in relation to this subject </li>
	<li> how these questions are to be structured</li> 
	<li> how the results of scientific investigations should be interpreted</li>
</ul>

<p>Within <i>normal science</i>, the paradigm is the set of exemplary experiments that are likely to be copied or emulated. In this scientific context, the prevailing paradigm often represents a more specific way of viewing reality, or limitations on acceptable programs for future research, than the more general <a href="#scientific_method">scientific method</a>.</p>

<p>When one paradigm is replaced or overthrown by another, that is called a <i>Paradigm Shift</i>. Kuhn considered that transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science. Hence paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics, where around the turn of the 20th century, classical netwonian physics was replaced by relativity and quantum mechanics. The mid-19th century transition from a more static biology to a <a href="biographies/D.html#Darwin">Darwinian</a>-derived <a href="#evolution">evolutionary</a> one would be another example. <a href="#evolutionary_theory">Evolutionary Theory</a> itself underwent a number of paradigm shifts, such as <a href="#darwinism">Darwinism</a>, <a href="#neo-darwinism">Neo-Darwinism</a>, <a href="#modern_synthesis">Modern Synthesis</a>, and now more recent ideas incorporating <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#molecular_phylogeny">molecular phylogeny</a>, <a href="#evo-devo">evo-devo</a>, <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#cladistics">cladistics</a>, <a href="#systems_theory">systems theory</a>, and so on. In terms of mapping out the history of life there was a qute dramatic paradigm shift in the 1980s, from <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#evolutionary_systematics">evolutionary systematics</a> to <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#phylogenetic_systematics">phylogenetic systematics</a> (two other paradigms, <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#phenetics">phenetics</a> and <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#pattern_cladistics">pattern cladistics</a>, played a much more minor role), more recently there has been a further shift from <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#morphology-based_phylogeny">morphology based</a> cladistics to <a href="../phylogeny/glossary.html#molecular_phylogeny">molecular phylogeny</a></p>

<p>Advocates of specific paradigms tend to be feircely passionate about their own preferred paradigm, extolling its strengths and virtues and minimising its weaknesses, while at the same time being uncompromisingly critical, dismissing, and ridiculing their oponents' paradigms. In this way, a paradigm becomes like a religion or a political ideology, something that may indeed have good qualities, but which is held to with irrational fervour. In the current iteration of Palaeos I have tried to balance and include many paradigms, not just dominant ones, while acknowledging that inevitavbly, whatever paradigms are used will be supplemanted or supplanted in the future by paradigms which we have no conception of now, and even if we did, would probably not believe. <small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm">Wikipedia</a>, MAK )</small> </p></div>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        (S325: 1880)</b></font></center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 284]]</font> Sir,--In 
        your last number Mr. Searles V. Wood advances what he considers to be 
        &quot;the conclusive objection&quot; to Dr. Croll's theory of<em> </em>excentricity 
        as a cause of the glacial epoch, viz. that North America was glaciated 
        further south than Europe, in proportion to its<em> present </em>difference 
        of winter climate, while Dr. Croll admits his theory &quot;to be baseless unless 
        there was a <em>complete diversion </em>of the warm ocean currents from 
        the hemisphere glaciated.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not myself remember that Dr. Croll ever 
        made such an admission, and it is certainly not necessary for the application 
        of his theory. But whether there was a <em>partial </em>or a <em>complete 
        </em>diversion of the Gulf-stream from the coasts of Europe, the result 
        anticipated by Mr. S. V. Wood--a complete <em>similarity </em>in the extension 
        of ice over the two continents--was not to be expected, <em>because they 
        are subject to very different conditions</em>, independently of the action 
        of ocean currents.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe is interpenetrated by seas having a southward 
        opening, while the mass of land in Western Europe is trifling compared 
        to that of North America. Transfer the Mediterranean to America and you 
        have a sea entering south of Cape Hatteras, and extending quite across 
        the continent to the Sierra Nevada of California, with northward branches 
        reaching to Lake Huron! The influence of such a sea receiving the waters 
        of one of the largest tropical rivers (the Nile), together with the broken 
        form of the western coast of Europe and the narrowness of the land, must 
        be alone sufficient to give Western Europe an insular climate as compared 
        with Eastern America. But at the same time we have on the American side 
        conditions tending in the very reverse direction. The enormous ice-bearing 
        masses of Greenland and Grinnell's Land immediately to the north and north-east, 
        and the Highlands of Labrador in the latitude of the Germanic plain, combined 
        with the great <em>cul-de-sac </em>of Hudson's Bay, to receive icebergs 
        from the north, and pile them up in its southern inlet, almost in the 
        latitude of London, must have tended to lower the climate of North America 
        during the Glacial epoch as much as the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay 
        must have ameliorated that of Europe.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These causes of difference of climate depend 
        on broad geographical facts, which we have every reason to believe existed 
        during the Glacial epoch as they do now, and they appear to me amply sufficient 
        to account for the 10&deg; or 12&deg; further southward extension of the 
        ice in America than in Europe, even if the Gulf-stream were &quot;completely 
        diverted.&quot; But I do not believe it was completely, but only partially 
        diverted and also diminished in intensity, and it therefore still exerted 
        <em>some </em>differential action on the climates of the opposite coasts 
        of the Atlantic. I would also point out that the difference between the 
        latitudes of points with the same <em>winter </em>isothermals in West 
        Europe and East America averages about 20&deg;, which is much greater 
        than the difference of the <font color="990000">[[p. 285]]</font> 
        limit of glaciation in the countries, and this would show that some equalizing 
        effect <em>was</em> produced by the diminished and partial diverted Gulf-stream, 
        as Dr. Croll's theory requires.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having recently been subjecting 
        the whole of the evidence on the subject of &quot;geological climates&quot; to a 
        careful examination, I may state, that I have arrived at an important 
        modification of Dr. Croll's theory, which will, I believe, obviate the 
        chief objections that have hitherto been made to it. The subject will 
        be fully discussed in a volume I am now engaged in printing.</p>

        It was with great surprise I read Prof. Haughton's unqualified statement 
        in last week's <em>Nature</em>, that--&quot;It is <em>impossible </em>to suggest 
        any rearrangement of land and water which shall sensibly <em>raise the 
        temperature of the West of </em>Europe,&quot;--since I had, as I thought, in 
        my recently-published volume--&quot;Island Life&quot;--not only &quot;suggested&quot; such 
        a rearrangement, but also adduced much evidence to show that it had actually 
        occurred throughout the periods when both the West of Europe and the Arctic 
        regions enjoyed a much higher temperature than they do now. I will now 
        briefly re-state my &quot;suggestion,&quot; and 
        will also make a few remarks on the general causes 
        of difference of temperature, which may serve to render the subject more 
        intelligible.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now well known that places 
        in the temperate zones owe their temperature at different seasons only 
        partially to the amount of direct sun-heat they receive, but very largely 
        to the amounts of heat brought to them by currents of air. Thus we explain, 
        not only the mild winter climate of our islands as due to the prevalence 
        of westerly and south-westerly winds which have become warmed by passing 
        over the Atlantic, but also the wonderful inequality of temperature at 
        different seasons of the year. When we have warm spring-like days in mid-winter, 
        it is because these warm currents of air are passing steadily over our 
        islands; while continued hard frosts are as clearly due to masses of cold 
        air from the north or north-east which drift down to us, often with no 
        perceptible wind. Again, when in April and May we have days as cold as 
        those of December and January, they can always be traced to northerly 
        or easterly currents of air, and are probably often connected with the 
        southern drift of the icebergs at that season. It is clear then, that 
        if south-westerly winds were to continue throughout the winter, the severity 
        of that season would be entirely abolished; and the same effect would 
        be produced if by any means the winds from the north and east lost their 
        severity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the source of the constant 
        warmth of our westerly winds is admitted to be the influx of warm water 
        into the North Atlantic--chiefly by the Gulf Stream; and this warm northward 
        flow of tropical water, being primarily due to the trade-winds, is not 
        confined to the Atlantic, but is equally present in the other great oceans, 
        and similar effects are produced in them, though nowhere to so great a 
        degree as in our islands, owing to our insular position and the great 
        extent to which Europe to the east of us is permeated by water as compared 
        with North America or Asia. The North Pacific, with its great Japan current, 
        is probably quite as warm as the North Atlantic; but Vancouver's Island, 
        though further south than London, has not so mild a climate; and this 
        can be clearly traced to the great mass of land to the east and north 
        of it, the lofty snow-clad mountains, and the absence of those deep gulfs 
        and inland seas which do so much to ameliorate the climate of Europe.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Haughton states, in his 
        &quot;Lectures on Physical Geography,&quot; that the Kuro Siwo, or great Pacific 
        current, is two and a half times as large as the Gulf Stream, while the 
        Mozambique current, which forms the outflow of the warm waters of the 
        Indian Ocean, is one and a half times as much, so that these two currents 
        have together four times the bulk and heating power of the Gulf Stream. 
        If therefore these two currents at any time obtained an entrance into 
        the Arctic Ocean, it is difficult to over-estimate their effect on its 
        climate. The Gulf Stream, of which probably not half passes northwards 
        of our islands, gives to Iceland the same winter temperature as Philadelphia, 
        and keeps the North Cape (far within the Arctic circle) permanently free 
        from ice, and this, notwithstanding the powerful counteracting influences 
        of the lofty Scandinavian mountains on the one side, and the huge ice-clad 
        plateau of Greenland on the other. Suppose that only an equal proportion 
        of the Kuro Siwo entered the Arctic Ocean, is it not probable that no 
        sea-ice at all would form there? While, if Greenland were less elevated 
        and thus ceased to be an accumulator of ice, the combined effect might 
        be to render the whole Polar area free of icebergs. This would at once 
        do away with the chief source of winter cold to all north temperate lands, 
        and ameliorate the climate of America as much, proportionately, as that 
        of Europe.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have yet to consider a 
        still more powerful agent in ameliorating the climate of Western Europe 
        in Secondary and early Tertiary times. The heated waters of the Indian 
        Ocean have now no northern outlet, and only penetrate the continent in 
        the sub-tropical Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Now if we suppose the waters 
        of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea to have had northward outlets 
        through the heart of the Euro-Asiatic continent, penetrating in two or 
        more directions into the then much more extensive Arctic Ocean, we should 
        have an agency at work which would render the presence of any permanent 
        ice in the North Polar area as impossible as it is now in Scotland. The 
        cooling agency of ice being once abolished, the comparatively small area 
        of the Polar as compared with the Tropical seas (about one-tenth) would 
        facilitate the raising of the temperature of the former to perhaps 15&deg; 
        or 20&deg; F. above the freezing point, and this would not only give the 
        Arctic lowlands a climate quite sufficient for the vegetation which we 
        know they supported, but, by doing away with the only source of our winter 
        cold, would give our islands a perfect immunity from frosts and render 
        them capable of supporting the vegetation now characteristic of sub-tropical 
        lands.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the modifications of land 
        and sea here indicated <em>did</em> exist throughout a considerable portion 
        of past geological ages, and that the existing consolidation of the great 
        northern continents, to which the possibility of our present Arctic climates 
        is mainly due, is a comparatively recent and abnormal phenomenon, I have 
        endeavoured to prove in the work already referred to. At present I have 
        only undertaken to show, that a &quot;suggested&quot; re-arrangement of land and 
        water adequate to raise the temperature of Western Europe to a very sensible, 
        or even to a very large extent, <em>is</em> &quot;possible.&quot;</p>

        I should not say more on this subject, but that the last paragraph of 
        Mr. Starkie Gardner's letter seems to imply that I have adopted some of 
        his views without acknowledgment. Now I certainly read his article in 
        <em>Nature</em> of December 12, 1878, with much interest and profit; but, 
        as regards the special question of the cause of the mild climates of Eocene 
        and Miocene times, I entirely disagreed with his views, as is sufficiently 
        shown by my recent letter in <em>Nature</em>. I quite admit that the closing 
        up of the North Atlantic between Europe and North America <em>might </em>have 
        considerably raised the temperature of Britain, but it would just as certainly 
        have rendered the Arctic regions even colder than they are now, by shutting 
        out the Gulf Stream, whereas all the evidence points to <em>continuous 
        </em>mild Arctic climates through Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene times. 
        Again, though I admit that there has probably, on more than one occasion 
        during the Tertiary period, been a land connection between North-West 
        Europe and North-East America, yet the peculiar distribution of the Tertiary 
        mammalia of Europe and North America indicates that such connection was 
        exceptional, and only endured for very short periods, the rule being a 
        separation like that which now exists. I could therefore only have quoted 
        Mr. Gardner's view to disagree with it; and I did not think it advisable 
        to encumber the exposition of my own theory with more references of this 
        kind than were absolutely necessary. I may add, that the extension of 
        the Miocene Arctic flora to Grinnell Land since Mr. Gardner's article 
        appeared, renders his views still more untenable. Of course I here refer 
        to my chapter on &quot;Mild Arctic Climates&quot; in &quot;Island Life.&quot; In my letter 
        to <em>Nature</em> I confined myself strictly to the point raised by Prof. 
        Haughton, which I did not consider had been adequately met by Mr. Gardner's 
        hypothesis.</p>

        The letter of Prof. Haughton in last week's <em>Nature</em> so bristles 
        with figures and calculations that some of your readers may feel a little 
        puzzled and may be unable to detect the fallacies that lurk among them. 
        The question is far too large a one to be fully discussed in your columns. 
        I shall therefore confine myself to pointing out the erroneous assumptions 
        and false inferences which vitiate all the learned Professor's calculations, 
        having done which my own theory will remain, so far, intact.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole argument against me 
        is based upon an &quot;ideal ice-cap,&quot; extending from the Pole to lat. 60&deg;. 
        A considerable but unknown thickness is given to this imaginary field 
        of ice, and it is then calculated that the three great ocean streams, 
        even if admitted to the Arctic area in the manner I suggest, would not 
        get rid of this mass of ice. There are however several important misconceptions 
        and illogical deductions underlying the whole argument, and when these 
        are exposed the results, however accurately worked out, become completely 
        valueless.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first have it stated that if 
        heat and cold were uniformly distributed over the Polar regions the whole 
        would be permanently frozen over, and an ice-cap be formed of great but 
        varying thickness, diminishing from the Pole to about lat. 60&deg;. But 
        even this preliminary statement is open to serious doubt; for ice cannot 
        be formed without an adequate supply of water, and over a large part of 
        the Polar area no more snow falls than is annually melted by the sun and 
        by warm southerly winds blowing over the heated land-surfaces of Asia 
        and America. Admitting however that any such ice-cap could be formed, 
        it would certainly not form in <em>one year </em>but by the accumulations 
        of a long series of years; and any estimate of the <em>total </em>heat 
        required to melt it has no bearing whatever on the <em>annual </em>amount 
        that would be sufficient, since this depends solely on the average thickness 
        of the ice <em>annually </em>formed, of which Prof. Haughton says nothing 
        whatever.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of rainfall in the 
        Arctic regions (mostly in the form of snow) is certainly very small. It 
        is estimated by Dr. Rink to be only twelve inches in Greenland, and this 
        is probably far above the average. All that falls on the inland plains 
        of Asia, Europe, and America is however melted or evaporated by the action 
        of the sun and air far from the influence of the Gulf Stream. The thickness 
        of ice formed annually over the whole area of the Arctic Ocean I have 
        no means of estimating. In open water in very high latitudes it may be 
        considerable, but perennial ice-fields can only increase very slowly. 
        I should therefore very much doubt if the thickness of ice now formed 
        annually over the whole Arctic area averages nearly so much as five feet; 
        and Prof. Haughton himself calculates that our own Gulf Stream is now 
        capable of melting this quantity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first assumption, therefore--that 
        the amount of heat required to be introduced into the Arctic regions in 
        order to raise their mean temperature above the freezing-point is &quot;accurately 
        measured&quot; by the amount required to melt an &quot;ice-cap&quot; covering the whole 
        area to a thickness of several hundred feet--is grossly erroneous; and 
        it is so because it takes the hypothetical <em>accumulated</em> effects 
        of <em>many years </em>Arctic cold under altogether impossible conditions, 
        and then estimates the amount of heat required to melt this whole accumulation 
        in <em>one year</em>!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we find a second and equally 
        important error, in the assumption (involved in all Prof. Haughton's arguments 
        and figures) that all the ice of the alleged &quot;ideal ice-cap&quot; must be melted 
        by that portion of the Gulf Stream which actually enters the Polar area, 
        where its temperature is taken to be 35&deg; F. or only 3&deg; above the 
        melting point of ice. A large quantity of the Arctic ice, however, even 
        now floats southward to beyond lat. 50&deg; in both the Atlantic and Pacific, 
        and is melted by the warmer water and atmosphere and the hotter sun of 
        these lower latitudes. Now, as it is an essential part of my theory that 
        much of Northern Asia and North America were under water at those early 
        periods when warm climates prevailed in the Arctic regions, it is clear 
        that whatever Arctic ice was then formed would have a freer passage southwards, 
        and as the south-flowing return currents would then have been more powerful 
        and more extensive than at present, a much larger proportion of the ice 
        would have been melted by the heat of temperate instead of by that of 
        Arctic seas.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Haughton admits that the 
        Kuro Siwo and the Mozambique currents together, if they entered the Polar 
        seas, would be equal to the melting of a layer of ice more than thirteen 
        feet thick over the whole area down to lat. 70&deg;. But if our own Gulf 
        Stream is sufficient to get rid of the whole of the ice that now forms 
        annually--as Prof. Haughton's figures show that it would probably be, 
        and as it would be still more certainly were Greenland depressed, thus 
        ceasing to be the great Arctic refrigerator and ice-accumulator--then 
        the heat of the other two currents would be employed in raising the temperature 
        of the Arctic seas above <font color="990000">[[p. 267]]</font> the<sub> 
        </sub>freezing-point; and if we take the area of the water as about equal 
        to that of the land, we shall have heat enough to raise the whole Arctic 
        ocean to a depth of full 180 feet more than<sub> </sub>20&deg; F., or 
        to a mean temperature of 52&deg; F., and as this would imply a still higher 
        surface temperature it is considerably more than I require.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless therefore Prof. Haughton 
        can prove that the amount of ice now forming <em>annually </em>in the 
        Polar regions is <em>very much more</em> than an average of five feet 
        thick over the whole area, his own figures demonstrate my case for me, 
        since they prove that the rearrangement of land and sea which I have suggested 
        would produce a permanent mild climate within the Arctic circle and proportionally 
        raise the mean temperature of all north-temperate lands.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly to summarise my present 
        argument:--Prof. Haughton's fundamental error consists in assuming that 
        the true way of estimating the amount of heat required in order to raise 
        the temperature of the Polar area a certain number of degrees is,--first, 
        to suppose an accumulation of ice indefinitely <em>greater </em>than actually 
        exists, and then to demand heat enough to melt this accumulation <em>annually. 
        </em> The utmost <em>possible </em>accumulations of ice in the Arctic 
        area, during an indefinite <em>number of years</em>, and under the most 
        <em>adverse physical conditions </em>imaginable, are to be all melted 
        in <em>one year</em>; and the heat required to do this is said to be the 
        &quot;accurate measure&quot; of that required to raise the temperature of the same 
        area about 20&deg;, at a time when there were no such great accumulations 
        of ice and when all the physical conditions <em>adverse </em>to its <em>accumulation 
        </em>and <em>favourable </em>to its <em>dispersal</em> were immensely 
        more powerful than at present!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this fundamental error is 
        corrected, it will be seen that Prof. Haughton's calculations are not 
        only quite compatible with my views, but actually lend them a strong support.</p>

        The letter of Prof. G. H. Darwin in your last issue states very clearly 
        the argument on which Mr. Culverwell and himself rely as affording a demonstration 
        of the inadequacy of the astronomical theory. It now seems opportune, 
        therefore, to lay before your readers the general considerations which 
        lead me to the conclusion that the whole argument they rest upon is unsound; 
        and, further, that Sir Robert Ball's ratio of 63 to 37, representing the 
        ratios of sun-heat received by each hemisphere in summer and winter respectively, 
        is (contrary to Prof. Darwin's view) an important factor in any adequate 
        discussion of the problem.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting Prof. Darwin's estimate 
        that the difference in the amount of sun-heat received in our latitudes 
        during high and low eccentricity, would only give to Yorkshire the amount 
        received by London or <em>vice versa</em>, I entirely demur to his statement 
        that this would be also a measure of the amount of change in the climates 
        of these places. To do so is to assume that the climate of a place, as 
        regards the amount and distribution <font color="990000">[[p. 221]]</font> 
        of its temperature, is determined by one factor only--the amount of sun-heat 
        it receives.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How very erroneous is this assumption, 
        may be shown by the contrasted climates of places on the east and west 
        sides of the Atlantic, due to the influence of both ocean-currents and 
        prevalent winds; but even more strikingly by a comparison (which I made 
        in my &quot;Tropical Nature&quot;) between certain tropical and temperate climates. 
        In Java, about 8&deg; south of the equator, the altitude of the noonday 
        sun in June is about 58 1/2&deg;, while at London during the same month 
        it is 62&deg;, the length of the day at the same time being 5 1/2 hours 
        greater with us. The sun-heat received in London must therefore be <em>considerably 
        greater </em>than that received in Java, and, according to the rule that 
        the <em>amount</em> of sun-heat determines temperature, London should 
        then have the warmest climate. The fact, however, is that our mean temperature 
        in June is more than 20&deg; lower than that of Java and our mean highest 
        temperature about 18&deg; lower, a result due, as I have shown, to a variety 
        of causes, of which the temperature of the atmosphere in all surrounding 
        areas, the action of aqueous vapour in reducing the loss by radiation, 
        and the accumulation of heat in the soil, are probably the most important. 
        These facts prove, I think, that the amount of heat received by the whole 
        hemisphere, through its influence on both oceanic and aerial currents, 
        must be taken account of in estimating temperatures under different phases 
        of eccentricity; and that any determination of the amounts of sun-heat 
        received at particular latitudes, considered by themselves, are necessarily 
        misleading and must usually indicate a difference of climate far below 
        the truth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another consideration 
        of even more importance which entirely invalidates the arguments of those 
        who, like Mr. Culverwell and Prof. Darwin, treat the problem as one to 
        be determined by a simple mathematical calculation of amounts of sun-heat 
        received on the same area at different times. This is, the remarkable 
        difference in the behaviour of air and liquid water on the one hand and 
        snow and ice on the other, as regards climate; the former from their great 
        mobility tending to the diffusion of heat, the latter by its comparative 
        immobility to the accumulation and perpetuation of cold. Without this 
        power of accumulation perpetual snow on tropical and temperate mountains, 
        and glaciers in hot sub-alpine valleys and at only 705 feet above the 
        sea-level in latitude 43&deg; 35' south in New Zealand, would be impossible. 
        In either of these cases, if an elevation of about a thousand feet should 
        double the area of the snow fields, which might easily be the case, the 
        outflowing glaciers would be greatly increased in magnitude and might 
        either descend to much lower levels or spread out over large areas of 
        the lowlands--and all this without any change whatever in the total amount 
        of sun-heat received by the countries in which they occur.<sup><a href="#A">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years past there has 
        been a persistent attack by astronomers and physicists on the explanation 
        of the glacial epoch put forth by Croll and adopted with some modifications 
        by many students of glacial phenomena. But as these writers have all treated 
        the problem as a question of the direct effect of the amount of sun-heat 
        received at different epochs in corresponding latitudes, completely ignoring 
        the great distributing and accumulating agencies which are always and 
        everywhere in action, their theoretical conclusions appear to us to be 
        entirely beside the question. We have to deal with a highly complicated 
        problem in physical meteorology, which cannot be solved by an appeal to 
        the well-known facts of the amounts of sun-heat received, any more than 
        can the June climates of London and Batavia or the general climates of 
        Ireland and Manitoba or Terra-del-Fuego (in about the same latitude) be 
        explained from similar data. The great merit of Croll was, that he fully 
        realised the complexity of the problem; that he took account of the various 
        relations and reactions of the oceanic and aerial currents, and the physical 
        characteristics of air and water, snow and ice; and that he showed how 
        these causes reacted on each other so that the winds and ocean currents 
        of one hemisphere might have an influence on the accumulation of snow 
        and ice in the other. Whatever errors he may have made in matters of detail, 
        his method was undoubtedly a sound one, and it is because so many recent 
        writers on the subject have wholly ignored his method without even attempting 
        to prove that it is erroneous, that their views appear to us to be both 
        retrograde and scientifically unsound.</p>

        Mr. Culverwell has pointed out to me that I am in error when I include 
        him among those writers who think that the problem of glacial periods 
        is to be solved by considering only the varying amounts of sun-heat at 
        different epochs. On referring to his paper, which I had not at hand when 
        I wrote, I find that this is the case, and that he is careful to limit 
        his calculations as giving only the variations of temperature due to <em>direct 
        </em>sun-heat. He also discusses, though very briefly and inadequately, 
        the effects due to <em>transference </em>of heat from one area to another. 
        Although willingly making this correction at his request, I am still, 
        after another perusal of his paper, quite unable to see that it finally 
        disposes of Croll's theory, much less of that modification of it which

A 24 000-year-old early modern human child burial known as The Lapedo child was discovered here. In 1998, the discovery of an early Upper Paleolithic human burial in this site has provided evidence of early modern humans from southern Iberia. The remains, the largely complete skeleton of an approximately 4 year old child buried with pierced shells and red ochre, is dated to ca. 24 500 years B.P. The cranium, mandible, dentition, and postcrania appear to present a mosaic of European early modern human and Neanderthal features, although this interpretation is disputed. If the child was indeed a hybrid of anatomically modern humans and Homo neanderthalensis, there could be significant implications regarding the Neanderthal interaction with Cro-Magnons and the taxonomical classification of these (possibly sub-) species."><META Name="keywords" Content="Lagar, Velho, site, rock-shelter, Lapedo, valley, limestone, canyon, Lisbon, Portugal, human, child, burial, Paleolithic, site, skeleton, child, shells, ochre, cranium, mandible, dentition, postcrania, European, Neanderthal, hybrid, Homo, neanderthalensis, Cro-Magnons"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="window-target" content="_top" ><meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> </HEAD><BODY><br><br><center><h2><b><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A></b></h2></center><center><br /><!-- CSS file for site and menu --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/layout.css" /><link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" href="https://www.donsmaps.com/favicon.ico"></center><center><script type="text/javascript"><!--//--></script></center><!-- Menu down Left Hand Side --><div class="left_menu">Navigation<ul ><li><a class="normal" href="abeltasmantrack.html">Abel Tasman Track in New Zealand</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="kimberleyart.html">Aboriginal Art of the Kimberleys</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginalrockart.html">Aboriginal art on the Northern Tablelands of NSW</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginals.html">Aborigines of Australia</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="pataudtools.html">Abri Pataud Tools</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="raymonden.html">Abri de Raymonden</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="mihisalisburyaccess.html">Access to Mihi Gorge and to Salisbury Waters below the junction with  Mihi Creek </a></li><li><a class="normal" href="loess.html">Achenheim -

the Hybrid Child from Portugal</h1><b>The Lagar Velho site is a rock-shelter in the Lapedo valley, a limestone canyon ca. 140 km north of Lisbon, in the District of Leiria, central Portugal. A 24&nbsp;000-year-old early modern human child burial known as The Lapedo child was discovered here.<br /><br />In 1998, the discovery of an early Upper Paleolithic human burial in this site has provided evidence of early modern humans from southern Iberia. The remains, the largely complete skeleton of an approximately 4 year old child buried with pierced shells and red ochre, is dated to ca. 24&nbsp;500 years B.P. The cranium, mandible, dentition, and postcrania appear to present a mosaic of European early modern human and Neanderthal features,  although this interpretation is disputed.  If the child was indeed a hybrid of anatomically modern humans and <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>, there could be significant implications regarding the Neanderthal interaction with Cro-Magnons and the taxonomical classification of these (possibly sub-) species.</b><br /><br />Text above: Wikipedia<br /><br /><center><a href="clickphotos/lagarvelho2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="clickphotos/lagarvelho1.jpg" alt = "The Hybrid Child from Portugal" width="218" height="605"></a><br /></center><br /><br /><center>The Hybrid Child from Portugal</center><br /><br />Morphological mosaic found on this 24&nbsp;500-year-old skeleton from Portugal indicates that Neanderthals and modern humans are members of the same species who interbred freely.

Our November 28, 1998, find made national news, but an even greater surprise was in store when my colleague, Washington University anthropologist Erik Trinkaus, who measured the bones weeks after the discovery, reported that the child's anatomy could only have resulted from a mixed Neandertal-early modern human ancestry. Here, finally, was proof that Neandertals did not simply disappear from Europe 28&nbsp;000 years ago. Instead, they interbred with modern humans and became part of our family.<br /><br />The discovery was made by João Maurício and Pedro Souto, archaeology field assistants and members of a local archaeology group, who visited the valley at my request to check on reports that a student from a nearby village had found some prehistoric paintings. The reports turned out to be genuine. The student showed them a few small, red anthropomorphic figures in a style characteristic of the Copper Age (fourth and third millennia B.C.) painted on the back wall of a shallow rock-shelter on the north side of the valley.<br /><br />While they were there, João and Pedro decided to inspect a larger shelter they saw on the opposite side of the valley. When they got there, the first thing they noticed was that archaeological deposits in the shelter had recently been destroyed; we later learned that in 1992 the landowner had bulldozed the upper six to nine feet of the shelter's fill to widen a rural trail used to reach property located farther up the valley. All that was left was a foot-and-a-half remnant of the original deposit in a fissure running along most of the length of the shelter's back wall. This remnant corresponds to a section of the original stratigraphic sequence lying between two and three feet below the former ground surface.<br /><br />The remnant was extremely rich in charcoal, stone tools, and animal remains, including fossilized horse teeth, all suggesting an Upper Palaeolithic age (between 30&nbsp;000 and 10&nbsp;000 years ago) for the site. While collecting surface material that had fallen from the remnant, João and Pedro inspected a recess in the back wall. In the loose sediments they recovered several small bones stained with red ochre they thought could be human. Recognizing the potential significance of the discovery, they stopped investigating and reported their finds to me.<br /><br /><p><a href="images21/discoverylagar.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/discoverylagarsm.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="414" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Archaeologists Cidália Duarte and Cristina Araújo excavated the child's skeleton. <br /><br />Photo: http://www.archaeology.org/0007/abstracts/neandertals.html<br /><br />Photo Credit: João Zilhão</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />The following weekend, on December 6, I went to the site with my colleagues Cristina Araújo, a fellow archaeologist, and Cidália Duarte, a bioarchaeologist specializing in burial taphonomy (how bodies are buried and preserved). João and Pedro presented their finds and two things almost immediately became clear. First, the bones they thought could be human were indeed the left forearm and hand bones of a young child. Second, stone tools found in the fissure dated the deposit to the Middle Solutrean and the Proto-Solutrean, that is, the period between 20&nbsp;000 and 22&nbsp;000 years ago. Since the juvenile human bones that lay some nine feet below this remnant belonged to a single individual and were very well preserved, the implication was obvious: a child had been buried at the site either in late Middle Palaeolithic or in early Upper Palaeolithic times, between 40&nbsp;000 and 25&nbsp;000 years ago. The ochre staining of the bones (a feature of all burials from the Gravettian period between 25&nbsp;000 and 27&nbsp;000 years ago) and rough estimates of the rate of sedimentation at the site led us to believe that a date closer to 25&nbsp;000 years ago was more likely.<br /><br />This conclusion prompted me to start a salvage excavation of the site, which we called the Lagar Velho rock-shelter after the ruin of an ancient olive-oil press at its entrance. The excavation began on December 12, 1998, continuing without interruption through Christmas and the New Year until January 7, 1999.<br /><br />Throughout the 1998-1999 salvage work we were able to count on the invaluable advice of Erik Trinkaus, to whom I e-mailed digital pictures of the excavation daily. Realizing the potential significance of the burial, Cidália Duarte and I invited him to the site to study the skeleton. An authority on Neandertals and early modern humans, Erik was already involved in analyzing Palaeolithic human material from Portugal.<br /><br />While Cidália and I completed the fieldwork, Erik began to clean and reassemble the skeleton and work toward a preliminary anatomical description. After returning to the United States, he was able to compare the bones with his extensive data base on Neandertals and early modern humans. On January 25, I got a message from him which began with the ominous words: 'The end of last week I made some quick comparisons of the Lagar Velho [child's] leg bone proportions with some data that I have, and it comes out looking like a Neandertal!' Other resemblances with Neandertals followed, but throughout this initial stage Cidália and I kept in mind Erik's cautionary remark in that first message: 'unless I have made some silly mistake.'<br /><br />We decided to check and double check all the measurements ourselves, and eventually concluded that Erik had made no mistake - the child did present a mosaic of Neandertal and modern human features. Most prominent among the former, the arctic body proportions (with short limbs, especially the lower parts of the arms and legs), the robusticity of the limb bones and the angle at which the jaw bones meet at the chin; among the latter, the characteristic 'snow-plow' chin and the size of the dentition<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h2>The Lagar Velho Child and the Fate of the Neanderthals</h2><h3>João Zilhão, Instituto Português de Arqueologia</h3><center>Text and photos below adapted from <span class="reference">Zilhão (2001) </span> except where otherwise noted.</center> <br /><br /><br /><br /><p><a href="images21/zilhao.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/zilhaosm.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="283" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />João Zilhão is the director of the Instituto Português de Arqueologia, Ministério da Cultura. Born in 1957, he received a Ph.D. in Prehistoric Archaeology from the University of Lisbon, where he taught between 1984 and 1995, with a dissertation on the Upper Palaeolithic of Portugal. In January 1996, he was appointed by the Portuguese government to set up the Côa Valley Archaeological Park, to coordinate the scientific research carried out to establish the chronology of the valley's Palaeolithic rock art, and to prepare the application of the site to the World Heritage List. In May 1997, he was appointed director-general of the newly created Instituto Português de Arqueologia (IPA), the department of the Ministry of Culture that supervises all archaeological activity in the country. <br /><br />In 1998, he directed the salvage excavation of the Early Upper Paleolithic child burial of Lagar Velho (Portugal) and, in 2004-2005, the archaeological excavations at the Peştera cu Oase (Romania), site of Europe’s earliest modern humans. He was the Conference Organizer for the year 2000 Annual Meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists, held in Lisbon, and was a member of its Executive Board between 2003 and 2006. In 2003, he was the recipient of a Humboldt Foundation Research Award (host institution: University of Cologne) in recognition of "past achievements in teaching and research." In 2005, he was the recipient of the London Prehistoric Society’s Europa Prize, in recognition of his "significant and enduring contribution to the study of European prehistory." <br /><br />Photo and text: <span class="reference">Zilhão (2001) </span> and supplementary text from http://www.bris.ac.uk/archanth/staff/zilhao/</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />Laga Velho is a rock-shelter in the Lapedo valley, a limestone canyon cut by the river Caranguejeira. The site is very close to the city of Leiria, about 140 km north of Lisbon in central Portugal. <br /><br />It was discovered in November 1998, following reports that late prehistoric paintings had been identified in the region. Further survey work in the valley led to the identification of this particular site. <br /><br />The upper 2 to 3 metres of its sedimentary fill had been almost entirely removed by the owner in 1992. All that was left of this upper fill was a hanging remnant preserved in a fissure running along the back wall of the shelter which contained an extraordinary density of remains clearly of Upper Palaeolithic age. The current ground surface corresponds to the truncation of the lower part of the original sequence of archaeological deposits. The richness of the remnant suggested that this was a major site and, consequently, a rescue operation ensued in December-January 1998 - 1999, followed by two summer field seasons, in July 1999 and in June - October 2000. As a result, it has been possible to establish that the site contains three major archaeological components. <br /><br /><p><a href="images21/lagarvelhosite.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/lagarvelhositesm.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="543" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Lagar Velho: panoramic view along the rockshelter face with indication of the three major archaeological components: Burial; living floor; and hanging remnant. <br /><br />Photo and text: <span class="reference">Zilhão (2001) </span><br /><br />Photo Credit: João Zilhão</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />The most recent deposits are those of the hanging remnant, which are particularly rich in the western part. Two main occupation levels were identified there. Level 6, charcoal stained and with abundant burnt cobbles, contains a faunal assemblage dominated by horse remains. The artefact assemblage is rich in quartz tools, contains some carinated cores, and features a couple of fine bone points, matching the characteristics of the Proto-Solutrean, a common occurrence in Portugal in stratigraphic sequences spanning the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).<br /><br />Three radiocarbon determinations on charcoal samples place this level between 22&nbsp;000 and 21&nbsp;000 BP. A marked discontinuity, which corresponds to an erosional hiatus, separates this unit from the overlying in situ deposits of Level 9, where charcoal is abundant, but not as much as in earlier deposits, and the amount of faunal remains also decreases somewhat. The lithics, however, are fully diagnostic of the Middle Solutrean, with thermally pre-treated laurel-leaf points. This level was dated from the charcoal to 20&nbsp;000&plusmn;180 years BP. <br /><br />A settlement area with dense remains of occupation in the same western part of the site (squares G-I/3-4) and beginning about 1.5 metres below the base of the remnant, is preserved under ground level.<br /><br />Throughout its Gravettian period occupation the western part of the shelter was used for ordinary settlement activities. The one burial episode so far documented took place in the easternmost part of the site, located far away from the settlement, and separated from the outer edge of the latter  by more than 10 metres of archaeologically empty space. <br /><br /><p><a href="images21/lagargravettian.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/lagargravettiansm.jpg" alt = "lagar velho gravettian" width="257" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /> João Zilhão pointing out the Gravettian levels just along the rock face from the child burial.<br /><br />Photo: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prehistoric/past/past36.html<br /><br />Photo Credit: William Davies, October 2000</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />The particular location selected took advantage of a small recess in the back wall of the shelter that, at the time of burial, created a protective overhang almost at ground level, forming a kind of natural niche ready-made to receive the body of the child that archaeologists eventually catalogued as fossil LV1. However, similar niches exist in the back wall of the shelter in the area where the living floors are located. It must be concluded, therefore, that there was an unequivocal intention to bury the child away from the areas that people used for the day to day living activities carried out in the framework of the site's use as a residential or logistical place. <br /><br /><b>The LV1 child burial</b><br /><br />The area where the burial took place was tested down to about two metres below the present ground surface. The deposits contained faunal elements but were otherwise archaeologically sterile. The faunal assemblage contained abundant coprolites and bones (horse, deer and rabbit) showing evidence of gnawing by carnivores. It is quite likely that this part of the shelter functioned as a wolf den until the time period represented by the burial event. Pollen analysis of the sequence excavated in square L20, under the burial, produced a diagram dominated by pine and heather. More work needs to be done before the site's surrounding palaeovegetation can be securely reconstructed. <br /><br /><p><a href="images21/lagarcoupe.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/lagarcoupesm.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="615" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Longitudinal section drawing of the hanging remnant at Lagar Velho, showing inset photos of a Proto-Solutrean Vale Comprido point derived from level 6, and a Solutrean laurel-leaf point from level 9.  <br /><br />Photo and text: <span class="reference">Zilhão (2001) </span><br /><br />Photo Credit: João Zilhão</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images21/valecompridopoint.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/valecompridopointsm.jpg" alt = "vale comprido point" width="331" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Point of the Vale Comprido Point type discovered in 2008 at Marseillon, near the town of Banos, France.

It was the slight overhang of the shelter's back wall that saved it from total destruction when the site was terraced. The skull was missing, because it originally lay slightly higher than the rest of the body and was shattered by the bulldozer. Fortunately, it was possible to recover most of its fragments, which were scattered in the thin level of disturbed deposits that covered the burial and surrounding areas. For the most part they were found in a dense accumulation located some three metres eastwards of the burial along the back wall of the shelter. <br /><br /><p><a href="images21/lagalvelhoskeleton.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/lagalvelhoskeletonsm.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="284" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Lagar Velho 1 in situ, with damaged skull and left forearm elements already removed.<br /><br />Careful excavation and screening of all these disturbed deposits allowed the recovery of some 160 fragments and, subsequently, the reconstruction of about 80% of the total skull. The post-cranial skeleton was virtually complete as well as the child's permanent and deciduous dentitions. <br /><br />The reconstructed burial ritual is very similar to that documented in contemporaneous funerary contexts of Central and Eastern Europe, showing that, culturally, these populations were fully integrated into the Gravettian world. The body was laid down in extended position, slightly tilted towards the back of the shelter, left foot on top of the right one. <br /><br />Photo and text: <span class="reference">Duarte et al.

Analysis of the charcoal recovered from under the child's right leg shows that the burned wood was a single branch of Scots Pine, <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>. The C14 date of ca. 24&nbsp;000 obtained from this charcoal is, therefore, the closest estimation for the age of the burial event. An absolute upper limit for such and age is provided by the date of ca. 23&nbsp;000 BP obtained from a bone sample collected from a semi-articulated ensemble of rabbit ribs and vertebrae directly overlying the child's right leg. <p><a href="images21/scotspine1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/scotspine1sm.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="231" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images21/scotspine2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images21/scotspine2sm.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="301" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Scots Pine tree and cones. <br /><br />Left Photo: The Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) Pinus sylvestris, Spittal of Glenmuick, Cairngorm National Park, Scotland, 56°58'22"N 3°8'15"W, 400m altitude.<br /><br />Date 2008-01-06 Source: Bruce on Flickr<br />Permission: This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.<br /><br /><br />Right Photo: The Scots Pine - cones (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), near Boronów, Poland<br />Date: 06.07.2008 Source: Pleple2000<br />Permission: This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported, 2.5 Generic, 2.0 Generic and 1.0 Generic license. 	</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />The red staining of the burial context is related to the use of ochre in the burial ritual. Since both upper and lower surfaces of the bones were stained, we infer that the body must have been wrapped in a shroud of ochre-painted skin, whose subsequent decay caused the transfer of the pigment to the skeleton and surrounding pigment. The presence of a semi-rigid durable wrap around the body would also have provided the empty space necessary for the normal post-mortem plantar flexion or downward pointing of the child's feet.<br /><br /><p><img src="images21/shell.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="239" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"><img src="images21/deercanines.jpg" alt = "Lager Velho" width="500" height="267" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"><br /><br />Artefacts and animal bones were found in close association with the skeleton.

The one burial episode so far documented took place in the easternmost part of the site, located far away from the settlement, and separated from the outer edge of the latter by more than 10 m of archaeologically empty space.  The particular location selected took advantage of a small recess in the back wall of the shelter that, at the time of burial, created a protective overhang almost at ground level, forming a kind of natural niche ready-made to receive the body of the child that archaeologists eventually catalogued as fossil LV1. However, similar niches exist in the back wall of the shelter in the area where the living floors are located. It must be concluded, therefore, that there was an unequivocal intention to bury the child away from the areas that people used for the day-to-day living activities carried out in the framework of the site’s use as a residential or as a logistical place.<br /><br />Fig.2: Longitudinal section of the Hanging Remnant at Lagar Velho, and related occupational levels and dates (João Zilhão).<br /><br />The LV1 child burial: The area where the burial took place was tested down to about 2 m below extant ground surface. The deposits contained faunal elements but were otherwise archaeologically sterile. The faunal assemblage contained abundant coprolites and bones (horse, deer and rabbit) showing evidence of gnawing by carnivores. It is quite likely that this part of the shelter functioned as a wolf den until the time period represented by the burial event. Pollen analysis of the sequence excavated in square L20, under the burial, produced a diagram dominated by pine and heather. These results are compatible with information on the environment of the early Upper Paleolithic in Portugal obtained from other sources. However, pollen preservation is always rather poor in these kinds of deposits, so more work needs to be done before the composition of the site’s surrounding paleovegetation can be securely reconstructed.<br /><br />The burial of the Lagar Velho LV1 child (fig.4) lay only a few centimetres below current ground surface. It was the above mentioned slight overhang of the shelter’s back wall that saved it from total destruction when the site was terraced. The skull was missing because it originally lay slightly higher than the rest of the body and was shattered by the bulldozer. Fortunately, it was possible to recover most of its fragments, which were scattered in the thin level of disturbed deposits that covered the burial and surrounding areas. For the most part they were found in a dense accumulation located some 3 m eastwards of the burial along the back wall of the shelter. Careful excavation and screening of all these disturbed deposits allowed the recovery of some 160 fragments and, subsequently, the reconstruction of something like 80% of the total skull. The post-cranial skeleton was virtually complete as well as the child’s permanent and deciduous dentitions.<br /><br />The reconstructed burial ritual is very similar to that documented in contemporaneous funerary contexts of Central and Eastern Europe, showing that, culturally, these populations were fully integrated in the Gravettian world. The body was laid down in extended position, slightly tilted towards the back wall of the shelter, left foot on top of the right one. Prior to the deposition of the body, a small fire had been lit in the shallow pit excavated for the grave. Analysis of the charcoal recovered from under the child’s right leg shows that the burned wood was a single branch of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris. The C14 date of ca. 24,900 BP obtained from this charcoal is, therefore, the closest estimation for the age of the burial event. An absolute upper limit for such an age is provided by the date of ca. 23,900 BP obtained on a bone sample collected from a semi-articulated ensemble of rabbit ribs and vertebrae directly overlying the child’s right leg.<br /><br />The red staining of the burial context is related to the use of ochre in the burial ritual. Since both the upper and the lower surfaces of the bones were stained, we infer that the body must have been wrapped in a shroud of ochre-painted skin, whose subsequent decay caused the transfer of the mineral pigment to the skeleton and surrounding sediment. The presence of a semi-rigid durable wrap around the body would also have provided the empty space necessary for the post-mortem plantarflexion or downward pointing, of the child’s feet.Artifacts and animal bones were found in close association with the skeleton. A Littorina obtusata shell pendant (fig.3) was recovered in the child’s neck. Four pierced red deer canines were found in the above-mentioned cluster of displaced, small, red-stained fragments of the child’s skull. The association of these deer canines with the cranial vault, as in contemporaneous burials from Italy and Moravia, suggests that they must have been part of a headdress.<br /><br />Besides the Scots pine charcoal lens, other natural, apparently unmodified components of the grave may also have been directly related to the burial ritual. The rabbit bones between the child’s legs - three vertebrae, four ribs and one sacral fragment - had a reddish color identical to the human bones. Two of the ribs were complete, with their proximal epiphyses preserved, which suggests that, originally, they were articulated to the vertebrae. The simplest explanation for this association is that part of the carcass of one rabbit was deposited in the grave, perhaps as a food offering.<br /><br />Fig.3 Plot of cranial fragments from the child burial at Lagar Velho , showing the locations of shell pendant and perforated red deer canines (photos: José Paulo Ruas).<br /><br />Analysis of the red deer bones found along the edge of the burial pit showed that they are taphonomically distinct from those found in the surrounding and immediately underlying sediments. The latter present eroded surfaces, have a shine that suggests they were chewed and digested by carnivores, often display actual teeth punctures, and are associated with coprolites. In contrast, the deer bones found by the head and feet of the child’s skeleton - two left pelvises, one distal tibia and two tarsal bones - are very well preserved, show no evidence of carnivore activity, were in contact with the body, and provided C14 dates showing contemporaneity with the burial event. Furthermore, no artefacts or other evidence of human habitation activities were recovered at this level in this part of the shelter. The simplest explanation for the association is that these bones belonged to parts of deer carcasses deposited in the grave as food offerings.<br /><br />The skeletal anatomy of LV1 and its significance: Preliminary descriptions of the child’s anatomy have already been published. His age at death is estimated to lie between 3.5 and 5.0 years and there are no indications of pathological conditions that might have affected normal skeletal development. During the excavation it was assumed that the skeleton represented that of a Gravettian early modern human child belonging to a population no different from those well documented by the numerous contemporary burials from Moravia, Italy and Russia. This view was initially based on the clear presence of a very prominent chin.<br /><br />Further analysis showed that the skeleton also possessed a suite of other traits that aligned it with the known sample of early modern humans from Europe and the Near East. For instance, Neanderthals exhibit relatively larger anterior mandibular teeth than early modern humans. In this regard, the Lagar Velho child falls in the middle of the early modern human distribution. In addition, Neanderthals and early modern humans contrast in the relative proportions of their thumb phalanges, a pattern that is established early in development among recent humans and at least by late juvenile years in Neanderthals. Hence, the comparison is relevant, and in this regard too the Lagar Velho child closely approaches the proportions seen among early modern humans and is distinct from the Neanderthal pattern.<br /><br />Other features of the child’s anatomy, however, suggest clear Neanderthal affinities. Of paramount importance in this regard are the relatively short lower limb segments, reflected in the proportions of its tibial length to femoral length. This ecogeographical proportion, indicating a hyperarctic pattern among the Neanderthals and a tropical one for the European early modern humans (as well as the Levantine early modern human Qafzeh-Skhul sample), completely separates the Neanderthals from these early modern human groups. The Neanderthals have proportionately shorter tibiae relative to their femora. These proportions appear early in development, are well documented for Neanderthal children, and remain stable for a number of millennia in Late Pleistocene and Holocene human populations. <br /><br />--><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br /><h1>The Hybrid Child from Portugal</h1><h2>by Erik Trinkaus and Cidalia Duarte</h2>From<b> Who were the Neanderthals?</b> Scientific American April 2000<br /><br />On a chilly afternoon in late November 1998, while inspecting the Abrigo do Lagar Velho rock-shelter in central Portugal's Lapedo Valley, two archaeology scouts spotted loose sediment in a rodent hole along the shelter's back wall. Knowing that burrowing animals often bring deeper materials to the surface, one of the scouts reached in to see what might have been unearthed. When he withdrew his hand, he held in it something extraordinary: bones of a human child buried nearly 25,000 years ago.<br /><br />		Subsequent excavation of the burial, led by one of us (Duarte), revealed that the four-year-old had been ceremonially interred-covered with red ochre and laid on a bed of burnt vegetation, along with pierced deer teeth and a marine shell-in the Gravettian style known from modern humans of that time across Europe.Based on the abrupt cultural transition seen in archaeological remains from the Iberian Peninsula,it seemed likely that when moderns moved into the area after 30,000 years ago,they rapidly replaced the native Neandertals.So it stood to reason that this specimen, called Lagar Velho 1, represented an early modern child. In fact, it didn't occur to us at first that it could be anything else.<br /><br />		This wonderfully complete skeleton does have a suite of features that align it predominantly with early modern Europeans. These include a prominent chin and certain other details of the mandible (lower jaw), small front teeth, characteristic proportions and muscle markings on the thumb, the narrowness of the front of the pelvis, and several aspects of the shoulder blade and forearm bones.Yet intriguingly, a number of features also suggest Neandertal affinities-specifically the front of the mandible (which slopes backward despite the chin), details of the incisor teeth, the pectoral muscle markings, the knee proportions and the short, strong lower-leg bones.Thus,the Lagar Velho child appears to exhibit a complex mosaic of Neandertal and early modern human features.<br /><br />		This anatomical amalgam is not the result of any abnormalities.Taking normal human growth patterns into consideration, our analysis indicates that except for a bruised forearm, a couple of lines on the bones indicating times when growth was trivially arrested (by sickness or lack of food) and the fact that it died as a child, Lagar Velho I developed normally.The combination can only have resulted from a mixed ancestry-something that had not been previously documented for western Europe.We therefore conclude that Lagar Velho 1 resulted from interbreeding between indigenous Iberian Neandertals and early modern humans dispersing throughout Iberia sometime after 30,000 years ago. Because the child lived several millennia after Neandertals are thought to have disappeared, its anatomy probably reflects a true mixing of these populations during the period when they coexisted and not a rare chance mating between a Neandertal and an early modern human.<br /><br />Fieldwork conducted last summer yielded major portions of the skull and most of the remaining teeth, along with more archaeological material. And in an effort to fully understand this remarkable specimen,we have organized a team of specialists to examine the skeleton further. Among the projects planned are CT scan analyses of the skull and limb bones and computer based virtual reconstruction of the damaged skull. Rigorous study is necessary because the discovery of an individual with such a mosaic of features has profound implications. First, it rejects the extreme Out of Africa model of modern human emergence, which proposes that early moderns originating in Africa subsequently displaced all archaic humans in other regions. Instead the Lagar Velho child's anatomy supports a scenario that combines a dispersal of anatomically modern humans out of Africa with mixing between that population and the archaic populations it encountered. (The African ancestry of early modern Europeans is reflected in their relatively long lower-leg bones, a tropical adaptation. Lagar Velho 1, however, has the short shins of the cold-adapted Neandertals.)<br /><br />		Lagar Velho 1 also provides insights into the behavioral similarities of Neandertals and early modern humans. Despite the paleontological evidence indicating anatomical differences between these two groups, their overall adaptive patterns, social behaviours and means of communication (including language) cannot have contrasted greatly. To their contemporaries, the Neandertals were just another group of Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, fully as human as themselves.<br /><br />		ERIK TRINKAUS is a paleoanthropologist at Washington University.<br /><br />		CIDALIA DUARTE is completing her Ph.D. in physical anthropology at the University of Alberta in Canada and is the human osteologist at the Portuguese Institute of Archaeology in Lisbon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br />From:<br />http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~anthro/lv.html<br /><br />In addition to providing evidence of a 25,000 year old ritual burial (with burnt pine branches, red ochre, pierced teeth and shell) of a 4 year old Paleolithic child, the analysis has revealed that the child exhibits distinctive characteristics of both contemporaneous European early modern humans and preceding Neandertals. It therefore provides evidence of previous admixture between Neandertals and early modern humans in southwestern Europe. As a result, it has become a focus of ongoing research by Prof. Trinkaus and others concerning the evolutionary dynamics of the emergence of modern humans across the Old World.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"><br /><br />From the N.Y. Times April 25, 1999<br /><br /><blockquote><h2>Discovery Suggests Humans Are a Bit Neanderthal</h2><h4>By John Noble Wilford</h4><br /><br />Neanderthals and modern humans not only coexisted for thousands of years long ago, as anthropologists have established, but now their little secret is out: they also cohabited.<br /><br />At least that is the interpretation being made by paleontologists who have examined the 24,500-year-old skeleton of a young boy discovered recently in a shallow grave in Portugal. Bred in the boy's bones seemed to be a genetic heritage part Neanderthal, part early modern Homo sapiens. He was a hybrid, they concluded, and the first strong physical evidence of interbreeding between the groups in Europe.<br /><br />"This skeleton demonstrates that early modern humans and Neanderthals are not all that different," said Dr. Erik Trinkaus, a paleoanthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis. "They intermixed, interbred and produced offspring."<br /><br />Although some scientists disputed the interpretation, other scientists who study human origins said in interviews last week that the findings were intriguing, probably correct and certain to provoke debate and challenges to conventional thinking about the place of Neanderthals in human evolution.<br /><br />Neanderthals and modern humans presumably were more alike than different, not a separate species or even subspecies, but two groups who viewed each other as appropriate mates.<br /><br />Recent DNA research had appeared to show that the two people were unrelated and had not interbred. Neanderthals lived in Europe and western Asia from 300,000 years ago until the last of them disappeared on the Iberian peninsula about 28,000 years ago. In the prevailing theory today, modern humans arose in Africa less than 200,000 years ago and appeared in great numbers in Europe, starting about 40,000 years ago.<br /><br />The new discovery could, at long last, resolve the question of what happened to the Neanderthals, the stereotypical stocky, heavy-browed "cave men." They may have merged with modern humans, called Cro-Magnons, who appear to have arrived in Europe with a superior tool culture. In that case, some Neanderthal genes survive in most Europeans and people of European descent.<br /><br />The skeleton of the boy, buried with strings of marine shells and painted with red ocher, was uncovered in December by Portuguese archeologists led by Dr. Joo Zilhao, director of the Institute of Archeology in Lisbon. The discovery was made in the Lapedo Valley near Leiria, 90 miles north of Lisbon.<br /><br />Realizing the potential significance, Dr. Zilhao called in Dr. Trinkaus, an authority on Neanderthal paleontology, who went to Lisbon and examined the bones in January.<br /><br />The boy, who was about 4 years old at death, had the prominent chin and other facial characteristics of a fully modern human. But his stocky body and short legs were those of a Neanderthal. Dr. Trinkaus compared the limb proportions with Neanderthal skeletons, including some children. He said he was then sure of the skeleton's implications.<br /><br />"It's a complex mosaic, which is what you get when you have a hybrid," Dr. Trinkaus said. "This is the first definite evidence of admixture between Neanderthals and European early modern humans."<br /><br />The age of the skeleton, determined by radiocarbon dating, showed that full Neanderthals had apparently been extinct for at least 4,000 years before the boy was born. "This is no love child," Dr. Trinkaus said, meaning that this was not evidence of a rare mating but a descendant of generations of Neanderthal-Cro-Magnon hybrids.<br /><br />Dr. Trinkaus and Dr. Zilhao have completed a more detailed scientific report to be published soon in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. DNA tests on the skeleton have not yet been done.<br /><br />Other Neanderthal specialists reacted favorably to the discovery. Dr. Fred H. Smith of Northern Illinois University in De Kalb called it "very convincing and absolutely right."<br /><br />Dr. Smith noted that he had come upon other skeletal material in central Europe that raised the possibility of interbreeding between the groups. Though most scholars in the field will probably accept the possibility of interbreeding, he said, a significant number will probably not.<br /><br />The more ardent exponents of the out-of-Africa hypothesis of modern human origins may be holdouts. They have argued that early modern humans all emerged from Africa and wiped out the Neanderthal population in Europe. Whether the relationship was fraternal or genocidal has been much debated. But many have argued that the two groups were distinct, with humans displacing and probably slaughtering their rivals.<br /><br />Dr. Chris Stringer, an expert on Neanderthals at the Museum of Natural History in London, who is a leader of the out-of-Africa forces, said that he was willing to consider the Portuguese findings with an open mind. He told The Associated Press that the current evidence was not sufficient to convince him of Dr. Trinkhaus's hybrid interpretation.<br /><br />An alternative theory, known as regional continuity, holds that the earliest human ancestors arose in Africa and spread around the world more than a million years ago. Modern humans then emerged in different regions through separate evolution and interbreeding. A leading advocate of this theory is Dr. Milford Wolpoff, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.<br /><br />"This find should be devastating to the out-of-Africa people," Dr. Wolpoff said. "It shows their theory doesn't work, at least in Europe. And it shows that fundamentally, Neanderthals are the same species we are and they contributed their genes to European ancestry."<br /><br />By now, scientists said, only a small fraction of Neanderthal genes have survived, the European gene pool having been further mixed through migrations during the spread of agriculture and invasions from the east.<br /><br />But Dr. Wolpoff cautioned that it would take more than one skeleton to tell the effects of interbreeding apart from ordinary evolutionary changes, the result of genes modifying in response to environmental stresses.<br /><br />Dr. Alan Mann, a specialist in human evolution at the University of Pennsylvania, called the Portuguese hybrid skeleton "some of the most important data we ever got about Neanderthals in human evolution," but said he was not sure that interbreeding had been established.<br /><br />Dr. Trinkaus said the discovery "refutes strict replacement models of modern human origins" and also seemed to undermine interpretations of recent DNA research. Two years ago, Dr. Svante Paabo of the University of Munich in Germany, reported that a study of the genetic material DNA from Neanderthal remains and living humans indicated that Neanderthals did not interbreed with the modern humans.<br /><br />At the time, scientists said the DNA results reinforced the idea that Neanderthals were a separate species from modern humans. If the new findings are correct, though, the two groups were probably more like different races of the same species.<br /><br />"The problem with the DNA research was the interpretation," Dr. Trinkaus said. "It's demonstrably wrong. All that they showed is that Neanderthal biology is outside the range of living humans, not modern Homo sapiens back then."<br /><br />Dr. Alan Templeton, an evolutionary geneticist at Washington University, said that some hybridization occurs without the effects showing up, for example, in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed only through the mother. "But if you look deep enough in evolutionary time, you find a lot of interbreeding," Dr. Templeton said. "That is what humanity is all about: we interbreed a lot."<br /><br /></blockquote><h3><span class="reference">References</span></h3><ol compact type="1" start="1"><li><span class="reference"><b>Duarte, C., Maurício, J., Pettit P., Souto P., Trinkaus E., Plicht van der H., Zilhão J.</b>, 1999: The early Upper Paleolithic human skeleton from the Abrigo do Lagar Velho (Portugal) and modern human emergence in Iberia, <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</i>, 1999 Jun 22;96(13):7604-9.</span></li><li><span class="reference"><b>Zilhão J.</b>, 2001: The Lagar Velho Child and the Fate of the Neanderthals, <i>Athena Review</i>, Vol.2, no.4 (pp.33-39)</span></li></ol><br /><br /><hr><br /><br /><h2><A HREF ="index.html">Back to Don's Maps</A></h2><br />   </div><!-- Closes the main content div that was set in the header --><div class="footer"><br /><br /><hr><br /><br /></center><small><br /><center><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A> </center></small><br />        <center> This page last updated: Tuesday, 11th May 2021 14:11

I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 39 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/lagar.html responseCode 3 200

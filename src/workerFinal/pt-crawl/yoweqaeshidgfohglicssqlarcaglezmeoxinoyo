<B>Abstract:</B> Terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center (WTC) 
in New York City and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, not only affected multi-level 
structures in urban areas but also impacted upon their immediate environment at the 
street level in ways that considerably reduced the speed of emergency response. In this 
paper, we examine the potential of using real-time 3D GIS for the development and 
implementation of GIS-based Intelligent Emergency Response Systems (GIERS) that aim at 
facilitating quick emergency response to terrorist attacks on multi-level structures 
(e.g. multi-story office buildings). We outline a system architecture and a network data 
model that integrates the ground transportation system with the internal conduits within 
multi-level structures into a navigable 3D GIS. We examine important implementation issues 
of GIERS, especially the need for wireless and mobile deployment. Important decision 
support functionalities of GIERS are also explored with particular reference to the 
application of network-based shortest path algorithms. Finally, we present the results 
of an experimental implementation of an integrated 3D network data model using a GIS 
database of Franklin County, Ohio (USA). Our study shows that response delay within 
multi-level structures can be much longer than delays incurred on the ground transportation 
system, and GIERS have the potential for considerably reducing these delays.</P></font>

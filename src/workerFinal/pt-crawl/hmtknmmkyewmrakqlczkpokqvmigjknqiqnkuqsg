  <P>My research addresses health, transport, environmental, and social issues in urban areas 
	   through the application of innovative geographic information system (GIS) methods. I focus 
		 on understanding how socioeconomic differences (e.g., gender, income, race, ethnicity, and 
		 religion) shape urban residents' everyday experiences and perceptions/use of the built 
		 environment. I am also interested in studying how specific characteristics of the social 
		 and physical environment affect the wellbeing and behavior of different social groups. My 
		 current projects attempt to mitigate two fundamental methodological problems while examining 
		 health-environment relationships: 
		 <A href="UGCOP.html" target="_blank">the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP)</A> and 
		 <A href="NEAP.html" target="_blank">the neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP)</A>. 		 
		 </P>
		 
		 <P>My studies often rely on the primary data I collected using a wide spectrum of quantitative, 
		 qualitative, and GIS methods, including GPS tracking, real-time mobile sensing, ecological 
		 momentary assessment, activity diary surveys, and in-depth interviews. My methods have several 
		 characteristics. They attempt to capture/reflect individual experience and thus are seldom 
		 based on aggregate data or conventional administrative units such as census tracts. Much of 
		 my work to date has been undertaken at very fine spatial scales (e.g., local streets, individual 
		 buildings, and even rooms inside a building). The following are some of the main themes of my 
		 recent research:
		 </P>
			
 <UL>
    
		<LI>
    geographies of health and wellbeing - environmental health, individual exposure 
		to environmental influences (e.g., air pollution, noise, green space, the food 
		environment) and its health impacts, subjective wellbeing, access to healthcare, 
		spatial disparities in health and wellbeing, protection of geoprivacy in health 
		research;
				
		<LI>
		human mobility, urban travel and sustainable transportation - accessibility jobs 
		and urban opportunities in space-time, the spatial mismatch between jobs and 
		residence, interaction between land use and travel, the environmental impact 
		of suburbanization and commuting, effects of subjective experience on the use 
		of urban space and facilities, and sustainable city;
				
		<LI>
		urban, environmental, health and transport issues in U.S. and Chinese cities;
    
    <LI>
    research method - big data analytics; collection and analysis of GPS and mobile 
		sensor data; 3D geovisualization; quantitative methods (geocomputation, spatial 
		data analysis, structural equation models, hierarchical and multilevel models); 
		qualitative methods (qualitative GIS, computer-aided qualitative data analysis, 
		oral history, narrative analysis, visual narratives, ecological momentary assessment); 
		mixed-method approaches; activity diary surveys;
    		
    <LI>
    3D GIS - 3D GIS data models for multi-story structures; analysis of the space-time trajectories 
    of moving objects through visualization and data mining methods; real-time positioning technologies;
    
         
</LI></UL>
  
  <P>My research interests are quite diverse, but several overarching 
  dimensions can be identified: (a) an emphasis on people’s everyday experiences; 
  (b) a focus on individual differences across multiple axes (e.g. gender, race 
  and religion); and (c) a recognition of the need to develop new methods for representing 
  the complexities of human behavior and the urban environment.
	</P>

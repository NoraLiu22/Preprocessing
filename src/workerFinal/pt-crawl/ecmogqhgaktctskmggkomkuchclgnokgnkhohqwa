<P>I first came to know Fini Littlejohn in 1982, when I took over as editor
of <I>Graffiti</I>, the ASIFA-Hollywood newsletter. While not the celebrity
her husband Bill was and is, I soon came to see that she was an important
presence in the local and international animation scene. It was also around
that time, that Fini started her campaign for what would become the Olympiad
of Animation, which was held in conjunction with the 1984 Summer Olympics
in Los Angeles. A sort of pocket film festival, with many of the trappings
of more established events like the Annecy, it briefly brought animation
and the Olympics together in a unique gathering which, unfortunately, has
for many faded into memory.<BR>
<BR>
In a professional sense, Fini's involvement with animation has always been
peripheral at best, but remains no less passionate about the medium. Born
in Vienna, Josephine (Fini) Rudiger attended the Institute of Arts &amp;
Crafts there, initially studying fashion design, then illustration, publicity
and stage design. However, it was as an actress that her talents first came
into demand. She appeared in a number of stage productions, participated
in the city's &quot;literary cabaret&quot; and had a part in Wily Forst's
classic film, <I>Maskerade</I>, starring Anton Walbrook.<BR>
<BR>
In 1937, at age 22, she realized that, as a Jew, her career options in Austria
were limited and managed to get to the United States, where she had a uncle.
She left rather suddenly and afterwards always felt awkward about leaving
in the midst of a stage production. She recalls that, &quot;It took me a
long time to get over that, because in the theater [everyone was] very friendly
and warm.&quot; It wasn't until she was invited back with other emigree
artists to participate in the 1993 Viennale that she learned that, &quot;They
fired everybody two months [after I left], including the director. So, I
wouldn't have had much hope for a future there. I didn't know that. If I
did, I would have been less homesick for Vienna.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Handicapped by language in New York, she fell back on her art training,
got an assignment as a book illustrator, but mostly painted window backgrounds
for major New York department stores. She moved to Los Angeles in 1938,
where she briefly wound up working at Disney's, doing incidental character
design for <I>Pinocchio</I>, as well as &quot;design, research and story
for <I>Cinderella, Dumbo</I> and other future projects.&quot; (In this,
she was probably one of the first women the studio used in any sort of official
creative capacity.) However, she again mostly earned her living as a commercial
artist for department stores, as well as doing two other children's books.<BR>

</FONT><B>An Interest in Animation</B><BR>
She married Bill in 1943 and it was through him that she continued to develop
her interest in animation. When he became active in ASIFA-International
and attending various international festivals, Fini tagged along. Soon,
their Malibu home became a favorite stopover for animation artists from
around the world.<BR>
<BR>
Her idea for the Olympiad of Animation, she says, was inspired by producer
Les Goldman (<I>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</I>) who always &quot;had
great visions for animation.&quot; And it was his ideas that came to mind
&quot;when there was so much talk about the Olympic Arts Festival&quot;
in anticipation of the 1984 Los Angeles games.<BR>
<BR>
Around this time, Fini broke her arm and was forced to largely get around
by bus, something which is not easy in an autocentric town like Los Angeles.
This did not stop her, and only &quot;a day or two after my accident,&quot;
she recalls that &quot;I bumped into Paul Ziffern's wife, who said, 'Oh,
I'm sorry for you.' (He was a big animal in the Olympics.) I said, You could
really help me. I would like to have an animation festival&quot; and asked
if Paul could help. Initially he couldn't, but did eventually point her
in the right direction.<BR>
<BR>
Fini's initial idea was to have a program of &quot;all these wonderful films
we had seen for the past 30 some years we've been going to festivals and
that you never see here.&quot; ASIFA-Hollywood, headed by animation writer-voice
artist Bill Scott, took the event under its wing; subsequently, through
voice actor June Foray, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Science
agreed to play host at its Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills. (It
helped that Foray was on the Academy's Board of Governors.)<BR>
<BR>
The project now fell under the aegis of the Academy's Douglas Edwards. Eventually,
Prescott Wright, a distributor and experienced film festival hand, was brought
in to manage the actual event. (Critic and historian Charles Solomon was
brought in to help with the final programming.) In addition to Fini's idea
for a retrospective, there came the idea to have &quot;new films made especially
for the Olympics.&quot; She felt that &quot;was a problem,&quot; but it
really did not seem to phase her. 
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<P><B>I Will Make a Film For You</B><BR>
Fini then set out to personally go out and recruit people to make films
especially for the event dealing with the Olympics. Thus, she took the occasion
of her and Bill's travels to festivals like Lucca and Annecy to recruit
filmmakers to the cause. &quot;The first one that said I will make a film
for you,&quot; she recalls, &quot;was Bruno Bozzetto. The second was [Osvaldo]
Cavandoli. Those were the two biggies.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the process of soliciting films, she learned first hand some of the political
realities of the day. Thus, she was initially taken aback by &quot;the cool
reception&quot; she got from people in places like the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia. &quot;Even Feodor Khitruk,&quot; she notes, &quot;who was
really a good friend, said 'I cannot make a film.' Finally one of the East
Germans said to me, 'You cannot approach the artists, you have to go to
the studio and ask them for permission to approach the artists. I had not
known that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She also did not realize the fallout from the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which
the US boycotted, which eventually led to a reciprocal boycott of the L.A.
games by the USSR, which certainly did not help Fini in her mission.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, some 140 new short films on &quot;The Spirit of the Olympics&quot;
from 18 countries were submitted, of which 32 were selected. In addition
to Italy's Bozzetto and Cavandoli, there were films by such world-class
animators as Japan's Yoji Kuri, Canada's Graeme Ross and Hungary's S&aacute;ndor
Bekesi. Due to an unexpected interest from schools around the world, 28
films were picked from films made by students of high school age and younger.
(All but one, an Italian film, <I>L'Importante e partecipare</I> (The Importance
is to Participate), which turned out to be an audience favorite, were screened
separately.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Champions of Animation?</B><BR>
At the time, Fini expressed some disappointment with the way the event turned
out. For instance, she did not really approve of the final selection of
the 50 greatest animated films of all time selected (the &quot;Champions
of Animation&quot;)by an international committee of journalists, scholars,
festival directors and scholars. She still dissents, feeling that the program
lacked the balance and scope she originally envisioned. She recalled that,
&quot;We had two Fischingers and two by Alexeieff and Parker. [Most] were
films that had recently been in the minds of people and not what we had
considered the best films.&quot; She also disliked the addition of a special
program, featuring &quot;Walt Disney's Tribute to Sports Goofy.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
Nevertheless, as I wrote at the time, the Olympiad was &quot;a real morale
booster for the local animation community, giving its members a chance,
once again, to be proud of being called animation artists.&quot; (Remember,
this was at a time when the industry seemed to be in a state of collapse,
with great amounts of work being shipped off to studios in East Asia.) I
further noted that, &quot;The event's widespread publicity and critical
acclaim seemed to carry over to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's &quot;Enchanted
Drawings&quot; series; this history of Hollywood animation shorts has been
consistently sold out, including the opening evening of silent films. ...
After the opening night, a background man from Filmation came up to me glowing
with pride, and said, 'Isn't it great, first the Olympiad and now this!'
It was a comment that seemed to make the Olympiad worthwhile.&quot; And
now, 12 years later, one must say that despite her misgivings, her effort
was certainly very worthwhile.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Spirit of the Olympics</B><BR>
The following is a list of the 32 finalists of films made for the Olympiad
of Animation in &quot;The Spirit of the Olympics.&quot; In retrospect, the
film most people remember seems to be Bruno Bozzetto's <I>Sigmund</I>, which
shows how a little Viennese boy is affected by watching the Olympics on
television. At the time, I also commended Graeme Ross' <I>1...2...3,</I>
whose portrayal of what goes on in a high jumper's mind as he gets ready
to do his stuff, had a funky wit all its own. <BR>

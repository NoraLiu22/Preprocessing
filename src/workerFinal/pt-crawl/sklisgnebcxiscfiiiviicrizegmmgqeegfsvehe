/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        105]]</font> The flood of light that has been thrown on the obscurest 
        and most recondite of the forces and forms of Nature by the researches 
        of the last few years, has led many acute and speculative intellects to 
        believe that the time has arrived when the hitherto insoluble problems 
        of the origin of life and of mind may receive a possible and intelligible, 
        if not a demonstrable, solution. The grand doctrine of the conservation 
        of energy, the all-embracing theory of evolution, a more accurate conception 
        of the relation of matter to force, the vast powers of spectrum analysis 
        on one side, showing us as it does the minute anatomy of the universe, 
        and the increased efficiency of the modern microscope on the other, which 
        enables us to determine with confidence the structure, or absence of structure, 
        in the minutest and lowest forms of life, furnish us with a converging 
        battery of scientific weapons which we may well think no mystery of Nature 
        can long withstand. Our literature accordingly teems with essays of more 
        or less pretension on the development of living forms, the nature and 
        origin of life, the unity of all force, physical and mental, and analogous 
        subjects.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of which 
        I now propose to give some account, is a favourable specimen of the class 
        of essays alluded to, for although it does not seem to be in any degree 
        founded on original research, its author has studied with great care, 
        and has, in most cases, thoroughly understood, the best writers on the 
        various subjects he treats of, and has brought to the task a considerable 
        amount of original thought and ingenious criticism. He thus effectually 
        raises the character of his book above that of a mere compilation, which, 
        in less able hands, it might have assumed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introductory 
        chapter treats of the characteristics of modern scientific thought, and 
        endeavours to show, &quot;that the chief and most distinctive intellectual 
        characteristic of this age consists in the prominence given to historical 
        and genetic methods of research, which have made history scientific, and 
        science historical: whence has arisen the conviction that we cannot really 
        understand anything unless we know its origin; and whence also we have 
        learned a more appreciative style of criticism, a deeper distrust, dislike, 
        and dread, of revolutionary methods, and a more intelligent and profound 
        love of both mental and political freedom.&quot; The first six chapters are 
        devoted to a careful sketch of the great motive powers of the universe, 
        of the laws of motion, and of the conservation of energy. The author here 
        suggests the introduction of a useful word, <em>radiance</em>, to express 
        the light, radiant heat, and actinism of the sun, which are evidently 
        modifications of the same form of energy,--and a more precise definition 
        of the words <em>force</em> and <em>strength</em>, the former for forces 
        which are capable of producing motion, the latter for mere resistances 
        like cohesion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He enumerates the 
        primary forces of Nature as, gravity, capillary attraction, and chemical 
        affinity, and notices as an important generalisation &quot;that <em>all primary 
        forces are attractive</em>; there is no such thing in Nature as a primary 
        repulsive force&quot; (p. 43). Now here there seem to be two errors. Cohesion, 
        which is entirely unnoticed, is surely as much a primary force as capillary 
        attraction, and, in fact, is probably the more general force, of which 
        the other is only a particular case; and elasticity is the effect of a 
        primary repulsive force. In fact, at p. 26, we find the author arguing 
        that <em>all matter is perfectly elastic</em>, for, when two balls strike 
        together, the lost energy due to imperfect elasticity of the mass is transferred 
        to the molecules, and becomes heat. But this surely implies repulsion 
        of the molecules; and Mr. Bayma has shown, in his &quot;Molecular Mechanics,&quot; 
        that repulsion is as necessary a property of matter as attraction.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth chapter 
        discusses the phenomena of crystallisation; and the next two, the chemistry 
        and dynamics of life. The reality of a &quot;vital principle&quot; is maintained 
        as &quot;the unknown and undiscoverable something which the properties of mere 
        matter will not account for, and which constitutes the differentia of 
        living beings.&quot; Besides the formation of organic compounds, we have the 
        functions of organisation, instinct, feeling, and thought, which could 
        not conceivably be resultants from the ordinary properties of matter. 
        At the same time it is admitted that conceivableness is not a test of 
        truth, and that all questions concerning the origin of life are questions 
        of fact, and must be solved, not by reasoning, but by observation and 
        experiment; but it is maintained that the <font color="990000">[[p. 106]]</font> 
        facts render it most probable that &quot;life, like matter and energy, had 
        its origin in no secondary cause, but in the direct action of creative 
        power.&quot; Chapters X. to XIV. treat of organisation and development, and 
        give a summary of the most recent views on these subjects, concluding 
        with the following tabular statement of organic functions:--</p>
      <p><font size="-1"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formative 
        or Vegetative Functions, essentially consisting in the Transformation 
        of Matter.<br />

        </font><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensory 
        . . . . . Sensation / Mind.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fifteenth 
        chapter we first come to one of the author's special subjects,--the Laws 
        of Habit. He defines habit as follows: &quot;The definition of habit and its 
        primary law, is that all vital actions tend to repeat themselves; or, 
        if they are not such as can repeat themselves, they tend to become easier 
        on repetition.&quot; All habits are more or less hereditary, are somewhat changeable 
        by circumstances, and are subject to spontaneous variations. The <em>prominence</em> 
        of a habit depends upon its having been recently exercised; its <em>tenacity</em> 
        on the length of time (millions of generations it may be) during which 
        it has been exercised. The habits of the species or genus are most tenacious, 
        those of the individual often the most prominent. The latter may be quickly 
        lost, the former may appear to be lost, but are often latent, and are 
        liable to reappear, as in cases of reversion. The fact that active habits 
        are strengthened, while passive impressions are weakened, by repetition, 
        is due in both cases to the law of habit; for, in the latter, the organism 
        acquires the habit of not responding to the impression. As an example, 
        two men hear the same loud bell in the morning; it calls the one to work, 
        as he is accustomed to listen to it, and so it always wakes him; the other 
        has to rise an hour later, he is accustomed to disregard it, and so it 
        soon ceases to have any effect upon him. Habit has produced in these two 
        cases exactly opposite results. Habits are capable of any amount of charge, 
        but only a slight change is possible in a short time; and in close relation 
        with this law are the following laws of variation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes of external 
        circumstances are beneficial to organisms if they are slight; but injurious 
        if they are great, unless made gradually.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes of external 
        circumstances are agreeable when slight, but disagreeable when great.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixture of different 
        races is beneficial to the vigour of the offspring if the races mixed 
        are but slightly different; while very different races will produce either 
        weak offspring, or infertile offspring, or none at all. Even the great 
        law of sexuality, requiring the union of slightly different individuals 
        to continue the race, seems to stand in close connection with the preceding 
        laws.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next seven chapters 
        treat of the laws of variation, distribution, morphology, embryology, 
        and classification, as all pointing to the origin of species by development; 
        and we then come to the causes of development, in which the author explains 
        his views as follows:--</p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
        two causes, self-adaptation and natural selection, are the only <em>purely 
        physical</em> causes that have been assigned, or that appear assignable, 
        for the origin of organic structure and form. But I believe they will 
        account for only part of the facts, and that no solution of the questions 
        of the origin of organization, and the origin of organic species, can 
        be adequate, which does not recognise an Organising Intelligence, over 
        and above the common laws of matter. . . . But we must begin the inquiry 
        by considering <em>how much</em> of the facts of organic structure and 
        vital function may be accounted for by the two laws of self-adaptation 
        and natural selection, before we assert that any of those facts can only 
        be accounted for by supposing an Organising Intelligence.</font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life 
          does not suspend the action of the ordinary forces of matter, but works 
          through them. I believe that wherever there is life there is intelligence, 
          and that intelligence is at work in every vital process whatever, but 
          most discernibly in the highest. . . . Nutrition, circulation, and respiration 
          are in a great degree to be explained as results of physical and chemical 
          laws;--but sensation, perception, and thought cannot be so explained. 
          They belong exclusively to life; and similarly the organs of those functions--the 
          nerves, the brain, the eye, and the ear--can have originated, I believe, 
          solely by the action of an Organising Intelligence.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admitting Mr. Herbert 
        Spencer's theory of the origin of the vascular system, and possibly of 
        the muscular, by self-adaptation, he denies that any such merely physical 
        theory will account for the origin of the special complexities of the 
        visual apparatus:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither 
          the action of light on the eye, nor the actions of the eye itself, can 
          have the slightest tendency to produce the wondrous complex histological 
          structure of the retina; nor to form the transparent humours of the 
          eye into lenses; nor to produce the deposit of black pigment that absorbs 
          the stray rays that would otherwise hinder clear vision; nor to produce 
          the iris, and endow it with its power of closing under a strong light, 
          so as to protect the retina, and expanding again when the light is withdrawn; 
          nor to give the iris its two nervous connections, one of which has its 
          root in the sympathetic ganglia, and causes expansion, while the other 
          has its root in the brain and causes contraction.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor will he allow 
        that Natural Selection (which he admits may produce any simple organ, 
        such as a bat's wing) is applicable to this case; and he makes use of 
        two arguments which have considerable weight. One is that of Mr. Herbert 
        Spencer, who shows that in all the higher animals natural selection must 
        be aided by self-adaptation, because an alteration in any part of a complex 
        organ necessitates concomitant alterations in may other parts, and these 
        cannot be supposed m occur by spontaneous variation. But in the case of 
        the eye he shows that self-adaptation cannot occur, whence he conceives 
        it may be proved to be almost an infinity of chances to one against the 
        simultaneous variations necessary to produce an eye ever having occurred. 
        The other argument is, that well-developed eyes occur in the higher orders 
        of the three great groups, Annulosa, Mollusca, and Vertebrata, while the 
        lower orders of each have rudimentary eyes or none; so that the variations 
        requisite to produce this wonderfully complicated organ must have occurred 
        three times over independently of each other. In the first of these objections, 
        he assumes that many variations must occur simultaneously, and on this 
        assumption his whole argument rests. He notices Mr. Darwin's illustration 
        of the greyhound having been brought to its present high state of perfection 
        by breeders selecting for one point at a time, but does not think it possible 
        &quot;that any apparatus, consisting of lenses, <font color="990000">[[p. 107]]</font> 
        can be improved by any method whatever, unless the alterations in the 
        density and the curvature are perfectly simultaneous.&quot; This is an entire 
        misconception. If a lens has too short or too long a focus, it may be 
        amended <em>either</em> by an alteration of curvature, or an alteration 
        of density; if the curvature be irregular, and the rays do not converge 
        to a point, then any increased regularity of curvature will be an improvement. 
        So the contraction of the iris and the muscular movements of the eye are 
        neither of them essential to vision, but only improvements which might 
        have been added and perfected at any stage of the construction of the 
        instrument. Thus it does not seem at all impossible for spontaneous variations 
        to have produced all the delicate adjustments of the eye, once given the 
        rudiments of it, in nerves exquisitely sensitive to light and colour; 
        but it does seem certain that it could only be effected with extreme slowness; 
        and the fact that in all three of the primary groups, Mollusca, Annulosa, 
        and Vertebrata, species with well-developed eyes occur so early as in 
        the Silurian period, is certainly a difficulty in view of the strict limits 
        physicists now place to the age of the solar system.</p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="990000"><br />
        [[p. 132]]</font> II.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        his chapter on &quot;The Rate of Variation,&quot; Mr. Murphy adopts the view (rejected 
        after careful examination by Darwin) that in many cases species have been 
        formed at once by considerable variations, sometimes amounting to the 
        formation of distinct genera, and he brings forward the cases of the Ancon 
        sheep, and of remarkable forms of poppy and of <em>Datura tatula</em> 
        appearing suddenly, and being readily propagated. He thinks this view 
        necessary to get over the difficulty of the slow rate of change by natural 
        selection among minute spontaneous variations; by which process such an 
        enormous time would be required for the development of all the forms of 
        life, as is inconsistent with the period during which the earth can have 
        been habitable. But to get over a difficulty it will not do to introduce 
        an untenable hypothesis; and this one of the rapid formation of species 
        by single variations can be shown to be untenable, by arguments which 
        Mr. Murphy will admit to be valid. The first is, that none of these considerable 
        variations can possibly survive in nature, and so form new species, unless 
        they are <em>useful</em> to the species. Now, such large variations are 
        admittedly very rare compared with ordinary spontaneous variability, and 
        as they have usually a character of &quot;monstrosity&quot; about them, the chances 
        are very great against any particular variation being useful. Another 
        consideration pointing in the same direction is, that as a species only 
        exists in virtue of its being tolerably well adapted to its environment, 
        and as that environment only changes <em>slowly</em>, small rather than 
        large changes are what are required to keep up the adaptation. But even 
        if great changes of conditions may sometimes occur rapidly, as by the 
        irruption of some new enemy, or by a few feet of subsidence causing a 
        low plain to become flooded, what are the chances that among the many 
        thousands of <em>possible</em> large variations the one exactly adapted 
        to meet the changed conditions should occur at the right time? To meet 
        a change of conditions this year, the right large variation <em>might</em> 
        possibly occur a thousand years hence.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        second argument is a still stronger one. Mr. Murphy fully adopts Mr. Herbert 
        Spencer's view, that a variation, however slight, absolutely requires, 
        to ensure its permanence, a number of concomitant variations, which can 
        only be produced by the slow process of self-adaptation; and he uses this 
        argument as conclusive against the formation of complex organs by natural 
        selection in all cases where there is no tendency for action to produce 
        self-adaptation; <em>&agrave; fortiori</em>, therefore, must a sudden 
        large variation in any one part require numerous concomitant variations; 
        it is still more improbable that they can accidentally occur together; 
        it is impossible that the slow process of self-adaptation can produce 
        them in time to be of any use; so that we are driven to the conclusion, 
        that any large single variation, unsupported as it must be by the necessary 
        concomitant variations, can hardly be other than hurtful to the individuals 
        in which it occurs, and thus lead in a state of nature to its almost immediate 
        extinction. The question, therefore, is not, as Mr. Murphy seems to think, 
        whether such large variations occur in a state of nature, but whether, 
        having occurred, they could possibly maintain themselves and increase. 
        A calculation is made by which the more rapid mode of variation is shown 
        to be necessary. It is supposed that the greyhound has been changed from 
        its wolf-like ancestor in 500 years; but it is argued that variation is 
        much slower under nature than under domestication, so that with wild animals 
        it would take ten times as long for the same amount of variation to occur. 
        It is also said that there is ten times less chance of favourable variations 
        being preserved, owing to the free intermixture that takes place in a 
        wild state; so that for nature to produce a greyhound from a wolf would 
        have required 50,000 years. Sir W. Thomson calculates that life on the 
        earth must be limited to some such period as one hundred million years, 
        so that only two thousand times the time required to produce a well-marked 
        specific change has, on this theory, produced all the change from the 
        protozoon to the elephant and man.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although 
        many of the data used in the above calculation are quite incorrect, the 
        result is probably not far from the truth; for it is curious that the 
        most recent geological researches point to a somewhat similar period as 
        that required to change the specific form of mammalia. The question of 
        geological time is, however, so large and important that we must leave 
        it for a separate article.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        second volume of Mr. Murphy's work is almost wholly psychological, and 
        can be but briefly noticed. It consists to a great extent of a summary 
        of the teachings of Bain, Mill, Spencer, and Carpenter, combined with 
        much freshness of thought and often submitted to acute criticism. The 
        special novelty in the work is the theory as to the &quot;intelligence&quot; manifested 
        in organisation and <font color="990000">[[p. 133]]</font> mental phenomena, 
        and this is so difficult a conception that it must be presented in the 
        author's own words:--</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I 
          believe the unconscious intelligence that directs the formation of the 
          bodily structures is the same intelligence that becomes conscious in 
          the mind. The two are generally believed to be fundamentally distinct: 
          conscious mental intelligence is believed to be human, and formative 
          intelligence is believed to be Divine. This view, making the two to 
          be totally unlike, leaves no room for the middle region of instinct; 
          and hence the marvellous character with which instinct is generally 
          invested. But if we admit that all the intelligence manifested in the 
          organic creation is fundamentally the same, it will appear natural, 
          and what might be expected, that there should be such a gradation as 
          we actually find, from perfectly unconscious to perfectly conscious 
          intelligence; the intermediate region being occupied by intelligent 
          though unconscious motor actions--in a word, by instinct. . . . The 
          intelligence which forms the lenses of the eye is the same intelligence 
          which in the mind of man understands the theory of the lens; the intelligence 
          that hollows out the bones and the wing-feathers of the bird, in order 
          to combine lightness with strength, and places the feathery fringes 
          where they are needed, is the same intelligence which in the mind of 
          the engineer has devised the construction of iron pillars hollowed out 
          like those bones and feathers. . . . It will probably be said that this 
          identification of formative, instinctive, and mental intelligence is 
          Pantheistic. . . . I am not a Pantheist: on the contrary, I believe 
          in a Divine Power and Wisdom, infinitely transcending all manifestations 
          of power and intelligence that are or can be known to us in our present 
          state of being. . . . Energy or force is an effect of Divine power; 
          but there is not a fresh exercise of Divine power whenever a stone falls 
          or a fire burns. So with intelligence. All intelligence is a result 
          of Divine Wisdom, but there is not a fresh determination of Divine thought 
          needed for every new adaptation in organic structure, or for every new 
          thought in the brain of man. Every Theist will admit that there is not 
          a fresh act of creation when a new living individual is born. I go a 
          little further, and say that I do not believe in a fresh act of creation 
          for a new species. I believe that the Creator has not separately organised 
          every structure, but has endowed vitalised matter with intelligence, 
          under the guidance of which it organised itself; and I think there is 
          no more Pantheism in this than in believing that the Creator does not 
          separately cause every stone to fall and every fire to burn, but has 
          endowed matter with energy, and has given energy the power of transposing 
          itself.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not myself 
        able to conceive this impersonal and unconscious intelligence coming in 
        exactly when required to direct the forces of matter to special ends, 
        and it is certainly quite incapable of demonstration. On the other hand, 
        the theory that there are various grades of conscious and personal intelligences 
        at work in nature, guiding the forces of matter and mind for their purposes 
        as man guides them for his, is both easily conceivable and is not necessarily 
        incapable of proof. If therefore there are in nature phenomena which, 
        as Mr. Murphy believes, the laws of matter and of life will not suffice 
        to explain, would it not be better to adopt the simpler and more conceivable 
        solution, till further evidence can be obtained?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other portion 
        of the work on which my space will allow me to touch, is the chapter on 
        the Classification of the Sciences, in which a scheme is propounded of 
        great simplicity and merit. Mr. Murphy does not appear to be acquainted 
        with Mr. Herbert Spencer's essay on this subject, and it is somewhat remarkable 
        that he has arrived at so very similar a result, although less ideal and 
        less exhaustively worked out. In one point his plan seems an improvement 
        on all preceding ones. He arranges the sciences in two series, which we 
        may term primary and secondary. A primary science is one which treats 
        of a definite group of <em>natural laws</em>, and these are capable of 
        being arranged (as Comte proposed) in a regular series, each one being 
        more or less dependent on those which precede it, while it is altogether 
        independent of those which follow it. A secondary science, on the other 
        hand, is one which treats of a group of <em>natural phenomena</em>, and 
        makes use of the primary sciences to explain those phenomena; and these 
        can also be arranged in a series of decreasing generality and independence 
        of those which follow them, although the series is less complete and symmetrical 
        than in the case of the primary sciences. The two series somewhat condensed 
        are:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Series: 
        <font size="-1">1. Logic. 2. Mathematics. 
        3. Dynamics. 4. Sound, Heat, Electricity, &amp;c. 5. Chemistry. 6. Physiology. 
        7. Psychology. 8. Sociology.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Series: 
        <font size="-1">1. Astronomy. 2. Terrestrial 
        Magnetism. 3. Meteorology. 4. Geography. 5. Geology. 6. Mineralogy. 7. 
        Pal&aelig;ontology. 8. Descriptive Biology.</font></p>
      <p>Taking the first in the list of secondary 
        or compound sciences, Astronomy, we may define it as the application of 
        the first five primary sciences to acquiring a knowledge of the heavenly 
        bodies, and we can hardly say that any one of these sciences is more essential 
        to it than any other. We are, perhaps, too apt to consider, as Comte did, 
        that the application of the higher mathematics through the law of gravitation 
        to the calculation of the planetary motions, is so much the essential 
        feature of modern astronomy as to render every other part of it comparatively 
        insignificant. It will be well, therefore, to consider for a moment what 
        would be the position of the science at this day had the law of gravitation 
        remained still undiscovered. Our vastly multiplied observations and delicate 
        instruments would have enabled us to determine so many empirical laws 
        of planetary motion and their secular variations, that the positions of 
        all the planets and their satellites would have been calculable for a 
        moderate period in advance, and with very considerable accuracy. All the 
        great facts of size and distance in planetary and stellar astronomy, would 
        be determined with great precision. All the knowledge derived from our 
        modern telescopes, and from spectrum analysis, would be just as complete 
        as it is now. Neptune, it is true, would not have been discovered except 
        by chance; the nautical almanack would not be published four years in 
        advance; longitude would not be determined by lunar distances, and we 
        should not have that sense of mental power which we derive from the knowledge 
        of Newton's grand law;--but all the marvels of the nebul&aelig;, of solar, 
        lunar, and planetary structure, of the results of spectrum analysis, of 
        the velocity of light, and of the vast dimensions of planetary and stellar 
        spaces, would be as completely known to us as they now are, and would 
        form a science of astronomy hardly inferior in dignity, grandeur, and 
        intense interest, to that which we now possess.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Murphy guards 
        us against supposing that the series of sciences he has sketched out includes 
        all that is capable of being known by man. He professes to have kept himself 
        in this work to what may be called positive science, but he believes equally 
        in metaphysics and in theology, and proposes to treat of their relation 
        to positive science in a separate work, which from the author's great 
        originality and thoughtfulness will no doubt be well worthy of perusal.</p>

                occurrence of diverse and well-preserved soft-bodied metazoan

                organisms are from the Ediacaran faunas dating to about 565 million
                 years ago during the Vendian Period of the Proterozoic, these
                
                are impression ichnofossils of soft-bodied organisms. In contrast,
                 the <a href="Chengjiang/Chengjiang-Biota.htm">Chengjiang Biota</a> 
                (about 525 to 520 million years ago), like the younger <a href="burgessshale.htm">Burgess
                 Shale</a> fossils in British Columbia, Canada (about 515 million

                 preservation 
                of soft body parts. Chengjiang is one of some 40 known Cambrian

                of soft tissues. Among these, due to the remarkable fossil discoveries
                  beginning in the 1980s, Chengjiang lagerstatte stands alone
                 in 
                providing insights, many in dispute, for understanding of the
                  paleobiology of multicellular animals in general, and <a href="../Tree_of_Life/PhylumChordata.htm">chordates</a> 
                in particular. Many new discoveries can be anticipated, as well
                 as revisions to the evolutionary interpretations of past discoveries.</font></DIV>

                   fossils of the Maotianshan Shales and Burgess Shale Fauna
                  of Field, 
                British Columbia provide a lens to view the appearance on earth
                   of all the major phyla in existence today, organisms that
                  remain 
                of enigmatic origin, as well as forms that did not persist beyond
                  the early Cambrian Period. The Chengjiang Biota's diversity
                  suggests a stable ecosystem occuring 
                after the <a href="../Paleobiology/CambrianExplosion.htm">Cambrian
                 Explosion</a> when life's major phyla appeared in what seems
                 like  the blink of the eye compared to preceding four billion
                 years 
                of geological time on earth. Importantly, since Chengjiang includes
                  all major animal groups found in the Burgess Shale, discoveries
                 
                in this  laggerstatte imply earlier diversication and/or
                  diversification over a shorter time interval than can be inferred
                 
                from the Burgess Shale. One theory for this change is the fact
                  that the rising concentration of oxygen, a result of bacterial
                 
                and plant <a href="../Tree_of_Life/Stromatolites.htm">photosynthesis</a> 
                over the eons (also see <a href="../Tree_of_Life/Stromatolites.htm">stromatolites</a>),
                 allowed for organisms to be larger in size and lead a more active
                
                lifestyle. According to this theory, oxygen finally reached a
                 concentration where the aerobic machinary, acquired by eukaryotic
                
                cells in the precambrian and contained in the mitochondria through 
                <a href="../Evolution/Endosymbiosis.htm">endosymbiosis</a>, could
                 provide a much higher energy level. Larger organisms more easily
                
                leave traces in the fossil record. The Cambrian Explosion also
                 encompasses the evolutionary emergence of hard body parts, thought
                
                by some to be a consequence of the selection pressures brought
                 about by predation; solid structure support could also lead
                to 
                increased size. Other mechanisms are theorized to have contributed
                 to the Cambrian explosion, such as a cooling of the Earth and
                
                an increase in calcium in marine environments. While the Cambrian
                 Explosion may always be shrouded in some mystery, it is clear
                
                that it represents a profound period for the evolution of life
                 on Earth, where the basic body plans of the major animal phyla
                
                appear by the fossil record to have been established over a brief
                 10 million year span. All the major animal phyla that exist
                today 
                -- about three dozen -- evolved from these early Cambrian fauna.

                region that became the Heilinpu Formation was bounded on three 
                sides by relatively steep mountains, with an opening to the ocean 
                on the east. Various events of shallowing are evident in strata 
                above and below that are indicative of both sea-level changes 
                and tectonic activity. The climate of the region is thought to 
                have been tropical due to <a href="Chengjiang/chuandianella/chuandianella.htm"><IMG SRC="Chengjiang/Waptia.jpg" ALT="Chuandianella ovata, an unusual Chengjiang Arthropod" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="145" hspace="5" vspace="5" BORDER="1" ALIGN="right"></a>proximity 
                to the equator. The Chengjiang fauna is believed to have been 
                mainly benthic (bottom-living), with most taxa living directly 
                on the soft, level seafloor. Few animals that lived above the 
                seafloor were preserved, perhaps because they were able to flee 
                from the periodic storm-induced turbidity flows that are presumed 
                to have resulted in the preservation seen. Most fossils show evidence 
                of only short-distance post-mortem transportation. Some sponges 
                have been preserved flat and current-aligned, indicative of some 
                transport prior to burial, as is also the case for various burrowing 
                worms. Some specimens, however, have been found exactly where 
                they had lived, especially in the case of some lingulid brachiopods 
                that were found with their shells lying flat and their pedicles 
                extending into the sediment. Most specimens of all types are preserved 
                with their flattest surface parallel to the bedding plane of the

                of June 2006, some 185 species of organisms were described in 
                the scientific literature. Of these, 45% are arthropods and 13 
                % are enigmatic. Approximately 65% of all fossils preserved are 
                <a href="Chengjiang/Chengjiang-Biota.htm#Arthropoda">arthropods</a> 
                of exceptional diversity among which the most abundant forms are 
                small bivalved animals known as bradoriids that had pliable exoskeletons. 
                Few arthropods from Chengjiang had the hard, mineral-reinforced 
                exoskeletons as found in trilobites. Rather, Early Cambrian arthropods 
                mostly had relatively pliable, nonmineralized exoskeletons like 
                those of insects. Only about 3% of the organisms known from Chengjiang 
                have hard shells, and most of those are the trilobites. The mud-filled 
                guts of some arthropods (such as <a href="Chengjiang/Fuxianhuia_protensa.htm">Fuxianhuia 
                protensa</a>) suggest they fed by swallowing mud to extract the 
                <em>in situ</em> nutrients. Others, such as the relatively huge

                the fauna, the trilobites are represented by <a href="Chengjiang/Eoredlichia_intermedia.htm">Eoredlichia</a>,

                the most renowned is Myllokunmingia, which<a href="../Fossil_Galleries/Chengjiang/Yannanozoon_lividum/Yannanozoon_lividum.htm"><IMG SRC="Chengjiang/Yunnanozoon.jpg" ALT="Yannanozoon lividum, Earliest Known Hemichordate from Chengjiang Biota" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="111" hspace="5" vspace="5" BORDER="1" ALIGN="right"></a>

                seven gill pouches containing feathery gill filaments. All of 
                these features distinguish this taxon as a vertebrate, probably 
                a primitive agnathid (jawless) fish, one thought to have affinities

                taxa</a> are known as well. Allonia is a chancelloriid that was 
                initially interpreted as a sponge. Other workers believe that 
                they have their affinity with the tunicates, and still others 
                with the halkeriids. Batofasciculus looks like nothing more than 
                a spiky balloon; the nature of this organism is truly an enigma. 
                Dinomiscus looks much like a typical crinoid, but most researchers 
                are unsure of its taxonomic placement. One worker allies it with 
                <a href="Chengjiang/Eldonia-eumorpha/Eldonia.htm">Eldonia</a> 
                in the newly-erected class Eldonoidea. Eldonia itself is frequently 
                seen in the biota, sometimes occurring in associations of several 
                individuals. It is typically preserved as a flat, discoidal impression. 
                It was originally described as a medusiod named Stellostomites, 
                but Simon Conway Morris considered it to be a species of Eldonia, 
                a well-known component of the Burgess Shale. The medusoid shape 
                suggests that Eldonia was pelagic; other researchers have argued 
                for an entirely different existence, considering the eldonioids 
                to be benthic, lying passively on the surface of the seafloor.</FONT></P>

                Chengjiang Biota is an incredible lagerstatte by all measures, 
                including the enormous diversity and early appearance in the fossil 
                record, and also the exquisite degree of detail of the preservation 
                of its specimens. It affords us a unique opportunity to learn 
                about these wonderful creatures so near the initial radiation 
                of life to the forms of today known as the <a href="../Paleobiology/CambrianExplosion.htm">Cambrian 
                Explosion</a>. This amazing diversity was hailed throughout the 
                world as one of the most important fossil finds of the 20th Century. 
                Because of its unique value to science, the Chengjiang lagerstatte 
                was placed on China's first list of A-class national geological 
                parks in 2001. Chengjiang County has plans to apply for a World 
                Natural Heritage designation for its deposits. Chengjiang is an 
                underdeveloped county having rich phosphate deposits that are 
                found both above and below the formation holding the lagerstatte. 
                They have been exploited in part through efforts that began at 
                about the same time that Hou Xian-guang discovered the deposits 
                that bear these exceptional fossils, with phosphate mining bringing 
                in some 2/3 of the county's revenue in 2003. Efforts are underway 
                to close the region to mining to support the county's efforts 
                to attain Heritage Status. A consequence of this has been renewed 
                mining efforts in the region which threaten the fossil-bearing 
                strata due to erosion, slumping of overburden, and simple destruction 
                by the mining efforts. Chengjiang County faces the dilemma between 
                calls for preservation of the treasure trove of early Cambrian 
                fossils to which it is steward and the economic reliance it has 
                on the phosphate industry. It is hoped that a balance between 
                exploitation and restoration of the land can be achieved while 
                there is still time.</FONT></P>

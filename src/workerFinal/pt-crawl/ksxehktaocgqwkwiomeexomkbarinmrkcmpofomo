<h1>Finding Scales to Measure Particular Personality Constructs</h1>
<p>Let's say one wants to investigate the possible relation
between perfectionism and fearfulness. If one wanted, one could go to
the <a href="index.htm" target="_blank">IPIP home
page</a>, follow the link to the list of over 3,000 items, and
build one&#8217;s own perfectionism and fearfulness scales from items that
appear to measure those two constructs.</p>
<p>One would probably be better off, however, looking for
existing IPIP scales for those constructs. The advantage of using
existing IPIP scales is that they are known to be reliable and to
correlate significantly with established, valid scales. To see whether
IPIP scales for constructs of interest already exist, browse to the <a href="index.htm" target="_blank">IPIP home page</a>,
follow the link labeled "All IPIP scales, organized according to an
alphabetical list of constructs," and search for <em>perfectionism</em>
and <em>fearfulness</em>.</p>
<p>A search for <em>perfectionism</em> will lead to
a line that reads<br>
<strong>Perfectionism (AB5C: III+/IV-), (CAT-PD: Perfectionism),
(CHS: Foa, et al., 1998), (HEX: C-Perf).</strong><br>
Each one of the abbreviations in parentheses is the name of an IPIP
scale that seems related to perfectionism. These scale names are also
hyperlinks, so if one clicks on them one will be taken to a page that
contains the items. One can examine the content of the items for these
four scales and choose the scale that best suits one&#8217;s research
purposes. (One can of course use more than one perfectionism scale if
that would be useful.)</p>
<p>A search for <em>fearfulness</em> brings up the
line<br>
<strong>Fearfulness (HEX: E-Fear).</strong><br>
In this case, it appears that one has only a single option. But if one
is dissatisfied with the content of this fearfulness scale, one can
think of a concept whose meaning is similar to <em>fearfulness</em>,
for example, <em>anxiety</em>. A search for <em>anxiety</em>
reveals five scales that might possibly suit one&#8217;s research purposes.
Another way to find additional scales for any construct of interest is
to think of the opposite of the construct. <em>Courage</em>
could be considered the opposite of <em>fearfulness</em>,
and a search for <em>courage</em> reveals one IPIP scale
for measuring that construct. If one scores the items on this scale in
reverse, the score would represent lack of courage, or fearfulness.</p>
<h2>Finding a Multi-Scale Personality Inventory</h2>
<h3>IPIP measures of the five major personality factors</h3>
<p>If one is interested in measuring a broad range of personality
constructs instead of one or two individual constructs, browse to the <a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm">Multi-Scale IPIP Inventories</a>
page. This page provides links to IPIP inventories designed to measure
constructs similar to many well-validated, multi-scale inventories,
including a number of measures of the five major personality factors.</p>
<p>Currently one of the most widely-used approaches to measuring
the full range of normal personality is to use an inventory based on
the five major domains of personality revealed by factor analytic
research. These five domains are often referred to as "The Big Five"
(B5) or "The Five-Factor Model" (FFM). While many nonprofessionals
outside the field of personality psychology or newcomers to the field
have heard of the five major personality factors, not everyone realizes
that the B5 and FFM derive from two historically separate research
programs, and are based on entirely different kinds of data. The five
factors were first identified from factor analyses of individual trait
words (such as such as <em>talkative</em>, <em>kind</em>,
<em>responsible</em>, <em>calm</em>, and <em>imaginative</em>)
found in the dictionary. Since the trait words came from our ordinary
language (lexicon), this program of research is often called the <em>lexical</em>
research tradition. Later, researchers who were aware of the five
factors identified by lexical research decided to construct personality
questionnaires based on those five factors.</p>
<h3>The lexically-derived Big Five</h3>
<p>Lexical research began with Gordon Allport's cataloging of
roughly 18,000 trait words from an unabridged dictionary. Next, Raymond
Cattell reduced the list to a smaller set of terms by various means
including factor analyses of ratings of individuals. Later, two Air
Force researchers, Tupes and Christal, reanalyzed Cattell's data and
analyzed some new data with different methods, and found five factors
every time. Their findings appeared in an obscure technical report, but
were noticed by Warren Norman at the University of Michigan, who
replicated their results and published them. He labeled the five
factors Extroversion/Surgency, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
Emotional Stability, and Culture. Norman's ORI colleague, Lew Goldberg,
continued to replicate his findings with different methods and sets of
trait words, always finding the same factors, although he labeled the
fifth factor Intellect instead of Culture. Goldberg (1981) coined the
phrase "Big Five" for the recurrent five lexical personality factors.</p>
<p>Personality psychologists have constructed a number of scales
containing different sets of personality trait adjectives, and the IPIP
website contains IPIP scales that correlate strongly with these
adjective-based scales. All of these measures are listed at the <a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm" target="_blank">top
of the Multi-Scale Inventory page</a> under the heading <em>Lexical
Big Five Inventories</em>. These inventories include IPIP
versions of Goldberg's (1992) Big-Five Factor Markers, Saucier's (1997)
7 Factor Scales, the 45 facets of the Abridged Five-Factor Circumplex
(AB5C; Hofstee, De Raad and Goldberg, 1992), 10 Aspects of the Big Five
(DeYoung, Quilty, &amp; Peterson, 2007), and the Interpersonal
Circumplex (Markey &amp; Markey, 2009). Some of these IPIP scales
have shorter and longer versions; for example there are 50-item and a
100-item IPIP versions of Goldberg's (1992) Big-Five Factor Markers.</p>
<p>Although many investigators have concluded that
personality-trait structure is best represented by five broad domains,
Michael Ashton and Kibeon Lee have argued for the inclusion of a sixth
domain, which they have labeled Honesty/Humility. On the basis of their
own extensive lexical research, they developed the <a target="_blank" href="https://hexaco.org/">HEXACO-PI</a>
(Lee
&amp; Ashton, 2004). The HEXACO-PI domain scales Extraversion,
Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience correspond to the lexical
factors Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Intellect. The HEXACO-PI
Agreeableness and Emotionality scales are rotational variants of the
Big Five Agreeableness and Emotional Stability factors. Finally,
Honesty/Humility is the sixth factor beyond the traditional five.</p>
<p>The above history should make it clear that there is not one
"Big Five Personality Inventory," but many different IPIP inventories
for measuring the B5 factors. We should also note that the expression
"Big Five Inventory" (BFI) is the name of <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Ejohnlab/bfi.htm">a
44-item personality inventory constructed by Oliver John</a>. The
items on the BFI are, like IPIP items, brief phrases rather than
adjectives, but the BFI does <em>not</em> use IPIP items.
There is no IPIP version of the BFI. If you are interested in the BFI,
browse to <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Ejohnlab/bfi.htm">Oliver
John's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Factor-Model Inventories</h3>
<p>The second history of the five personality factors is based on
personality questionnaires. Raymond Cattell had constructed the 16
Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF), which included 16 different
scales. Paul T. Costa, Jr. and Robert R. McCrae analyzed the items on
the 16PF and found three factors which they labeled Neuroticism,
Extraversion, and Openness to Experience. Eventually they constructed
their own original personality inventory to measure these three domains
of personality, and the called it the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO
PI; Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). Later, after hearing a talk by Lew
Goldberg
at a symposium arranged by Jack Digman, they added an Agreeableness and
Conscientiousness scale and renamed their instrument the NEO PI-R (R is
for Revised). Costa and McCrae then correlated their NEO PI-R with
other major personality questionnaires and demonstrated that
essentially all of the scales in existing personality questionnaires
are related to the five factors in the NEO PI-R. Their view, which they
call the Five Factor Model (FFM), is that Extraversion, Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience are the five
basic factors that underlie personality. The differences between the
Big Five factors and the factors of the FFM are not very large. The
first four factors are nearly identical (Emotional Stability is simply
the opposite of Neuroticism). The greatest difference lies in the fifth
factor, where Intellect measures a tendency toward intelligence and an
intellectual style, while Openness to Experience measures creativity,
imagination, and an interest in trying new things. But the items on the
IPIP Intellect and Openness scales possess largely similar content.</p>
<p>The IPIP scales that represent the NEO PI-R were created by
identifying items that correlate highly with Costa and McCrae's NEO
PI-R. <a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm" target="_blank">The
Multi-Scale Inventory page</a> contains several IPIP versions of
the NEO PI-R. Included are 50-item and 100-item measures of just the
five factors. These measures are labeled "NEO PI-R Domains." Costa and
McCrae's NEO PI-R also includes six "facet" scales for each of the five
NEO domains. The IPIP scales associated with the label "NEO PI-R
Facets" were developed to measure constructs similar to these NEO facet
scales. There are currently three IPIP inventories that measure NEO
facets: a 300-item version (Goldberg, 1999) that is one of the first
IPIP measures ever constructed, a 120-item subset of the 300-item
inventory developed by Johnson (2014) using internal consistency
methods, and a 120-item subset developed by Maples, Guan, Carter, and
Miller (2014) using item response theory.</p>
<p>The NEO PI-R is not the only personality questionnaire that
was explicitly informed by the earlier lexical research. Even before
Costa and McCrae added Agreeableness and Conscientiousness scales to
their original NEO PI, Robert Hogan (1986) designed his Hogan
Personality Inventory (HPI) around the Big Five. The 1986 version of
the HPI contained six domain scales: Sociability and Ambition
represented different aspects of Extraversion; while Likeability,
Prudence, Adjustment, and Intellectance corresponded to Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Intellect in the Big Five
model. A revision of the HPI (Hogan &amp; Hogan, 1992) later
divided the fifth domain scale into School Success, which retains
closeness to the Big Five Intellect factor, and Intellectance, which
resembles Costa and McCrae's Openness to Experience construct. The
scales of both versions of the HPI were constructed from smaller,
narrower scales subscales called homogeneous item composites (HICs).
The original HPI contained 43 HICs; the 1992 version revised the item
composition of HICs and altered the scale assignment of the 44 somewhat
different HICs. The IPIP site contains scales representing the 1992
version of the HPI.</p>
<p>The <a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm" target="_blank">Multi-Scale Inventory page</a> also
lists IPIP versions of two more recent inventories that were explicitly
based on the five major personality factors. The Six Factor Personality
Questionnaire (6FPQ; Jackson, Paunonen, &amp; Tremblay, 2000)
contains domain scales for Extroversion, Agreeableness, and
Intellectual Openness that correspond to the three factors with similar
names in the FFM. The 6FPQ breaks Conscientiousness into separate
Methodicalness and Industriousness domain scales. Independence
corresponds to low Neuroticism. Each of these domain scales contain
three narrower facet scales. The IPIP version of the 6FPQ can be scored
for the six domains and 18 facets. The aforementioned <a href="https://hexaco.org/" target="_blank">HEXACO-PI</a>
(Lee
&amp; Ashton, 2004), based on six factors identified in lexical
research studies, employs items whose format is&nbsp;similar to
IPIP items. The IPIP representation of the HEXCAO-PI&nbsp; was
constructed using an early version of the HEXACO-PI, which has since
undergone <a href="https://hexaco.org/history" target="_blank">revisions</a>.</p>
<h2>IPIP versions of other established multi-construct
inventories and questionnaires</h2>
<p>The <a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm" target="_blank">Multi-Scale Inventory page</a> also
contains links to IPIP inventories designed to measure constructs
similar to many widely-used inventories that were not based on the five
major personality factors. These include the 16PF, California
Psychological Inventory, Temperament and Character Inventory,
Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire, and the Jackson Personality
Inventory.</p>
<p>In order to measure constructs from more than one of the above
questionnaires while keeping the total number of items relatively
small, Yarkoni's (2010) Analog to Multiple Broadband Inventory (AMBI)
can measure 203 constructs similar to those measured by the scales of
the NEO PI-R, HEXACO PI, TCI, HPI, 6FPQ, CPI, JPI-R, and MPQ with only
181 items.</p>
<h2>New multi-construct IPIP inventories</h2>
<p>Most multi-scale IPIP inventories were constructed to assess
constructs similar to those on established personality inventories by
locating items that correlated empirically with scores on those
measures. However, some multi-scale IPIP inventories were constructed
to assess theoretical constructs of interest by locating items whose
content seemed to tap those constructs. These inventories are listed
toward the bottom of the <a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm" target="_blank">Multi-Scale Inventory page</a>.</p>
<p>For her doctoral dissertation, Kim Barchard (2001) developed
seven self-report measures of emotional or social intelligence which
were administered to the Eugene-Springfield Community Sample. The <a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm" target="_blank">Multi-Scale
Inventory page</a> links to these seven IPIP scales representing
components of self-reported emotional or social intelligence. Barchard
cautions that these self-report measures do not correlate with
maximum-performance tests of intelligence and should be regarded as
measures of personality rather than cognitive ability.</p>
<p>Other new multi-scale IPIP inventories include Peterson and
Seligman's Values in Action Survey of Character (Diamond,
O'Brien-Malone, &amp; Woodworth, 2010), Simms, et al.' (2011)
Personality Disorder Scales,Goldberg's Oregon Vocational Interest
Scales (ORVIS: Pozzebon, et al., 2010), and Goldberg's (2010) Oregon
Avocational Interest Scales (ORAIS)</p>

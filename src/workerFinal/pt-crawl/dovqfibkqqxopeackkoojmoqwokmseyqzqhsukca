Native Americans are not extinct. As of the year 2000, there are more than three million Native American people in Canada and the US 
combined--including more than a million children. Native American kids have real-life hopes and real-life problems, just like other kids do. 
They may take part in traditional Indian dances, or they may be Britney Spears fans, or both. They probably don't live in tepees, 
any more than non-native kids live in log cabins. And sometimes, they have to do their homework on the Internet. You are sharing this 
website with each other. Please be respectful neighbors.

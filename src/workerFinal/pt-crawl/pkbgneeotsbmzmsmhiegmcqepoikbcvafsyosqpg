<p align=justify><font color="#FFFF99">Note: The historical data contained in this
section were extracted by permission from <a href="http://www.rolentapress.com">Ralph
Baer's book</a> about his long experience of father of the video game.</font><br><br>

After more than two years of work on <a href="sanders.htm">TV gaming systems at Sanders Associates</a>, 
Ralph Baer and his two coworkers Bill Harrison and Bill Rush ended up with a prototype unit which played 12 
games using mylar overlays, some of which used a light gun. They had also developed the so-called 
dynamic ball action "<b>de/dt</b>" chassis to offer more advanced game features. 
Called the <b>Brown Box</b> because of its simulated woodgrain self-adhesive 
covering, the Brown Box was used to take the project to the next and most 
important step: finding a licensee.<br><br>

Demonstrations were made to Cable TV system operators <b>Teleprompter</b> in 
1968. When that failed to jumpstart the industry, TV manufacturers (Zenith, 
Sylvania, GE, Motorola and RCA) were contacted in order to find a licensee. None 
of the demonstrations to these firms ended up with a license agreement. Fortunately, 
<b>Bill Enders</b>, a member of the RCA team, had left that company and moved on 
to become a marketing VP at Magnavox in their New York sales offices. He had 
been thoroughly impressed with the demonstrations of the Brown Box. During the 
month of July of 1968, Enders came up to get another, personal demonstration; he 
got even more enthusiastic and urged Magnavox management, headquartered in Fort 
Wayne, Indiana, to take a second look at the game concepts. Here was another guy 
with vision.<br><br>

In July, Ralph Baer and <b>Lou Etlinger</b>, Sanders Associates’ Corporate 
Director of Patents, received an official invitation to come and demonstrate the 
game in Fort Wayne. Lou and Ralph got on an airplane on the 17th of July and 
flew to Indiana for that all-important demonstration. Magnavox gave them the use 
of their boardroom and one of their 19-inch TV sets; Ralph set up the TV, along 
with the Brown Box, the light gun, and the golf putting device. One by one, a 
large number of people filed into the room. After their boss, <b>Gerry Martin</b>,
arrived, the demonstration started. Ralph's recollection is that of a room full
of guys sitting around a long, dark conference table, looking generally glum and
non-committal. No one showed any visible degree of enthusiasm except for one man
in the room: The VP for Marketing of the television set division, Gerry Martin.
He immediately saw a novel product category for Magnavox… and he was the boss! He
made a decision right then and there to try and push ahead with a Home TV Game
product.<br><br>

It was remarkable how the atmosphere in the room changed after Gerry Martin 
announced:<br><br>

<i><b>We’re going with this!</b></i><br><br>

Gerry Martin still had to convince Magnavox corporate management to support his 
decision to build games in their Morrison, Tennessee TV set manufacturing plant. 
It took until March of 1971—nine months later—for that to happen.<br><br>
A preliminary agreement was signed between the two companies, Sanders Associates 
and Magnavox. Once that was in place, the Brown Box and all the design data 
turned over to Magnavox engineers in Fort Wayne; they got started on a prototype 
for what was to become their first Odyssey (Model 1TL200) TV Game in 1972.<br><br>
<b>Bill Harrison</b> and Ralph made trips to Fort Wayne in March and June of 
1971 to help with technical and marketing decisions. Bill spent much of his time 
with <b>George Kent</b> and other Magnavox engineers assigned to the project. 
Meanwhile, Ralph worked mostly with <b>Bob Fritsche</b>, who had become Magnavox’
Odyssey program manager.<br><br>

The major concern was to define all the games that the machine should play; what 
the colored overlays should be like, Magnavox having decided in their corporate 
wisdom to leave out the color circuitry, so they could save some money. There 
were extensive debates about which games were to be included with the basic 
Odyssey product and which were to be set aside for after-market sale...and so 
on. Ralph and Bob Fritsche worked well together.<br><br>

The circuitry designed into the Brown Box at Sanders was essentially copied with 
a few exceptions: Components for colored backgrounds were thrown out in favor of 
the plastic screen overlays. The sixteen game-selection switches on the Brown 
Box were replaced with plug-in programming cards—an excellent decision! Some new 
games were added. Unlike the design of the Brown Box, the 1TL200 unit had one 
large printed circuit board (the mother board) into which several small "baby"
boards were plugged. The small, modular boards contained the various sub-circuits, such as 
the ball spot and player spot generators, the H&amp;V sync signal generators, and so 
forth. This method of construction simplified the motherboard design and lowered 
its cost.<br><br>

Prototype development at Magnavox was completed by George Kent’s group in the 
summer of 1971. Two market surveys were made in July and in October 1971 in 
order to determine what potential customers thought of the concept. Amazingly, a 
large number of them disliked the cartridge concept: they thought they could 
get lost or broken by kids. But Magnavox kept the concept. Once George Kent had taken the final design of the game unit and 
antenna switch-box to the FCC labs in Washington and passed their tests (another 
thing that millions of video game units would be subjected to in the incoming 
years), Odyssey went into production at the Tennessee plant in August 1972. A number of 
hand-assembled units were sent to Magnavox’ captive dealers shortly before. The response was phenomenal: The best thing to come down the pike 
in years! was the general consensus. The consumer-electronics press carried 
articles about an up-coming "mystery product" from Magnavox. There was much 
speculation in the trade press just what that "mystery product" might be.<br><br>
During the month of April, Magnavox put on simultaneous shows for their dealers 
and for the press in many parts of the country, touting their 1972 product line. 
Ralph Baer was pleased to be invited to one of these product line introductions 
on the 22nd of the month. The affair took place at the
<b>Bowling Greene Restaurant</b> in the middle of New York’s Central Park. As he 
sat in the audience on a folding chair among dealers and reporters, he watched 
their reactions; it was obvious that the Odyssey game was the undisputed hit of 
the show! As he said: <i><b>I got pretty excited and was hard-pressed to keep my
mouth shut and  restrain myself from jumping up on the stage and yelling: ‘That’s
my baby!’</b></i><br><br>

At about the same time that this New York product line presentation took place, 
other Magnavox dealerships in major cities throughout the country laid on 
similar shows for the press and for their captive dealers. Over the following 
months, Magnavox began supplying these dealers with production units. They also 
started shipping a very nice-looking, pump-action plastic rifle, for which 
they provided a separate, large, in-store easel display. Magnavox also shipped 
their dealers ten additional games available separately, or in a pack of six (as 
six games were originally planned and another four were released later in 1973).<br><br>
A handsome flier was widely distributed. It introduced the idea of Home TV Game 
Playing. It showed the basic and optional Odyssey games and the shooting gallery 
games. The Home TV Game industry was launched for real!<br><br>

Unexpected problems soon began to haunt the program: First off, Magnavox 
featured Odyssey in their fall TV advertising in such a way that everyone got 
the impression that Odyssey would only work with Magnavox TV sets; then they set 
the price at a steep $100 for the game unit plus six program cards that could 
play twelve different games using overlays; and finally, they decided to charge 
another whopping $25 for the rifle, which, of course, made it all a hard sell.<br><br>
Secondly, sales were restricted to Magnavox’ franchised dealer stores. In the 
1960s and 1970s, Magnavox did not sell their TV sets, radios and phonographs 
through independent stores or mass merchandisers such as Sears or 
Montgomery-Ward. Naturally, that narrowed the potential sales base considerably.<br><br>
On the positive side, 
and in spite of all of these marketing and sales gaffes, Magnavox' TV ad 
campaign (including a television commercial featuring old "Blue Eyes", <b>
Frank Sinatra</b>) helped spark up sales in the fall. Over 130,000 Odyssey’s and 
20,000 Shooting Gallery rifle packs were manufactured by Christmas 1972. Who 
knows how many more would have moved off the shelves that holiday season, or the 
next, if Magnavox had enjoyed broader distribution. Restricting Odyssey sales to 
&quot;authorized” Magnavox dealerships was a huge handicap. Magnavox would be forced 
to eliminate this marketing and sales scheme a year later when they 
were sued by the Government for restraint of trade. But by early 1973, Odyssey games were 
already being discounted (see advertisements below). Foreign sales took up some 
of the slack, starting with a Mexican export in October 1972 (Magnavox Odisea). Another export in 
Germany took place in late 1973 (see the ITT Schaub-Lorenz Odyssee). The 1974 French ad for Odyssey shown
<a href="odypubfr.htm">here</a> is typical of the advertising in Europe.<br><br>

Magnavox also mismanaged the sale of the additional plug-in game packs. These 
featured some of the best games, such as Volleyball, Handball, Baseball, 
Wipe-Out, Invasion, and Fun Zoo. All those packs wound up under the store 
counters for after-market sale, but since Magnavox neglected to train sales 
personnel to &quot;push” the packs, not many of them were sold.<br><br>

While the Odyssey game was being demonstrated at Bowling Greene in New York 
in April 1972, 
another new-product show was open to dealers and the invited public in 
<b>Burlingame</b>, California at the <b>Airport Marina</b>. On the 24th of May, 
<b>Nolan Bushnell</b>, later the President of Atari, signed the visitors’ guest 
book and attended that product line demonstration. There he played an Odyssey 
unit hands-on, including, of course, its Ping-Pong game.<br><br>

Shortly after that demo, Nolan Bushnell hired a young engineer, <b>Alan Alcorn</b> 
from Ampex, where Bushnell had worked some years earlier. He put Alan to work on 
a coin-operated arcade Ping-Pong game, which he named &quot;<b>PONG</b>.”<br><br>

Years later, during various depositions, and in Federal Court, Mr. Bushnell 
would allow as how the Odyssey Ping-Pong game he had played in Burlingame wasn’t 
very interesting. However, the fact that he had actually played the Odyssey 
Ping-Pong game that May made his revisionist story unconvincing to the court.<br><br>

In his design of an arcade game, Alan Alcorn had the freedom to use about 70 
integrated logic circuits—so-called ‘7400 series TTL IC’s, to be precise. That 
was a perfectly sensible way to go with a design for a coin-op machine that cost 
many hundreds of dollars, but it was a totally inaccessible route at the time 
for the Home TV Game designer.<br><br>

As it turned out, Alan Alcorn did a great job, improving on the basic Ping-Pong 
features of the Odyssey machine by providing a segmented paddle for vertical 
ball control in place of Odyssey’s "English" control, and by adding wall bounce 
and scoring; most effectively, he came up with that PONG sound, which gave the 
game an unmistakable character. As just about everybody knows, PONG quickly 
became a great hit in some of the bars and arcades of America; PONG can clearly 
be credited with having starting the coin-operated arcade video game industry 
with a bang! Video games, both of the Home TV Game variety and Coin-Op Arcade 
Video Games, were launched.<br><br>

There is also no doubt that PONG helped Odyssey sales late in 1972...after all, 
an Odyssey game system was the only way you could have some of the PONG 
experience at home. The rest, as they say, is (video game) history.

They mainly differ by small eletronic changes and minor variations of game 
accessories as listed below.<br>Model 1TL200BL99 concerns specimens sent back to Magnavox for warranty renewal. 
Except for <a href="pics/odyssey/earlyrenew.jpg">early renewals</a>, renewed Odyssey units had their model updated to 1TL200BL99 
and a new serial number sticked over the original
(serials originally sticked inside the unit were left).<br>Serial numbers start from 06xxxxxx to 11xxxxxx 
(the first 0 was not printed) and <strong>are not
incremental</strong>: some starting with 70 can date early August 1972 although 
some starting with 69 can date weeks later.<br><br>

When most of the 1972 stock was sold, Magnavox decided to produce another large batch of units
(i.e production run), hence the second RUN. Minor changes were made to the hardware. The second RUN
includes not only 1TL200BLAK units, but also the second model (1TL200BK12) which had a few more
hardware changes.<br>The first RUN is either printed on a small white square sticker right to the
serial sticker or stamped in red on the serial sticker. The second RUN is always stamped in red.<br>Specimens happen to have an additional A or B letter on the RUN number. The B letter means that
the batteries were replaced by Magnavox later in 1973 in the many unsold units 
which have been kept in stock for one year (or almost). The A letter is obviously rarer than the B but is considered 
being
a typo. It also does not involve earlier
serials than those with the B letter: the only units known to have the A letter 
were all produced in October 1972.<br>

<p align=justify>Back in the 1990s, the few Odyssey web pages listed two types of consoles:
<b>Type A</b> (which came with 12 games) and <b>Type B</b> (which came with 10 games). Several
Odyssey units were also found with a red <b>B</b> letter added to their RUN 1 label (see above
picture). Later, David Winter found that the <b>Type B</b> corresponded to an export version.
To avoid confusion, he decided that the old <b>Type A</b> and <b>Type B</b> would be
renamed <b>US Model</b> and <b>Export Model</b> respectively, and that RUN-1 
labels with a stamped letter would be called RUN-1A and RUN-1B depending on the 
letter. The above pictures show the first
production run both in 1A and 1B variants as well as the last model, which
only exists in RUN 2. Although most of the Export units were indeed exported to Europe, a few
were found in the USA.<br><br>

<p><font color="#69B4FA" size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>Operation of the Odyssey:</u></strong></font></p>

<p align=justify>The operation of the Odyssey is very basic. Most of the games used special
plastic overlays placed on the television screen to simulate the background graphics that
the system could not draw. Each of the twelve games had two identical overlays in order to
fit on a small or a large screen. Some games used a special scoreboard to mark the scores.
Some others used plastic chips, cards, or other accessories such as a pair of dice, small
chips and game decks. Several games used the same cartridge. The difference was made by
using accessories or by changing the game rules, since the games were mostly played with
the accessories rather than with the elementary graphics shown on the screen. Collectors
interested in the complete set of accessories can have a look at the <a href="odyitems.htm">
list of Odyssey accessories</a>. Some games even used two or three cartridges: the game
started with a specific cartridge and continued with another one after specific events.
Since both players are located by the horizontal and vertical controls, turning the system
off by changing the cartridge did not alter their positions.<br></p>

<p align=justify>The original Brown Box prototype allowed playing some games with a light gun.
Thus, the Odyssey had a special connector to plug in a rifle which allowed playing four extra
games using two additional cartridges (#9 and #10). This rifle pack is called Shooting Gallery.
Because of its limitations, the system could not determine whether the rifle was pointed to the

<p><font color="#69B4FA" size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>How the Odyssey sold in the USA:</u></strong></font></p>

<p align=justify>Odyssey was first announced to the public in May 1972. Although a couple
pre-production units were distributed in May for demonstration purposes, the production
started in August. Nationwide advertising of this system on television and radio
resulted in a real success: over 130,000 Odyssey and over 20,000 rifle packs were 
made
in 1972. More might have been sold if some of Magnavox’ advertsing had not confused TV
viewers into believeing that the Odyssey system would only work with a Magnavox TV set.
Perhaps this was done by Magnavox to increase the sales of their own name-brand TV sets,
but persistent rumors to this effect confused potential customers and did not help sales.
Another 200,000+ Odyssey and 50,000+ rifle packs sold between 1973 and 1975, bringing the
total to 330,000+ Odyssey and 80,000+ rifle packs sold. The system was removed from the
stores in late 1975 and replaced by two new, simpler models: the
<a href="odyssey_other.htm">Odyssey 100 and Odyssey 200</a>.<br>As can be seen 
in the advertisements below, Magnavox made significant discounts to sell more 
Odyssey units. The original $99.95 price was rather high, and the console was 
already discounted at $79 in late 1973. With the purchase of a Magnavox 17" 
color or 19" black and white TV (or any larger screen size), one could get his 
Odyssey for only $49.95 in late 1973.<br><br><br></p>


<a name="P8"></a>
<p><font color="#69B4FA" size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>The very first law suit in the history of video games:</u></strong></font></p>

<p align=justify>As mentioned earlier, Mr. Nolan Bushnell, President of Atari, attended
a demonstration of the Odyssey game system laid on by Magnavox on May the 24th of 1972
at the Airport Marina in Burlingame, CA. After founding Atari on 27th June 1972, Bushnell
and Alan Alcorn (his first employee) designed the famous prototype of their PONG arcade
machine. Once finished a couple months later, it was placed on trial in a local bar
called Andy Capp's Cavern in Sunnyvale. Later in 1974, the arcade video game business
having flourished, Magnavox filed a lawsuit for patent infrigement against Seeburg,
Bally-Midway and Atari. Although Bushnell insisted that he didn't copy the Ping-Pong
(Tennis) game of the Odyssey, Federal District Court judge John F. Grady was not convinced
that Bushnell had designed PONG before attending the Odyssey demonstration. Mr. Bushnell
opted out of the lawsuit before it began and became Magnavox first sublicensee. Henceforth,
they paid royalties to Magnavox in order to legally manufacture and sell PONG systems.
The suit against Seeburg and Bally went forward and marked the very first law suit in the
history of the video game industry. The Sanders/Magnavox team won this suit as well as
later law suits in the Court of Appeals. Much money changed hands. Additional patent
infringement lawsuits vs. Mattel, Activision, Nintendo and several arcade game manufacturer
went to trial over the next decade. All of these lawsuits were won by the Sanders/Magnavox
team and, along with income from many patent licenses, brought in a total of close to a
hundred million dollars over that period of time. The lawyers at Sanders made everything
to avoid that Ralph Baer be aware of these amounts. Ralph only discovered this in 2002 
with David Winter while visiting the former lawyer company in charge of the 
various litigations.
As he said: "I had a great run and invented many other things", and didn't really care.<br><br><br></p>

<p><font color="#69B4FA" size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>Odyssey exports and clones:</u></strong></font></p>

<p align=justify>Odyssey originally sold in the USA only, but was later exported in small
amounts to several countries, and has even been cloned.<br><br>

Several types of exports exist: the <b>US Version</b>, and the <b>Export Version</b>
released by Magnavox in 1974.<br><br>

The very first export of the Magnavox Odyssey, the <strong>Magnavox Odisea</strong>, was made in Mexico around October 1972 
following a very successfull market survey a few months before. It consisted of a US Odyssey with the top
of the box relabeled with a very nice Magnavox logo and large Odisea words. The States
game was replaced by the Volleyball add-on (a yellow sticker was even put on the side of
the box). All paperwork was made in Mexico and printed in spanish. Less than 4,000 Odisea
units were produced.<br><br>

<b>In England</b>, modified US Odyssey units were exported around 1973 and sold by 
<strong>Wendaford Ltd.</strong>,
who inserted additional papers explaining their <a href="pics/odyssey/UKGuarantee.jpg">local
guarantee</a> as well as <a href="pics/odyssey/UKErrata.jpg">important operation instructions</a>. Odyssey units 
were modified to become compatible with local
television sets.<br><br>

<b>In Egypt</b>, a few US Odyssey units were reported, but it is unknown whether they were 
a US or Export version, and whether they were adapted to local TV sets.<br><br>
<strong>In Brazil</strong>, Magnavox exported the Odyssey in late 1975 under 
exclusive licence with <strong>Planil</strong> (Rio de Janeiro). A US version with all text 
translated in Portuguese, this particular Odyssey (model <strong>1TL200BK13</strong>) 
was probably the last batch before the end of the whole production. Click here 
to download the&nbsp; Portuguese user manual (the Planil licence is shown on the 
back cover).<br><br>

The <b>1974 Export Odyssey</b> differs from the above variants, and was sold in several countries listed on a large Patents Label
sticked under the Odyssey unit. The two countries listed under Germany are Greece and Israel
respectively. The french advertisement can be seen <a href="odypubfr.htm">here</a>.</p>

<center><img src="pics/odyssey/PatentLabel.jpg" width="750" height="389"><br></center>

<p align=justify>Odyssey was also exported to <b>Singapore</b> (export model 
reported: <b>YE7100BK13</b>).<br><br>

<b>The Export Version (1974)</b> differs from the US Version by several points. It came with
ten games instead of twelve: five games of the original version were removed (Cat and Mouse,
Football, Haunted House, Roulette, and States) and three others previously sold as add-ons
were added (Soccer, also called Football in the USA, Volleyball and Wipe Out). The user manual
was reduced from thirty-six to twenty-four pages. The Simon Says and Wipeout cards were
translated to three languages (see some pictuers in the <a href="odypics.htm">Odyssey Pictures</a>
page). Consequently, it had a couple overlays removed, a few accessories added (the Wipeout
cars for example) and used cartridges #1, #2, #3, #5 and #7 only. Although this version was
not supposed to be released in the USA, a few specimens were found there.<br><br>

<b>In Germany</b>, Odyssey was exported in two versions. It was first announced in late 1973
as being sold by <b>ITT Schaub-Lorenz</b>. Very few ITT units were made. The
<a href="pics/odyssey/german/itt_box_top.jpg">box</a> was different, and the papers and game
cards were translated to German. The console was also renamed <b>Odyssee</b> and its shipping
box had two large ITT stickers covering the original Magnavox logos. These stickers are almost
never found on Odyssee shipping boxes as their glue dried, leaving two almost black sides on the shipping box, allowing to see the original
&quot;Magnavox&quot;, &quot;Odyssey&quot;, &quot;1TL200&quot; and &quot;Made in USA&quot; 
prints.
The original  user manual was replaced by two separate manuals written in German: one for the
system installation and operation, and one for the game rules. English words moulded on the
console unit were covered by transparent overlays showing their German equivalents printed in
black. This Odyssee version was released in limited amounts in early 1974 (a few thousands).
It was shortly replaced by the <b>Export Version</b> (named Odyssee, model <b>YE7100BK11</b>),
which still had the two manuals translated to German and German text on the controllers. It is
believed that ITT still sold this version in 1974 and that about 10,000 Magnavox units were
exported to Germany in 1974 and 1975. Click <a href="o1german.htm">here</a> to view both versions
of the German Odyssee manuals.<br><br>

<b>In Italy</b>, Odyssey got a last attempt circa 1975-76 as <strong>Odissea</strong> 
(not to be confused with the Mexican Odisea), distributed by <strong>G.B.C. Italia</strong>, the company which
also imported Sinclair computers in the 1980s. In the January 1976 issue of the <i>Sperimentare</i> magazine, the 
Odissea advertisement (scan courtesy of Carlo Santagonisto) clearly shows twelve 
games translated in Italian. However, the console itself is model YE7100BK14, 
the Export version with ten games, which seems to be a very last marketing 
attempt. The Shooting Gallery rifle seems to have been sold as well in Italy as 
one specimen came with its cartridges #9 and #10.<br><br><br></p>

<p align=justify><br>
Although the Odyssey was legally imported to foreign countries, at least three clones are known to exist.<br><br>

<b>In Spain</b>, Odyssey was modified (or cloned) and called <b> <a href="overkal.htm">Overkal</a></b>.<br>
<b>In Argentina</b>, Odyssey was also modified (if not cloned) and called
<b><a href="panoramic_telematch.htm">Telematch De Panoramic</a></b> (model J-5, 
which could stand for "5 Juegos" or "five games"), where Telematch is the name 
of the game, and Panoramic the distributor.<br><br>
Interestingly, both of these clones used a number of push-buttons to select the games instead
of cartridges. Although the Spanish Overkal was a cut-down Odyssey with eight games, the
Argentinian Telematch played only three Odyssey games (Tennis, Squash and
Volleyball) but also featured two additional games: <b>Submarino</b> (a boat shoots a
submarine with a torpedo) and <b>Futbol</b> (football with goals). This required additional
hardware in the unit. Telematch De Panoramic is the only game system known to play the
Torpedo game, also advertised for the <a href="v2000.htm">German Interton Video 2000</a>
and <a href="teletenis.htm">Spanish Tele-Tenis</a>, but never released. For these reasons,
Telemach De Panoramic only came with a carton board explaining the general operation and
game rules. However, the Overkal was much more complete: it came with a detailed used
manual, as well as set of overlays and accessories.<br><br>

<b>In Sweden</b>, an Odyssey clone called <b>Kanal 34</b> was advertised in 1975 but 
very few specimens were manufactured. The advertisement below shows a different unit 
housed in a wood cabinet, using Magnavox Odyssey controllers, cartridges and overlays.
In fact, the main unit contains the Magnavox Odyssey hardware (Export version, either
from a Magnavox Export or ITT Odyssee unit), with the cartridge connector fixed to the
top board and wired to the circuit board. The original battery compartment was still
used and located left to the mother board, like in an Odyssey. Interestingly, the ITT
Odyssee was also sold in Sweden. It came with four manuals: the two original German
ITT manuals, and xerox copies with Swedish text in place of the german text. It is
believed that those ITT Odyssee were released around 1976/77, which is quite late for
that game, but not surprising for the video game market of that time.</p>

<p><font color="#69B4FA" size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>Technology of the Odyssey:</u></strong></font></p>

<p align=justify>Because of its mid-1960’s type of technology, the Odyssey is
completely different from modern video game systems. It uses no microprocessor
and has no need for memory. It is based on a hybrid analog and digital circuit
design. Opening the physical game unit reveals only discrete components:
resistors, capacitors, etc. The only semiconductors are about 40 diodes and 40
transistors.<br><br>

Odyssey’s cartridges contain no components: they are basically <a href="odycarts.htm">
wirejumper sets</a>. When plugging a cartridge into the console, internal
<a href="odymodul.htm">diode logic circuits</a> are interconnected in different 
ways to produce the desired result. As a matter of fact, the Odyssey contains 
everything to make a game based around a ball, one or two paddles representing 
the players, and a central or off-side vertical line which serves as a net or a 
wall. The cartridges act to connect the machine’s diode logic circuitry to 
set the aspect and the position of the vertical line (normally centered for ping 
pong and tennis but located on the left or on the middle for handball and 
volleyball respectively, or not displayed at all for Chase games and gun games), 
and to determine the interaction between the ball and the other graphic objects: 
bounce or erase either a player or a ball spot when there is a collision with a 
player or the central line (a player could even be erased after a collision with 
the ball). During the winter of ’72 – ’73 Ralph Baer designed several advanced 
cartridges equipped with some additional active components so as to add some 
more realistic features to the Odyssey. Unfortunately, Magnavox chose not to go 
along with these new ideas. Recently, Ralph rebuilt two active cartridges. One 
plays Tennis with sound effects, the other is a form of Squash with sound and an 
active wall which moves from left to right, thus increasing the game difficulty.<br>

Grades K-4<P>
It is surprising all the noises that you can hear in the classroom 
even when everyone is quiet.  Well, what are they?  Write 
down everything you can hear when everyone is trying to be quiet.  Can you 
hear the clock?  Wind? Talking? Breathing? Cars? Airplanes?  Footsteps?  
See what interesting noises everyone can hear.<P>

It's time to go outside to take a walk-about.  Find a nice place to have a
seat.  Perhaps in a park or on a bench near a busy street.   
Now listen. 
Write down everything you can hear.  Can you hear the wind? Cars? Airplanes?   
Go back to class and compare the sounds that everyone heard.  Did you

one person and have him sit in the middle of the class.  Have the other 
people form a large circle around the blindfolded person.  Point to one of 
the people in the circle and have him say the seated person's name.  The 
seated person must then try point in the direction of the voice and

with the seated person using both ears and then again with one ear closed.  
How accurate can the center person identify the caller and where the call 
came from?  Are two ears better than one?<P>

Sound Shakers/Noise Makers</H1></center></u>

Grades K-3<P>
Let's make some <font size =+1 color=red>NOISE!</font>.  Explore the sense
of sound with these easy-to-make sound shakers (noise makers).  Find some
plastic film containers, plastic yogurt or cottage cheese cups, or other
plastic juice bottles.  Make sure that the containers have covers for the  
tops. Fill the
containers 1/2 or 1/4 full with dry seeds, uncooked beans or rice, pebbles
or sand.  Seal the top of the container with glue or tape (you don't want
the seeds, beans, rice, etc. all over the floor).  Decorate the container
with glue and magazine cutouts, stickers or colored paper, then shake,
shake, shake.  Compare the sounds made by the different materials.<P>

You could also play a guessing game with your sound shakers:  have people
guess what is inside of your sound shaker just by listening to the noise
your shaker makes.<p>

Mix and Match</H1></center></u>

Grades K-6<P> In this activity you will use your sense of hearing to find
a "sound match."  First you need to make your sound pairs just like in 
the
activity "Sound Shakers/Noise Makers," except use the same type of
container for all the shakers.  Use the same type of film canister or
yogurt container for all the shakers.  Fill pairs of containers with
similar material.  For example, you could fill 2 containers with sand, 2
other containers with a few pennies, 2 other containers with marbles. 
When you shake a container, there will always be one other container that
sounds the same. <P> Mix up the containers and let each student pick one.
Students then shake their containers and hunt around the room trying to
find their matching noise maker by listening to the sound of the other
noise makers.<P>

Auditory Acuity</H1></center></u>

Grades 3-12<P> You hear the ringing of the phone in the middle of the
night, but you just can't find it.  You can hear it, but you can't see it.  
Where is that thing?  Just how good is the ability to find things using
only the sense of hearing.  Blindfold a person.  Have him cover one ear.  
Take a watch or stopwatch that "ticks".  An electric watch will not
work. Ask the student to tell you when he hears some "ticking". Approach
the blindfolded person from several different angles and record the
distance when the subject says "I can hear the ticking".  Keep track of
the angles and the distances.  Repeat the same experiment with the
student's other ear closed.  Then do it again with both of his ears 
opened.  <P>

Two Ears are Better Than One:  Sound Localization</H1></center></u>

Grades 3-12<P>
To show the importance of two ears, try this one.  Make an X on 
the floor with tape or chalk or erasable marker.  Measure distances in a 
straight line in increments of 5 ft (1.5 m) from the X and label each of 
these points with the distance it is from the X (5 ft, 10 ft, 15 ft, etc.)  
Now for the test.  Place a blindfolded subject on the X.  Now, you stand 
on one of the points away from the X.  Say the subject's name.  The 
subject must now tell you which line you are standing on.  Try it 
when the subject uses one and both ears.  Make it harder with shorter 
distances from the X.  Are 2 ears better than one in judging 
distance?<P>
<img src = "mat2.gif"> Materials:
<ul><li>tape OR chalk OR marker</ul><P>

For most people, it will be easier to judge distance using two ears.  Our 
brains use the loudness of sounds and the differences in time for sounds 
to reach each ear to make accurate determinations of sound locations.

Grades 1-12<P>

Marco Polo is a game that requires people to localize sounds.  The game is
often played in the swimming pool, but you can play it outside too. One
person is "IT".  The other players must stay in the pool or within an
outlined space (such as a basketball court).  The object of the game is
for "IT" to tag any other player;  the catch is that "IT" must keep his or
her eyes CLOSED.  To help find other players, "IT" can say, "Marco".  The
other players must respond with the word "POLO".  Using this sound, "IT"
tries to tag someone.  A person who is tagged becomes the new "IT".<p>

<img src = "pennypic.gif" align = left><img src="./gif/coind.gif"
align=right> Here is another way to test your
hearing acuity. Collect 10 or more U.S. 
pennies - the more pennies you collect, the better the "sample". Recently,
I noticed that the U.S. government changed the metals that it uses to make
a penny.  Pennies are not 100% copper.  For one thing, newer pennies look
different - they are more shiny.  To me, new pennies also
<font color=blue>SOUND</font> different. 
Try to figure out WHEN they changed the formula of the penny.  Take your
collection of pennies and drop them, one at a time, on a hard surface...a
table or floor will work.  Newer pennies have a "tinny," "dull" sound. 
Older pennies have a more "full," "ringing" sound.  Keep track of the
pennies that you think are old and which ones are new.  When did they make
the switch to the new penny formula?  My guess, based on my perceptions of 
the penny sounds, is that 1982 was the last year that they made pennies 
with the old metal formula.  From 1983 on, I think they made pennies
out of copper-plated <strong>zinc</strong>.<BR>

<tr><td><center><h1><u><img src="ear2.gif"> Model Eardrum</H1></center></u>
Grades 1-12<P>
 
It's easy to make a model of the eardrum (also called the "tympanic
membrane") and see how sound travels through the air.  Just stretch a
piece of plastic wrap over a large bowl or pot (any container with a wide
opening will work).  Make sure the plastic wrap is stretched tightly over
the container.  The plastic represents the eardrum.  Place about 20-30
grains of uncooked rice on the top of the plastic wrap.  Now you need a
noise maker.  A tin cookie sheet or baking tray works well.  Hold the
cookie sheet close to the plastic wrap. Hit the cookie sheet to create a
"big bang" noise and watch the rice grains jump.<p>

The "big bang" produces sound waves (changes in air pressure) that cause
the plastic sheet to vibrate which causes the rice grains to move.
Sound waves vibrate the eardrum in much the same way.<P>

<ul><li>Plastic wrap
<li>Container with wide opening
<li>Uncooked rice (any other small grain will work)
<li>Tin cookie sheet (or other noise maker)

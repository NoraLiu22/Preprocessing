/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: An anonymously penned 
        review of Charles Lyell's <u>Principles of Geology</u> and <u>Elements 
        of Geology</u> published in the April 1869 issue of <u>Quarterly Review</u>. 
        At the end of this essay Wallace famously states his objections to Darwinian 
        views on human evolution. Original pagination indicated within double

      <p><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 359]]</font> The first 
        edition of the 'Principles of Geology' appeared in 1830: the tenth edition 
        was completed in 1868. In this period of thirty-eight years the work has 
        grown to double its original bulk, and has besides given birth to two 
        vigorous children, the 'Elements of Geology' and the 'Antiquity of Man.' 
        These have reached, the one a sixth and the other a third edition, and 
        are both of them bulky volumes, the former even surpassing in size the 
        entire parent work at the time when it first came before the public. Translations 
        of all these works into French and German, and even into the Russian language, 
        have made them widely known over the whole civilised world.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 360]]</font> We believe 
        we are correct in saying that no other work on geology has ever reached 
        ten editions; and we may perhaps go further, and say that no purely scientific 
        work, not specially educational or popular, has ever had so large a circulation 
        during its author's life. As another distinctive character of this work, 
        we may point out that in its whole scope and aim it stands entirely alone 
        and without rivals. Books on geology, like books on almost every other 
        branch of science, can be counted by the dozen and the score; but among 
        them all there is not one that goes over the same ground as Sir Charles 
        Lyell's great work. We have volumes on every branch of the subject, mineralogical, 
        stratigraphical, and pal&aelig;ontological; we have 'Handbooks' and 'Manuals,' 
        'Treatises' and 'Introductions;' we have educational, systematic, picturesque, 
        and theological Geology: but we have no other work whatever on the Modern 
        changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants considered as the very foundations 
        and principles of Geology. And yet the subject is one of the most wide 
        and varied interest, as we hope to be able to convince our readers. It 
        admits of description of the most marvellous natural phenomena, and discussions 
        of the most curious nature into the past history of the earth and even 
        of the solar system. If, therefore, Sir Charles Lyell has been permitted 
        to retain undisputed possession of this wide and fertile field of research 
        for so long a period, we must impute it to his having treated the subject 
        so exhaustively, with such lucidity of argument and such a charm of style, 
        as completely to satisfy both scientific readers and the educated public, 
        and thus render competition hopeless. A book with such a history is certainly 
        worthy of our attention. We propose, therefore, to lay before our readers 
        in the first place a short sketch of its main purport, bearing in mind 
        the state of scientific opinion at the date of its appearance; and then 
        to discuss some of the matters of very great interest which first appear 
        in this tenth edition and make it in many respects an entirely new work.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when Sir Charles Lyell first came 
        before the public, the standard work on Geology both in this country and 
        throughout Europe, was Cuvier's 'Essay on the Theory of the Earth.' In 
        1827, a fifth edition of the English translation was published, and so 
        late as 1830 a German translation appeared,--striking proofs of its wide 
        popularity, due no less to the great name of its author than to the authoritative 
        tone in which it was written, the beauty and clearness of its style, and 
        to its being almost the only recent work that discussed, however briefly, 
        the great questions of theoretical Geology.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this essay, besides giving an abstract of 
        his researches on <font color="990000">[[p. 361]]</font> fossil animals, 
        Cuvier proposed to show how far the 'history of the revolutions of the 
        globe' had been restored, and he believed that he had determined many 
        parts of it 'in such a rigorous manner' that they would be 'regarded as 
        points definitely fixed, and form an epoch in science.' He then proceeds 
        to contrast the calm and peaceful aspect of the surface of the earth with 
        the appearances discovered when we examine its interior. Here in the raised 
        beds of shells, the fractured rocks, the inclined or even vertical stratification, 
        we find abundant proofs 'that the surface of the globe has been broken 
        up by revolutions and catastrophes.' The different character and constitution 
        of successive strata, and the diverse organic remains found in them, showed 
        that the nature of the ocean and the matters which it held in solution 
        must again and again have changed, and that there must have been various 
        successive irruptions of the sea over the land. He then goes on to prove 
        that these irruptions and retreats of the sea have not been slow or gradual; 
        'but most of the catastrophes which have occasioned them have been sudden;' 
        and he remarks that 'this is especially easy to be proved with regard 
        to the last of these catastrophes: that which, by a twofold motion, has 
        inundated and afterwards laid dry our present continents.' This proof 
        is so remarkable that it deserves to be quoted entire:--</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">'In the northern regions it [the 
        inundation] has left the carcasses of large quadrupeds, which became enveloped 
        in the ice, and have thus been preserved even to our own times, with their 
        skin, their hair, and their flesh. If they had not been frozen as soon 
        as killed, they would have been decomposed by putrefaction. And, on the 
        other hand, this eternal frost could not previously have occupied the 
        places in which they have been seized by it, for they could not have lived 
        in such a temperature. It was, therefore, at one and the same moment that 
        these animals were destroyed, and the country which they inhabited became 
        covered with ice. This event has been sudden, instantaneous, without any 
        gradation: and what is so clearly demonstrated with respect to this last 
        catastrophe, is not less so with reference to those which preceded it.'<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 362]]</font> This passage 
        may be taken as a good example of the style and tone of the whole work, 
        which then proceeds to show that <em>life</em> has not always existed 
        upon the globe, and that 'it is easy for the observer to distinguish the 
        point at which it has begun to deposit its productions.' The 'primitive 
        mountains' are said to afford this evidence, and their 'sharp and bristling 
        ridges and peaks are indications of the violent manner in which they have 
        been elevated.' On the flanks of these mountains 'a sea without inhabitants' 
        deposited schists, porphyries, sandstones, and limestones destitute of 
        shells, and prepared materials for the mollusca and zoophytes which were 
        presently to deposit upon these formations vast heaps of their shells 
        and corals.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving a sketch of the changes now going 
        on, and describing erratic blocks, alluviums and volcanoes, he concludes 
        that 'it is in vain we search among the powers which now act at the surface 
        of the earth for causes sufficient to produce the revolutions and catastrophes, 
        the traces of which are exhibited in its crust.'</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not less confident of the 'newness of the 
        present continents,' of which he furnishes physical proofs:--</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">'It must,' he says, 'have been 
        since the last elevation of the land above the sea, that precipices began 
        to disintegrate and to form heaps of d&eacute;bris at their bases; that 
        our rivers have begun to flow and to deposit alluvial matters; that our 
        present vegetation has spread over the surface and has produced soil; 
        that our cliffs began to be corroded by the sea; that our sand downs began 
        to be thrown up by the wind, and that men have begun to spread themselves 
        over the surface.'</font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then shows that all these processes go on 
        rapidly, and concludes:--</p>
<blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">'that if anything in geology be established, it is that 
        the surface of our globe has undergone a great and sudden revolution, 
        the date of which cannot be referred to a much earlier period than five 
        or six thousand years ago; that this revolution overwhelmed and caused 
        to disappear the countries which were previously inhabited by man, and 
        the species of animals now best known; that on the other hand it laid 
        dry the bottom of the last sea, and formed of it the countries which are 
        at the present day inhabited.'</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have thought it necessary to bring forward 
        what Cuvier taught, as nearly as possible in his own words, or it would 
        hardly be credited to what extent the theory of 'convulsions' and 'catastrophes' 
        was really carried. These doctrines had held <font color="990000">[[p. 
        363]]</font> undisputed sway for nearly twenty years, and had been weighted 
        by the authority of one of the greatest scientific names in Europe. The 
        chief writers on Geology in France and England supported similar views, 
        while the doctrines of Hutton and Playfair, so much in advance of their 
        age, seemed to be utterly forgotten. It was at this juncture, when Cuvier 
        was at the height of his fame, and his 'Theory of the Earth' was still 
        being translated into foreign languages, that a hitherto unknown author, 
        Mr. Lyell, had the audacity to strike at the very root of this theory, 
        and to demonstrate by masterly reasoning and by a vast array of facts, 
        that almost every portion of it was radically unsound. From the date of 
        the completion of the 'Principles of Geology' there appeared no more English 
        editions of the 'Theory of the Earth.'</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of that hasty and superficial view of 
        natural causes now acting, which led Cuvier and so many other writers 
        to the conclusion that they were totally inadequate to explain the phenomena 
        of geology, Mr. Lyell investigated them with the most painstaking minuteness, 
        applied the tests of survey and measurement, and showed that, taking into 
        consideration the element of long periods of time, they were, in almost 
        every case, fully adequate to explain those phenomena. He showed at the 
        same time, that violent and convulsionary action, vast d&eacute;b&acirc;cles 
        and sudden upheavals, would not at all account for the observed facts. 
        That if we descended from vague general comparisons, and studied in detail 
        all the appearances presented by the crust of the earth, we found everywhere 
        proofs of slow and continuous action, everywhere the minutest correspondence 
        with what was now taking place, if we but took the trouble to learn what 
        that really was. He showed that modern volcanoes had poured out equally 
        vast masses of melted rock, which had covered equally extensive areas 
        with any ancient volcano; that strata were now forming, comparable in 
        extent and mass to any ancient strata; that organic remains were being 
        preserved in them, just as in the older formations: that the land was 
        almost everywhere rising or sinking as of old; that valleys were being 
        excavated and mountains upheaved; that earthquake-shocks were producing 
        faults; that vegetation was now preparing future coal-beds; that limestones, 
        crystalline, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, were still being formed; 
        and that, given time, and the intermittent or continuous action of the 
        causes we can now trace in operation, and all the contortions and fractures 
        of strata, and every other phenomenon supposed to necessitate catastrophes 
        and cataclysms, may be again and again produced.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The views advocated with so much talent have 
        steadily gained <font color="990000">[[p. 364]]</font> wider and wider 
        acceptance, and have led to considerable modification in the doctrines 
        held by those who have most consistently opposed them. The 'Convulsionists' 
        of the present day, are very different from those of the time of Cuvier.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one objection made to the doctrines 
        of the 'Uniformitarians,' as the followers of Sir Charles Lyell have been 
        termed, which appears very plausible, but which rests upon a misconception 
        of what those doctrines really are. It is said, that it is unphilosophical 
        and almost absurd to believe, that in our little experience of a few hundred 
        or at most a few thousand years, we can have witnessed all forms and degrees 
        of the action of natural forces; that we have no right to take the historical 
        period as a fair sample of all past geological ages; and that as a mere 
        matter of probability we ought to expect to find proofs of greater earthquakes, 
        more violent eruptions, more sudden upheavals, and more destructive floods, 
        having occurred during the vast &aelig;ons of past time. Now this argument 
        is perfectly sound if it limits itself to the strict laws of probability 
        and average, and no Uniformitarian would deny the possibility and even 
        the probability of their <em>[[sic]]</em> having been <em>some</em> greater 
        convulsions in past geological ages than have ever been experienced during 
        the historical period. But the Convulsionists do not confine themselves 
        to this. They maintain that, <em>as a rule</em>, all the great natural 
        forces tending to modify the surface of the earth, were more powerful 
        and worked on a larger scale than they do now, and that there has been 
        a steady if not an uniform decrease in those forces from the earliest 
        epochs to the present day. The Uniformitarians demand proofs of any such 
        decrease of energy; and Sir Charles Lyell's book is in great part a critical 
        examination of all these supposed proofs, and a more or less vigorous 
        demonstration of their fallaciousness. His doctrine is simply that of 
        real against imaginary causes, and he only denies catastrophes and convulsions 
        to have been the course of nature in early times, because he finds that 
        forces analogous both in kind and degree to those of existing nature are 
        quite competent to explain all the phenomena.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now proceed to a consideration of the 
        many interesting additions to this tenth edition of the 'Principles of 
        Geology'; and some of these will serve to show how willing the author 
        is to admit a former condition of the world very different from its present 
        state, whenever there is direct evidence of such a change, and whenever 
        causes which are known to have been in operation, seem adequate to have 
        produced it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first volume we find, besides many smaller 
        additions, that five entire chapters have been added or re-written. These 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 365]]</font> are, Chapter IX. which treats of 
        the progressive development of organic life, and will be better considered 
        when we come to the new matter in the second volume; and Chapters X. to 
        XIV. which discuss in great detail geological vicissitudes of climate 
        and their probable causes, and are so exceedingly interesting as to deserve 
        our attentive consideration.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the earliest and most striking deductions 
        from the study of fossils, was, that the climate of former ages was warmer 
        than that of the present day; and this was held to support the hypothesis 
        of the primeval fusion of our planet. It was tacitly assumed that all 
        the facts went to show a greater heat in the more ancient than in the 
        comparatively modern epochs; and the scarcity or total absence of organic 
        remains in the most ancient formations, was supposed to be due to the 
        earth having then just solidified and begun to cool down, without being 
        yet in a fit condition to support animal or vegetable life. This very 
        simple hypothesis received its first shock when the existence of a former 
        glacial epoch was demonstrated, and a more accurate study of all the indications 
        of climate in past ages seemed to imply alternations of temperature rather 
        than a regularly progressive decrease of heat. Proofs of a very warm climate 
        in high northern latitudes, during the early and middle tertiary epochs 
        were next discovered, while there seemed to be no satisfactory evidence 
        that it was still warmer in the remotest pal&aelig;ozoic times. Then came 
        the calculations of the physicists, who demonstrated that very soon after 
        the crust of the earth had solidified, the climate of the surface would 
        cease to be affected in any perceptible degree by the temperature of the 
        interior, however high that might be; and it was at length perceived that 
        the problem was a far more complicated one than had been at first imagined. 
        Of late years our knowledge of the structure, affinities, and distribution 
        of fossil animals and plants has immensely increased; the relation of 
        existing organisms to climate has been more accurately studied; terrestrial 
        and astronomical causes of change of climate have been inquired into, 
        and we are enabled to approach this difficult question, with a full appreciation 
        of its difficulty, if not with much confidence in our ability to solve 
        it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most startling geological revelations 
        of modern days is the demonstration, that at so comparatively recent a 
        period as the Miocene a temperate climate prevailed within the Arctic 
        circle, and poplars, planes, and lime-trees grew within twelve degrees 
        of the pole. Beds of fossil-plants of this epoch have been found in Iceland, 
        on the Mackenzie River in North Canada, in Banksland, in North Greenland, 
        and in Spitzbergen. A hundred and forty-four species of flowering plants 
        and nine ferns have <font color="990000">[[p. 366]]</font> been described 
        by Professor Heer. Seventy-eight of these were probably trees, and fifty 
        shrubs. There were no less than thirty-one Conifer&aelig;, among which 
        were four species of <em>Sequoia</em>, allied to the gigantic Wellingtonias 
        of California (a group which was abundant in Miocene times), and three 
        of these were also inhabitants of Central Europe. Species of <em>Thujopsis</em> 
        and <em>Salisburia</em>, genera now found only in Japan, inhabited Spitzbergen 
        and North Greenland, along with beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, maples, 
        walnuts, limes, hazels, and even a magnolia. Among the shrubs were buckthorn, 
        holly, dogwood, and hawthorn; while ivy and vines twined round the forest 
        trees, and large broad-leaved ferns grew beneath their shade. Many of 
        the limes, planes, and oaks had very large leaves, and the tulip-trees 
        and maples bore large fruits; in some cases even the flowers are preserved, 
        and the specimens are so abundant and so perfect, that it is impossible 
        to escape the conclusion that all the plants grew upon the spot, and that 
        the climate must have been at the very least as mild as that of the South 
        of England at the present day. Yet in North Greenland an enormous glacier 
        now covers the whole country, leaving only a narrow strip of land free 
        from ice in summer, and no woody vegetation but a few dwarf willows can 
        exist.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, then, we have absolute proof that the warm 
        climate which characterised the Miocene epoch in the north temperate zone 
        extended into the Arctic regions; and it is Professor Heer's opinion that 
        forests might then have flourished at the North Pole itself. But although 
        this is by far the most striking and the most satisfactory case, it is 
        not the only indication of a mild Arctic climate in past ages. Ammonites, 
        Belemnites, and an Icthyosaurus, have been found in Oolitic rocks about 
        77&deg; N.--animals which we are almost certain could not have inhabited 
        a frozen sea. Coal and characteristic coal-fossils have been found about 
        the same latitudes. Again, in the oldest of all the formations which produce 
        sufficient organic remains to afford any indications of climate--the Silurian--Encrinites, 
        Corals, and Mollusca have been discovered in the Arctic regions, and seem 
        unmistakeably to indicate a warm and open sea where there is now an almost 
        perpetually frozen ocean.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these indications of warm or temperate 
        climates in past ages, extending sometimes far into the Arctic regions, 
        the opinion has of late years been steadily gaining ground among geologists 
        that there are also very satisfactory proofs of cold intervals or glacial 
        epochs intercalated among them. In the same Miocene formation in which 
        we find such abundant remains of the luxuriant sub-tropical fauna and 
        flora that pervaded Central <font color="990000">[[p. 367]]</font> Europe, 
        there occurs south of the Alps a series of beds containing immense angular 
        blocks of serpentine and greenstone, sometimes striated and polished, 
        and thus exactly resembling those which occur in true glacial drift. The 
        geological position of these beds is indisputable, since they rest upon 
        Lower Miocene strata and are covered by an Upper Miocene shell-bearing 
        formation; and Sir Charles Lyell admits, after close personal examination, 
        that no other hypothesis than ice-action is at present tenable. Again, 
        in the Eocene formation north of the Alps is an immense series of beds 
        of sandstone and shale entirely devoid of all organic remains but fuci, 
        and some of which contain angular blocks varying in size from 10 to 100 
        feet in diameter. These facts clearly point to deposit by icebergs in 
        a cold sea.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still further back in the Cretaceous period, 
        isolated blocks of greenstone and syenite, often with granitic sand attached, 
        found in the white chalk of the south of England, is held to indicate 
        the action of ice, and to imply a cool climate somewhere near. It is now 
        admitted that chalk is a deep-sea formation, and some of the stones found, 
        weighing from thirty to forty pounds, cannot be accounted for by any other 
        means of transport than floating icebergs.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no more indications of cold till we reach 
        the Permian or Magnesian Limestone period, at which time Professor Ramsay 
        has almost demonstrated the intercalation of a glacial epoch. A red unstratified 
        marl occurs frequently in Worcestershire, Shropshire, and other parts 
        of England containing angular fragments of various rocks, some half a 
        ton in weight, and many of them polished and striated. They lie confusedly, 
        just as do the rocks and pebbles in the boulder drift, and many of the 
        blocks must have come from the mountains of Wales, twenty, thirty, or 
        fifty miles distant. All this is so exactly characteristic of ice-action 
        at the present day and in the recent glacial epoch, that we are compelled, 
        however unwillingly, to admit that so far back as the Permian our seas 
        were at times actually colder than they are now. Earlier still, in the 
        Devonian, many geologists see evidences of ice-action in the conglomerates 
        containing blocks and pebbles, some of which are polished and striated; 
        and even in the still more ancient Cambrian strata some indications of 
        a similar nature have been traced; but even if we neglect these more doubtful 
        cases, we have sufficient evidence to give us a completely new idea of 
        the past history of our globe. Instead of the regular increase of temperature 
        in past ages which early geological and cosmical theories took for granted, 
        we find proofs of alternations of warm and cold periods far back into 
        the Pal&aelig;ozoic epoch, and no proof that the climate which produced 
        the coal-plants was any warmer than <font color="990000">[[p. 368]]</font> 
        that of the comparatively recent Miocene flora. Where we had expected 
        to find a marked contrast between the old and the existing world, we discover 
        on a more extended survey a close resemblance; and this resemblance extends 
        in some cases to physical details of climate, which we might have supposed 
        would leave no permanent record on the leaves of the great stone book, 
        but which are so curious and instructive as to deserve more attention 
        than has been given to them. In some of the older rocks small hemispherical 
        impressions are found, which exactly resemble the marks left on a surface 
        of fine sandy mud by a shower of rain. Circular pits of various sizes 
        are thus formed, with a somewhat raised rim, and they are often all a 
        little deeper on one side, showing the direction of the wind when the 
        drops fell which produced them. Fine specimens of these rain-prints were 
        obtained by Sir Charles Lyell from the mud-flats of the Bay of Fundy, 
        in Nova Scotia, where in summer the sun dries and hardens the surface 
        so rapidly that the succeeding tide covers them over with a layer of sediments, 
        and thus effectually preserves them. A cake of this dried mud can be split, 
        and will sometimes show the rain-marks and their casts on two opposite 
        surfaces. Now the markings on certain Triassic and Carboniferous shales 
        of North America correspond in the minutest particulars to these recent 
        rain-prints, and even agree with them in the average size and depth of 
        the pits; so that we learn, not only that rain fell in those early times, 
        but that the general atmospheric conditions were so similar, that the 
        size of the drops was about the same as they are now, that the sun shone 
        out afterwards and hardened the surface, and that within a few hours the 
        tide flowed gently over that ancient shore and deposited its preserving 
        layer of sediment. There is a stratum of Triassic shales in New Jersey 
        which preserves layer upon layer of these rain-prints, and among them 
        Mr. Redfield, the well-known meteorologist, has detected curious indented 
        sub-angular impressions which exactly correspond to the marks produced 
        by a storm of angular <em>hail</em>; a most curious corroborative proof 
        of the striking similarity of our present climates to those of the most 
        ancient geological periods.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence we have here briefly sketched, of 
        alternations of cold as well as of warm climates, far into the remotest 
        past of which Geology gives us any knowledge, and the proof it offers 
        us, that in the enormous lapse of ages between the Carboniferous and the 
        Miocene epochs there was no clearly-marked decrease of temperature, seems 
        quite incompatible with the notion of the climate of our globe having 
        been affected even in the earliest times by internal heat derived from 
        a central fluid mass. The geological evidence of climate in the remotest 
        epochs of the <font color="990000">[[p. 369]]</font> earth's history gives 
        absolutely no support to the view of its having ever been in an intensely-heated 
        molten condition. Many attempts have been made to account for the alternations 
        of climate about a mean condition somewhat warmer than that which we now 
        enjoy. It has been supposed that the solar system passes through regions 
        of space of higher and lower temperature. But this view has received very 
        little support, for not only is it entirely beyond proof, but the astronomical 
        and physical difficulties in the way of its reception are enormous. True 
        to his great principle of seeking, in the present condition of the earth, 
        for a clue to its past history, Sir Charles Lyell, in former editions, 
        put forth a very beautiful theory of past changes of climate having been 
        mainly due to a different distribution of land and sea from that which 
        now exists. Many striking facts show that this is a real and efficient 
        cause of abnormal climate. Cumberland House, in North America, has the 
        same latitude as our city of York, but its mean temperature is the freezing 
        point; Newfoundland, about the latitude of Paris, has the same mean temperature 
        as Stockholm and St. Petersburg; while Ireland, in the latitude of frozen 
        Labrador, has a uniform climate whose mean is the same as that of New 
        York in the latitude of Naples. Turning to the Southern hemisphere, we 
        find that in the island of South Georgia, in the same latitude as Yorkshire, 
        the perpetual snows descend to the level of the sea, there are no trees 
        or shrubs, and even at midsummer the heat rarely rises ten degrees above 
        the freezing point. Yet at Terra del Fuego, in the same latitude, and 
        only 800 miles further west, the snow-line is 3000 to 4000 feet high, 
        the slopes of the hills are covered with forests, and in summer there 
        are abundance of gay flowers, which are visited by humming birds! Now, 
        all these striking differences, and many others equally curious, are known 
        to be due to the distribution of sea and land. Water is an equaliser of 
        temperature. Warm currents are continually flowing towards the poles, 
        cold currents towards the equator. Land surfaces within or near the tropics 
        produce heat, near the poles cold. High mountains always produce cold; 
        and this cold or heat is carried by prevalent winds to adjacent and even 
        sometimes to far distant lands. Thus, the winds that blow direct from 
        Australia to New Zealand, 1500 miles distant, melt the snow on the Southern 
        Alps of the middle island and produce floods, a fact which shows how much 
        the climate of those islands might be modified, either by a south-eastern 
        extension of Australia, or by a submergence which should lay its hot plains 
        and deserts under water. In the former case the glaciers might almost 
        disappear; in the latter (especially if an extension of antarctic land 
        occurred at the same time <font color="990000">[[p. 370]]</font> towards 
        New Zealand) they might descend to the sea, and so deteriorate the climate 
        as to render the island uninhabitable. The direction taken by icebergs 
        greatly affects temperature, and this must depend on the direction of 
        ocean currents, which are themselves dependent on the distribution of 
        the land. The south-westerly winds which prevail in the temperate zones 
        are an important factor in determining climate. They cause the western 
        coasts of the great northern and southern continents to be so much milder 
        and more uniform in temperature than the eastern, and we can scarcely 
        doubt that if an archipelago of broken land occupied the place of these 
        continents, the whole region would enjoy a more genial climate than any 
        portion of it does now.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present distribution of land and sea upon 
        the globe is exceedingly irregular and unsymmetrical. The eastern hemisphere 
        contains twice as much land as the western--the northern more than twice 
        as much as the southern. But what shows the irregularity in a more striking 
        manner is the fact that the globe can be divided into two hemispheres, 
        one of which shall have about eight times as much water as land, while 
        in the other the land and water shall be about equal, and of the latter 
        hemisphere the British isles form the centre or pole. Now, as it is certain 
        that much which is now land has very recently been sea, and as every spot 
        which is now land has at some time been sea; and yet further, as we know 
        that changes from land to sea, and from sea to land, have taken place 
        over and over again at almost every part of the surface, we may feel pretty 
        sure that many other equally abnormal distributions of land and sea have 
        occurred during past ages, and that hardly any peculiarity of distribution 
        is impossible. Yet, without any very extravagant supposition, we may see 
        how very great changes of climate might be brought about. At present the 
        oceans have free communication over the whole globe; the warm waters of 
        the equator can penetrate to the poles, while the accumulated ice of the 
        Arctic regions is melted by the warm southern currents. But suppose the 
        Arctic and north temperate seas were ever completely, or almost enclosed 
        by land--as might easily happen by a comparatively limited elevation of 
        the sea bottom between Greenland, Iceland, and the Orkneys, and at the 
        entrance to Davis' Straits--would not the ice of each successive winter 
        accumulate so as to form a vast ice-cap which would inevitably produce 
        a glacial epoch over the whole north temperate zone. If, on the other 
        hand, the polar regions were as free from land as the Atlantic Ocean is 
        now, and if almost all the highest land were situated within forty-five 
        degrees of the equator,--which it might very easily be since those limits 
        include considerably more than two-thirds of the whole surface of the 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 371]]</font> globe,--it is certain that no ice 
        would ever be formed at sea, and that islands within ten or twelve degrees 
        of the pole might enjoy a climate as mild as the south of Ireland or the 
        warmest parts of New Zealand. The differences of temperature of places 
        in the same latitude at the present day fully warrant this belief.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes of distribution of sea and land are therefore 
        a sufficient cause for any changes of climate of which we have geological 
        evidence. That changes of the required amount must certainly have occurred 
        at various epochs of past time is also certain; yet Sir C. Lyell himself 
        furnishes us with a very strong argument against these changes having 
        been the sole cause of those variations of climate of which we have such 
        clear evidence, although they may have been always an important, and perhaps 
        an essential, collateral agent in their production. This argument depends 
        on the fact that the depth of the oceans is much greater than the height 
        of the continents. It has been calculated that the mean height of the 
        whole land of the globe above the sea-level is only 1000 feet, while the 
        mean depth of the oceans is 15,000 feet. Now, as there are mountain ranges 
        of 20,000 feet and upwards, and many extensive plateaux of 8000 and 10,000 
        feet, it follows that a very large portion of the surface of the land 
        cannot be much more than 500 feet high, so that a sinking of a hundred 
        fathoms would convert a vast extent of land into sea. Again, all the shallow 
        seas are near land, while the remoter portions of the great oceans are 
        enormously deep, so that an elevation of 1000 or 2000 feet would only 
        produce new land adjacent to existing land; while to change the ocean 
        beds into dry land would require a continuous elevation of 15,000 or 20,000 
        feet. It follows from this, that while local changes of land and sea may 
        be frequent and comparatively rapid, those greater changes which would 
        result in the complete submergence of continents and elevation of the 
        deepest ocean beds, can only be the work of long periods of time, comparable 
        at least to the age of entire geological formations. When, therefore, 
        we find evidence of great change of climate in the same formation, such 
        as the glacial epochs of the Eocene, Miocene, and Newer Pliocene formations, 
        which seem to have been immediately preceded and followed by warm or temperate 
        periods, it may be argued that we can hardly impute such changes entirely 
        to modifications in the distribution of sea and land, of which we have 
        in most cases no evidence. But, on the other hand, it may be urged--and 
        the argument is a very forcible one--that, as we know that Newer Pliocene 
        strata in Sicily have been raised to a height of 3000 feet above the sea, 
        and the still later glacial drifts in the British Islands to more than 
        2000 feet, it is evident that such an amount <font color="990000">[[p. 
        372]]</font> of change is possible in a very limited portion of geological 
        time as to be capable of producing important modifications of climate. 
        A subsidence of no greater amount than the elevations now referred to 
        would depress the Isthmus of Panama and a large portion of Nicaragua to 
        the depth of a thousand feet below the sea-level, so that the Gulf Stream 
        might pass entirely into the Pacific; and it is a very curious circumstance 
        that quite recently it has been ascertained by Dr. Gunther that no less 
        than 57 species of true marine fishes are found on both the Atlantic and 
        Pacific coasts of Central America out of 173 species known to inhabit 
        those waters.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> These species, Dr. Gunther remarks, are absolutely 
        identical, and present no local modifications whatever, so that we are 
        almost driven to the conclusion that there has really been a temporary 
        connexion between the two oceans at a very recent period. The Mollusca, 
        it is true, show no such striking identity of species, but this is not 
        difficult to explain when we consider how comparatively limited are their 
        means of dispersal, and how completely their existence is dependent on 
        local conditions, which might not be favourable on the shores or in the 
        bed of the interoceanic channel.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now generally admitted that during the 
        glacial epoch a considerable part of northern Europe was submerged, admitting 
        of the southward passage of the cold and iceberg-laden water of the Arctic 
        seas. Add to this the undoubted recent submergence of the Sahara, and 
        the very probable divergence of the Gulf-stream,--and we have three distinct 
        changes in the distribution of land and sea probably occurring about the 
        last epoch of excessive cold. Each of them is admitted to be capable of 
        producing a very considerable effect on climate, and it does not seem 
        improbable that the three combined would have had so powerful an effect, 
        that if their occurrence were really synchronous they might well have 
        proved a sufficient cause for the glacial epoch.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years past great attention has been 
        paid to the question of what effect astronomical causes may have had upon 
        climate, and Mr. James Croll has published a series of able papers on 
        almost every phase of this subject. The thirteenth chapter of the 'Principles' 
        is devoted to a discussion of the facts and arguments of Mr. Croll and 
        others on this interesting problem, which is connected with some of the 
        boldest speculations of modern science.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth in its revolution round the sun describes 
        an ellipse, differing very little from a circle. The excentricity of this 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 373]]</font> ellipse varies slowly and irregularly, 
        and it may in the course of ages approach very nearly to a circle, or 
        become very perceptibly elongated. The excentricity cannot however exceed 
        certain limits, which are pretty accurately known. When the excentricity 
        is least, the difference between the earth's perihelion (or least) distance 
        from the sun, and its aphelion (or greatest) distance is about half a 
        million of miles; when greatest the same difference may amount to 14 millions. 
        At present the difference is about 3 millions of miles. The total quantity 
        of heat received by the earth from the sun in each revolution is inversely 
        proportional to the length of the minor axis of the ellipse, and this 
        varies so little for all changes of excentricity, that the extreme possible 
        differences of total annual heat due to this cause alone are as 1000 to 
        1003, or so small as to have no perceptible effect upon climate.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the obliquity of the ecliptic, leading to 
        the difference of seasons and the long polar day and night, materially 
        affects this result, because the two hemispheres will be differently acted 
        upon by an extreme degree of excentricity according as their summer or 
        winter occurs at perihelion or aphelion. If the north pole is turned away 
        from the sun when the earth's distance is at a maximum, the winters will 
        not only be colder but also longer than they would be if the earth were 
        at its minimum distance; while at the same time the southern hemisphere 
        will have shorter and milder winters. Now, the procession of the equinoxes, 
        combined with the revolution of the apsides, cause all these changes to 
        be gone through in about 21,000 years, so that if at any given period 
        winter in the northern hemisphere occurs at aphelion, in 10,500 years 
        afterwards it will occur at perihelion, and at the end of the full period 
        of 21,000 years will occur again in aphelion. It has been stated that 
        the change of excentricity is irregular, but it is also very slow; so 
        that several complete revolutions of the equinoxes may occur during a 
        period of great excentricity, and the question is to discover whether 
        these alternations of very long and cold with very short and mild winters, 
        at intervals of about 10,500 years during periods of great excentricity, 
        will account for the glacial epochs which seem to have occurred, as it 
        were suddenly, in the midst of warmer periods.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat derived from the sun varies as the square 
        of the distance, and it is calculated that when winter occurs in aphelion 
        during an extreme excentricity, that hemisphere will be receiving one-fifth 
        less heat than it does now when the excentricity is very small. It is 
        therefore supposed that all the moisture in high latitudes would fall 
        as snow instead of rain, and would accumulate to such an extent that the 
        heat of summer, although very <font color="990000">[[p. 374]]</font> great 
        (but of short duration), would be insufficient to melt it. The power of 
        the sun in summer would, it is said, be diminished by the quantity of 
        fog and cloud produced by the action of so much melting snow and ice. 
        Thus the snow would accumulate year by year till a sheet of glacier ice 
        covered all the high lands, and even descended over much of the plains, 
        as we know it did during the glacial epoch.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the opposite hemisphere, enjoying 
        a short and mild winter, would have little snow, and the long moderately 
        warm summer would soon melt it and thus lead to an almost perpetual spring 
        near the poles, while the temperate zone, Mr. Croll thinks, would enjoy 
        a perpetual summer. Thus would be produced a condition of things similar 
        to that of the carboniferous epoch, when there was a warm, moist, and 
        equable climate throughout temperate and even Arctic latitudes. These 
        results are supported by a great array of calculation of temperatures, 
        which are, to say the least, of very doubtful value, as it is impossible 
        to determine how far they would be modified by terrestrial conditions. 
        A striking example of the preponderating influence of terrestrial over 
        astronomical causes in determining climate is afforded by the present 
        state of the earth. The excentricity is now 3 millions of miles, and we 
        are to that extent nearer to the sun in winter than in summer, while the 
        southern hemisphere is so much farther from the sun in winter. The difference 
        is one-thirtieth of the mean distance, and the whole earth ought therefore 
        to be one-fifteenth warmer in December than in June. But exactly the reverse 
        is found to be the case, and the whole earth is really colder in December, 
        owing to the greater masses of land in northern than in southern regions. 
        According to calculation, the northern hemisphere ought to be warmer in 
        winter and colder in summer than the southern, since the earth is in that 
        phase of procession which ought, according to Mr. Croll, to produce some 
        approximation to a perpetual spring in the north temperate zone; but the 
        reverse is again the fact, as shown by the following mean temperatures 
        given by Dove:--</p>
<blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">Northern Hemisphere . . . . . Summer, 70.9&deg; . . . Winter, 
        48.9&deg; . . . Difference, 22.0&deg;<br />
Southern Hemisphere . . . . . Summer, 59.5&deg; . . . Winter, 
        53.6&deg; . . . Difference, 5.9&deg;</font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>Here we see that the southern hemisphere, taken as a whole, approaches 
        to the perpetual spring which ought to occur in the northern, and there 
        is little doubt that if the great mass of lofty antarctic land were to 
        be submerged and the same quantity raised near the tropic of Capricorn, 
        this would actually exist in all the south temperate zone. Now, when we 
        find that not only does our present amount of excentricity produce absolutely 
        no <font color="990000">[[p. 375]]</font> perceptible effect on our climate, 
        but that the real differences of the two hemispheres are in an exactly 
        opposite direction and of a very considerable amount, and when we know 
        that this effect is produced solely by terrestrial causes, we must feel 
        very doubtful whether an excentricity three or four times as great might 
        not also have been often partially neutralised by similar causes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Croll has calculated a table of the amount 
        of excentricity for the last million of years, for the purpose of seeing 
        how far the probable date of the glacial epoch could be determined. He 
        finds that there was about three times the present eccentricity 100,000 
        years ago; three and a half times 200,000 and 210,000 years ago; and nearly 
        as much 850,000 years ago. Mr. Croll was at first disposed to place the 
        glacial epoch at the remotest of these dates, and Sir Charles Lyell thinks 
        that the more recent periods do not afford time for those changes in physical 
        geography and in organic life of which we have proof. Since then, however, 
        Mr. Croll has changed his opinion, and thinks that the middle period, 
        or 200,000 years ago, is quite as far back as we can place the date of 
        the glacial epoch, while 850,000 years ago will mark the Miocene glacial 
        epoch. His reasons for this change of opinion will introduce us to some 
        of the most curious speculations of modern geology.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the glacial epoch at about 800,000 years 
        back as a basis, Sir C. Lyell has calculated, by the proportionate change 
        in the forms of life, the approximate age of the entire geological series. 
        He puts the Eocene at 60 millions of years back, the Carboniferous at 
        160 millions, and the Cambrian at 240 millions of years. Now Sir William 
        Thomson, of Edinburgh, has argued, and Mr. Croll thinks demonstrated, 
        that it is absolutely impossible that the existing order of things on 
        our globe can go so far back, because the sun is emitting heat at such 
        a rate that no conceivable agency could have maintained it the required 
        number of years.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be fairly doubted, however, whether our 
        knowledge of the forces of the universe is at present so accurate or so 
        complete as to enable us to speculate with any chance of arriving at the 
        truth, on such tremendous problems as the age of the sun and the sources 
        of its light and heat. Even among physicists and mathematicians there 
        are radical differences of opinion on these questions, and Professor Challis 
        has published a paper on the 'Source and Maintenance of the Sun's Heat,'<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
        in which he directly opposes Sir W. Thomson's views, and maintains that 
        the light and heat of the sun are due to the dynamical action of different 
        orders of vibrations of the ether upon each other; and <font color="990000">[[p. 
        376]]</font> he seems to think that they are closely related to the force 
        of gravitation and are equally inexhaustible. When such great men as these 
        disagree, the geologist may take heart, and pursue his researches into 
        the past history of our globe, unchecked by the dread of overdrawing his 
        account at the bank of time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although we may feel satisfied that the physicists 
        have not yet quite settled the antiquity of the sun, and thus placed a 
        limit to the age of the earth and the other planets, recent geological 
        investigations of a very definite character do seem to show that the time 
        required for the past changes of the earth has sometimes been over-estimated. 
        Sir Charles Lyell has given a full account of the enormous quantity of 
        sediment brought down by the Ganges and the Mississippi, and has calculated 
        at what rate the deltas of these rivers have been formed, and how vast 
        an extent of new strata they may be building up at the bottom of the ocean. 
        But these and similar statistics have been made use of in a still more 
        instructive manner by Mr. Croll and Mr. Geikie, as a means of proving 
        the unexpected rapidity of sub-a&euml;rial denudation, not only in forming 
        valleys and mountains, but in steadily and surely lowering the surface 
        of whole continents. This subject deserves our attentive consideration, 
        since it appears to afford one of the most reliable measures of geological 
        time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that all the sediment, sand, and 
        gravel carried by a river to the sea must come from some part of the surface 
        drained by that river, and when the quantity of solid matter and the area 
        of the river-basin are known, it is easy to calculate the average depth 
        annually taken from the surface. In many cases the quantity of solid matter 
        carried down by rivers has been accurately determined, and the following 
        are some of the results given by Mr. Geikie:--</p>
<blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">The Ganges has its basin lowered 1/2358 of a foot per 
        annum.<br />
The Mississippi has its basin lowered 1/6000 of a foot 
        per annum.<br />
The Hoang-ho has its basin lowered 1/1464 of a foot per 
        annum.<br />
The Rhone has its basin lowered 1/1528 of a foot per 
        annum.</font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>In other words, in about 1500 years the whole basins of the Hoang-ho 
        and the Rhone will be lowered a foot; in 15,000 years, 10 feet; and in 
        1,500,000 years, 1000 feet. But the mean height of Europe is only about 
        670 feet, so that if other rivers carry down as much sediment as the Rhone, 
        in little more than a million years Europe will be planed down to the 
        level of the sea. Of course as the surface becomes lower, the denuding 
        and carrying power would be less, and this would greatly lengthen the 
        process; but on the other hand, large tracts of the basins of all large 
        rivers are alluvial flats, and are subject to occasional overflowings. 
        These are all raised rather than lowered, and therefore imply a greatly 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 377]]</font> increased action on the sloping 
        surfaces. Again, wherever there are lakes, as in the Rhone basin, an immense 
        quantity of the sediment goes to fill up the lake, and this has to be 
        added to the quantity brought down to the sea, and goes to increase the 
        action on the hills and slopes. We must consider further, that the denuding 
        action goes on with exceeding irregularity; in some parts the surface 
        wears away rapidly, in others it remains unchanged for thousands of years. 
        Solid rock-surfaces retaining glacial stri&aelig; and loose moraines still 
        remaining in Welsh valleys sufficiently indicate how local and partial 
        is the denuding action. But this only proves how powerful it must be in 
        other places,--how valleys must be deepened, how precipices must be eaten 
        away (as is often indicated by the taluses at their feet), how chalk and 
        limestone must be dissolved, and how sand, gravel, and the less tenacious 
        clays must be rapidly carried down by every shower of rain and every tiny 
        brooklet. If in two or three thousand years the average surface of a country 
        is lowered a foot, then certainly the definite lines and limited surfaces, 
        where denudation is most active, must be lowered ten or perhaps fifty 
        feet; and in 80,000 years, the very lowest of the periods that can be 
        assigned since the close of the glacial epoch, changes of surface must 
        have been produced that would be measured by hundreds of feet; and in 
        the much vaster period adopted by Sir Charles Lyell, by thousands.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must, we think, be admitted that this actual 
        measurement of the quantity of matter conveyed away from the surface of 
        a country by its rivers at the present day is a very powerful, though 
        not perhaps a conclusive, argument against adopting the epoch of 850,000 
        years ago as the date of the glacial period; and at first sight it seems 
        equally strong against that of 210,000 or 80,000 years. We must consider, 
        however, that a considerable portion of the matter carried down by rivers 
        consists of loose materials, through which they and their numerous tributaries 
        cut their channels; and if such loose materials were scarce, the quantity 
        of denuded matter would be very much diminished. The well-known black-water 
        rivers of South America bring down exceedingly little sediment, and the 
        amount of denudation effected in the vast granite district of the Upper 
        Rio Negro must be almost infinitesimal. Among the mountains of Wales and 
        Scotland we often see streams which even in floods have clear brown waters, 
        and hardly bring down any sediment, while others are heavily charged with 
        earth, gravel, and stones. Now, every subsidence of a country beneath 
        the sea will tend to fill the lower valleys with such loose materials, 
        which will furnish afterwards a large portion of the sediment carried 
        down by the rivers. Such <font color="990000">[[p. 378]]</font> subsidences 
        and elevations have perhaps occurred many times since the glacial epoch; 
        unequal subsidences will have sometimes altered the level of valleys and 
        diminished the carrying power of rivers; and we can hardly solve this 
        question of the rate of denudation satisfactorily till we find a river-basin 
        which contains no gravel, drift, or loose soil already deposited in it, 
        and, by determining the quantity of matter it carries away annually, get 
        some notion of the amount of average rock-formations denuded by sub-a&euml;rial 
        action. We are inclined to think that this would be found to be a very 
        small fraction of that given by most of the rivers which have already 
        been measured.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this view of the case is correct, it will 
        follow that the enormously rapid rate of denudation going on now is only 
        rendered possible by recent submergence of the land, especially during 
        the last glacial epoch, when vast deposits of gravel, drift, and clay 
        were formed in the valleys and lowlands, and even to the height of several 
        thousand feet on the mountains. The quantity of matter now carried away 
        by our rivers is therefore no measure of the rate at which solid rock 
        formations can be denuded, or whole continents eaten away. To determine 
        this we require measures of the sediment carried away from purely intertropical 
        river-basins, whose sources do not descend from snowy mountains. Such 
        rivers as the San Francisco and the Tocantins in Brazil would perhaps 
        serve for this purpose, although from the abundance of the tropical rains 
        there can be little doubt that they must possess more denuding power than 
        the rivers of temperate latitudes; unless the powerful agency of frost 
        in loosening and decomposing rocks should balance the effect of the tropical 
        rainy seasons.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may however be argued, that no measure of 
        the rate of destruction of our continents can be obtained by a study of 
        denudation alone, because the subterranean elevating forces must always 
        on the whole have fully balanced the degrading forces, and are probably 
        still doing so. But though the mean height of a continent may be kept 
        stationary, or may even be increased by the action of subterranean forces, 
        this will actually assist the denuding power, by loosening rocks, causing 
        mountain slides, raising and inclining alluvial deposits, and altering 
        the slope of valleys. The form of the surface will therefore be continually 
        more and more changed, and the existing rate of denudation on the most 
        moderate estimate, shows that the amount of this alteration of the surface 
        would be enormous in the course of hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to glance only at a few of 
        the more important considerations that enter into the difficult questions 
        of <font color="990000">[[p. 379]]</font> geological climates and geological 
        time. The subject is now being discussed so vigorously and studied so 
        carefully that we may soon hope to arrive at more definite results than 
        have hitherto been possible. The impression produced by our own study 
        of the subject may be expressed in the following propositions:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. That geology affords no evidence in support 
        of the view that, on the whole, the more ancient were hotter than the 
        more recent climates. The Pal&aelig;ozoic age may have been, for anything 
        we know to the contrary, less tropical than the Tertiary.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. That the present climate of the globe, and 
        especially of the northern hemisphere, is abnormal; and this can be clearly 
        traced to the very abnormal distribution of land and water that now obtains.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. That the main vicissitudes of geological climate, 
        and especially the alternations of warm and cold climates of which we 
        have distinct evidence, have been to some extent due to regularly recurring 
        astronomical causes, whose effects were, however, profoundly modified, 
        or sometimes entirely neutralised, by terrestrial changes of surface acting 
        in conjunction with, or in opposition to them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. That the date of the glacial epoch may not 
        have been earlier than some portion of the latest period of great excentricity 
        (from 80,000 to 250,000 years back), and was probably due, in great part, 
        to its coincidence with one or more of the very important changes of physical 
        geography (the subsidence of the Sahara, of the Isthmus of Panama, and 
        the communication of the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic), which are known 
        to have occurred somewhere about the same time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have dwelt at so much length on one of the 
        important subjects first discussed in detail in the tenth edition of the 
        'Principles of Geology,' that we must pass over the new and valuable matter 
        in the eight interesting chapters on Etna and other volcanoes, and on 
        the general phenomena of earthquakes and of elevation and subsidence of 
        land, in order to give some account of what will always be considered 
        the great distinguishing feature of this edition,--the adoption in its 
        main outlines, if not in all its details, of Mr. Darwin's theory of the 
        Origin of Species.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all previous editions of his work Sir Charles 
        Lyell had strenuously opposed the theories of transmutation or development 
        put forth by Lamarck, or by the author of the 'Vestiges of Creation,' 
        and had endeavoured to show that they were unsupported by facts. True, 
        however, to his grand principle of explaining the former history of the 
        earth by a reference to the <font color="990000">[[p. 380]]</font> phenomena 
        of existing nature, he entered into an elaborate investigation of the 
        causes which now lead to the extinction of species, and showed that this 
        was a gradual process, for ever going on, and by no means necessarily 
        connected with cataclysms and convulsions of the surface. He also opposed 
        the hypothesis of a decline in the vital energy of species, put forward 
        by some philosophers to account for extinction, and maintained that such 
        causes as the influence of hostile species, the diminution of food, mutations 
        of climate, and changes of land and sea were amply sufficient to account 
        for it. Yet, while rejecting transmutation, he was equally opposed to 
        the popular theory that the creative power had diminished or been in abeyance 
        since man had come upon the earth. He showed the improbability that a 
        renovating force, which had been in full operation for millions of years, 
        should cease to act while the causes of extinction were still in full 
        activity, and were even intensified by the destroying power of Man and 
        his civilization; and he argued that the introduction of new species must 
        be a regular part of the system of nature, and that the reason why we 
        could not detect the mode of its action was that the rate of change was 
        of a slowness comparable with the changes of the inorganic world. He showed 
        that if one species were to die and one new one to appear annually upon 
        the globe, yet, taking into consideration the immense proportions of minute 
        organisms, the large surface of the oceans and of uninhabited lands, and 
        the very short time nature has been carefully observed, it was exceedingly 
        improbable that the introduction of any conspicuous animal should yet 
        have been detected. More than thirty years ago, therefore, Sir Charles 
        Lyell maintained the doctrine of 'continuity' in the organic as in the 
        inorganic world, and strenuously opposed the theory that whole floras 
        and faunas had died out together and been replaced by creative fiats; 
        but he at the same time denied that the process was yet discovered by 
        which new species of animals and plants were introduced. It was, therefore, 
        to be expected that, as soon as a naturalist appeared, who, following 
        out his own mode of research, deduced from an exhaustive study of the 
        changes which now occur in animals and plants how they may have changed 
        in past ages, and who was able to show clearly how the slight alterations 
        of form and structure continually occurring in organised beings might 
        be accumulated during long periods of time--just as he had himself shown 
        that the almost imperceptible changes of the earth's surface have been 
        accumulated--the new doctrines would be accepted as being in perfect harmony 
        with his own general views. At the same time it must be admitted that 
        it required no little moral courage to adopt such a course. For <font color="990000">[[p. 
        381]]</font> more than thirty years, and during the issue of nine editions 
        of his work, Sir Charles Lyell had been constantly quoted as the greatest 
        and most authoritative opponent of 'transmutation:' a doctrine which he 
        had, in fact, very strongly condemned. In his tenth edition he re-writes 
        the whole of this portion of his book, and gives in his adhesion to a 
        theory which to superficial readers will appear hardly distinguishable 
        from that which he had all his life so unmistakably opposed. The history 
        of science hardly presents so striking an instance of youthfulness of 
        mind in advanced life as is shown by this abandonment of opinions so long 
        held and so powerfully advocated; and if we bear in mind the extreme caution, 
        combined with the ardent love of truth, which characterise every work 
        which our author has produced, we shall be convinced that so great a change 
        was not decided on without long and anxious deliberation, and that the 
        views now adopted must indeed be supported by arguments of overwhelming 
        force. If for no other reason than that Sir Charles Lyell in his tenth 
        edition has adopted it, the theory of Mr. Darwin deserves an attentive 
        and respectful consideration from every earnest seeker after truth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement is often made that Darwin has only 
        revived the theory of Lamarck under a new name, and although the mere 
        fact, that so cautious and acute a thinker as Sir Charles Lyell sees in 
        them the wide difference between truth and error, is almost a sufficient 
        answer to this accusation, it may be as well to point out briefly in what 
        the difference consists. The theory of Lamarck was, that there were two 
        causes tending to effect changes in animal and vegetable forms,--the influence 
        of external conditions leading in animals to changes of habits, which 
        in time modify their form and structure, and the tendency to progressive 
        development. The first is a real cause, but one quite inadequate, as is 
        best seen in its application to plants; for although the constant running 
        of an antelope in endeavouring to escape from its enemies may be supposed 
        to increase the length of its legs and the rapidity of their motion, we 
        can see no such reason why one plant should acquire the power of climbing, 
        and another that of floating at the surface of the water, or why a herb 
        should acquire the woody trunk of a tree. Again, we have no shadow of 
        an explanation given us of the complicated adjustments of the parts of 
        organisms, of the stamens to the pistils of plants, of the teeth and claws 
        to the stomach of animals, of the colours of animals to the purposes of 
        concealment, of flowers to the insects that fertilise them. We are now 
        referred to the second cause of change--the tendency to progressive improvement. 
        But this is a purely imaginary one. Its <font color="990000">[[p. 382]]</font> 
        existence is not demonstrated; we are not told how or whence it arises, 
        or how it can act, nor are we able to form any clear conception of a power 
        capable of producing such a result as the progressive improvement of all 
        the varied forms of life, except through the intervention of a variety 
        of subsidiary laws and actions. Such a supposed <em>tendency</em> is as 
        vague and as useless as it would be to impute all life and all its forms 
        to the action of a 'vital principle,' or an 'organising fluid.' It is 
        evident, therefore, that Lamarck was unable to give any intelligible explanation 
        of nature.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, on the other hand, is at all events clear 
        and intelligible. He calls in the aid of no 'tendencies' or 'principles,' 
        which he does not clearly explain, and he supports every position by an 
        appeal to the facts of nature. More than this, he appeals to <em>all</em> 
        the facts, and applies his theory to the explanation of the most varied 
        and the most complicated phenomena; and he is ready to give up his whole 
        system if one fact can be found absolutely irreconcileable with it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Darwin's theory is based on a very few groups 
        of observed facts, and on one demonstrable principle. The first group 
        of facts is the <em>variability</em> of all organisms descended from the 
        same parents; a variability not confined to external form or colour, but 
        extending to every part of the structure, and even to constitutional and 
        mental characteristics. This variability is found to be one of the most 
        universal facts in nature. It is not common or general only, but absolutely 
        universal. Every one knows from his own experience that no two individuals 
        of a family, whether human or animal, are absolutely alike, but no one 
        knows the large amount, or the infinite phases of this variability, but 
        the naturalist or the breeder.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of universal and all pervading variability 
        being proved, it is next shown that every kind of variation can be accumulated, 
        by the simple process of choosing from a great number of individuals those 
        which possess any given variation in a marked degree, and breeding from 
        these. It is found that in the next generation, the offspring do not, 
        as might perhaps have been supposed, cease to vary further in the same 
        direction, but generally vary from their parents as a centre in every 
        direction, and if a large number of individuals are produced, a considerable 
        increase of the first variation may be obtained. For example, the wild 
        jungle cock (<em>Gallus bankiva</em>) has an average size about equal 
        to that of our smaller kinds of domestic poultry, and out of thousands 
        or millions of individuals none are ever so large as the 'Shanghae,' or 
        so small as the 'Bantam' breeds. Yet these are descended from the same 
        race, made permanently larger or <font color="990000">[[p. 383]]</font> 
        smaller by the process above described. In pigeons, the bill, the feet, 
        the wings, and the tail have been altered in size and form to an extent 
        nowhere seen in the original wild stock, and Mr. Darwin has shown that 
        the bones and internal organs are capable of modification to an equal 
        extent. The power of accumulating every kind of variation is therefore 
        proved, and this is the very corner-stone of the theory, and that which 
        best distinguishes it from all hypotheses of transmutation or development 
        that have preceded it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fact of importance is, that all living 
        things have the capacity of increasing in a geometrical ratio. If a pair 
        produce ten young ones once during their lives, and these breed at a year 
        old, there will be nearly 20 millions produced in ten years. Many animals, 
        and most plants, have far greater powers of increase than this, and even 
        the slowest breeding of all, the elephant, would in 500 years increase 
        from a single pair to 15 millions. But we know that in any country once 
        stocked with animals and plants, the number of individuals may fluctuate 
        slightly, but never regularly increases. Taking an average of all the 
        species, it certainly remains nearly stationary. It follows, therefore, 
        that the deaths every year are almost exactly equal to the births. If 
        the number of sparrows in England is on the average half a million, and 
        if a million young ones are hatched every year, then before the next year 
        a million sparrows must die. So in a forest of oaks, the number of trees 
        cannot increase on the same space of ground, yet millions of acorns are 
        dropped annually, and would all become oak-trees under favourable conditions, 
        but all must die before maturity till an oak falls and leaves room for 
        some of them. Now when, according to our supposition, a million sparrows 
        die every year, what is it that determines which individuals die and which 
        survive? We know that wild animals die of diseases, of hunger, of cold, 
        by the attacks of enemies, and perhaps from other causes. Will it be the 
        healthy or the sickly that will die of disease,--the strong or the weak 
        that will die of hunger,--the well feathered or the poorly feathered that 
        will die of cold,--the active and wary or the slow and careless that will 
        be killed by enemies? We can only answer these questions one way. We are 
        as sure of the average result, as we are that an Insurance Company, which 
        charged the ordinary rates to all people with consumption and heart-disease 
        would soon be bankrupt; and we may well express it by the term--'survival 
        of the fittest,'<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> a term which states the absolute fact, that 
        those <font color="990000">[[p. 384]]</font> best adapted to survive do 
        survive, and those least adapted die. This is Mr. Darwin's celebrated 
        theory of 'Natural Selection,' but which is more properly a self-evident 
        principle or axiom. Having been led to it by the analogy of the choosing 
        or selecting by man of certain varieties to continue the breed, while 
        others were neglected or destroyed, he personified the various natural 
        causes which led to the preservation of the half million, and the death 
        of the million, and termed them 'natural selection.' But people are continually 
        forgetting that the term is an analogical one, and object over and over 
        again that 'selection' implies a selecter; whereas if they would take 
        pains to understand the thing, instead of puzzling over the mere term, 
        they would see that the preservation of those best fitted to live, was 
        as much the secondary result of the powers of nature as is the arrangement 
        of sand and pebbles by water, or the selecting of leaves to be drifted 
        into heaps by the wind, while the stones and sticks are left behind.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully bearing in mind these great and demonstrable 
        facts--the universal variability of all organisms and of all their parts,--the 
        possibility of accumulating these variations in definite directions--the 
        enormous reproductive powers of all living things; and the mortality equal 
        to the births,--and lastly the necessary survival of the fittest--we shall 
        be able to see, that the changes in external nature animate and inanimate 
        continually going on, must produce indirect effects vastly greater and 
        more important than any which, as Lamarck supposed, they can produce by 
        their direct action on individuals or species.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take first the differences of colour in 
        animals. These are absolutely inexplicable on Lamarck's theory, for we 
        do not find that any change of conditions produces definite changes of 
        colour, still less does it produce the varied spots, lines, bands, and 
        patches of colour that occur in animals. Neither have the motions of animals, 
        their desires, or their food been proved to produce any definite effects 
        on their colours. But we know that colour is the most variable of all 
        an animal's characters, and yet in a state of nature colour as a rule 
        is very constant in each species. Mr. Darwin has shown, however, that 
        colour is often intimately associated with other constitutional peculiarities. 
        In Virginia the paint root (<em>Lachnanthes tinctoria</em>) is eaten by 
        pigs, and makes their hoofs drop off. But black pigs are uninjured by 
        it. Consequently, in places where this plant is abundant the farmers never 
        keep any but black pigs, as no others can be raised except in confinement. 
        Here we have a beautiful illustration of the mode of action of 'natural 
        selection.' The pigs of Virginia are not all born black any more than 
        in other countries, <font color="990000">[[p. 385]]</font> but those of 
        all other colours soon die, and therefore in a state of nature a black 
        race would be produced; and from the powerful action of the law of hereditary 
        descent there can be little doubt that in time the litters would consist 
        almost entirely of black pigs. If after this had happened it were first 
        discovered that white or brown pigs could not live in the district, we 
        should have a striking example of adaptation; but the adaptation would 
        evidently be an adjustment brought about by the simple law of 'natural 
        selection' or 'survival of the fittest,' and the rigid extermination of 
        all individuals not adapted to the surrounding conditions. It can be easily 
        seen that in this case 'natural selection' does not imply a personal selector, 
        since exactly the same result must happen whether the farmer kills off 
        the white pigs himself and turns the black ones loose, or turns out all 
        together.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case, although curious, is by no means isolated. 
        White terriers suffer most from distemper, and white chickens from the 
        gapes. In Sicily the <em>Hypericum crispum</em> is poisonous to white 
        sheep alone. White horses suffer severely from eating honey-dewed vetches, 
        while chestnuts and bays are uninjured. Purple plums in North America 
        are subject to a disease from which green and yellow plums are free. Again, 
        the white pigeons of a flock are the first to fall victims to the kite. 
        White rabbits of a very hardy kind have been turned loose but fail to 
        maintain themselves, and black fowls on the west coast of Ireland are 
        picked off by sea-eagles. Here we have the explanation of the otherwise 
        puzzling fact, that white quadrupeds and birds are so rare in nature, 
        although abundant among all domesticated animals; and the explanation 
        is all the more satisfactory because it accounts for the exception to 
        the rule, in the case of many arctic birds and quadrupeds as well as of 
        sea birds, for to these the white colour is a protection instead of a 
        danger. Now this same principle will apply to structural and constitutional 
        peculiarities and to habits. Man can accumulate variations either in the 
        root, the leaf, the flower, or the fruit of plants, their colour, odour, 
        or taste; in the size, swiftness, or scent of dogs; he can alter the bill, 
        the feet, the tail, or the habits of pigeons; can increase the milk of 
        the cow or the fat of the pig; can alter the length of ear in the rabbit 
        and of horns in the bull, or can attend to two or even more of these points 
        at once. In like manner the law of 'survival of the fittest,' by simply 
        determining which out of the immense surplus annually born shall be the 
        parents of the next generation, must lead to the modification of every 
        part of an animal's organization that affects its welfare,--that is to 
        say, sooner or later of its whole organization. So long as the changes 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 386]]</font> of land and sea of which geology 
        assures us, and their concomitant changes of climate, of soil, and of 
        vegetation, and of the distribution of animal forms, are going on, each 
        species in turn must be exposed to new conditions and new dangers, must 
        have to live upon new food, or to struggle with new enemies. Those whose 
        organization is sufficiently flexible to furnish in each generation favourable 
        variations, will become adapted to the new conditions and will appear 
        as the new or representative species of the naturalist; such as could 
        not vary quickly enough would die out, and furnish the extinct species 
        whose remains the pal&aelig;ontologist disentombs.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have at all events a real and a powerful 
        cause in action, and one which is accurately defined, and has been copiously 
        illustrated by observation and experiment. No occult powers are postulated, 
        but instead of them demonstrable groups of facts; and Mr. Darwin has developed 
        his theory so fully and has shown it to be in accordance with such a vast 
        mass and variety of phenomena which on any other hypothesis are unintelligible, 
        that it has commanded very general acceptance, especially among geologists 
        with whose general doctrines it so well harmonizes. Yet geology has furnished 
        perhaps the most formidable or at least the most often quoted objections 
        to it; but these objections are of a nature to weigh more with the public 
        than with men of science, since they depend in a great measure upon the 
        assumption that our knowledge of the past history of the earth is tolerably 
        complete. Mr. Darwin, however, lays great stress upon the extreme imperfection 
        of the geological record itself, and the very small portion of that record 
        which we have yet brought to light. This was fully established by Sir 
        Charles Lyell even in his first edition, but as the subject is an important 
        one and very commonly misunderstood, it will be as well to give a short 
        sketch of it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first consideration is, that as the ocean 
        covers by far the larger portion of the globe, and has, as long as our 
        continents have retained their present outlines, received much of their 
        preservable organic remains, we are at once precluded from ever obtaining 
        a sight of a large portion of the record. On the land itself we only get 
        a glimpse of its interior here and there: in valleys, in railway cuttings, 
        or in quarries, mines, and wells, and only in a few of the more civilised 
        parts of the globe. But even in the places where we have access to the 
        strata formed at any former period of the earth's history, we know that 
        those strata will not contain anything like a consecutive record of the 
        animals and vegetables that lived in its vicinity. As long as the surface 
        at that spot was dry land, few or no organisms could <font color="990000">[[p. 
        387]]</font> be preserved, except at the mouth of some large river which 
        might carry down their remains and cover them with sediment. But when 
        the strata thus formed came to be raised up again above the waters, they 
        would be exposed to the action of the waves and in most cases be eaten 
        away and redistributed on the sea-bottom. Only when a long-continued subsidence 
        had allowed strata of great thickness to be formed, and when the subsequent 
        elevation was so rapid or the situation was so favourable that they could 
        resist the denuding action of the sea, would fossiliferous strata ever 
        rise above the surface. We might, therefore, anticipate, that between 
        the formation of any given beds and others of different composition lying 
        upon them, there would often elapse vast and unknown intervals of time, 
        allowing for a complete change in animal and vegetable life; and this 
        is exactly what geologists find. In the infancy of the science it was 
        supposed that this indicated a catastrophe by which hundreds of species 
        were destroyed, and a sudden creation of hundreds of new ones. Now it 
        is universally admitted to prove only a vast lapse of time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even under the most favourable conditions 
        different groups of animals will be very unequally preserved. Shelly molluscs 
        will, perhaps, be abundant; corals sometimes equally so; crustacea and 
        fishes, being easily decomposed, more rare; terrestrial reptiles and mammals 
        still scarcer; and flying birds and insects the scarcest of all. All soft 
        creatures, naked molluscs, zoophytes, medus&aelig;, and the more delicate 
        insects, will never be preserved at all. Bearing these various facts in 
        mind, how rash it must be to conclude that because we do not find the 
        remains of any group of animals in certain strata, those animals nowhere 
        existed on the globe at that time! It seems almost too absurd to hold 
        any such opinion; yet this is really the essence of the most common argument 
        against Mr. Darwin's views. 'Where,' it is said, 'are the intermediate 
        forms connecting distinct groups of animals which must have existed if 
        your theory is true?' The sufficient answer to this objection is, that 
        the chances against any particular intermediate type being found are so 
        nearly infinite, that we need not expect to find it; but that numerous 
        intermediate types have been discovered, and their number steadily increases 
        with the process of geological investigation. Professor Owen has repeatedly 
        declared that one of the chief characteristics of extinct animals is to 
        be more generalised in structure than existing species, and this is exactly 
        what we should expect if the one has descended and diverged from the other. 
        Cuvier considered the ruminants and the pachyderms as two most distinct 
        orders of mammals; but Owen and <font color="990000">[[p. 388]]</font> 
        others have now demonstrated that there once existed a variety of genera 
        and species connecting, by almost imperceptible grades, such widely different 
        animals as the pig and the camel. Scarcely a more isolated group than 
        the genus <em>Equus</em> (comprising, the horses, asses, and zebras) can 
        be found among living quadrupeds; but through the intermediation of three 
        fossil genera it is connected by a regular series of forms to the Eocene 
        <em>Pal&aelig;otherium</em>, itself allied to the existing tapir and rhinoceros. 
        The recent researches of M. Gaudry in the Miocene strata of Greece have 
        furnished much new evidence in the same direction. He has discovered the 
        group of the <em>Simocyonid&aelig;</em>, intermediate between bears and 
        wolves; the genus <em>Hy&aelig;nictis</em>, which connects the hy&aelig;nas 
        with the civets; the <em>Ancylotherium</em>, which is allied both to the 
        extinct mastodon and to the living pangolin or scaly ant-eater; and the 
        <em>Helladotherium</em>, which connects the giraffes with the deer and 
        antelopes. Between reptiles and fishes an intermediate type has been found 
        in the <em>Archegosaurus</em> of the coal formation, and the Triassic 
        <em>Labyrinthodon</em> combined characters of the Batrachian with those 
        of crocodiles, lizards, and ganoid fishes. Even the birds, the most wonderfully-isolated 
        of all existing orders of animals and the most rarely preserved in a fossil 
        state, yet furnish evidence of a former connection with reptiles. The 
        Oolitic <em>Arch&aelig;opteryx</em>, in its long tail and some other characters, 
        approaches the reptiles much more nearly than does any existing bird; 
        and the <em>Compsognathus</em>, an extraordinary reptile from the same 
        formation and allied to the Dinosaurians, according to Professor Huxley 
        approaches birds even more than the <em>Arch&aelig;opteryx</em> does reptiles. 
        Now, in the face of these undoubted facts (and hundreds less conspicuous 
        but equally important are known to pal&aelig;ontologists), it cannot fairly 
        be maintained that the absence of intermediate types is a valid objection 
        to Mr. Darwin's views.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now another objection is raised. It is said 
        that in strata where a group of animals first appears we often find a 
        great abundance of distinct species and very highly organized types, such 
        as the abundance of Lower Silurian trilobites and cephalopods, of Devonian 
        fishes, of Carboniferous ferns and conifer&aelig;, of Liassic reptiles, 
        and of Eocene mammals. 'Why,' it is asked, 'do we not find traces of the 
        slow growth and development of these groups through successive formations, 
        instead of finding them, as it were, bursting at once into vigorous life?' 
        This is, no doubt, a serious objection, as long as we consider the change 
        from one formation to another to have been effected by catastrophes and 
        convulsions rather than by slow changes during vast periods of time. But 
        a full appreciation of the imperfection of <font color="990000">[[p. 389]]</font> 
        the geological record, and of the almost unimaginable succession of years 
        that may have intervened between the Eocene and the Cretaceous or between 
        the Devonian and Silurian formations, will enable us to understand how 
        an important group like the fishes or the reptiles may for ages have existed 
        on the earth while their fossil remains were either not preserved or have 
        not yet been discovered by us, and then seem to appear at once in a state 
        of high development. Sir Charles Lyell furnishes us with an excellent 
        illustration of the inconclusiveness of all such reasoning by giving a 
        table<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> showing the dates at which the different groups of Vertebrata 
        were discovered in successively earlier formations. For twenty years the 
        <em>Pal&aelig;otherium</em> and other Eocene mammalia were held to have 
        been the first warm-blooded Vertebrates that appeared upon the globe, 
        and their variety and high organization were such as entirely to oppose 
        all ideas of their development from lower forms. But in 1818 the Stonesfield 
        mammals were discovered far back in the Lower Oolite, and in 1847 in the 
        Upper Trias, nearly at the commencement of the secondary formations. Birds 
        were not found in the Lower Eocene till 1839. Nineteen years later they 
        were discovered in the Upper Greensand, and so recently as 1863 in the 
        Oolite. Reptiles are nowhere abundant below the Lias, but a single specimen 
        had proved their existence in the Permian formation so long back as the 
        year 1710. In 1844, however, they were found in the coal formation, and 
        there show evident signs of an earlier and more generalised organization. 
        Fishes have steadily advanced in age with increasing research. Before 
        1793 they were not known to be older than the Permian age, but in that 
        year they were detected in the Mountain Limestone; in 1828 in the Devonian; 
        in 1840 in the Upper Ludlow beds; and in 1859 in the Lower Ludlow beds 
        of the Upper Silurian formation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These facts all point to the imperfection of 
        our knowledge, and should teach us that the absence of a group of animals 
        or plants can never be inferred from the fact of our not having yet found 
        any of its remains. Quite recently the <em>Eozoon Canadense</em> has been 
        discovered in the lowest of all known strata, far below what have always 
        been considered as the Primary and Azoic beds of European geologists; 
        and only last year an endogenous land plant, the <em>Eophyton</em>, was 
        discovered in the Cambrian strata of Sweden, proving the existence of 
        land vegetation of a highly-organized type at that early epoch.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this mass of evidence, all tending in one 
        direction, we <font color="990000">[[p. 390]]</font> can scarcely deny 
        the fairness of Mr. Darwin's assumption that not only is the geological 
        record imperfect, but we only have fragments of the last volume of it: 
        an unknown series of preceding volumes having been lost or destroyed. 
        In other words, he believes that before the Cambrian and Laurentian rocks 
        were deposited there was life upon the globe; and we know that a number 
        of formations which may have contained the relics of that life must have 
        been ground down to form those early stratified rocks, while others, equally 
        ancient, have probably been so metamorphosed by heat as to have lost all 
        trace of their original structure. It is certain that, if the world has 
        been in existence long enough, and denudation, upheaval, and subsidence 
        have always gone on, the earlier formations must have been so lost; and 
        if we find a convergence backward of all forms of life towards simpler 
        and more generalised types, and if we lose, one after another, the higher 
        and more specialised groups (as we certainly do), then we have a right 
        to claim a sufficiency of past time, wherein to lose successively all 
        but the very lowest forms of life, and to follow out our converging lines 
        of existence till they meet in the same remote point. For this the known 
        formations will not suffice; and Mr. Darwin claims, as a reasonable assumption, 
        an earlier series, which have left no recognisable proofs of their existence, 
        but which, nevertheless, modern geologists are not disposed to deny him.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who accept the doctrine of the development 
        of all organisms from pre-existing species by variation and survival of 
        the fittest, the group of insects offers some most suggestive illustrations 
        of the extreme remoteness of the origin of life upon our globe. Taking 
        into consideration their strange metamorphoses, the isolation of the various 
        groups, their complex and highly specialised structure, and their wonderfully 
        diversified forms, no class of animals more impresses us with the immensity 
        of the time required for their development. Yet when we go back as far 
        as the period of the Lias, we find a number of the most highly-organized 
        groups,--as Elaterid&aelig; and Carabid&aelig; among the beetles, Gryllid&aelig; 
        among the Orthoptera, and Dragon-flies among the Neuroptera, already in 
        existence. Still more extraordinary, in the remote carboniferous epoch, 
        the insects that haunted the fern-groves and Sigillaria swamps were still 
        of forms that can in some cases be classed in existing families, such 
        as cockroaches, crickets, white ants, and such extremely specialised forms 
        of beetles as Curculionid&aelig; and Scarab&aelig;id&aelig;! If the development 
        theory be true, these facts compel us to the conclusion that the ages 
        since the carboniferous formation, vast though they are, can <font color="990000">[[p. 
        391]]</font> only be a small fraction of the whole period during which 
        these complicated forms have been slowly evolved from the simpler Annulosa.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adopting the views of Mr. Darwin, Sir Charles 
        Lyell carries them out to their legitimate results, and does not shrink 
        from the logical necessity, of the derivation of man from the lower animals; 
        and he has written a very interesting chapter on the 'Origin and Distribution 
        of Man.' Into this subject, however, we cannot now enter, except to remark 
        briefly on some aspects of the question which all who have hitherto written 
        upon it seem to have neglected.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would certainly appear in the highest degree 
        improbable, that the whole animal kingdom from the lowest zoophytes up 
        to the horse, the dog, and the ape, should have been developed by the 
        simple action of natural laws, and that the animal man, so absolutely 
        identical with them in all the main features and many of the details of 
        his organization, should have been formed in some quite other unknown 
        way. But if the researches of geologists and the investigations of anatomists 
        should ever demonstrate that he was derived from the lower animals in 
        the same way that they have been derived from each other, we shall not 
        be thereby debarred from believing, or from proving, that his intellectual 
        capacities and his moral nature were not wholly developed by the same 
        process. Neither natural selection nor the more general theory of evolution 
        can give any account whatever of the origin of sensational or conscious 
        life. They may teach us how, by chemical, electrical, or higher natural 
        laws, the organized body can be built up, can grow, can reproduce its 
        like; but those laws and that growth cannot even be conceived as endowing 
        the newly-arranged atoms with consciousness. But the moral and higher 
        intellectual nature of man is as unique a phenomenon as was conscious 
        life on its first appearance in the world, and the one is almost as difficult 
        to conceive as originating by any law of evolution as the other. We may 
        even go further, and maintain that there are certain purely physical characteristics 
        of the human race which are not explicable on the theory of variation 
        and survival of the fittest. The brain, the organs of speech, the hand, 
        and the external form of man, offer some special difficulties in this 
        respect, to which we will briefly direct attention.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brain of the lowest savages, and, as far 
        as we yet know, of the pre-historic races, we have an organ so little 
        inferior in size and complexity to that of the highest types (such as 
        the average European), that we must believe it capable, under a similar 
        process of gradual development during the space of two or three thousand 
        years, of producing equal average results. But the mental requirements 
        of the lowest savages, such as the <font color="990000">[[p. 392]]</font> 
        Australians or the Andaman islanders, are very little above those of many 
        animals. The higher moral faculties and those of pure intellect and refined 
        emotion are useless to them, are rarely if ever manifested, and have no 
        relation to their wants, desires, or well-being. How, then, was an organ 
        developed so far beyond the needs of its possessor? Natural selection 
        could only have endowed the savage with a brain a little superior to that 
        of an ape, whereas he actually possesses one but very little inferior 
        to that of the average members of our learned societies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, what a wonderful organ is the hand of 
        man;<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> of what marvels of delicacy is it capable, and how greatly 
        it assists in his education and mental development! The whole circle of 
        the arts and sciences are ultimately dependent on our possession of this 
        organ, without which we could hardly have become truly human. This hand 
        is equally perfect in the lowest savage, but he has no need for so fine 
        an instrument, and can no more fully utilise it than he could use without 
        instruction a complete set of joiner's tools. But, stranger still, this 
        marvellous instrument was foreshadowed and prepared in the Quadrumana; 
        and any person, who will watch how one of these animals uses its hands, 
        will at once perceive that it possesses an organ far beyond its needs. 
        The separate fingers and the thumb are never fully utilised, and objects 
        are grasped so clumsily, as to show that a much less specialised organ 
        of prehension would have served its purpose quite as well; and if this 
        be so, it could never have been produced through the agency of natural 
        selection alone.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have further to ask--How did man acquire his 
        erect posture, his delicate yet expressive features, the marvellous beauty 
        and symmetry of his whole external form;--a form which stands alone, in 
        many respects more distinct from that of all the higher animals than they 
        are from each other? Those who have lived much among savages know that 
        even the lowest races of mankind, if healthy and well fed, exhibit the 
        human form in its complete symmetry and perfection. They all have the 
        soft smooth skin absolutely free from any hairy covering on the dorsal 
        line, where all other mammalia from the Marsupials up to the Anthropoid 
        apes have it most densely and strongly developed. What use can we conceive 
        to have been derived from this exquisite beauty and symmetry and this 
        smooth bare skin, both so very widely removed from his nearest allies? 
        And if these modifications were of no physical use to him--or if, as appears 
        almost certain in the case of the naked skin, they were at first a positive 
        disadvantage--we know that they could not have been produced by natural 
        selection. Yet we can well understand that <font color="990000">[[p. 393]]</font> 
        both these characters were essential to the proper development of the 
        perfect human being. The supreme beauty of our form and countenance has 
        probably been the source of all our &aelig;sthetic ideas and emotions, 
        which could hardly have arisen had we retained the shape and features 
        of an erect gorilla; and our naked skin, necessitating the use of clothing, 
        has at once stimulated our intellect, and by developing the feeling of 
        personal modesty may have profoundly affected our moral nature.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same line of argument may be used in connexion 
        with the structural and mental organs of human speech, since that faculty 
        can hardly have been physically useful to the lowest class of savages; 
        and if not, the delicate arrangements of nerves and muscles for its production 
        could not have been developed and co-ordinated by natural selection. This 
        view is supported by the fact that, among the lowest savages with the 
        least copious vocabularies, the capacity of uttering a variety of distinct 
        articulate sounds, and of applying to them an almost infinite amount of 
        modulation and inflection, is not in any way inferior to that of the higher 
        races. An instrument has been developed in advance of the needs of its 
        possessor.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subject is a vast one, and would require 
        volumes for its proper elucidation, but enough, we think, has now been 
        said, to indicate the possibility of a new stand-point for those who cannot 
        accept the theory of evolution as expressing the whole truth in regard 
        to the origin of man. While admitting to the full extent the agency of 
        the same great laws of organic development in the origin of the human 
        race as in the origin of all organized beings, there yet seems to be evidence 
        of a Power which has guided the action of those laws in definite directions 
        and for special ends. And so far from this view being out of harmony with 
        the teachings of science, it has a striking analogy with what is now taking 
        place in the world, and is thus strictly uniformitarian in character. 
        Man himself guides and modifies nature for special ends. The laws of evolution 
        alone would perhaps never have produced a grain so well adapted to his 
        uses as wheat; such fruits as the seedless banana, and the bread-fruit; 
        such animals as the Guernsey milch-cow, or the London dray-horse. Yet 
        these so closely resemble the unaided productions of nature, that we may 
        well imagine a being who had mastered the laws of development of organic 
        forms through past ages, refusing to believe that any new power had been 
        concerned in their production, and scornfully rejecting the theory that 
        in these few cases a distinct intelligence had directed the action of 
        the laws of variation, multiplication, and survival, for his own purposes. 
        We know, however, that <font color="990000">[[p. 394]]</font> this has 
        been done; and we must therefore admit the possibility, that in the development 
        of the human race, a Higher Intelligence has guided the same laws for 
        nobler ends.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such, we believe, is the direction in which we 
        shall find the true reconciliation of Science with Theology on this most 
        momentous problem. Let us fearlessly admit that the mind of man (itself 
        the living proof of a supreme mind) is able to trace, and to a considerable 
        extent has traced, the laws by means of which the organic no less than 
        the inorganic world has been developed. But let us not shut our eyes to 
        the evidence that an Overruling Intelligence has watched over the action 
        of those laws, so directing variations and so determining their accumulation, 
        as finally to produce an organization sufficiently perfect to admit of, 
        and even to aid in, the indefinite advancement of our mental and moral 
        nature.</p>

        'Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory,' in which that author maintains 
        that the ice-preserved rhinoceros and mammoth of Siberia inhabited that 
        country at a time when the climate was very little different from what 
        it is now. After showing the untenability of every other hypothesis, Playfair 
        thus sums up:--'On the whole, therefore, no conclusion remains but that 
        these bones have belonged to species of elephants, rhinoceros, &amp;c., 
        which inhabited the very countries where they are now buried, and which 
        could endure the severity of the Siberian climate. The rhinoceros of the 
        Wilui certainly lived on the confines of the Polar circle, and was exposed 
        to the same cold when alive, by which, when dead, its body has been so 
        long and so curiously preserved.' --(Playfair's Works, vol. i. p. 464.)

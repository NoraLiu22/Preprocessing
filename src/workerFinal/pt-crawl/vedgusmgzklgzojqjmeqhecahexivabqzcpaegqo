    the present day no one believes the existence of the strange inhabitants of 
    the region of the Baikal Lake that we see in this image, taken from the medieval 
    "Book of Wonders". So nobody should take as absolutely creditable the cartographic 
    evidence of the ancient navigation maps dated before 16th century. Maps that 
    were written up before the discovery of a precise way to calculate the longitude. 
    Discovery that happened in the 17th century. The geographic maps designed 
    until that period were based on symbolic systems of representation such as 
    Jerusalem as the center of the world, inverted north/south orientation, or 
    different scales for different nations and so on. In many cases these maps 
    were not drawn on the basis of direct evidence but were copied and modified 
    from other maps, and were often adapted to suit the needs of nations like 
    Spain and Portugal, in dispute for the dominion of recently discovered lands. 
    Added to this fact, it was believed until 1507, that those lands, visited 
    for the first time by Columbus and then Vespucci, were part of Asia and not 
    a new continent. Furthermore many maps joined parts of the known Far East 
    with parts of newly explored lands, and then often added southern mythical 
    "incognito lands". These additions were made in order to refer to the </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="javascript:void(null)" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Austral.jpg','','width=366,height=500')"> 
    ideas of the ancient Greek</a> philosophers (rediscovered in the Renaissance).<br>
    In the same maps we can often see other mythical places like the "Reign of 
    Priest John", the island of <http://www.antiquemaps.co.uk/book/chapter10.html>Brazil, 
    the Garden of Eden, the Tower of Babel or the Island of Saint Brendan.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But if you try and 
    search the Internet using &quot;<a href="http://www.google.it/search?q=Piri%2BReis%2Bmap&hl=it&btnG=Cerca%2Bcon%2BGoogle&lr=" target="_blank">Piri 
    Reis map</a>&quot; as keywords, you will surely come across many web sites 
    dedicated to "mysteries", which allege that this map, dated "Year 919 in Muslim 
    Calendar" (A.D. 1513 in our calendar), contains a precise representation of 
    the coasts of Antarctica, a continent unknown at that time. The same happens 
    for other famous maps, such as the one drawn by <a href="Finaeus.htm" target="_blank">Orontius 
    Finaeus</a> in 1531 and the one by <a href="Buache.htm" target="_blank">Philippe 
    Buache</a>, , dated 1739. According to Charles Hapgood, author of "Maps of 
    the Ancient Sea Kings: Evidence of Advanced Civilization in the Ice Age", 
    those map contain a precise representation of Antarctica as it was before 
    last ice age. The same idea was advanced by Von Daniken in "Chariots of Gods" 
    and by Flavio Barberio in &quot;<a href="Atlantide.htm" target="_blank"><i>Una 
    civilt&agrave; sotto ghiaccio</i></a>&quot;,</font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
    but the most famous book among the ones which made this theory so popular, 
    is Graham Hancock's archeological fiction "Fingerprints of the Gods".</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to many 
    mystery enthusiasts, these maps were either based on ancient representations, 
    perhaps dating as far back as the mythical Atlantis, or were drawn from pictures 
    taken from the sky, by satellites, aircrafts or spaceships. That because the 
    knowledge available as of 16th century cannot explain such stunning correspondence 
    with reality.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Both Hapgood and 
    Hancock claim that the representation of the Antarctic continent is incredibly 
    precise. And since it clearly indicates rivers, lakes and mountains, this 
    ancient cartographic model could date as back as 15,000 years ago. They also 
    suggest that the map was drawn basing on surveys, which must have been taken 
    from a satellite in a geostationary orbit over... Egypt. The usual, recurring 
    Egypt of mysteries.</font></p>

    try a much simpler explaination.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What 
    is known today as the map of the Turkish admiral Piri Reis is actually just
       a fragment of the original, much larger map, which represented the whole
      known 
    world. This surviving portion represents Atlantic Ocean, western coasts of
       Europe and Africa, and eastern coasts of America. It is dated "Muslim
       Year  919", which corresponds to our A.D. 1513 (but the map was presented
       to the  Sultan in 1517). According to its author, the map was compiled
       from "twenty 
    older charts and eight planispheres". It is very likely that Reis also examined
     the journey accounts written by early explorers of New World, expecially
    Portuguese, 
    as they are often mentioned within notes on the map. The <a href="http://turkeyinmaps.com/piri.html" target="_blank">notes</a> 
    have been transcribed by Turkish scholar Bay Hasan Fehmi and published by
    Yusuf Akcura, President of the Society for Turkish Historical Research, in
    1935
    in his
    work &#147;<i>Piri
    Reis Haritasi</i>&#148;, 
    and then re-published by Ayse Afetinan in <a href="http://www.prep.mcneese.edu/engr/engr321/preis/afet/afet0.htm" target="_blank">&quot;The
     oldest map of America&quot;</a> in 1954. It is worth nothing that, although
      this and other maps abound with clear and perfectly readable text and captions,
     
    the authors who present them as proof of their extravagant theses quote nothing
      but few lines. The only region of South America to look sufficiently detailed
     
    on the map is the coast of Brazil, although River of Amazones is drawn twice,
      in different locations. Other areas such as Caribbean islands, though already
     
    explored at that time, are roughly charted, with evident errors in both position
      and orientation.</font></p>

      that he consulted the charts of Cristopher Columbus. </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The
      peculiar (and wrong) configuration of the Caribbean area in his map seem
      to confirm that statement. That region of the American continent is indeed
      improperly represented: it features a large island arranged north-south,
      which cannot easily be identified with Cuba, not even by rotating the whole
  map counterclockwise by 90 degrees.</font></p>

      existed, except in tales about lives of the Saints). The map of Piri Reis

      who first realized he was not coasting Asia but a new continent, the name 
      "America" was only being used to denote what is now known as South America. 
      It was still believed that the newly discovered lands north of Caribbean 
      Sea were part of Asia, and that Japan (Cipango) was just west of Cuba, as

      been compiled from both older charts and new third-hand knowledge, represents 
      an extremely imprecise description of lands that lie across the Atlantic 
      Ocean. Even maps dating back to the first years of 1500 (<font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ren/Ren1/305.html" target="_blank">Juan

  <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The only part of 
    the map that Piri Reis probably copied from a quite accurate source is the

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But what mystery 
    lovers are most enthusiastic about is the bottom edge of the map, which is 
    said to represent Antarctica. Some claim that Land of Queen Maud and other 
    features of Antarctica are clearly recognizable on the map, even though that 
    continent was not explored but many centuries later. Unfortunatley these people, 
    including Hancock, claim the above hypothesis without making any cartographic 
    comparison or first-hand check: they just accept Charles Hapgood's statements 
    as true. Hancock in particular does not mention any book about history of 
    cartography within the notes of the first two chapters of his book "Fingerprints 
    of the Gods" (the very chapters about geographic charts). He just quotes Hapgood's 
    work, thus clearly showing that he didn't even make an attempt to learn on 
    the subject.<br>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> . Moreover, if the 
    map of Piri Reis is so accurate and if the land depicted at the bottom edge 
    of it is really Anctartica, one may ask why none of those authors explains 
    what has become of the missing 1200 miles of coast from Brazil to Tierra del 
    Fuego (the whole length of Argentina), and why this odd Antarctica protrudes 
    from Brazil instead of laying 2500 miles south of it.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One just needs to 
    examine that part of the map carefully to realize, even without being an expert 
    cartographer, that it represents nothing more than the extremity of the south-american 
    continent, an approximate representation made possibile by means available 
    at that time. The drawing is deformed, slanted to the right, possibly to conform 
    to the peculiar shape of the piece of parchment. It is also worth mentioning 
    that cartographic maps were used as political tools as well. Placing some 
    land on either side of the meridian dubbed "la Raya" ­ which was agreed upon 
    as a demarcation between Spanish and Portuguese zones of influence ­ could 
    serve as an excuse for the corresponding power to claim rights of possession. 
    Piri Reis often mentions Portuguese maps in his notes, and of course Portuguese 
    would have preferred the coast south of Brazil to bend sharply to the right 
    towards Africa. That would have placed the coast within the 180 degrees assigned 
    to their jurisdiction by <b>Treaty of Tordesillas</b> in 1494.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We must also not 
    forget that pratical methods of calculating the longitude were invented only 
    a century later. Earlier maps thus contained a great degree of approximation, 
    and different drawing "styles" were employed according to the purpose of the 
    chart</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In order to identify 
    the places depicted on the bottom part of Piri Reis's map, we can try and 
    rotate a map of South America counterclockwise by 90 degrees. We must keep 
    in mind, though, that no precise measuring instruments were available at that 
    time. Thus, cartographers would draw their maps of newly discovered coasts 
    basing on early journey accounts, which talked generically about capes, islands, 
    river mouths, gulfs, and so on. Charts would therefore contain pieces of information 
    and of geographical data not correctly calculated, nor in correct relationship 
    among each other.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We can nonetheless 
    recognise, albeit deformed, some features such as Gulf of San Matias and Peninsula 
    Valdes, while the extremity could be Tierra del Fuego. We could maybe even 
    identify the mouth of Strait of Magellan, with its peculiar small gulf.. If 
    we now look carefully at the bottom-right edge, which is supposed to represent 
    Anctartica, we can see a small picture of a snake. A corresponding note by 
    Piri Reis reads: "This land is uninhabited. Everything is in ruin (barren?) 
    and it is said that large snakes are found here. For this reason the Portuguese 
    infidels did not land on these shores and these are also said to be very hot." 
    Clearly such a description does not fit Antarctica at all.</font></p>

    "il de Sare". Among those islands is written "Buadalar issizdir, ama bahar 
    coktur", that is "Those islands are deserted but spring here lasts long". 
    It could be a primitive representation of Falkland/Malvinas islands (the larger 
    of which is called Soledad). It may seem quite odd, as the small archipelago 
    was "officially" discovered in 1592. But a group of islands in the same location 
    can be seen on the Circolus Antarticus chart by Pedro Reinel, dated 1522 (Istambul,

    coasting the south-eastern end of America during the first decade of 1500 
    actually sighted an archipelago, and reported the sighting back home. Such

    parallel, even before 1513. The strait was later named after Magellan, who 
    in 1520 realized it was not a mere gulf but a way between Atlantic and Pacific 
    oceans. Magellan then succeeded in crossing the strait among many difficulties, 
    and finally reached Philippines.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At that time, the 
    land south of the strait was thought to represent the northern edge of that 
    large continent which, according to tolemaic tradition, must have existed 
    in the southern emisphere to balance the quantity of emerged lands in the 
    northern one. Furthermore, many charts and planispheres of that period read 
    "Terra Australis Incognita" (Unknown Austral Land) on the land south of the 
    strait of Magellan.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The southern end 
    of <b>Tierra del Fuego</b> - thus named because of the villages' bonfires 
    Magellan saw while sailing across the strait - is Cape Horn, swept by winds 
    and stormy, which was circumnavigated only in 1615. That too did not happen 
    for the sake of knowledge but for mere economical reasons. Indeed, two Dutches, 
    Cornelius Shouten and Jacob Lemaire, intended to reach Indonesian seas avoiding 
    all known routes (strait of Magellan, Cape of Good Hope), as Company of Indies 
    had denied them the permission to follow those routes. They succedeed in their 
    feat, but once they reached Java they were arrested by Dutch authorities, 
    which disbelieved their discovery of a new route. Tierra del Fuego was in 
    fact commonly thought to be a peninsula linked to "Terra Australis".</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It could just be 
    a coincidence, but one cannot but notice the presence, in both charts, of 
    the two basins forming the mouth of Strait of Magellan, and of another large 
    bay farther south. Could the mistery of Piri Reis' map be just that? Did Piri 
    Reis employ the journey accounts of the Portuguese sailors who reached Tierra 
    del Fuego before Magellan? Magellan set out in 1519 and it looks like he already 
    knew about some strait or bay as "he saw it, in the Treasury of the King of 
    Portugal, on a map drawn by Martin de Bohemia" (Martin Behaim), as the journey's 
    chronicler Antonio Pigafetta tells us. Or, on the contrary, can we speculate 
    that the lower extremity of the map was added later, after the journey of 
    1519? We indeed know that the chart of Pedro Reinel, kept in the same Library 
    of Topkapi, was probably retouched after the discovery of the Strait of Magellan </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But the more probable
      hypothesis remains that, drawing the extremity of the South American continent,
      Piri Reis would
    have been based on the more diffuse geographic theories in the first
    decades of the ' 500. According to many geographers of the age the
    more southern
    part of the South America would have been joined to the mythical
    Terra Australis Incognita. The map of Lopo Homem (1519) can allow us to reconstruct
    the aspect of the complete map of Piri Reis:</font></p>

  <p align="left">In this map, from the famous <em><strong><a href="http://www.finns-books.com/miller.htm" target="_blank"> Atlas Miller</a></strong></em>, we see that the still unexplored extremity of the
    South American continent fold towards east, going to form the mythical austral
    continent that, touching the indonesian archipelago, continues without a break until the extremity of Asia.</p>

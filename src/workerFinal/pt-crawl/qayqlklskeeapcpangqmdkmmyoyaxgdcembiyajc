      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">There are many factors 
        that go into making and keeping a reptile healthy. Internally, they must 
        be healthy, with all systems functioning properly. While they may not 
        be completely parasite- or infection-free, a healthy animal's immune system 
        functions strongly and easily keeps the colonies of parasites, bacteria, 
        or fungi under control so that they do not reproduce to such an extent 
        as to interfere with the normal functioning of the body. The skin of a 
        healthy animal looks right for its species. For most reptiles, this means 
        well rounded and filled out, with few or any the lateral folds associated 
        with dehydration. The color is full and clear. A healthy animal behaves 
        normally for the species, alert to its surroundings, thermoregulating 
        during the course of the day, eating, drinking, and defecating on a regular 
        basis based on normal circadian rhythms and digestive cycles. Shedding 
        is regular, occurring every 4-6 weeks or so, sometimes more often for 
        younger animals during the peak growing seasons during the year, more 
        slowly during any annual slow period (for example, the period of most 
        rapid growth for most reptiles occurs in the spring/summer, with slowdowns 
        usually occurring in the winter. For many reptiles, these periods relate 
        to periods of greater and lesser food abundance in the wild, as well as 
        to pre- and post-breeding seasons when the animals would typically feed 
        heavily.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">What goes into making 
        a healthy reptile? Just buying one isn't enough. (Just thinking you can 
        buy one a problem: most reptiles sold in the pet trade and at too many 
        expos and swaps are anything </font><em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">but</font></em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2"> 
        healthy...). The many factors that must be dealt with include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Enclosure of the proper 
            size </font><em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">and</font></em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2"> 
            orientation (vertical height for arboreals; width and depth to enable 
            proper thermoregulation, wide-ranging species, and multiple inhabitants).</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Sufficient humidity.</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Water offered in a manner 
          that can be utilized by the reptile.</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Suitable and safe substrate 
          (depth, type).</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Furnishings (logs, rocks, 
          hide boxes, according to species needs).</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Proper heating </font><em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">and</font></em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2"> 
          thermal gradients.</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Proper lighting (day/night 
          cycles, UVA/B when required).</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Healthy food appropriate 
          for the species, of the size that is appropriate for the individual.</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Proper cleaning and 
          disinfecting of enclosure, substrate, and furnishings.</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Regular monitoring of 
          enclosure and equipment to ensure proper maintenance.</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Regular monitoring of 
          the reptiles to detect early signs of stress or ill health.</font> 
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Access as needed to 
          an experienced reptile veterinarian for initial examination of new reptiles 
          and exams and treatment as needed as problems arise.</font> 
          <p></p>
      </ul>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Reading over this list 
        it becomes apparent that unless one knows what the species' requirements 
        are for the animals one has, one is going to have some problem meeting 
        some or most of these requirements. If you don't know what a reptile needs 
        to be maintained properly in captivity, it is going to be difficult to 
        ensure you are providing a proper environment for it. If you don't know 
        how a species should behave, you may miss the early signs of stress or 
        illness, and thus not realize that something is wrong until the animal 
        is very ill.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Even very small things 
        that are wrong or just slightly off can, over time, lead to big health 
        problems. Stress onset can be sudden and acute (an earthquake topples 
        an enclosure; the owner moves or gives the animal away; the power goes 
        out for three days; a new cage mate is introduced; the new family dog 
        spends its time slavering in front of the enclosure; etc.) or it can be 
        slow and insidious (reptile not drinking enough because the water bowl 
        is too difficult to access; the crickets fed are just a little too large; 
        there is no day/night cycle of temperatures in the enclosure; temperature 
        gradients are not broad enough; temperatures are too hot or too cool; 
        insufficient or improper hiding places provided; domineering cagemates; 
        etc.). Sudden onsets bring about immediate and dramatic changes in color 
        and behavior that even the only moderately observant owner can pick up 
        on. Slow, constant stress, however, may result in slow, gradual changes 
        in behavior and color. Behaviors such as thermoregulating, hiding, prolonged 
        soaking, reduced appetite, irregular defecation, attitude, regression/increase 
        in tameness, and more can all indicate signs of stress and illness.</font></p>

      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">If any of these signs occur, 
        the environmental requirements of the species must be checked against 
        the conditions actually occurring in the enclosure and any inadequacies 
        or failures corrected.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">If the proper physical 
        environment is well established, the social environment needs to be looked 
        at in enclosures where more than one animal is housed together. It should 
        be noted that aggression and dominance behavior is not always overtly 
        physical - there need not be any actual fighting. Subtle behaviors on 
        the part of the dominant animal may result in a subordinate animal staying 
        away from basking areas and food, slowly dying of stress-enhanced hypothermia 
        and starvation.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">If the physical and social 
        environments inside the enclosure are not a problem, then the macroenvironment 
        must be evaluated. Has the placement of the enclosure been changed (to 
        a different room or different part of the original room)? Are children 
        or pets annoying or scaring the reptile (think food chain/predator-prey 
        relationships here as well as the annoyance factor of children)? Have 
        you moved your household? Had to evacuate due to a natural disaster? Had 
        the in-laws over for the week, totally disrupting your usual animal maintenance 
        (and playtime) schedule? Been gone on vacation? These are all things that 
        may seem like they wouldn't intrude on the life of our captive reptiles 
        but, for many of them (especially iguanas and other social lizards), most 
        definitely do.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">There are also the things 
        that go on behind your back... One woman found out from neighbor, who 
        observed what was going on through the window while the owner was at work, 
        that her cat would sit staring into her iguana's enclosure, nose pressed 
        up against the glass, for hours at a time when the owner was at work. 
        Since the cat never engaged in this behavior when the owner was home, 
        she never thought there was a problem with the cat. Another woman found 
        out that her husband was turning off the heating equipment in her reptile's 
        enclosure at night after she went to bed &quot;to save money - it's a 
        cold-blooded animal, so it doesn't need heat all the time&quot; was his 
        rationale when she finally figured out why her reptile was sick and stressed. 
        So, just because you are not directly observing something going on doesn't 
        mean that something isn't happening to result in fear and stress in your 
        reptile. You may need to become a sort of detective in carefully and deeply 
        assessing everything that goes on in and around your reptile's enclosure 
        as well as exploring as much as you can of the animal's natural history 
        before you will be able to figure out what isn't right.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Please note that if your 
        conditions have not been set up appropriately before reading this material, 
        the shedding, defecation, and growth patterns you have come to expect 
        from your reptile may in fact be abnormal. Reptile owners who have no 
        previous experience with healthy reptiles believe that since their reptile 
        is alive, eating, and defecating, that they are healthy. One 4-H reptile 
        program leader informed me, for example, that ball pythons never shed 
        in one piece. Her snake was covered in patches of unshed skin representing 
        3-4 different sheds, its eyes deeply dented from retained eye caps. Her 
        snake was not healthy, but she insisted that, since that was the way her 
        snake had always been, and that since it was alive and moving around, 
        that it was &quot;normal&quot; for the species! I frequently encounter 
        iguana owners who tell me that their iguanas defecate only once or twice 
        a week even though they are eating daily. This tells me right away that 
        their temperatures are too low. </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Once 
        they are raised to the proper levels, the owners are often dismayed to 
        find that, not only does the iguana increase its food intake, but its 
        digestion speeds up to the proper rate, resulting in often copious defecation 
        one or more times a day, depending upon the season. Most of these owners 
        also find that their iguana isn't really as tame as they thought it was.</font>

          and to increase the smell of the prey.</font> </li>
        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Take into account the 
          species natural hunting and feeding strategies (actively seek and stalk

        <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">&quot;Shotgun&quot; 
          smaller prey items: once the reptile has started eating a small prey 
          or scented prey item, hold another small or unscented prey item up to 
          the back end of the prey being consumed. In this way, the reptile will 
          have not choice but to start eating the second prey as the first prey 
          is pulled back into its throat. Shotgun as many as are needed to constitute 
          an appropriately sized meal (5-6 one- to two-day old pinks, for example,

        and Humidity</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="3" ><b><br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">The humidity 
        and temperatures in an enclosure will vary through the year as the ambient 
        room air temperatures and humidity rise and fall.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">You may need to boost 
        the humidity artificially more during the winter and winter months than 
        during the Fall, for example. Hygrometers can be used to measure humidity 
        and may be used as a guide to alert you when you need to boost the humidity 
        or back off. Unfortunately, more is known about the temperature requirements 
        of species kept in captivity than is known about their humidity needs. 
        In the absence of specific humidity data, you will have to learn how to 
        judge the adequacy of humidity based on the above points.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">During the the winter, 
        the fall in outside temperatures results in a lowering of the temperatures 
        inside our homes. This drop in ambient room air temperature often results 
        in a lowering of the temperatures inside the reptile enclosures. Always 
        monitor the temperatures with several thermometers placed inside the enclosure. 
        You may find that during the colder months you many not only have to boost 
        humidity inside the room or enclosure, but you may have to add stronger 
        or additional heating equipment just to be able to maintain the proper 
        temperatures. One final factor that must be mentioned is the human tendency 
        to demand that animals share the human's time schedule. Many people work 
        during the day, coming home tired at night, often with an hour or more 
        of chores to be done before they can settle down to relax. At that time, 
        they may want to feed their reptile, or take it out for some together 
        time. The problem is that if their reptile is a diurnal (active during 
        the day) species, it needs to sleep at night. Constant disruption of the 
        sleep cycle, as well as being forced to eat at night rather than during 
        the day, results in long term low levels of stress. The same is true for 
        people who work or otherwise stay up all night and sleep throughout most 
        of the day. While this life style may be okay for nocturnal reptiles (other 
        than the fact that nocturnal species do still require darkness at night 
        to function normally), it is stressful for the diurnal and even for many 
        crepuscular species. When we keep animals, we must accommodate </font><em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">their</font></em><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2"> 
        needs; they should not be forced to accommodate our schedules.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="3" ><b>So, what does all 
        of this have to do with my reptile's health?<br>
        </b> </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Stresses, little 
        and big, as well as the direct effects of environmental problems (cage 
        size, orientation, heating, lighting, feeding, humidity, etc.) can lead 
        to illness. Thermal burns, dysregulated endocrine system, sleep deprivation, 
        constant fear and/or insecurity, malnutrition, etc., lead to numerous 
        illnesses and disorders. Stress itself can suppress immune function, making 
        the body unable to naturally fight off infection or keep internal parasites 
        under control. The more stress, or the longer that it is allowed to continue, 
        the weaker the animal becomes and the less tolerant it is to continued 
        stresses and other problems in its environment.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Verdana" size="2">Reptiles take a long time 
        to die. Because of their ectothermy, their cold-bloodedness, they are 
        able to conserve energy to maintain basic body functions for a long time, 
        long after a mammal or bird would have succumbed or have deteriorated 
        to the point where the owner would notice. Reptiles do not die &quot;suddenly.&quot; 
        When someone says that, what has happened is that their reptile was sick 
        for a long period of time but, according to the nature of wild animals 
        (which, after all, most reptiles still are, even if they were captive 
        bred), they hid their distress: in the wild, it is the sick and the weak 
        who are preyed upon. Those animals most adept at suppressing signs of 
        ill-health or injury are those that will have a chance to recover before 
        being eaten. In the wild as in captivity, reduced activity and increased 
        hiding are behaviors associated with attempts at conserving energy (the 
        less one moves, the fewer calories burned, a common reaction to slow starvation 
        and to giving the body more calories to put into healing, for example) 
        and trying to hide to avoid predation when the animal is too weak (or 
        too cold) to effectively defend itself.</font>

        Changes</b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        Changes in behavior can be a sign of an underlying physical problem. We 
        tend to think of health problems as causing lethargy and loss of appetite, 
        but animals may also become snappy, cranky, and may react abnormally to 
        accustomed interaction and stimuli. Some iguanas may get aggressive. When 
        the aggression occurs in green iguanas, known for their breeding season 
        and territorial aggression, such behavioral changes are often dismissed 
        as &quot;just&quot; being related to &quot;typical&quot; male aggression. 
        As an increasing number of iguana keepers are finding, abnormal aggression 
        may also caused by huge bladder stones, tumors, abscessed organs, and 
        other as yet undefined, pain, disorders and pathologies. When investigating 
        the possible causes of abnormally aggressive behavior, do not discount 
        a primary physiological cause until you and your vet have thoroughly checked 
        it out.</font></p>

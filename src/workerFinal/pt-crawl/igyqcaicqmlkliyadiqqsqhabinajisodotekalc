</p>

<p>
In 2015, the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) announced a new initiative for funding projects digitizing collections of rare and unique content in cultural memory institutions.  The Washington University project, <i>Revealing Visual Culture</i>, was one of eighteen projects selected out of 167 proposals.  CLIR pledged $250,000 to complete the project within a two-year period.</p>

<p>The <i>Revealing Visual Culture</i> project will create digital images and supporting metadata for 150,000 modern periodical illustration tear sheets contained in the Walt Reed Illustration Archive. The archive reflects the New York-based Illustration House, a gallery specializing in the resale of original works of illustration including pulp fiction covers, magazine illustrations, advertisements, comic strips and more, founded by Walt Reed.  In 2012, Washington University Libraries acquired the archive, which includes approximately: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>8,000 periodicals</li>
<li>1,200 illustrated books</li>
<li>250,000 magazine tear sheets</li>
<li>and 140 pieces of original art</li>
</ul>

<p>The tear sheets &#150; from over 200 illustrated periodical publications dating from the 1860s to the 1990s &#150; represent the largest known collection in the world.  Featuring illustrations from magazine covers, fiction stories, advertisements, news and information articles, the tear sheets offer a rich resource for scholarly investigation in multiple fields.</p>

<p>During the two-year project, an outside vendor will create digital files.  WU library staff and student assistants will create and enhance the metadata and perform quality control.  The resulting image database will be searchable by illustrator, publication title, subject matter, date and content.  Washington University Libraries will provide complete public access to high-resolution images and metadata online.</p>

<p>The process of sorting, foldering, boxing, and packing items began in January 2016.  Staff and student volunteers from Special Collections removed files from the cabinets.  The contents were re-foldered and labeled, and the folders were rehoused in boxes to be sent to the digitization vendor. Six pallets were filled and shipped to the digitization vendor in Atlanta, Georgia, HeritageWerks. </p>

<p>Hard drives with the digital files will be returned quarterly over the next two years.    Staff and student workers will catalog and add descriptive metadata to the high resolution files.  All 150,000 images will be available in ArtStor's Shared Shelf Commons.    This management system combines image collections of unique holdings and will provide full public access to the images in the Walt Reed Illustration Archive.  Users may browse image collections, search using relevant terms, view thumbnails and zoom into high-resolution images. Images published in Shared Shelf Commons can also be accessed via Google search.</p>

</p>

<p>The ETDplus project (<a href="http://educopia.org/research/grants/etdplus">http://educopia.org/research/grants/etdplus</a>) invites Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) program staff, librarians, faculty advisors, and graduate students to participate in a public review of the <i>Guidance Briefs for Preserving &amp; Curating ETD Research Data &amp; Complex Digital Objects</i>. </p>
<p>
<b>About the ETD Guidance Briefs</b><br />
Interested ETD stakeholders can download copies of the Guidance Briefs at the following website, <a href="http://educopia.org/deliverables/etdplus-guidance-briefs">http://educopia.org/deliverables/etdplus-guidance-briefs</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Guidance Briefs</i> are short (3-4 page) "how-to" oriented briefs designed to help ETD programs build and nurture supportive relationships with student researchers. These briefs will assist student researchers in understanding how their approaches to data and content management impact credibility, replicable research, and general long-term accessibility: knowledge and skills that will impact the health of their careers for years to come.</p>

<p>We are releasing these Guidance Briefs as openly editable documents so that institutions may use and reuse these in whatever ways work best for their local audiences. Topics covered include: Copyright, Data Structures, File Formats, Metadata, Storage, and Version Control. Each Brief includes generally applicable information about its topic, and also includes a "Local Practices" section that an institution may use to call attention to what's happening on its own campus.</p> 

<p>We invite you to help us refine these documents by drawing our project team's attention to any components that need to be edited, revised, broadened, or narrowed. Please send us an email with your suggestions and/or track your changes within the documents and email those back to our team (katherine [at] educopia.org) by or before June 30, 2016. We plan to integrate the community's feedback before formally issuing these Briefs under a CC BY 4.0 license later this summer.</p> 

<p>
<b>About the ETDplus Project</b><br />

</p>

<p>The roles and responsibilities within academic library cataloging units have gradually been shifting over the past several years. To deal with these changes, catalogers on both the librarian/faculty levels as well as professional or paraprofessional staff have had to respond by shifting workloads to ensure that necessary cataloging tasks are carried out. With many of these new and upcoming tasks and workflows that academic library cataloging units are completing comes change to the organizational structure of these units.</p>

<p>This research project has been designed to gather information about the past, current, and future organizational structures of academic library cataloging units. As part of the study, a survey was widely distributed in March and April 2016 requesting academic librarians and staff members to offer information about the cataloging units at their organizations. The survey response deadline was April 30, 2016, and data is currently being analyzed to be made available through publications, presentations, and on a website.</p> 

<p>The survey data revealed several compelling trends about the recent changes in cataloging staffing models used by academic libraries with disparate sizes and funding levels. Trends include how the organizational structure of cataloging units have changed over the past decade, future plans for restructuring cataloging, and shifting responsibilities while assuming new iterations of traditional cataloging and metadata related roles.</p>

<p>In addition to discovering how cataloging units have changed in response to needs and trends in academic libraries, special attention is being paid to the type of work that is completed both inside and outside of the cataloging unit along with new responsibilities that have been shouldered in the recent past or will be acquired in the future. These roles and responsibilities can be directly related to the size of the library (both collection size and staffing), the overall structure of the cataloging unit, and the unit's place within the institution.</p>

<p>Preliminary findings can be found on the following website, with more content being added periodically: <a href="https://catalogingunitorg.wordpress.com/">https://catalogingunitorg.wordpress.com/</a>.</p>

<p class="orange">Rare Orson Welles recordings to be preserved and shared through Indiana University Libraries and the National Recording Preservation Foundation</p>

<p>May 3, 2016 &#151; &quot;With the assistance of a $25,000 grant from the <a href="http://recordingpreservation.org/">National Recording Preservation Foundation</a> to Indiana University Libraries, the university will preserve rare, original recordings of 'The Orson Welles Show.' The live radio series produced by its iconic host and namesake debuted Sept. 15, 1941.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Previously, internet sites and books have stated that only eight of the 19 'Orson Welles Show' broadcasts have survived.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An IU-led preservation and digitization project, titled 'Orson Welles on the Air,' will reveal the truth: Original lacquer discs containing 14 of the broadcasts, as well as other supposedly lost recordings, had been secured by <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/">Indiana University Libraries' Lilly Library</a>, one of the nation's premier rare book and special collection libraries....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Together, the 'Orson Welles on the Air' materials represent the most complete original source of audio for Welles' radio work during the late 1930s and 1940s, with the highest extant sound quality.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Research Library Associations Endorse Open Data Accord</p>

<p>April 29, 2016 &#151; &quot;The International Alliance of Research Library Associations (IARLA) &#150; a global coalition of major research and academic library associations in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States &#150; recognizes the importance of working towards a common vision for open data. We firmly believe that open data holds the key to addressing many societal challenges worldwide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;IARLA views the Science International accord on '<a href="http://www.icsu.org/science-international/accord">Open Data in a Big Data World</a>' as an important step towards creating and enabling this common vision of the importance of open data. In setting out principles for open data that are derived from emerging practices within the scientific community, the accord lends the voice of a key stakeholder to the case for open data and provides a practical road map for the implementation of open data at the global level....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...By signing this accord we declare our commitment to working with the scientific community in making publicly funded research data open by default. Data are the building blocks of knowledge. Therefore libraries, which exist to ensure access to knowledge, are key stakeholders in the open data environment. Libraries have a responsibility to make data discoverable, accessible, intelligible, assessable, and usable. It is of the utmost importance that the library community engage with the global scientific and research community on this issue in venues such as the Research Data Alliance. We look forward to engaging in the dialogue initiated by this accord and to working with the global community of stakeholders to implement the principles the accord promotes.&quot;</p>

<p><b><i>  Data Transition to Congress.gov Complete; Legacy System Can Take a Bow</i></b></p>

<p>April 28, 2016 &#151; &quot;THOMAS.gov, the online legislative information system, will officially retire July 5, completing the multi-year transition to Congress.gov.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'The Library is well-positioned for the future with Congress.gov,' said Acting Librarian of Congress David S. Mao. 'Free access to legislative information that anyone can search for and read is central to an informed democracy. I applaud the visionary leaders who launched THOMAS two decades ago, and I congratulate and thank the many talented individuals at the Library and throughout the legislative branch who have transitioned that resource into the 21st century with Congress.gov. Finally, I invite and encourage everyone to use this resource. It is here for you to learn about, to connect with, to better understand your representative government.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;THOMAS, named for Thomas Jefferson, was a pioneering site when it was launched by the Library in 1995 as a bipartisan initiative of Congress. The system has been updated over the years, but its foundation can no longer support the capabilities that today's Internet users have come to expect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Congress.gov system, initially launched in beta form in September, 2012, applies modern design and infrastructure to the robust legislative data sets, with mobile-friendly access, faceted search and other features.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">NIST Kicks Off Effort to Defend Encrypted Data from Quantum Computer Threat</p>

<p>April 28, 2016 &#151; &quot;If an exotic quantum computer is invented that could break the codes we depend on to protect confidential electronic information, what will we do to maintain our security and privacy? That's the overarching question posed by a new report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), whose cryptography specialists are beginning the long journey toward effective answers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8105">NIST Internal Report (NISTIR) 8105: Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography</a> details the status of research into quantum computers, which would exploit the often counterintuitive world of quantum physics to solve problems that are intractable for conventional computers. If such devices are ever built, they will be able to defeat many of our modern cryptographic systems, such as the computer algorithms used to protect online bank transactions. NISTIR 8105 outlines a long-term approach for avoiding this vulnerability before it arises....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The report shares NIST's current understanding of the status of quantum-resistant cryptography, and details what the agency is doing to mitigate risk in the future. One overall recommendation for the near term is that organizations focus on "crypto agility," or the rapid ability to switch out whatever algorithms they are using for new ones that are safer.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">New Carnegie report calls on partnership working between academics and the third sector</p>

<p>April 26, 2016 &#151; &quot;A new report published today by the Carnegie UK Trust suggests that public policy outcomes could be improved if academics and the third sector were to work more closely together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The report, written by Carnegie Fellow Professor Mark Shucksmith OBE, challenges traditional views of universities as sole producers of knowledge and identifies opportunities for academics and charities to work together for the public's benefit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As well as drawing on existing research, the Trust has consulted with stakeholders from across the UK and held roundtable events in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Newcastle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Professor Mark Shucksmith OBE and author of the report explains, 'The notion that universities have a monopoly on knowledge production that must be transferred out to users is outdated. Both practitioners and academic institutions are knowledge creators.  Universities and the third sector have a shared interest in achieving impact and have different types of knowledge and expertise that they can bring to the table. There are many mutual benefits which should encourage cooperation.'&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Grant will help Cornell University Library improve information access by scholars</p>

<p><b><i>  New tools and methods will enrich scholarly research</i></b></p>

<p>April 25, 2016 &#151; &quot;Cornell University Library will develop new tools and methods to better describe libraries' scholarly information resources and share those descriptions among different institutions, thanks to a new grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In collaboration with the libraries of Harvard and Stanford universities and library researchers at the University of Iowa, Cornell has been awarded a $1.5 million, two-year grant to help libraries use linked data to improve the exchange and understanding of information about scholarly resources. The project team aims to have tools, services and solutions available that research libraries could use at their own institutions within the next three to five years....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The new tools will improve descriptions of everything in the library's catalog, including books, journals and research datasets, as well as special collections such as hip-hop, maps, and works of art.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cornell is also participating in a companion project based at Stanford University Libraries, which seeks to transition the functions of library technical services to linked data, so libraries can use these new tools to produce information communally. While the two projects are separate, each is expected to advance the goals of the other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Linked Data is a way of expressing data in large networks of related information on the Internet so that computers can make connections among different collections with a minimum of prior agreement.&quot;</p>

<p>April 21, 2016 &#151; &quot;The <a href="https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/imls-awards-13-million-prepare-future-librarians-and-advance-library-field">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>, the federal agency spearheading grants to archives, museums and libraries, has awarded a $500,000 grant to a researcher at The University of Texas at Austin to study rural library 'hotspot lending programs,' where libraries loan out devices that connect patrons to cellular networks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hotspot lending programs essentially move Internet connectivity into people's homes by loaning out devices that connect to 3G or 4G cellular networks, and then allow patrons subsidized access to the Internet from anywhere on that network.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sharon Strover, Philip G. Warner Regents Professor of Communication in the Moody College of Communication, will serve as lead investigator for the 20-month project: 'At the Edges of the National Digital Platform: Rural Library Hotspot Lending Programs.' A partnership with researchers at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, the project will examine the success of programs that seek to address the lack of digital access that often face rural communities.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">UC Davis, CDL to Lead Major Project to Build Open Access Financial Model</p>

<p>March 20, 2016 &#151; &quot;The University of California, Davis and the California Digital Library (CDL) will lead a major new project, with an $800,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, to help define the future of Open Access to scholarship. Pay It Forward: Investigating a Sustainable Model of Open Access Article Processing Charges for Large North American Research Institutions is a year-long effort to study the implications of new funding models for scholarly communications, particularly the use of article processing charges, and determine their sustainability for research universities in the U.S. and Canada. The project partnership includes three major research libraries (Harvard University, Ohio State University and the University of British Columbia) as well as the ten University of California campuses. The project will create a detailed, flexible, and publicly available financial model to help university administrators and librarians develop Open Access policies and strategies....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The project brings together a group of scholarly communications experts, including Greg Tananbaum (ScholarNext), Dr. David Solomon (Michigan State University), Dr. Bo-Christer Bj&#246;rk (Hanken School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland), Dr. Mark McCabe (University of Michigan and Boston University), and Dr. Carol Tenopir (University of Tennessee, Knoxville). The team will create both an in-depth qualitative analysis of authors' attitudes towards Open Access publishing fees and a detailed financial model of these fees relative to current library journal budgets and additional funding sources. The project will also collaborate with information providers Elsevier (Scopus) and Thomson Reuters (Web of Science) as well as the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers, whose membership includes several hundred scholarly and professional publishers. The team will build a series of models depicting the social and financial impact of a largely APC-funded publishing landscape on the institutions participating in the study under a variety of assumptions and across different academic disciplines....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The project came out of a 2013 planning effort that looked at the institutional costs of converting scholarly communications, particularly scholarly journals, to an entirely Article Processing Charge business model, often referred to as 'Gold Open Access.' In that funding model, researchers &#150; generally with support from their institutions or funders &#150; pay in advance to publish, enabling readers to access published articles for free from the publisher's web site or another scholarly repository.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">2013 Public Libraries Survey Shows Libraries Responding to Changing 21st Century Needs</p>

<p>March 15, 2016 &#151; &quot;Research by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) found shifts in Americans' interaction with public libraries' materials, programs and services in Fiscal Year 2013. <a href="https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/publications/documents/plsfy2013.pdf">Public Libraries in the United States Survey: Fiscal Year 2013</a> reveals key indicators of investments and library usage at public libraries in the United States. The survey report, which had a 97 percent response rate, describes findings from public libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. With the available survey data, the report provides aggregated local, state and national information about the nation's 9,000 public libraries and their 16,500 branches and bookmobiles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The survey shows that 96 percent of the total U.S. population, or 304.8 million people, lived within a public library service area in 2013, and Americans made an average of almost four million visits each day to public libraries that year. While this is an 8.2 percent decrease since a peak in visitation in 2009, it is a 17.6 percent increase over 10 years. Similar to retailers and businesses, public libraries are increasing their online presence, and library patrons can access more materials, resources and services online.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Access to public computers and the Internet continue to be important library offerings, though the survey shows shifting usage. Sessions on public access computers have decreased since 2010. While use of public library Wi-Fi by patrons who bring their own devices to the library is not measured, the survey may indicate a decline in public library computer use due to growth in this behavior.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Libraries are offering more programs and the public's participation in those programs is increasing. For many communities, public programs fulfill critical K-12 learning as well as lifelong informational needs related to digital and financial literacy, employment and job training and healthcare and wellness. Libraries increasingly enhance their learning programs by linking them to community support services. There is also a long-term increase in the number of children and young adults attending library programs. In addition to story hours and summer reading programs, children's libraries provide an increasing number of programs to foster early learning, school readiness and Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) learning. Many libraries are now creating learning spaces where young adults can be both consumers and creators of content.&quot;</p>

<h2>What is Rohypnol?</h2>

"Roofies." Sounds like a cartoon character or a piece of candy.  However,
nothing could be further from the truth about Roofies, also known as the
drug <font color=red>Rohypnol</font>.<p>
 
Rohypnol (Flunitrazepam) is a type of benzodiazepine, a class of drugs
that depresses the central nervous system.  You may have heard of Valium
and Xanax.  These are also benzodiazepines used as sedatives and
antianxiety agents. Rohypnol was developed as a sleeping aid.  It is also
used in therapy settings to relax patients and to get them talking.  
Rohypnol is manufactured in Europe and Latin American and is sold in many
countries around the world. However, it is illegal in the United States
and Canada.  The pills are round, white and smaller than aspirin.<p>
 
Because Rohypnol is inexpensive, it is becoming popular with high
school and college students. In the US, Rohypnol is used mostly at
parties, and usually taken with alcohol. It has a synergistic effect with
other drugs such as alcohol.  This means that one drug increases the
effect of the other. </td>

bgcolor="#ffffcc"><h2>Behavioral Effects of Rohypnol</h2> 

Rohypnol can produce amnesia (memory loss) and muscle relaxation and make
people lower their inhibitions. An inhibition is when you feel like you
can't do something.  When inhibitions are lowered, people feel as if
an obstacle has been removed.  Therefore, they can talk more freely and
feel less shy.

Because Rohypnol is colorless, odorless and flavorless,
it can be slipped into drinks unnoticed.  This is one reason this drug is
so dangerous.  People may consume it without knowing it.  It dissolves
quickly and takes effect in 20-30 minutes. Its effects can last 8-12
hours. Within the past few years, Rohypnol has become known as the "date
rape" drug.  People will come home from a party and have no idea what
happened to them because they unknowingly ingested Rohypnol, passed out,
and woke up several hours later with no memory of the evening. To address
this new use, Congress passed the "Drug-Induced Rape Prevention and
Punishment Act of 1996" to increase federal penalties for the use of any
controlled substance to aid in a sexual assault.<p>
 
Continued, repeated use of Rohypnol may result in addiction and although
Rohypnol is a sedative, it can cause aggressive behavior in some people.
Withdrawal symptoms may occur and include headaches, sore muscles,
hallucinations, convulsions, and possibly seizures 1-2 weeks after
quitting the drug.<p>
 
Although overdoses are rarely fatal, emergency services are sometimes
required because Rohypnol can cause a person to vomit, hallucinate, have
trouble breathing and fall into a coma. When Rohypnol is combined with
alcohol the outcome is usually worse. <p>
 
Street names for Rohypnol include rophies, ruffies, R2, roofenol, Roche,
la rocha, rope, roopies, ropies, and rib.</td></tr></table>

<h2>Effects of Rohypnol on the Brain</h2> 

The benzodiazepines influence behavior by interacting with receptors on
neurons in the brain that use the neurotransmitter called <font
color=red>GABA</font>.  When GABA binds to receptors, it usually inhibits
a neuron and acts to reduce neuronal activity. When benzodiazepines attach
to GABA receptors, they increase GABA binding to other receptors.  In this
way, benzodiazepines enhance the effects of GABA and reduce brain
activity.<p>

The fact that there are receptors for benzodiazepines in the
brain suggests that the brain makes its own type of benzodiazepine.   The
brain has been found to make its own morphine, the <font
color=red>endorphins</font>, but the brain's own benzodiazepine has not
yet been discovered.</td>

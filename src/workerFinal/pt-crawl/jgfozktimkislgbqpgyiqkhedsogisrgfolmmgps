<a name="Heading3"></a><b>BOOK REVIEW</b><br><a name="Heading4"></a><b>ERIC
HEINZE,</b><b><i> THE LOGIC OF EQUALITY: A FORMAL ANALYSIS OF NON-DISCRIMINATION
LAW</i> (Ashgate Publishing, 2003)</b></h1>
<p align="center"><b><i>Amelia
Simpson<sup><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[*]</a></sup></i></b></p>
<p>Anyone interested in contemporary non-discrimination jurisprudence will find
much to contemplate in Eric Heinze's <i>The Logic of Equality</i>, published as
part of Ashgate's Applied Legal Philosophy series. Aimed at legal practitioners
as well as academics, the book sets
out to illuminate certain enduring features
of non-discrimination discourse and to provide a framework for analysing
individual legal
disputes. The author largely succeeds in that aim. However, in
avoiding consideration of underlying subjective values the author
leaves
untouched an important input into the discourse, lessening the model's
usefulness to disputants and decision-makers.</p>
<p>The book's central thesis is that contemporary non-discrimination discourse
in Anglo-American and European jurisdictions is, in important
respects,
determinate; that is, it is conducted within identifiable parameters and
conforms to certain set patterns. The author presents
his analysis as
descriptive only; that is, as aiming simply to isolate and illuminate the common
threads, neither approvingly nor
disapprovingly, while building a framework for
discussing them. The framework that he constructs employs the tools and
methodology
of formal logic, attempting to reduce non-discrimination discourse
to a set of variables and sequences that may be abstracted from
the facts of any
particular legal dispute. </p>
<p>There are four Parts, each comprising several short chapters. Parts I to III
construct the author's logic-based model. The model's
key components are
introduced in stages and their variables are explored. The discussion is likely
to be challenging for readers
not already familiar with the methodology of
formal logic, although the author does provide examples and exercises that allow
readers
to confirm their understanding as the model-building progresses. By the
end of Part III, the reader has been introduced to the distinction
between
normative and factual arguments in non-discrimination discourse and also to the
two core variables within the author's model,
reflecting the concepts of a
person's objective status, on the one hand, and his or her subjective merit, on
the other. </p>
<p>Part IV tracks the model through several standard 'types' of
non-discrimination dispute, distinguished by the nature of the claims
and
counter-claims that each involves. The author here aims to demonstrate both the
accuracy of his model of non-discrimination discourse
and the extent of its
explanatory power by overlaying it upon decided cases taken from a range of
jurisdictions and settings. He
identifies four distinct types of
non-discrimination dispute, being the 'Traditional Model', the 'Impact Model',
the 'Accommodation
Model', and the 'Non-Recognition
Model'.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> Each, he contends,
represents a particular configuration of the variables identified in Parts I to
III of the book. The Traditional
Model, for example, encompasses discrimination
disputes in which the claimant asserts her 'commensurate subjective merit'
&#8212;
that is, some personal ability, need, or circumstance identical to that
of specified others &#8212; and contends that this should
translate into
treatment on the basis of 'objective' equality &#8212; that is, there should be
no abstract legal distinction drawn
between people in her position and those
others to whom she compares
herself.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> The respondent to a
Traditional Model case disputes the asserted link between personal merit and a
broader conclusion of objective
equality, for instance by pointing to other,
impersonal, factors supporting the maintenance of a distinction. </p>
<p>By the end of the book, the author claims to have demonstrated that there are
clear patterns to which all non-discrimination disputes
conform, meaning that
the discourse of non-discrimination is to that extent determinate. He regards
his methodology as neutral and
ascribes only descriptive significance to his
project. There is only fleeting advertence to the standard criticisms levelled
at such
projects. In the Introduction, the author concedes that '[m]any have
doubted whether a strictly formal model can illuminate the subtler
or more
controversial elements of legal
reasoning.'<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup> In the concluding
paragraph, he assures readers that if his model seems 'icy and mechanical' or
rigid and limiting, blame must lie
with the jurisprudence and discourse from
which the model is distilled, rather than with the model
itself.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup> He does not advert at all
to the possibility that some readers may be sceptical as to his motivations,
seeing in his attachment to
legal determinacy a latent distaste for judicial
discretion.</p>
<p>In honing in upon the determinate aspects of non-discrimination discourse,
the author has left to one side what he sees as inherently
indeterminate inputs
in the form of subjective values. This exclusion seems an unavoidable
consequence of the author's chosen methodology.
Nevertheless, it detracts from
the explanatory power of his formal structure, as will be clear to anyone
familiar with the High Court
of Australia's non-discrimination jurisprudence.
For over 15 years that court has insisted that the concept of 'relevant
difference'
lies at the heart of the legal conception of discrimination, the
issue always being whether a given distinction should be accepted
as legitimate
in its context.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup><b> </b><i>The Logic
of Equality</i>, in sidestepping the issue of the subjective values supporting
particular legal distinctions, offers no insights into the way in
which these
important calculations are performed. The book devotes only a page to the
'Non-Recognition Model' which, of the author's
identified models, comes closest
to pointing up the question of how the legitimacy of a particular classification
should be assessed.
As the author himself asserts, 'the analysis in this book
ends where those questions begin.'<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Another limitation of the author's model will appear to readers familiar with
the 'subordination' approach to non-discrimination
discourse.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup> That approach,
distinctive in that it transcends the devices of classification and comparison,
has received some judicial
recognition.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> Yet it cannot be
captured and explained by the formal structure posited in <i>The Logic of
Equality</i>. </p>
<p><i>The Logic of Equality </i>achieves its author's goal; it teases out
carefully and clearly several determinate aspects of mainstream
non-discrimination discourse.
To the extent that the book has limitations, they
are for the most part limitations inherent in analytic jurisprudence more
generally;
any project of definition and classification will be more successful
in its treatment of the 'core' of an idea than it will be in
treating its murky
and indistinct fringes. The contribution made by <i>The Logic of Equality</i>
relates to the core of non-discrimination discourse. Readers not distracted by
underlying questions of values and legitimacy will
find the book a useful
resource, especially as an aid to framing legal arguments that will be
comprehensible within the parameters
of mainstream non-discrimination
analysis.</p>

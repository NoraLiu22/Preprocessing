To inform clinical practice about the health effects of menopausal hormone therapy, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation, and a low-fat dietary pattern, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled 161 808 postmenopausal US women (N = 68 132 in the clinical trials) aged 50 to 79 years at baseline from 1993 to 1998, and followed them up for up to 20 years. Observations: The WHI clinical trial results do not support hormone therapy with oral conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate for postmenopausal women or conjugated equine estrogens alone for those with prior hysterectomy to prevent cardiovascular disease, dementia, or other chronic diseases. However, hormone therapy is effective for treating moderate to severe vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. These benefits of hormone therapy in early menopause, combined with lower rates of adverse effects of hormone therapy in early compared with later menopause, support initiation of hormone therapy before age 60 years for women without contraindications to hormone therapy who have bothersome menopausal symptoms. The WHI results do not support routinely recommending calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for fracture prevention in all postmenopausal women. However, calcium and vitamin D are appropriate for women who do not meet national guidelines for recommended intakes of these nutrients through diet. A low-fat dietary pattern with increased fruit, vegetable, and grain consumption did not prevent the primary outcomes of breast or colorectal cancer but was associated with lower rates of the secondary outcome of breast cancer mortality during long-term follow-up. Conclusions and relevance: For postmenopausal women, the WHI randomized clinical trials do not support menopausal hormone therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease or other chronic diseases. Menopausal hormone therapy is appropriate to treat bothersome vasomotor symptoms among women in early menopause, without contraindications, who are interested in taking hormone therapy. The WHI evidence does not support routine supplementation with calcium plus vitamin D for menopausal women to prevent fractures or a low-fat diet with increased fruits, vegetables, and grains to prevent breast or colorectal cancer. A potential role of a low-fat dietary pattern in reducing breast cancer mortality, a secondary outcome, warrants further study.","paper_focus":"Study methods"},{"ms_id":"4944","title":"20-year depressive symptoms, dementia, and structural neuropathology in older women","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Petkus, Andrew J.","first_author":"Andrew J.

Methods: Utilizing joint latent class mixture models, we identified longitudinal trajectories of annually assessed depressive symptoms and dementia risk over 21 years in 957 older women (baseline age 72.7 years old) from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study. In a subsample of 569 women who underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, we examined whether estimates of cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neurodegeneration were associated with identified trajectories. Results: Five trajectories of depressive symptoms and dementia risk were identified. Compared to women with minimal symptoms, women who reported mild and stable and emerging depressive symptoms were at the highest risk of developing dementia and had more cerebrovascular disease and AD-related neurodegeneration. Discussion: There are heterogeneous profiles of depressive symptoms and dementia risk. Common neuropathological factors may contribute to both depression and dementia. Highlights The progression of depressive symptoms and concurrent dementia risk is heterogeneous. Emerging depressive symptoms may be a prodromal symptom of dementia. Cerebrovascular disease and AD are potentially shared neuropathological factors.","paper_focus":"Cognition"},{"ms_id":"4479","title":"Risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in postmenopausal women with inflammatory bowel disease","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Greywoode, Ruby","first_author":"Ruby Greywoode","full_citation":"Greywoode R, Larson J, Peraza J, Clark R, Allison MA, Chaudhry NA, Schnatz PF, Shadyab AH, Wallace RB, Wassertheil-Smoller S.

Whether women with IBD have increased CVD risk after the menopause transition is unclear. Methods: We conducted a survival analysis of Women's Health Initiative (WHI) participants and excluded those with missing IBD diagnosis, model covariate data, follow-up data, or a baseline history of the following CVD outcomes: coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Risk of outcomes between IBD and non-IBD women was performed using Cox proportional hazard models, stratified by WHI trial and follow-up. Models were adjusted for age, socio-demographics, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, etc.), family history, and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol, physical activity, body mass index, etc.). Results: Of 134,022 WHI participants meeting inclusion criteria, 1367 (1.0%) reported IBD at baseline. Mean baseline age was 63.4 years. After adjusting for age and other confounders, no significant difference was observed between IBD and non-IBD women for the risk of CHD (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73-1.24), VTE (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.81-1.52) or PAD (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28-1.42). After adjusting for age, risk of ischemic stroke was significantly higher (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.88) in IBD than non-IBD women. With further adjustment, the excess risk of ischemic stroke among IBD women was attenuated and no longer statistically significant (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.98-1.76). Conclusions: Among postmenopausal women with IBD, risk of ischemic stroke may be higher than in non-IBD women.","paper_focus":"Cardiovascular Disease;Diet and nutrition"},{"ms_id":"4587","title":"Plasma oxysterols are associated with serum lipids and dementia risk\nin older women ","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Dunk, Michelle","first_author":"Michelle Dunk","full_citation":"Dunk MM, Rapp SR, Hayden KM, Espeland MA, Casanova R, Manson JE, Shadyab AH, Wild R, Driscoll I.

As cohort studies had opposite findings, other randomized clinical trials were identified to conduct a meta-analysis of estrogen-alone influence on breast cancer incidence.\n\nMethods: We conducted literature searches on randomized trials and: estrogen, hormone therapy, and breast cancer, and searches from a prior meta-analysis and reviews. In the meta-analysis, for trials with published relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), each log-RR was multiplied by weight = 1/V, where V = variance of the log-RR, and V was derived from the corresponding 95% CI.

Methods: Women from the Women's Health Study (N = 16,629) and Women's Health Initiative/Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 6,079) were asked to wear an accelerometer on the hip for 7 days. Multiple mixed-effects linear regression models were used to identify sociodemographic-, health-, and chronic condition-related correlates (independent variables) associated with PA and SB (dependent variables) among women with (n = 2,554) and without (n = 20,154) a history of cancer. All correlates were mutually adjusted for each other. Results: In unadjusted analyses, women with a history of cancer took fewer mean daily steps (4,572 (standard deviation 2557) vs 5,029 (2679) steps/day) and had lower mean moderate-to-vigorous PA (74.9 (45.0) vs. 81.6 (46.7) minutes/day) than cancer-free women. In adjusted analyses, for cancer and cancer-free women, age, diabetes, overweight, and obesity were inversely associated with all metrics of PA (average vector magnitude, time in moderate-to-vigorous PA, step volume, time at ≥40 steps/minutes, and peak 30-minute step cadence). In unadjusted analyses, mean SB was similar for those with and without cancer (529.7 (98.1) vs. 521.7 (101.2) minutes/day). In adjusted analyses, for cancer and cancer-free women, age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, current smoking, overweight, and obesity were positive correlates of SB, while Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, weekly/daily alcohol intake, and excellent/very good/good self-rated health were inverse correlates of SB. Conclusion: Several sociodemographic, health, and chronic conditions were correlates of PA/SB for postmenopausal women with and without cancer.

Furthermore, depression and antidepressant use has been linked to white blood cell (WBC) count, a routinely measured inflammatory marker. We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of depressive symptoms and/or antidepressant use with WBC count among postmenopausal women. Analyses of cross-sectional data at enrollment were performed on 125,307 participants, 50-79 years of age, from the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trials and Observational Studies who met eligibility criteria, and a subset of those with 3-year follow-up data were examined for longitudinal relationships. Depressive symptoms were defined using the Burnam Algorithm whereas antidepressant use was defined using therapeutic class codes. WBC count (Kcell/ml) was obtained through laboratory evaluations of fasting blood samples. Multivariable regression modeling was performed taking sociodemographic, lifestyle and health characteristics into consideration. At enrollment, nearly 85% were non-users of antidepressants with no depressive symptoms, 5% were antidepressant users with no depressive symptoms, 9% were non-users of antidepressants with depressive symptoms, and 2% were users of antidepressants with depressive symptoms. In fully-adjusted models, cross-sectional relationships were observed whereby women in the 2nd (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.13), 3rd (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.12) or 4th (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.17) quartiles of WBC count were more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, and women in the 4th quartile were more likely to be users of antidepressants (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.15), compared to women in the 1st quartile. Compared to women who exhibited no depressive symptoms at either visit, those with consistent depressive symptoms at enrollment and at 3-year follow-up had faster decline in WBC count (β = -0.73, 95% CI: -1.33, -0.14) over time. No significant bidirectional relationships were observed between changes in depressive symptoms score and WBC count over time. In conclusion, depressive symptoms and/or antidepressant use were cross-sectionally related to higher WBC counts among postmenopausal women. Further evaluation of observed relationships is needed in the context of prospective cohort studies involving older adult men and women, with repeated measures of depression, antidepressant use, and WBC count.","paper_focus":"Behavioral and psychosocial;Diet and nutrition"},{"ms_id":"4581","title":"Longitudinal Associations Between Optimism and Objective Measures of Physical Functioning in Women","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Koga, Hayami K.","first_author":"Hayami K.

Prior work suggests optimism may protect health, but less is known about the association between optimism and objective physical functioning measures as individuals age. Objective: To evaluate the longitudinal association between optimism and 3 physical functioning measures. Design, setting, and participants: This was a prospective cohort study using data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) with participants recruited from 1993 to 1998 and followed up over 6 years. Data analysis was conducted from January 2022 to July 2022. Participants included postmenopausal women older than 65 years recruited from 40 clinical centers in the US. Exposure: Optimism was assessed at baseline using the Life Orientation Test-Revised. Main outcomes and measures: Physical functioning was measured at 4 time points across 6 years by study staff evaluating performance in grip strength, timed walk, and chair stands. Results: The final analytic sample included 5930 women (mean [SD] age, 70 [4] years). Linear mixed-effects models controlling for demographics, depression, health status, and health behaviors showed that higher optimism was associated with higher grip strength (β = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21-0.50) and number of chair stands (β = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.10) but not timed walk at baseline. Higher optimism was also associated with slower rates of decline in timed walk (β = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04) and number of chair stands (β = 0.01; 95% CI, 0-0.03) but not grip strength over time. Cox proportional hazards models showed that higher optimism was associated with lower hazards of reaching clinically defined thresholds of impairment for all 3 outcomes over 6 years of follow-up. For example, in fully adjusted models, for a 1-SD increase in optimism, hazard ratios for reaching impairment thresholds were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80-0.92) for grip strength, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-1.01) for timed walk, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98) for chair stands. Conclusion and relevance: In this cohort study of postmenopausal women, at baseline, higher optimism was associated with higher grip strength and number of chair stands but not with the time it took to walk 6 m. Higher optimism at baseline was also associated with maintaining healthier functioning on 2 of the 3 performance measures over time, including less decline in walking speed and in number of chair stands women could perform over 6 years of follow-up. Given experimental studies suggesting that optimism is modifiable, it may be a promising target for interventions to slow age-related declines in physical functioning. Future work should explore associations of optimism with maintenance of physical functioning in diverse populations.","paper_focus":"Behavioral and psychosocial;Physical Activity"},{"ms_id":"4687","title":"Low physical function post-cancer diagnosis is associated with higher mortality risk in postmenopausal women","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":" Gonzalo Encabo, Paola","first_author":"Paola  Gonzalo Encabo","full_citation":"Gonzalo-Encabo P, Vasbinder A, Bea JW, Reding KW, Laddu D, LaMonte MJ, Stefanick ML, Kroenke CH, Jung SY, Shadyab AH, Naughton MJ, Patel MI, Luo J, Banack HR, Sun Y, Simon MS, Dieli-Conwright CM.

The aim of this study is to determine whether declines in physical function after cancer diagnosis are associated with all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 8,068 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) who were diagnosed with cancer and had physical function assessed within 1-year of cancer diagnosis. Self-reported physical function was measured using the 10-item physical function subscale of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Cause of death was determined by medical record review with central adjudication and linkage to the National Death Index. Death was adjudicated through February 2022. Results: Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years from cancer diagnosis 3,316 (41.1%) women died. Our results showed that for every 10% decline in the physical function score after cancer diagnosis, all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality were significantly reduced by 12% (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.89) and (HR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.86 to 0.91), respectively.

Previous studies were primarily small clinic-based or registry studies with short follow-up and predominantly focused on premenopausal breast cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between infertility and postmenopausal breast cancer risk among participants in the Women's Health Initiative (analytic sample = 131,784; \u003e 25 years of follow-up). Methods: At study entry, participants were asked about their pregnancy history, infertility history, and diagnosed reasons for infertility. Incident breast cancers were self-reported with adjudication by trained physicians reviewing medical records. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risk of incident postmenopausal breast cancer for women with infertility (overall and specific infertility diagnoses) compared to parous women with no history of infertility. We examined mediation of these associations by parity, age at first term pregnancy, postmenopausal hormone therapy use at baseline, age at menopause, breastfeeding, and oophorectomy. Results: We observed a modest association between infertility (n = 23,406) and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (HR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.02-1.13). The association was largely mediated by age at first term pregnancy (natural indirect effect: 46.4% mediated, CI 12.2-84.3%). Conclusion: These findings suggest that infertility may be modestly associated with future risk of postmenopausal breast cancer due to age at first pregnancy and highlight the importance of incorporating reproductive history across the life course into breast cancer analyses.","paper_focus":"Cancer"},{"ms_id":"3940","title":"Physical function trajectory after wrist or lower arm fracture in postmenopausal women: Results from the Women’s Health Initiative Study","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Crandall, Carolyn","first_author":"Carolyn Crandall","full_citation":"Crandall CJ, Larson J, Shadyab AH, LeBoff MS, Wactawski-Wende J, Weitlauf JC, Saquib N, Cauley JA, Saquib J, Ensrud KE.

We found that women with versus those without distal forearm fracture were more likely to experience a 5-year decline in physical functioning, independent of initial physical functioning level. This association was most evident among women 80 years and older. Introduction: Physical functioning trajectory following lower arm or wrist fracture is not well understood. Purpose: This study is to evaluate physical functioning trajectory before vs. after lower arm or wrist fracture, stratified by age. Methods: We performed a nested case-control study of prospective data from the Women's Health Initiative Study (n = 2097 cases with lower arm or wrist fracture, 20,970 controls). Self-reported fractures and the physical functioning subscale of the RAND 36-item Short-Form Health Survey were assessed annually. We examined three physical functioning trajectory groups: stable, improving, and declining. Results: Mean (SD) number of physical functioning measurements was 5.2 (1.5) for cases and 5.0 (1.4) for controls. Declining physical functioning was observed among 20.4% of cases and 16.0% of controls. Compared to women without lower arm or wrist fracture, women with lower arm or wrist fracture were 33% more likely to experience declining physical functioning (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.33 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.49, reference group stable or improving physical functioning trajectory). Associations varied by age: age ≥ 80 years aOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.29-1.88); age 70-79 years aOR 1.29 (95% CI 1.09-1.52); age \u003c 70 years aOR 1.15 (95% CI 0.86-1.53) (pinteraction = 0.06). Associations between lower arm or wrist fracture and odds of declining physical functioning did not vary by baseline physical functioning or physical activity level. Conclusions: Women with lower arm or wrist fracture, particularly those aged 80 and older, were more likely to experience declines in physical functioning than women without such fractures, independent of baseline physical functioning level.

Objectives: This study assessed risk of HF and its subtypes conferred by ICAM1 p.K56M (rs5491). Methods: Associations of rs5491 with risk of HF and its subtypes were estimated among African American individuals in WHI (Women's Health Initiative). The study evaluated whether the association between rs5491 and HF hospitalizations was modified by baseline age. Subsequently, African-American women in WHI and MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) were pooled and analyses were repeated. Results: Among 8,401 women in WHI, the minor allele frequency of rs5491 was 20.7%, and 731 HF hospitalizations occurred over 19.2 years. The rs5491 variant was not associated with HF or its subtypes across WHI. Interaction analyses suggested that age as a continuous variable modified the association of rs5491 with HFpEF hospitalization (interaction P = 0.04). Upon categorizing women into age decades, rs5491 conferred increased risk of HFpEF among women ≥70 years (HR per additional rs5491 allele: 1.82 [95% CI: 1.25-2.65]; P = 0.002) but was not associated with HFpEF risk among women \u003c70 years.

Antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sedative/hypnotic medications were evaluated at WHI enrollment and 3-year follow-up visits. Performance-based physical function [Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)] was assessed at the 2012-2013 WHI-LLS visit.

This along with two earlier WHI nutrition biomarker studies having TEE assessments (n=1131 total), with 14.6 years (median) follow-up, constituted a prospective cohort for the study of EI and all-cause mortality.\n\nResults: An empirical biomarker for log (EI) was developed that had a correlation of 0.73 with log (feeding study-consumed EI). The overall association between EI and mortality was non-significant. The association, however, depended on age (P=0.009) with lower EI associated with lower mortality at younger ages, and also on preceding weight change history (P=0.03). Among participants with stable or increasing weight, mortality hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) for a 12% lower EI were 0.66 (0.51, 0.87) at age 60, 0.84 (0.72, 0.98) at age 70, and 1.06 (0.87, 1.29) at age 80.

Their prevalence, especially in ambulatory populations, is understudied and limited by few female participants and the use of short-duration (24- to 48-hour) monitoring. Objective: The objective of this study was to report the prevalence of frequent PVCs and NSVT in a community-based population of women likely to undergo electrocardiogram (ECG) screening by sequential patch monitoring. Methods: Participants from the Women's Health Initiative Strong and Healthy (WHISH) trial with no history of atrial fibrillation (AF) but 5-year predicted risk of incident AF ≥5% by CHARGE-AF score were randomly selected to undergo screening with 7-day ECG patch monitors at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Recordings were reviewed for PVCs and NSVT (\u003e5 beats); data were analyzed with multivariate regression models. Results: There were 1067 participants who underwent ECG screening at baseline, 866 at 6 months, and 777 at 12 months. Frequent PVCs were found on at least 1 patch from 4.3% of participants, and 1 or more episodes of NSVT were found in 12 (1.1%) women. PVC frequency directly correlated with CHARGE-AF score and NSVT on any patch. Detection of frequent PVCs increased with sequential monitoring. Conclusion: In postmenopausal women at high risk for AF, frequent PVCs were relatively common (4.3%) and correlated with higher CHARGE-AF score. As strategies for AF screening continue to evolve, particularly in those individuals at high risk of AF, the prevalence of incidental ventricular arrhythmias is an important benchmark to guide clinical decision-making.

GAUDI explicitly models ancestry-differential effects while borrowing information across segments with shared ancestry in admixed genomes. We demonstrate marked advantages of GAUDI over other methods through comprehensive simulation and real data analyses for traits with associated variants exhibiting ancestral-differential effects.

Objective: Therefore, the aim was to examine whether these lifestyle changes attenuated age-related physical functioning decline.  Design: In a randomized trial, the influence of 8-years of a low-fat dietary pattern intervention was examined through 20 years cumulative follow-up.\nParticipants: /setting; From 1993-1998, 48,835 postmenopausal women, ages 50-79 years with no prior breast cancer and negative baseline mammogram were randomized at 40 US clinical centers to dietary intervention or usual diet comparison groups (40/60). The intervention significantly reduced fat intake and increased vegetable, fruit, and grain intake.  Main outcome measures: In post hoc analyses, physical functioning, assessed using the RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), evaluated quality or limitations of 10 hierarchical physical activities. Longitudinal physical functioning, reported against a disability threshold (when assistance in daily activities is required) was the primary study outcome.\nStatistical analyses performed: Semiparametric linear mixed effect models (LME) were used to contrast physical functioning trajectories by randomization groups. Results: Physical functioning score, assessed 495,317 times with 11.0 (median) assessments per participant, was significantly higher in the intervention versus comparison groups through 12-years cumulative follow-up (P = 0.001), representing a reduction in age-related functional decline. The intervention effect subsequently attenuated and did not delay time to the disability threshold. Among women in the dietary intervention versus comparison groups, aged 50-59 years, who were physically inactive at entry, a persistent, statistically significant, favorable influence on physical functioning with associated delay in crossing the disability threshold by approximately a year was seen (P-interaction = 0.007). Conclusions: In the WHI DM randomized trial, a dietary intervention which significantly reduced breast cancer mortality also significantly reduced age-related functional decline through 12 years, which was attenuated with longer follow-up.","paper_focus":"Diet and nutrition;Physical Activity"},{"ms_id":"4365","title":"Associations of accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior with incident clinical osteoporotic fractures among older women: the OPACH study","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Nguyen, Steve","first_author":"Steve Nguyen","full_citation":"Nguyen S, Bellettiere J, Anuskiewicz B, Di C, Carlson J, Natarajan L, LaMonte MJ, LaCroix AZ.

As a motivating example for two-stage regression, we consider regression calibration, a popular approach for addressing covariate measurement error. The sandwich variance approach has been rarely applied in regression calibration, despite it requiring less computation time than popular resampling approaches for variance estimation, specifically the bootstrap. This is likely due to requiring specialized statistical coding. We first outline the steps needed to compute the sandwich variance estimator. We then develop a convenient method of computation in R for sandwich variance estimation, which leverages standard regression model outputs and existing R functions and can be applied in the case of a simple random sample or complex survey design. We use a simulation study to compare the sandwich to a resampling variance approach for both settings. Finally, we further compare these two variance estimation approaches for data examples from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The sandwich variance estimator typically had good numerical performance, but simple Wald bootstrap confidence intervals were unstable or over-covered in certain settings, particularly when there was high correlation between covariates or large measurement error.","paper_focus":"Study methods"},{"ms_id":"4544","title":"Traditional Mexican dietary pattern and cancer risk among women of Mexican descent","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Lorona, Nicole","first_author":"Nicole Lorona","full_citation":"Loroña NC, Santiago-Torres M, Lopez-Pentecost M, Garcia L, Shadyab AH, Sun Y, Kroenke CH, Snetselaar LG, Stefanick ML, Neuhouser ML.

The highest tertile of MexD score was associated with a lower risk of all-cancer incidence (HR: 0.67; 95% CI 0.49-0.91; p-trend: 0.01) and colorectal cancer (HR: 0.38; 95% CI 0.14-0.998; p-trend \u003c 0.05), with each unit increase in the MexD score associated with a 6% lower risk of all-cancer incidence (HR: 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-0.99). There was no statistically significant association with risk of breast cancer. Conclusion: Consumption of a traditional Mexican diet was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cancer incidence and colorectal cancer. Confirmation of these findings in future studies is important, given the prevalence of colorectal cancer and a growing U.S. population of women of Mexican descent.","paper_focus":"Cancer;Diet and nutrition"},{"ms_id":"4324","title":"Photosensitizing antihypertensive medication and risk of skin cancer among postmenopausal women","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Hou, Alexander","first_author":"Alexander Hou","full_citation":"Hou A, Li Y, Shadyab AH, Han J, Eaton CB, Qureshi A, Cho E.

We therefore examined the association between home radon exposure and risk of stroke among middle-aged and older women in the United States. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years at baseline (1993-1998) in the Women's Health Initiative. We measured exposures as 2-day, indoor, lowest living-level average radon concentrations in picocuries per liter (pCi/L) as estimated in 1993 by the US Geological Survey and reviewed by the Association of American State Geologists under the Indoor Radon Abatement Act. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate risk of incident, neurologist-adjudicated stroke during follow-up through 2020 as a hazard ratio and 95% CI, adjusting for study design and participant demographic, social, behavioral, and clinical characteristics. Results: Among 158,910 women without stroke at baseline (mean age 63.2 years; 83% white), 6,979 incident strokes were identified over follow-up (mean 13.4 years). Incidence rates were 333, 343, and 349 strokes per 100,000 woman-years at radon concentrations of \u003c2, 2-4, and \u003e4 pCi/L, respectively. Compared with women living at concentrations \u003c2 pCi/L, those at 2-4 and \u003e4 pCi/L had higher covariate-adjusted risks of incident stroke: hazard ratio (95% CI) 1.06 (0.99-1.13) and 1.14 (1.05-1.22). Using nonlinear spline functions to model radon, stroke risk was significantly elevated at concentrations ranging from 2 to 4 pCi/L (p = 0.0004), that is, below the United States Environmental Protection Agency Radon Action Level for mitigation (4 pCi/L). Associations were slightly stronger for ischemic (especially cardioembolic, small vessel occlusive, and large artery atherosclerotic) than hemorrhagic stroke, but otherwise robust in sensitivity analyses. Discussion: Radon exposure is associated with moderately increased stroke risk among middle-aged and older women in the United States, suggesting that promulgation of a lower Radon Action Level may help reduce the domestic impact of cerebrovascular disease on public health.","paper_focus":"Cardiovascular Disease;Physical \u0026 Built Environment"},{"ms_id":"4245","title":"Engagement With Remote Delivery Channels in a Physical Activity Intervention for Senior Women in the US","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Mendoza-Vasconez, Andrea","first_author":"Andrea Mendoza-Vasconez","full_citation":"Mendoza-Vasconez AS, King AC, Chandler G, Mackey S, Follis S, Stefanick ML.

Design: Secondary analysis of data from WHISH, a pragmatic trial that used passive randomized consent. Setting: United States (remote intervention in all 50 states). Sample: 18,080 U.S. women, aged 68-99 years, assigned to the WHISH PA intervention arm. Measures: 6 dichotomous variables operationalized engagement: Engagement with Targeted Inserts, Email (opened), Email (clicked links), Website (logging in), Website (tracking), Interactive Voice Response (IVR). PA was measured using the CHAMPS PA questionnaire. Analysis: Linear regressions evaluated effects of engagement on PA. Conditional Inference Trees identified subgroups of participants engaging with different channels based on demographic and psychosocial variables. Results: Engagement with each channel, except IVR, was associated with significantly more hours/week of PA (square root coefficients .29 - .13, P values \u003c.001). Consistently across channels, features that identified subgroups of participants with higher engagement included younger age, and higher levels of PA and physical function. Subgroups with the highest engagement differed from those with the lowest in most participant characteristics. Conclusions: For equitable population-level impact via large-scale remotely-delivered PA programs, it may be necessary to identify strategies to engage and target harder to reach subgroups more precisely.","paper_focus":"Physical Activity"},{"ms_id":"3912","title":"Using simultaneous regression calibration to study the effect of multiple error-prone exposures on disease risk utilizing biomarkers developed from a controlled feeding study","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Zheng, Cheng","first_author":"Yiwen Zhang","full_citation":"Zhang Y, Dai R, Huang Y, Prentice R, Zheng C.

The joint regression calibration method has been developed for measurement error correction when objectively measured biomarkers are available for all dietary components of interest. Unfortunately, objectively measured biomarkers are only available for very few dietary components, which limits the application of the joint regression calibration method. Recently, for single dietary components, controlled feeding studies have been performed to develop new biomarkers for many more dietary components. However, it is unclear whether the biomarkers separately developed for single dietary components are valid for joint calibration. In this paper, we show that biomarkers developed for single dietary components cannot be used for joint regression calibration. We propose new methods to utilize controlled feeding studies to develop valid biomarkers for joint regression calibration to estimate the association between multiple dietary components simultaneously with the disease of interest. Asymptotic distribution theory for the proposed estimators is derived. Extensive simulations are performed to study the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators. We apply our methods to examine the joint effects of sodium and potassium intakes on cardiovascular disease incidence using the Women's Health Initiative cohort data. We identify positive associations between sodium intake and cardiovascular diseases as well as negative associations between potassium intake and cardiovascular disease.","paper_focus":"Study methods"},{"ms_id":"3807","title":"Accelerometer-measured physical activity, sedentary time and heart failure risk in women ages 63-99 years","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"LaMonte, Michael","first_author":"Michael LaMonte","full_citation":"LaMonte MJ, LaCroix AZ, Nguyen S, Evenson KR, Di C, Stefanick ML, Hyde ET, Anuskiewicz B, Eaton CB.

Objective: To examine incident HF and its subtypes with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced EF (HFrEF) according to accelerometer-measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary time. Design, setting, and participants: This was a prospective cohort study, the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) in Older Women study, conducted from March 2012 to April 2014. Included in the analysis were women aged 63 to 99 years without known HF, who completed hip-worn triaxial accelerometry for 7 consecutive days. Follow-up for incident HF occurred through February 2022. Data were analyzed from March to December 2023. Exposure: Daily PA (total, light, moderate to vigorous PA [MVPA], steps) and sedentary (total, mean bout duration) behavior. Main outcomes and measures: Adjudicated incident HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF. Results: A total of 5951 women (mean [SD] age, 78.6 [6.8] years) without known HF were included in this analysis. Women self-identified with the following race and ethnicity categories: 2004 non-Hispanic Black (33.7%), 1022 Hispanic (17.2%), and 2925 non-Hispanic White (49.2%). There were 407 HF cases (257 HFpEF; 110 HFrEF) identified through a mean (SD) of 7.5 (2.6) years (range, 0.01-9.9 years) of follow-up. Fully adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for overall HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF associated with a 1-SD increment were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.95), 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.91), and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.81-1.28) for minutes per day total PA; 0.74 (95% CI, 0.63-0.88), 0.71 (95% CI, 0.57-0.88), and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.62-1.12) for steps per day; and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.04-1.33), 1.29 (95% CI, 1.10-1.51), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.75-1.18) for minutes per day total sedentary. Cubic spline curves for overall HF and HFpEF were significant inverse for total PA and steps per day and positive for total sedentary. Light PA and MVPA were inversely associated with overall HF (HR per 1 SD: 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98 and 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97) and HFpEF (0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.93 and 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.01) but not HFrEF. Associations did not meaningfully differ when stratified by age, race and ethnicity, body mass index, physical function, or comorbidity score. Results for sedentary bout duration were inconsistent.Conclusions and relevance: Higher accelerometer-measured PA (MVPA, light PA, steps per day) was associated with lower risk (and greater total sedentary time with higher risk) of overall HF and HFpEF in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of older women. Increasing PA and reducing sedentary time for primary HFpEF prevention may have relevant implications for cardiovascular resilience and healthy aging in later life.","paper_focus":"Cardiovascular Disease;Physical Activity"},{"ms_id":"3203","title":"Fatty acid intake and polyunsaturated fatty acid biomarkers and risk of total knee or hip arthroplasty among older women in the Women’s Health Initiative","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Orchard, Tonya","first_author":"Tonya Orchard","full_citation":"Orchard T, McLaughlin E, Winschel T, Shadyab A, Laddu D, Vitolins M, Florina C, Jackson R.

Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to estimate risk of arthroplasty. Results: Risk of THA was associated with higher intake of arachidonic acid, [multivariable hazard ratio (HR) quartile (Q)4 vs Q1: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.34; p for linear trend = 0.03] and higher intake of eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid [(EPA+DHA), HR Q4 vs Q1: 1.20; 95% CI:1.05, 1.39; p for linear trend=0.003]. There was a linear trend (p=0.04) for higher risk of THA with higher erythrocyte EPA+DHA in BMI-adjusted models; however, there was no significant difference in THA by quartiles of erythrocyte EPA+DHA (p=0.10). Dietary fatty acids and erythrocyte PUFAs were not significantly associated with risk of TKA. Conclusions: Higher baseline intakes of arachidonic acid and EPA+DHA were associated with a modestly higher risk of THA. No association was found between fatty acids and TKA. Further research in populations with direct measures of osteoarthritis severity is needed to better understand the importance of PUFAs in modulating osteoarthritis and arthroplasty risk.","paper_focus":"Diet and nutrition"},{"ms_id":"4876","title":"Alcohol consumption and the diversity of the oral microbiome in postmenopausal women","stage_id":"12","stage_summary":"Publication","stage_web_summary":"Published","convener":"Millen, Amy","first_author":"Amy Millen","full_citation":"Maley SJ, Yue Y, Burns KF, Hovey KM, Wactawski-Wende J, Freudenheim JL, McSkimming DI, LaMonte MJ, Andrews CA, Sun Y, Buck M, Millen AE.

Women were categorized as nondrinkers, drinking \u003c1 drink/wk, ≥1 to \u003c7 drinks/wk, or ≥7 drinks/wk for total alcohol consumption and for beer, wine, and liquor consumption. The composition and diversity of the oral microbiome was assessed from subgingival plaque samples using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to examine β-diversity (between-sample diversity) in the microbiome between alcohol consumption categories. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the mean α-diversity (within-sample diversity), assessed by the Shannon index (species evenness), Chao1 index (species richness), and observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) count and the mean relative abundance of 245 bacterial taxa across alcohol consumption categories. Results: Over half of the participants (67%) consumed alcohol, with 14% reporting ≥1 drink/d.

However, the impact of choice of approach on air pollution estimates and health-effects associations remains unclear. Objectives: Our objective is to compare particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μ m ( PM 2.5 ) concentrations and resulting health effects associations using multiple estimation approaches previously used in epidemiologic analyses. Methods: We assigned annual PM 2.5 exposure estimates from 1999 to 2004 derived from 11 different approaches to Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) participant addresses within the contiguous US. Approaches included geostatistical interpolation approaches, land-use regression or spatiotemporal models, satellite-derived approaches, air dispersion and chemical transport models, and hybrid models. We used descriptive statistics and plots to assess relative and absolute agreement among exposure estimates and examined the impact of approach on associations between PM 2.5 and death due to natural causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and incident CVD events, adjusting for individual-level covariates and climate-based region. Results: With a few exceptions, relative agreement of approach-specific PM 2.5 exposure estimates was high for PM 2.5 concentrations across the contiguous US. Agreement among approach-specific exposure estimates was stronger near PM 2.5 monitors, in certain regions of the country, and in 2004 vs. 1999. Collectively, our results suggest but do not quantify lower agreement at local spatial scales for PM 2.5 . There was no evidence of large differences in health effects associations with PM 2.5 among estimation approaches in analyses adjusted for climate region. Conclusions: Different estimation approaches produced similar spatial patterns of PM 2.5 concentrations across the contiguous US and in areas with dense monitoring data, and PM 2.5 -health effects associations were similar among estimation approaches. PM 2.5 estimates and PM 2.5 -health effects associations may differ more in samples drawn from smaller areas or areas without substantial monitoring data, or in analyses with finer adjustment for participant location. Our results can inform decisions about PM 2.5 estimation approach in epidemiologic studies, as investigators balance concerns about bias, efficiency, and resource allocation.

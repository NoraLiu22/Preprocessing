Extending for more than a mile from the entrance are caverns the walls of which are painted with dramatic murals dating from the Gravettian culture (some 25 000 years BP) Some of the paintings and engravings, however, could date from the later Magdalenian era (16 000 years BP). This area once had a great river flowing through it, cutting underground channels which were later used by humans for shelter and eventually for mural painting. The walls of seven of the chambers at Pech Merle have fresh, lifelike images of a woolly mammoth, spotted horses, bovids, reindeer, handprints, and some human figures. Footprints of children, preserved in what was once clay, have been found more than a kilometre underground. Within a ten kilometre radius of the site are ten other caves with prehistoric art of the Upper Palaeolithic period, but none of these are open to the public. During the Ice Age the caves were very probably used as places of refuge by prehistoric peoples when the area had an Arctic climate, very cold temperatures, and native animal species very different from those of the present day. It is supposed that, at some point in the past, mudslides  covered the cave entrances providing an airtight seal until the 20th century. The cave at Pech Merle has been open to the public since 1926. Visiting groups are limited in size and number so as not to destroy the delicate artwork with the excessive humidity, heat and carbon dioxide produced by breathing."><META Name="keywords" Content="Pech, Merle, prehistoric, cave, painting, site, France, murals, Gravettian, engravings, Magdalenian, mammoth, spotted, horses, bovids, reindeer, handprints, human, figures, footprints, children, clay, Upper, Palaeolithic, Ice, Age, Arctic, climate, cold, temperatures, species, humidity, heat, carbon dioxide, breathing"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="window-target" content="_top" ><meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> </HEAD><BODY><br><br><center><h2><b><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A></b></h2></center><center><br /><!-- CSS file for site and menu --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/layout.css" /><link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" href="https://www.donsmaps.com/favicon.ico"></center><center><script type="text/javascript"><!--//--></script></center><!-- Menu down Left Hand Side --><div class="left_menu">Navigation<ul ><li><a class="normal" href="abeltasmantrack.html">Abel Tasman Track in New Zealand</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="kimberleyart.html">Aboriginal Art of the Kimberleys</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginalrockart.html">Aboriginal art on the Northern Tablelands of NSW</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginals.html">Aborigines of Australia</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="pataudtools.html">Abri Pataud Tools</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="raymonden.html">Abri de Raymonden</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="mihisalisburyaccess.html">Access to Mihi Gorge and to Salisbury Waters below the junction with  Mihi Creek </a></li><li><a class="normal" href="loess.html">Achenheim -

Extending for more than a mile from the entrance are caverns the walls of which are painted with dramatic murals dating from the Gravettian culture (some 25 000 years BP) Some of the paintings and engravings, however, could date from the later Magdalenian era (16 000 years BP). This area once had a great river flowing through it, cutting underground channels which were later used by humans for shelter and eventually for mural painting. The walls of seven of the chambers at Pech Merle have fresh, lifelike images of a woolly mammoth, spotted horses, bovids, reindeer, handprints, and some human figures. Footprints of children, preserved in what was once clay, have been found more than a kilometre underground. Within a ten kilometre radius of the site are ten other caves with prehistoric art of the Upper Palaeolithic period, but none of these are open to the public. During the Ice Age the caves were very probably used as places of refuge by prehistoric peoples when the area had an Arctic climate, very cold temperatures, and native animal species very different from those of the present day. It is supposed that, at some point in the past, mudslides  covered the cave entrances providing an airtight seal until the 20th century. The cave at Pech Merle has been open to the public since 1926. Visiting groups are limited in size and number so as not to destroy the delicate artwork with the excessive humidity, heat and carbon dioxide produced by breathing.</b><br /><br />Text above from Wikipedia. <br /><br /><center><a href="images28/pechmerleaerial.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images28/pechmerleaerialsm.jpg" alt = "Pech Merle google earth image" width="1000" height="597" ></a>  <br /><br />Pech Merle site and the nearby village of Cabrerets.   <br /><br />Photo: Google Earth</center><br clear="all"><p><a href="images38/dsc01629pechmerleoutside.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images38/dsc01629pechmerleoutsidesm.jpg" alt = "pech merle discoverer" width="450" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />Today Pech Merle is a popular tourist destination, with regular cave tours. <br /><br />Photo: Ralph Frenken 2019</p><br clear="all"><br /><br /><!--http://www.pechmerle.com/visite.html map of the cave --> <p><a href="images28/pechmerleaerial2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images28/pechmerleaerial2sm.jpg" alt = "pech merle aerial" width="430" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><!-- <a href="images3/cabrerets.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images3/cabreretssm.jpg" alt = "photo of cabrerets" width="100" height="60" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>--><br />Cabrerets and the Pech Merle site. Note the white limestone evident throughout the area.  <br /><br />Pech Merle is a cave in the south of France in the Department called Lot. (Quercy is the pre-Napoleonic name of the province, still in popular use. Pech means hill, and Pech Merle is the highest hill in its local region) It is at an elevation of 280m on the eastern side of the hill called Pech Merle.<br /><br /> Pech Merle was discovered in 1922 by three teenagers, Marthe David, age 13, her brother André David, age 16 and Henri Dutetre, age 15.  The examination of the paintings and engravings was     immediately begun by Father Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Lemozi, the priest of Cabrerets.  The galleries of the cave are on average 10 m wide and the height of the ceilings is about 5 to 10 m. There are two  levels of the cave, but there are only paintings on the first level. 300 m of the walls are painted. <br /><br />Photo: http://www.quercy.net/pechmerle/english/introduction.html <br />Text: Wikipedia </p><br clear="all"><br /><br />  <p>  <a href="images30/pechplancmy.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/pechplancmysm.jpg" alt = "Pech Merle Plan " width="339" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Plan of Pech Merle <br /><br />Photo: Heinrich Wendel (&copy; The Wendel Collection, Neanderthal Museum)</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />  <br /><br /><hr align="center" width="20%"> <br /><br /><center><a href="images26/archsitessthfrancnobasemap3.gif" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images26/archsitessthfrancnobasemap3sm.gif" alt = "map of sites in southern France" width="615" height="400"></a></center><br clear = "left"><center>Map of   sites in the south of France including Pech Merle,  showing ice age coastlines. <br /><br />Note - Use this   <A HREF ="images26/archsitessthfrancnobasemap3.pdf">pdf file </a> if you wish to print this map on a single sheet of paper.<br /><br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock version 2012/05/26</center><br clear = "all"><hr align="center" width="20%"> <br /><br /><p><a href="images28/discoverer.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images28/discoverersm.jpg" alt = "pech merle discoverer" width="405" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />One of the two discoverers of the cave, Andr&eacute; David.<br /><br />Photo: http://www.pechmerle.com/english/introduction.html</p><br clear="all"><br /><br /><blockquote> Why is it called 'Pech Merle'? In the lower third of France is a southern Latin culture called langue d'oc or occitan. Pech is the french writing of the occitan word pu&egrave;g which means a hill. We pronounce it as in "fresh". It appears in the name of many localities, written pech, puech, pioch, pey, and you can read it on the signs of the regional roads. In old french, the word is puy, as in "Puy de Dome". Merle is sometimes translated as blackbird, so we can think of the name as Blackbird Hill. </blockquote>Text above:  http://www.quercy.net/pechmerle/english/introduction.html<br /><br /><p><a href="images28/pechmerleoutline.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images28/pechmerleoutlinesm.jpg" alt = "pech merle plan" width="502" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><!--<a href="images3/pmerlephotoplan.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images3/pmerlephotoplansm.jpg" alt = "photo plan of pech merle" width="100" height="60" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> --><br /><br />Photo of the surface of the site with superimposed plan of the cave.<br /><br /> Photo: http://vm.kemsu.ru/en/palaeolith/pesh-merl.html  </p><br clear="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images30/pechmerleplanleroig.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/pechmerleplanleroigsm.jpg" alt = "pech merle plan" width="1000" height="819" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Pech Merle plan<br /><br /> 1.

According to the findings published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ancient artists were simply drawing what they saw around them.<br /><br />  The team - which included scientists from Britain, Germany, Mexico, the United States, Spain and Russia - was led by Melanie Pruvost of the Department of Evolutionary Genetics at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) and the Department of Natural Sciences at the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin.'We had a project on the domestication of the horse, and were looking at this particular color variation in pre-domesticated horses,' Arne Ludwig, one of the German researchers, told Deutsche Welle.'Then an American scientist came up to me at a conference in Leipzig and said, 'Do you know that we have identified the genetic mutation for spotted horses?' So, since we knew about the Pech Merle paintings, we looked for evidence of that mutation from that time.'<br /><br />By analyzing bones and teeth of 31 horses in Siberia and Europe dating back as many as 35&nbsp;000 years, researchers found that six shared a gene associated with a type of leopard spotting seen in some modern horses. Archeologists believe that horses were only domesticated about 6&nbsp;000 years ago, which means that the horses depicted in Pech Merle were hunted, not bred. 'We assume that the people who did these cave paintings were horse-hunters,' said Ludwig. 'They needed to be able to observe their environment very precisely. Their whole culture was practically based on hunting horses, because horses were the most common large mammals at the time.'<br /><br />Patrick Skinner, archeologist at Cambridge University, says the findings reinforce current theories of how humans interacted and perceived animals at the time. 'The characteristics of the animals were very important for how the Upper Paleolithic people interacted with them,' he told Deutsche Welle. 'So the new evidence reinforces the idea that they aren't just painting animals for the sake of painting animals. It's their idiosyncratic behaviors that make them important.' It is difficult to judge how common the spotted horses were, based on the handful of samples tested, but Ludwig thinks the percentages suggest they were 'not rare.' This is also a new insight, since many researchers had considered a spotted coat unlikely for Paleolithic horses.<br /><br />The ability to genotype Stone Age animals is a relatively new tool for archeologists, and the team behind the discovery are confident that, as more and more genetic codes are identified, we will soon know much more about the appearance of these animals. French archeologist Jean Clottes, president of the International Federation of Rock Art Organizations, is convinced that the new discovery does nothing to damage the spiritual dimension of the cave art, or the creative reputation of the Stone Age artist. He points out that spots depicted on the Pech Merle horses also appear above and below the animals, not just on them - so, he argues, they must have had another meaning too. 'This does not change our perceptions at all,' he told Deutsche Welle. 'It's interesting, because it shows that the Pech Merle horses were not a figment of the imagination. Fine, but this works for those two horses, and that's it. We've known for a hundred years and more that these people painted animals which existed.'Ludwig agrees. 'There's no way you could rule out that these spots generally have a ritual, shamanistic or religious value for the people in those days,' he says. 'But that's just speculation. All we can say now as geneticists is that these horses existed then.' 'The discovery doesn't prove anything for or against any interpretation,' adds Clottes. 'There are hundreds of cave paintings and the majority of the animals represented are naturalistic, and this is another example. So what? But there are also what we call composite animals - for example, a head of a horse with horns. These are fantastical.'<br /><br />But Ludwig also notes that it is striking how the proportions of tan and spotted horses match the numbers depicted in cave art.

The Magdalenian epoch is synonymous in many people's minds with reindeer hunters, although Magdalenian sites also contain extensive evidence for the hunting of red deer, horses, and other large mammals present in Europe toward the end of the last ice age.

Where the Inuits have intercourse with white men, they barter for cheese-knives or long-bladed butcher-knives, remove the double-handle from the tang, and put on a single one about three times as long, which can be readily grasped by both hands. The old knives were made of reindeer-horn or from the shin-bone of the reindeer.</i><br /><br />This is a fascinating object. It is not a lissoir, since it is not broad enough, nor strong enough to perform the function of vigorously working hides for making leather. In the case of the Magdalenians, a snow knife would not have been used for making igloos, but perhaps for cutting small blocks of snow for melting for drinking water when placed in a leather bucket or wooden receptacle within a warm tent or a cave, perhaps near a fire. It could also have been used after a heavy fall of snow to cut an air hole or exit from the cave or tent. <br /><br />Photo: Ralph Frenken 2019<br />Additional text: Don Hitchcock, Wikipedia<br />Origin: La Bergerie Cave, Caniac, Lot<br />Source: Pech Merle Museum</p><br clear="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images38/dsc01664necklacepechmerle.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images38/dsc01664necklacepechmerlesm.jpg" alt = "pech merle" width="521" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Magdalenian necklace from La Bergerie Cave, Caniac, Lot. <br /><br />The necklace is made up of fossil dentalium shells, as well as reindeer and ibex incisors. <br /><br />The fossil dentalium shells would have come from the local limestone plateau which is Middle to Late Jurassic in age.<br /><br />Photo: Ralph Frenken 2019<br />Source: Pech Merle Museum</p><br clear="all"><br /><br /><p><img src="clickphotos/necklaceshellsfox.jpg" alt = "necklaceshellsfox.jpg" width="347" height="335" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"><a href="images28/dolniimg_2014b.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images28/dolniimg_2014bsm.jpg" alt = "Jewellery" width="276" height="335" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />(left) Gravettian  Necklace made of fossil <i>Dentalium badense</i> shells and teeth of the arctic fox, Dolní Věstonice.<br /><br />Photo: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Jelinek (1975)</span></a><br /><br />(right) Gravettian  Necklace of fossil <i>Dentalium badense</i> shells.

They came to the cave to die: their skeletons have been found there. <br /><br />During hibernation, the females gave birth.

I am convinced that it contains others that will be revealed gradually, through patient investigation by researchers.<br /><br />According to an old belief, widespread among nearby residents, the bushy 'great hill', is hollow like a sponge.Witness the many natural vents that open here and there on the slopes of the hill, complicated wells and mazes, haunts of badgers, foxes, wild rabbits, and where hunters lose their ferrets down holes. <br /><br />These details make it reasonable to assume that Pech-Merle still holds discoveries for cavers and prehistorians alike. It was called by  Abbé Breuil the 'limestone Sistine Chapel of  Lot', after the discoveries of 1922.<br /><br />The story of  prehistory is far from being exhausted in our neighbourhood, and it would be a foolhardy researcher who  presents to the public a complete inventory accumulated by man or nature from the mysterious treasures  of the 'mountain'.<br /><br />In any case, here is a new chapter about the site which is quite exciting,  to add to what has already been published on Pech-Merle. Le Combel is a valuable complement to the discoveries of 1922 and brings  to them new meaning and significance. The coming book will include discoveries in the large cave since 1929.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Location and discovery</b><br /><br />Le Combel (or the trough) is located in the hill of Pech-Merle, at 515 metres altitude, on the right bank of the little valley of the Sagne. Around 1922, after the discovery of the painted galleries of Pech-Merle,  for a quarter-century, thanks to the generous assistance of Mr. Jean Lebaudy and Mlle de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, we became sure that the prehistoric painters, in their paths to the rooms and passages decorated by them, had never used the daunting trenches, often clogged and with absolutely no evidence of  human use, which we explored  for 2 years, when we made the map, study, and development of the  sinkholes and other methods of access  to the cave.<br /><br />The first traces of Palaeolithic man seemed to us to appear abruptly at the entry to the Room of the Archer, (<i>the Chamber of the Wounded Man&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>) which we followed until the middle of the 'gallery of the bear' and to the 'boneyard' and noted the busiest points, which were in the immediate vicinity of the 'ceiling hieroglyphics' is all we could say about the comings and goings of our quaternary ancestors in the basement of Pech Merle. But the traces appeared suddenly, so that we had no idea how the painters had got there, so deep in the galleries, without leaving any trace of their entry. <br /><br />Where did these first painters   come from? Where was the entrance they had long used? Mystery!<br /><br />However, a cone of debris, consisting of limestone gravel , in which we collected, in 1923, a <i>Helix vermiculata</i> certainly came  from the outside. We had always assumed that there was in these parts, a chimney, or some more or less wide opening, that once, before being completely obstructed, served as an entrance for the Aurignacian people who painted the cave. <p><a href="images30/helix.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/helixsm.jpg" alt = "helix" width="496" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><i>Eobania vermiculata</i>, also known as <i>Helix vermiculata</i>, common name the 'chocolate-band snail', is a species of large, air-breathing, land snails, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicidae, the true snails or typical snails. <br /><br />Photo: tato grasso<br />Permission: Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.<br />Text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />Behind this mound, the  gallery of Pech Merle could, in addition, continue with the same surprise and the same interest.<br /><br />Such were the assumptions we have made ​​many times since 1922, when, in November 1949, André David, the owner since shortly after he first discovered  Le Combel,   expressed the desire to put in a sondage, to dig a hole near the galleries already known. Its purpose was twofold: to find the depth of the soil once cultivated here, and if possible identify new galleries.<br /><br />At once attentive and intrigued, I established a regular routine of digging starting in early November.  Here is the result.<br /><br />On the surface, thin topsoil surmounting a sterile level of red earth. At 130 cm deep, a layer with a thickness of 80 cm, containing much iron ore slag, with pottery shards that suggested a fairly large foundry of the Iron Age, probably from the time of   la Tène, as there are others in the area, at Valadié and Ferrières, commune de Lentillac.<br /><br />(<i>The la Tène culture was an eastern European late Iron Age culture which developed and flourished  from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />The objects found Combel in the aforementioned layer, belong to an open air site. At the time of la Tène, the  entry to the Combel galleries  were here,  clogged undoubtedly for a long time by scree which gradually become very compact.<br /><br />In fact, since the occupation by the men of la Tène, that is to say from about 2200 years ago, the narrow pipe filled with about 130 cm of debris, while the roof of the galleries of Pech Merle which were discovered in 1922 were about ten metres below the surface. <br /><br />At a depth of 550 cm, limestone boulders, gravel, limestone and the appearance of a wall forming an abri,  which although broken and rough on the top, was smooth below and similar to the roof of the galleries found in 1922.<br /><br />Encouraged by this analogy, André David, instead of continuing the excavation deeper, set about clearing away the material along a horizontal line.  As he advanced the gravel became less resistant,  indicating almost certainly that he had    reached  the edge of the alluvial fan. After digging an area 3 metres long, on Friday, December  2, 1949, around noon, his crowbar suddenly met no resistance. He had punctured a gallery of the Pech Merle complex. <br /><br />There was the same exhilaration as  at Pech-Merle, during that night of 1922, when the scene of horses and hands came to light after thousands of years!<br /><br />The hole was expanded, just enough for the passage of a man, and soon, André and his companion, in silent admiration, were able to make  a stunning walk in front of large columns formed by the roots of oak, in the midst of fossil bones in several beautiful galleries, painted and engraved, remaining inviolate, no doubt, for many centuries, as seems to be shown by  the complete absence of traces of metals, ceramics, etc, in other words the history of man...<br /><br />That same evening, I visited the new underground in the company of  MM. André David, Abel Bessac, Albert Colonge, Roger  Vinel, and  Roger Theron,  Mayor of  Cabrerets.<br /><br />Eight days later, M. Séverin Blanc, Director of District Prehistoric Antiquities, who I had made ​​aware of the good news, who had traveled in turn, the labyrinths of Combe and was happy to see firsthand the importance the recent discovery.<br /><br />I spent long months in a survey of the new paintings and engravings, making a complete record concerning the new  Combel galleries, which includes more than 200 handwritten pages, large format, and hundreds of illustrations. Here are some excerpts.<br /><br /><b>Description of the new galleries<br /><br /><p><a href="images38/rootscaverng.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images38/rootscaverngsm.jpg" alt = "oak tree" width="441" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />The room of roots</b><br /><br />At 18 metres from the entrance to le  Combel there is a curious phenomenon of underground vegetation. It consists of a nine metres  high vertical column, fairly rounded, with a mean diameter of 30 cm, consisting of hundreds of small oak roots, although alive, and entangled throughout their length. They sink into the clay and produce around their base, small offspring, which remain white and can not flourish in the absence of light. This graceful, most unusual pillar  contains no rigid support and moves at the slightest shock, as would a huge ponytail, tossed by the wind. It is now protected by a metal guard. <br /><br />Photo:  http://en.pechmerle.com/the-prehistory-center/the-pech-merle-cave/visit-the-cave/</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><!--  <p><a href="images30/oaktree.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/oaktreesm.jpg" alt = "oak tree" width="332" height="450" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is the oak tree whose roots have forced their way through the roof of Le Combel.  <br /><br />Photo: http://www.travelfranceonline.com/pech-merle-cave-negative-hands-quercy/</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> --><p><a href="images38/dsc01713questiontree.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images38/dsc01713questiontreesm.jpg" alt = "oak tree" width="294" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />This three trunked oak tree with a question mark painted on it is believed to be the one whose roots have forced their way through the roof of Le Combel.  <br /><br />Photo: Ralph Frenken 2019</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />In the light of the lamps, all of it seemed hairy,  sparkling like  grass or cobwebs in the morning, at sunrise, when they are covered with frost or dew.<br /><br />These tiny tentacles, the size of a human hair, had gone through limestone ten metres thick, to which  must be added the 9 metres between the arch area of the cave, making a total of  19 meters, not counting their penetration into the wet floor of the cave.<br /><br />This plant column, placed like an ornament in the middle of a large room, a little bare, 12 metres wide, constituted a spectacle as graceful as it was rare. <br /><br /><b>Fossils, wallows, concretions.</b><br /><br />At 38 metres from the entrance, in the 'hall of lions', there are fifteen beds (wallows or holes) dug by cave bears or cave lions, in which can be found  bones (including several jaws) next to a reindeer antlers and a limestone block, very polished by friction.<br /><br />In  the  salle du carrefour, the crossroads, located about 22 metres from the last wallow, there is a beautiful and lush forest of stalactites and stalagmites. There are a multitude of pendants, sometimes tapered and curved, sometimes spindle shaped or  breast shaped.<br /><br />  There are corals,  infinitely nuanced polyps, 'pearls' scattered here and there, sometimes grouped in profusion in a bowl filled with clear water.<br /><br />The decor is magnificent, giving the impression of a beautiful fairy room or a prestigious snowy landscape, as we see in a beautiful dream.<br /><br />Under these immense vaults, which appear so solid as to have no fear of collapse, there are huge supports created and sustained by the patient infiltration of lime laden water, and which easily evoke memories of some mysterious tomb of ancient Egypt, or even that of a  majestic temple, loved and frequented by prehistoric hunters.<br /><br />Towards the east, the end room dubbed 'the Chimney', with a cone of talus, hiding perhaps other galleries, such as the the original entry to le Combel. Then comes a section  which we might label 'freaks of nature', of which there are may kinds in le Combel, including stalagmite nipples painted by man, and the bent tail of a cat. <br /><br /><b>Description of the paintings and engravings.<br /><br />The 'Lion Cage'</b><br /><br />Behind a compact curtain of stalagmites, there is a small lateral niche, very well hidden, 2 metres long, 1 metre wide and 120 cm high.It was only possible to enter by crawling, through a small opening which M. André David had to enlarge with a pick. <br /><br />In this corner, on a gently undulating limestone wall, 40 cm above the ground, are painted in red (except some sections of blackish lines), a lion and three horses, surmounted or surrounded by   17 dots of the same colour.<br /><br />Here, for lack of space, the designer who wishes to make a copy of this great scene, measuring 160 cm by 80 cm, must work alone, bringing his own light, and lie down in the wet and muddy bed of a temporary stream, the water of which bathes the lower part of the wall. It is in this position that we had to work long hours interpreting and recording the images ...<br /><br /><b>Various signs around the 'Lion Cage'</b><br /><br />Signs of horizontal dots, line made by fingers, triangular signs and dotted signs, all in a red colour. These signs are extensively studied in our report.<br /><br /><b>The Room of the Magician</b><br /><br />Masked human figures, engraved and complicated with a pecked cupule, beside a conical, pointed stalagmite, which has received the same artificial pecking. These will require detailed and comparative study. <br /><br /><b>The Chapel of Antelopes</b><br /><br />The Chapel of Antelopes  is a little smaller than 205 cm long and 85 cm high. It has been made accessible  through a small opening made ​​through the stalagmites, made with care by M. André David. <br /><br />The scene, painted behind a barrage of  large columns reaches 120 cm long and 80 cm wide. This is the most mysterious and most complex drawing of  le Combel, if we except the dots,  which we try to explain in our complete report to follow soon. <br /><br />The paintings in question include five main components, shown in black, except for a small section of a red line. To the left, the hindquarters of a rhinoceros, facing northwest. Above the rhinoceros, a head, neck, and right foreleg of an antelope, very finely represented.<br /><br />The scene continues with a second antelope in the same style, then a feline whose body is seen in profile with the head facing the viewer, and finally a third antelope, whose features whose feature  partially merge, as seen in the previous image, with the lines that make up the feline.<br /><br />The antelope scene is framed on the left by two red dots, and on the right by one dot of the same color. This is where we noticed a section of the wall to be very much rubbed,  and this polishing  is well defined and intentional.<br /><br />Facing  this grand  scene is the   representation of a female human, in the composition of which occur 2 large red dots, 2 stalagmite columns, partially polished, and a prominent triangular notch.<br /><br />On the ceiling  are suspended forty calcite nipples or breasts, of which ten have been intentionally painted black  in their lower part.<br /><br /><b>The Dots</b><br /><br />We count about 150 dots. They are painted red, and quite variable in form and disposition. We made a detailed comparative study of these punctuations in our report on le  Combel.<!-- The two extreme points galleries, arms and hands stretched horizontally. (I don't know what this refers to. The width of the galleries perhaps?) -->A chapter of the full report is devoted to the authenticity of the drawings. Several observations are in favour of it,  among others the complete isolation of the newly discovered galleries before the dig of 1949, a flowstone, obliterating a portion of a related rhinoceros, the absence of any trace of man, the history etc.<br /><br />(<i>a summary of the chapter headings of the forthcoming book follows, as well as a   general  discussion of le Combel which the reader can see at&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Lemozi (1952)</span></a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /> <br /><hr align="center" width="20%"> <br /> <br /><h2>The Ossuary - the Boneyard</h2> <br /> <br />Text below from http://www.pechmerle.com/english/secrets_4.html<br /> <br /><br /> <br />The Ossuary is the name of a small chamber in the Pech Merle cave. It is decorated with paintings and finger-drawings (animals, dots, signs). The floor is a bed of clay, crammed with animals bones. There are plenty of bears' scratch marks.This room was fitted up for visitors in 1926. As it is rather small (34 metres by 22 metres) and the dome is rather low (about 1 or 2 metres high), a path was made by digging some trenches in the clay. So one can see 18 piles of bones and 3 heaps of clay close to the trenches.<br /> <br />When the Combel galleries were discovered (in 1950), the chamber was sealed off to visitors. <br /> <br />In 1998, Jean Claude Faurie, a guide at the Pech Merle cave, began to renovate the Ossuary room, with  permission for excavations. The old rusted wire netting, iron stakes, were taken away and the floor was overlaid with sand and gravel.

The site consists of two caves separated by 200 metres. The first contains many concretions, some very fine, called soda straws. The second is a decorated cave from the Paleolithic. The cave has many prehistoric paintings gadted to the upper Paleolithic.  Depictions include deer, megaceros, the ibex, and mammoths as well as various schematic human figures. The paintings corresponded to at least two clearly distinct phases: one around 25&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP, the other about 14&nbsp;000 years before the present.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 43 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/pechmerle.html responseCode 3 200

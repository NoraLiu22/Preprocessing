<h1>Designing Boat Structure</h1>
<h2 class="table_text_centered">Working With the ABS Rule</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;" ><a href="copyright.htm">Copyright</a> 2011 - 
	2016 Michael Kasten 
	<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p >I have often been asked how boat scantlings are determined.  For 
	the most part such questions fall into one of the following general 
	categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How is structure determined for boats...?</li>
	<li>What are "appropriate" scantlings for an ocean-worthy vessel....?</li>
</ul>
<p >Of course there is not a "one size fits all" answer to the <strong>second</strong> question, 
	since boats differ greatly in size and therefore have different loads that 
	will be imposed upon the structure.  I 
	 have written the following article in order to describe my own approach to 
	determining a boat's 
	 structure - which amounts to being an answer to the <strong>first</strong> 
	question. The following article is not intended to be a treatise on designing in aluminum, 
	 but rather a general overview of the <strong>process</strong> and a few of the 
	 <strong>variables</strong> to 
	 be considered, most of which are applicable to boats built in <strong>any</strong> material.</p>
<p >As a criterion for structure, I prefer to use the applicable <strong>American 
	 Bureau of Shipping</strong> rules wherever possible.  This is because 
	the various ABS rules are based on actual calculations, as opposed to 
	"look-up" tables as are  found in many other scantling rules.  Via 
	the ABS rules we are able to calculate a minimum plate 
	 or panel thickness, as well as a minimum Section Modulus for each member.  
	This "calculated" approach allows considerable flexibility in terms of 
	scantling choices, plate and panel thickness, and the spacing of internal frames, bulkheads, and longitudinal 
	 stringers.</p>
<p >The exception however is that for plank-on-frame wooden vessels, 
	unfortunately the ABS 
	 stopped publishing their wooden vessel rule in the 1960's..!  As a 
	 result, for plank-on-frame wooden yachts Germanischer Lloyd, British Lloyds 
	Register, and Det Norske Veritas presently offer the best guides to wooden 
	vessel structure.  </p>
<p >For metal or composite boats, among the many different rules published 
	by Classification Societies that address a boat's structure there appear to 
	be many good options.  Even so, I prefer using the various ABS rules, 
	which offers many excellent advantages that are described below.  </p>
<p >Although the following article uses <strong>aluminum</strong> boat structures as an example, 
	 the following <strong>methodology</strong> is also directly applicable to steel 
	or composite structure (fiberglass).<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >ALUMINUM ALLOYS  </h3>
<p >The alloys commonly used for boat <strong>extrusions</strong> (flat bar, pipe, angle, etc.) are predominantly 6061 T-6, or occasionally 6063 T-6 or 6063 T-5 if there is an availability problem with 6061. 
	A new 6082 T-6 alloy has been introduced that offers slightly improved 
	strength, but which can be quite difficult to find in many of the common 
	extrusion shapes (pipe, flat bar and others). </p>
<p >For <strong>plate</strong> (and any shapes that will be NC cut from plate, such as frames) the 
	most available alloys in the US and Canada are 5086-H116 (the most commonly used alloy with the highest corrosion resistance) and 5083 H-116 (higher as-welded strength, but slightly less corrosion resistance; less commonly 
	 specified). </p>
<p >If the vessel will be built in North America, New Zealand or Australia, 
	I prefer to specify 5083 or the new 5383 alloy from Pechiney / Alcoa which 
	combines the higher corrosion resistance of 5086 with the higher as-welded 
	strength of 5083.&nbsp; If the vessel will be 
	 built in the EU, I prefer to specify the even newer 5059 alloy developed by 
	Corus in Germany which improves on both the corrosion resistance and the 
	 as-welded strength of Pechiney's 5383.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3>STRENGTH OF VARIOUS ALUMINUM ALLOYS </h3>
<p >With regard to material strength, it should be noted that each of the ABS rules for aluminum vessels specify 
	different minimum un-welded and as-welded strengths. Wherever a published allowable strength is higher in a given ABS rule, it is usually compensated for by different head pressures being calculated for each region (bottom, 
	topsides, deck, house, tanks) or different credits are applied locally.&nbsp; 
	This issue has to a large extent been addressed in the <strong>ABS Yacht 
	Rule - Materials &amp; Welding - Aluminum &amp; FRP (updated in 2016).</strong></p>
<p>In general, structures are designed to the <strong>yield strength</strong> of the 
	material, plus a margin of safety.&nbsp; For aluminum, ordinarily the “as-welded” 
	yield strength is used, as opposed to the "fully annealed" yield 
	strength.  You can see in the table below that the 
	as-welded yield never approaches the fully annealed condition.&nbsp; Even 
	so, the ABS rules 
	use the <strong>fully annealed</strong> condition for each alloy.  As a result, the ABS 
	rule assures a considerable built-in safety factor.  </p>
<p>A summary of the various ways of expressing the yield 
	strength of aluminum alloys is as follows: </p>

<p>All values above are from the <strong>2016 ABS Yacht Rule </strong>except 
	for the following: </p>
<p class="p_indent_40px">*    Values as-published for alloy 5059 
	in the <strong>GL Rule</strong>. 
	<br />**  As-welded values for alloy 5059 (<strong>interpolated</strong> based on as-welded yield for 
	other alloys). </p>
<p >We can see from the above that there is quite a variation in the 
	strength of each one of these alloys depending on their "<strong>temper</strong>".&nbsp; 
	There is also a considerable variation in strength 
	between <strong>alloys </strong>regardless of their "temper".&nbsp; </p>
<p >For my own designs, in order to make use of the most conservative strength values I use the 
	 <strong>fully annealed </strong>material strength as is most often 
	 specified within the ABS rules.&nbsp; In addition to using the fully annealed condition, 
	for the scantling calculations I generally assume the 
	<strong>lowest strength alloy</strong> (5086) will be used unless it is KNOWN for certain that a specific 
	 higher strength alloy will be available and will be used. This approach 
	 allows use of 5086 throughout if that is all that's available to the builder. 
	 Then if a higher as-welded-yield strength material is used, the vessel will simply 
	 be that much stronger, however <strong>in all cases</strong> the ABS rule will still 
	 have been satisfied.  
	 </p>
<p >This can result in heavier weight than is necessary if 5383 or 5059 plate 
	 happens to be available.  Therefore in a weight-sensitive application, 
	 there is plenty of room for optimization of the 
	 structure to suit the higher fully annealed yield strength of 5383 or 5059 
	 alloys.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >APPLICABILITY OF THE
	    ABS RULES...&nbsp;  </h3>
<p >The ABS scantling rules that have most commonly been used for yachts are as follows:&nbsp; &nbsp;  
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>1994 ABS Offshore Racing Yacht Rule</strong> (ORY) - 
		Originally applied to ALL <span class="text_underline">sailing yachts</span> 
		in wood, GRP, steel and aluminum up to 100 feet in length (30m).&nbsp; 
		In 1996 the scope of this rule was limited to sailing yachts between 79 feet 
		(24m) and 100 feet (30m) without any actual changes to the 
		rule.&nbsp; Due to this limitation in scope, the ABS ORY rule has 
		effectively been replaced by the <strong>2016 ABS Yachts Rule</strong> 
		(see below). This rule was apparently the theoretical basis of the RCD 
		ISO-12215 rules for yacht structure which is used in the EU for all 
		yachts under 79 feet (24m) therefore it is very odd to have its scope 
		limited to yachts above 79 feet.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;  </li>
	<li><strong>2000 ABS Motor Pleasure Yachts Rule</strong> (MPY) - Originally applied to 
		ALL displacement and high speed <span class="text_underline">motor yachts</span> 
		in wood, GRP, steel and aluminum up to 200 feet (61m).&nbsp; In 1995, 
		the scope of this rule was limited to motor yachts between 79 feet and 200 feet (24m 
		- 61m) without any actual changes to the rule. The ABS MPY has proven to be an excellent 
		all-around rule, although it has now effectively been superseded by the
		<strong>2016 ABS Yachts Rule</strong> (see below).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;  
	</li>
	<li><strong>2016 ABS Steel Vessels Rule</strong> (SV)- Applies to steel 
		<span class="text_underline">commercial</span> vessels up to 295 feet in length 
		(90m).&nbsp; Specified by the US CFR for use on steel yachts carrying 
		passengers for hire, whether power or sail.&nbsp; It is apparent that 
		the US CFR has not yet caught up with the recent publication of the 
		comprehensive <strong>2016 ABS Yachts Rule</strong> which applies to
		<span class="text_underline">private</span> and
		<span class="text_underline">commercial</span> yachts up to 200 feet 
		(61m<strong>)</strong>.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; </li>
	<li><strong>2016 ABS Yacht Rule </strong>- Supersedes <strong>ALL
		</strong>prior ABS Rules applicable to <span class="text_underline">private</span> and 
	<span class="text_underline">commercial yachts</span> 
		of <span class="text_underline"><strong>all</strong></span> types built in 
	<span class="text_underline"><strong>any</strong></span> material 
		between 79 feet and 295 feet.&nbsp; If taken literally, the ABS Yacht 
		Rule replaces both the 2000 ABS MPY Rule and the 1994 ORY Rule.&nbsp; 
		In the coming years it is likely that the ISO-12215 rules will find 
		their way onto the scene in the US for <span class="text_underline">private</span> yachts under 79 feet.&nbsp; 
	<br />&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p >From the above, it seems the following ABS Rules should be applied:</p>
<ol>
	<li><span class="text_underline"><strong><span class="auto-style2">Yachts UNDER 79 Feet (24m)</span></strong></span>:&nbsp; Per the 
	above scope limitations, we are left without an ABS Rule that applies to 
	any kind of vessel under 79 feet (24m).&nbsp; However in consideration of 
	the <span class="text_underline">original</span> scope of the above rules it seems most appropriate to 
	still apply the <span class="auto-style2"><strong>1994 ABS ORY</strong></span> rule to 
		<span class="text_underline">sailing</span> yachts and the 
	<span class="auto-style2"><strong>2000 ABS MPY</strong></span> rule to
		<span class="text_underline">motor</span> yachts in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both rules 
	address steel, aluminum, fiberglass, and plywood construction, and are 
	therefore quite versatile in their application. &nbsp;For any sailing or motor 
	yacht that is destined for the EU, the applicable <span class="auto-style2">
	<strong>ISO-12215</strong></span> scantling rule 
	will apply.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong><span class="text_underline"><span class="auto-style2">Yachts OVER 79 Feet (24m)</span></span></strong>:&nbsp; 
	Here, the <span class="auto-style2"><strong>2016 ABS Yachts Rule</strong></span> will apply to all
		<span class="text_underline">private</span> yachts, as well as all
		<span class="text_underline">commercial</span> yachts that carry 12 
	passengers or less.&nbsp; Yachts that carry between 13 and 36 PAX are 
	considered 'Passenger Yachts' and must use the ABS Steel Vessels Rules as 
	applicable to the vessel's size.&nbsp; Since the ABS is considered a 
	'Notified Body' in the EU, the new <span class="auto-style2"><strong>ABS Yachts Rule</strong></span> can be used to 
	class any yacht over 79 feet (24m) within the European Union.</li>
</ol>
<p >All yachts carrying passengers must additionally comply with Flag State 
	requirements with regard to safety and stability that apply to commercial yachts 
	(such as the CFR 
	in the US or the UK's MCA LY3 
	rules for States using the Red Ensign).</p>
<p ><span class="auto-style3"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>:&nbsp; The ABS 
	Rule for Steel Vessels Under 295 feet (90m) has received vigorous editing by 
	the ABS in recent years, and has consequently grown to nearly absurd 
	proportions in an attempt to cover all manner of steel craft.&nbsp; 
	In the process it has become an extremely unwieldy tome that is of 
	questionable applicability to any sort of craft under 79 feet (24m).&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though 
	the US CFR requires using this rule to assess the structure of all 
	commercial vessels 
	carrying passengers, I do not 
	regard the ABS Rule for Steel Vessels Under 295 feet as being at all relevant to 
	any vessel under 79 feet 
	(24m).&nbsp; This is a case where the Flag State (i.e. the US) imposes a 
	more restrictive rule for commercial yachts.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >SCANTLING CALCULATIONS  </h3>
<p >Within all of the above mentioned ABS rules the method for determining scantlings is generally 
	 the same, as 
	 follows:  </p>
<p class="p_indent_40px">1. First a head pressure is calculated for each region of the boat, based on boat size and dimensions. Alloys are then selected, and the allowable yield strength for the chosen alloy is considered in all subsequent calcs.  
	</p>
<p class="p_indent_40px">2. Then a hull plate thickness is selected and verified per the rule, based on experience, boat size, usage, location, 
	 etc.   </p>
<p class="p_indent_40px">3. With a plate thickness chosen for each region, a long'l stringer spacing is then selected and verified based on what is necessary to support that plate thickness, and based on the location and the resulting head pressure. Then a frame spacing is selected and verified, based usually on what is practical in terms of attachment of the interior and the arrangement of interior spaces (typically double the long'l spacing, or thereabouts, but often 
	 more).   </p>
<p class="p_indent_40px">4. Once the long'l and transverse spacings have been chosen, the long'l stringer scantlings are selected, calculated and verified based on the location, plate thickness, and the maximum span between frames according to the prescribed minimum Section 
	 Modulus.   </p>
<p class="p_indent_40px">5. Then the transverse frame and deck beam scantlings are selected and calculated on the basis of being at least twice the depth of the long'l stringers, and verified against the prescribed minimum Section Modulus in the rule, which is calculated according to the local head pressure and the local span, and which considers the local plate thickness.  
	</p>
<p >First, a few simple limits apply:  
	 Aluminum plate must be at least 5/32 inch thickness as an absolute minimum. Based on vessel size, head pressure and plate location, greater minimum thicknesses may be prescribed. In some cases a credit might be available, based on the aspect ratio or the curvature of the unsupported plate region. In other cases, such as for tanks on commercial vessels, 1/4 inch 
	 aluminum plate is the minimum thickness used.  </p>
<p >Also per the ABS MPY rule, the ratio of depth to thickness for any aluminum flat bar frame members (transverse or long'l) must not be greater than 12:1, or a rider bar or flange must be used. A flat bar flange is also limited to a 12:1 ratio (width to thickness). The depth to thickness ratio of web frames with flanges must not exceed 59:1.&nbsp; 
	For aluminum, the depth to thickness ratio is adjusted according to a factor based on 
	 material strength.  
	</p>
<p >The ABS MPY rule allows a region of plate adjacent to each frame member equal to 80 times the thickness of the plate to be included in the Section Modulus calculation, but limited to no more than half the frame member's local spacing on each side of the member. The ABS 
	ORY rule allows a region of plate 100 times the plate thickness to be included in the frame and long'l 
	 stringer SM 
	 calcs.  </p>
<p >My own preference is to limit the Section Modulus credit to 60 times the local plating thickness as a maximum, 
	per the Nevins Rule. In any case, this credit assumes the local plate will be attached to the internal member by welding per the ABS calculated welding schedule.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >PLATE THICKNESS  </h3>
<p >The hull plating thickness required for ocean-worthy aluminum boats depends on the boat size and on the spacing of the internal 
	 framing.  </p>
<p >For a skiff or pram, 1/8 inch aluminum plate is about as thin as can be welded easily. For larger boats, although the ABS rule allows 
	 the use of aluminum plate as thin as 5/32 inch, the minimum thickness I use is 3/16 inch regardless of boat size (except for skiffs and prams).  
	</p>
<p >For the hull bottom and topsides, I consider it best to use a 
	 minimum of 1/4 inch thickness for boats of from 30 feet to around 45 feet, length on deck, then 5/16 inch up to around 55 feet, then 3/8 inch up to around 100 feet, etc. Keel sides are generally one size greater in thickness. Decks and houses are typically one size lesser in thickness.  
	</p>
<p >These are only very general guidelines for <u>minimum</u> thickness. The ideal plate thickness depends on the as-welded strength of the alloy chosen, the type of boat it is used on, the location of the plate, and very much depends on the spacing of the internal 
	 framing.   </p>
<p >If it is desired to make use of a wider frame or longitudinal stiffener spacing 
	by using plate of greater thickness, the ABS calcs will reflect the added strength imparted due to the greater plate thickness.  
	</p>
<p >For aluminum, a few special considerations are imposed. Among them is to provide increased plate thickness in way of stress points such as next to the keel, above the propeller, around the rudder post, and in way of any other fittings that will have high stress (cleats, bitts, mast partners, chainplates, windlass, etc.).&nbsp; 
	Another consideration for aluminum is that plate seams should be located at 
	the point of least stress.&nbsp; For transverse butt weld seams, that 
	location is 1/4 of the local span in between frames.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >TYPICAL FRAMING  </h3>
<p >The required dimensions of the internal transverse and longitudinal framing depends on their location and their span, but also depend on the thickness of plate, as noted 
	above.  </p>
<p >Using the minimum plate thicknesses outlined above, it is fairly typical for longitudinal stiffeners to be spaced from 12 inches to a maximum of around 18 inches, depending on the plate thickness, location, head pressure, etc. As noted above, it is more or less the case that transverse frames will be spaced approximately twice the long'l spacing.  
	Transverse frames must always be twice the depth of the long'l stiffeners.  
	</p>
<p >If the plate is of lesser thickness than outlined above, or if the service is more severe (such as for a high speed vessel's slamming loads), the stiffener spacing may well need to be less than the above spacings. If the plate is of greater thickness, then the stiffeners and frames may be farther apart.  
	</p>
<p >One of the excellent benefits of using the ABS rule is that one can freely vary the sizes and spacing of the internal structure according to what is readily available, what is the most simple, and 
	in order to accommodate different build strategies.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >EXTRUDED SHAPES  </h3>
<p >On small craft under around 70 feet, for the sake of simplicity it is my 
	 preference to use flat bar for internal framing.  As a result, the 12:1 depth to thickness ratio limit automatically imposes a minimum 
	 thickness for each of the long's and 
	 frames.  </p>
<p >Where it is necessary to exceed that aspect ratio in order to satisfy the minimum required Section Modulus, but a greater thickness is not desired, a rider bar will be used. For example, it is always necessary to use rider bars on floors, since they always exceed the aspect ratio limit. I will use rider bars or flanges for frames if needed, but generally not for long'l 
	 stringers.  </p>
<p >Even though "T" shapes are superior structurally, for the sake of simplicity I prefer to use only flat bar for frames and for long'l stringers. On occasion for fast boats that must be as light as possible, I might specify a "T" shape for a long'l stringer, but not without considering alternate arrangements or closer spacing of flat bar, 
	 etc.   The available "T" bars are given in a link provided at the end of this article. Those "T" sizes are available from Alaskan Copper, and can therefore be considered , however they may not be readily available to all 
	 builders.   </p>
<p >The Alaskan Copper stock list also shows what they refer to as a "6061 Hull Stiffener" which might also be considered for small boats, but I have not used 
	 them.  </p>
<p >I have seen some applications of American Standard channel for long'l stringers, but not very often.  
</p>
<p >Also, structural angle is used on occasion for long'l stringers, and might even be fairly common on some kinds of commercial 
	 boats. I tend not to use any angle whatsoever, mainly because all transverse members are NC cut and 
	 will therefore be given a rider bar instead if necessary, and because for long'l stringers angle is not stable in bending since it tends to want to collapse with the open angle inward or outward.&nbsp; 
	So even if strong, angle is not very "builder-friendly" especially where 
	there is any amount of curvature.&nbsp; If needed for strength locally, a "T" 
	stiffener would be vastly preferable in those 
	 locations.  </p>
<p >For regions of little or no curvature, say possibly for deck stringers, structural angle might be used more often than I imagine, however even there it requires a rather large cutout in the transverse frame, which either adds complexity in order to weld in a patch, or will otherwise reduce the strength of the transverse frame.  
	</p>
<p >I tend not to use "half pipe" sections anywhere except as an entirely external rub-strake at dock level 
	for use as a bumper. It is tempting to make use of half pipe as an external "keel cooler" however for the sake of achieving minimum wetted surface, it is always preferable to locate any cooling channels entirely inside, say in place of an internal stiffener or as part of the keel box.  
	</p>
<p >On the other hand, I do make extensive use of "full round" pipe sections, which are located at the intersection of hull and deck, and as trim on the top of bulwarks and around other edges. This is both an aesthetic choice, as well as a functional choice. At the intersection of the deck edge with the hull sides, a full round pipe adds considerable strength, and serves as a robust guard. At the top of a bulwark, a full round pipe provides a visual appeal, as well as a well-rounded edge to better hold paint, and to prevent chafe, etc.  
	</p>
<p >In my use, these full rounds are usually specified as "pipe" rather than as 
	 "tube" since tube tends to be relatively much less common in North America, 
	 therefore tube is less easy to source. Schedule 40 pipe is the most common 
	 and the most readily available thickness. For aluminum structures I will 
	 sometimes specify schedule 80 pipe – primarily for ease of welding in the smaller diameters.  
	</p>
<p >An advantage with pipe is that for any given nominal diameter, it always has the same O.D. regardless of wall thickness, so that threaded pipe fittings will work on any schedule thickness. Butt-weld ends, elbows and tees are available for pipe, and make for excellent terminations and 
	 transitions.  </p>
<p >In the EU, and "down under" the situation is quite the opposite, with metric tube being commonly available, and imperial dimensioned pipe being rather difficult to source.  
	</p>
<p >Many builders prefer to use a heavy wall pipe or tube or a solid round rod at all chines. I prefer not to do that because it complicates the welding considerably (double the number of welds along the chine…!). Instead, I prefer to locate the first long'l approximately 3 to 5 inches from the chine corner or plate edge, depending on plate thickness, on both sides of the chine. This stabilizes the weld-zone considerably, 
	improves fairness, and vastly simplifies the assembly and the 
	 weld-up.  </p>
<p >I have not made much use of "I" beams on boats, except as girders on larger craft, however possibly they 
	could be used as compression posts or stanchions. In general I prefer to use 
	pipe or tube for posts and stanchions, especially in locations where they 
	will be used as hand-holds.</p>
<p >Although "bulb flats" are available on occasion, I have not them used on 
	small craft, nor would I specify them.&nbsp; They are used to good effect in larger craft 
	and in military craft.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >REVIEW &amp; VERIFICATION  </h3>
<p >My own review process starts with making sure that all structure is simple, practical, easy to build, and has good access for welding and maintenance. I will then verify the proposed structure per the applicable ABS rule. If regions of plate are in doubt, I will verify plate thickness and internal support according to plate theory per local edge fixity.  
	</p>
<p >If the vessel is very slender, or is shallow in relation to its length, then the ABS Aluminum Vessels rule requires a global longitudinal strength analysis, based on a calculated minimum Section Modulus for the whole vessel. This would not ordinarily be a factor for vessels under around 60 to 80 feet. 
	Although this may at first look like a very complex calculation, the ABS AV rule uses a fairly simple approach.  
	</p>
<p >As noted above, in general it is best to locate transverse plate seams at 1/4 the span between frames - at the location of least stress. It is desirable in all cases to locate plate seams away from other stress points, such as hatch or house corners. In general, all house and hatch corners should have a generous radius. It is generally desirable to reinforce transverse plate seams using "sister" long'ls to span the seam, which also helps to minimize distortion during weld-up.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >SOURCES  </h3>
<p >One of the best sources of supply for aluminum alloy shapes and plate on the US West Coast is Alaskan Copper 
	 (<a href="http://www.alaskancopper.com">www.alaskancopper.com</a>). And... 
	 any of the ABS rules mentioned here can be downloaded for free at
	<a href="http://www.eagle.org">www.eagle.org</a>, in the Marine section.  </p>
<p >Probably the best general guide to structure for metal boats is Tom Colvin's excellent book
	 <em><strong>"Steel Boatbuilding"</strong></em> which, even though aimed at building 
	 cruising yachts in steel, is entirely applicable to building similar types 
	 of boats in aluminum. I find the examples of typical boat structure that Tom 
	 Colvin has offered to be very simple and extremely practical.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >PARTING SHOTS  </h3>
<p >It should be rather evident from the above that I do not subscribe to the so-called "frameless" approach to metal boat building.   
	 For a discussion of the merits of the so-called "frameless" approach, 
	 please see my article on <a href="framing.htm">Metal Boat Framing</a>.  
	 On the other hand, I do strongly favor the use of increased plate thickness in order to minimize the internal framing wherever it is practical to do 
	 so.  </p>
<p >Further, there is no special requirement that dictates whether 
	 the frames or the plate will be erected first.  For a discussion of 
	 various methods of metal boat 
	 construction, please see my article on <a href="frames_first.htm">Metal 
	 Boat Building Methods</a>.</p>
<p >The approach of using increased plate thickness in order to limit internal framing is sometimes referred to as the "Strongall" system, which 
	 a company in France claims to have "invented." This approach definitely saves labor (and therefore costs) and vastly improves hull fairness. Despite those advantages, increased plate thickness will 
	certainly result in 
	 a heavier structure and a higher materials cost.  </p>
<p >This illustrates one of the biggest benefits of using the ABS rule, which is not a rigidly "prescribed" tabular rule (as is 
	 for example the British Lloyds rule). In other words, when using a "calculated" approach to boat structure 
	 as is inherent in the ABS rules, we have
	 <em>always</em> had the option to freely vary the internal structure and plate thickness, for example to increase plate thickness in order to realize benefits in terms of simplicity of a boat's internal structure.  
	</p>
<p >Come to think of it, this was actually not "invented" in France after all… it is merely a practical approach to metal boat building!<br />&nbsp;</p>

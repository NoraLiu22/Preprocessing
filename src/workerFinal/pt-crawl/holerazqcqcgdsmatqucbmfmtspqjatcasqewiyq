        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>        
The opinions expressed below represent only my experience with various makes and models of oboe family instruments so far.  Please keep in mind that how an oboe &ldquo;takes the air&rdquo; is different, often vastly different, from player to player. &ldquo;Your air&rdquo; is not &ldquo;my air,&rdquo; &ldquo;your scale&rdquo; is not likely to be &ldquo;my scale,&rdquo; your compensations will differ from my compensations, your reed will not be my reed, and your own &ldquo;personal resonance&rdquo; will be different from anyone else's &ldquo;personal resonance&rdquo; when playing an oboe instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
       For many years past, collecting and trading oboe instruments, I have had opportunity to take on various makers 
to represent.  I have declined all such opportunities.  However, at the 2011 IDRS convention, I came across a make English horn that is in a league of its own, far superior to any other English horn by any other present day maker.
The English horn I felt was &#40;by far&#41; the &ldquo;best in show&rdquo; at IRDS 2011 is by Puchner, and I have contracted to represent Puchner oboes, oboes d'amore, and English horns in North America.
However, please know that my reviews of Puchner instruments below reflect my genuine assessments.</p>

     <p> A note about tuners &ndash;  I will offer the advice of my late friend Wally Bhosys, oboist with the Metropolitan Opera
in the 1950s&ndash;1970s.  It is not possible to separate the observer from the observed when playing to an electronic tuner.  
Simply put, playing to a tuner will produce completely arbitrary results.  The only use possible good use for a tuner would be to test the length of a reed or bocal to establish a comfortable A.   Beyond this, <em>trust your own ears</em>.

		<h2>Preamble - A Primer on Wood</h2>

		<p>The quality of wood found in many instruments offered by some major manufacturers nowadays seems to be of much poorer quality than wood found in instruments made [say] prior to 1990.  Much of the wood presently used for mass produced wooden oboe instruments tends to be "open" (coarse) grain, from young trees, and exceedingly prone to cracking, or even "exploding."  Not only is much of the wood used nowadays for oboe production of lesser quality than in decades past, the wood is not truly "seasoned."</p>  
		<p>"Seasoning" oboes woods, according to usual convention, means that the wood is cut into billets, the billets then placed in an unheated warehouse or barn on stickers for air circulation for perhaps 10-20 years.  After the initial seasoning process, the un-cracked, un-warped  billets will be turned round, and a small pilot hole drilled completely through the pieces.  Then the rounds will be set aside for perhaps (ideally) another 5 years or so.  In this manner, the wood will be able to experience all the changes in temperature and humidity, and dry ever so slowly.  After the rounds have seasoned, any cracked or warped pieces will (should) be discarded.</p>  
		<p>Nowadays, some of the large oboe manufacturers do not have the luxury of seasoning the wood as in "the old days."  A common practice nowadays is simply to dry the wood for a year or two in an insulated box ("kiln") at 125 degrees. In my estimation, this drying process is absolutely no substitute for seasoning wood! Drying wood IS part of the oboe manufacturing process, though only AFTER wood has been well seasoned.</p> 
		<p>With wood being of such dubious quality nowadays, I am amazed that oboe manufacturers do not simply sleeve the upper joints of their instrument with PET polymer liners... </p>

        <p><strong><em> Subject to change!</em></strong></p>
        <h2>OBOES</h2>
        <a name="amati"></a>
        <p> AMATI - AVOID !  Yikes!</p>
        <a name="adler"></a>
        <p> ADLER - The model 6000 &#40;French style&#41; oboe is worth a look. Very well made.
                  I prefer the model 6000 oboes made after  2010
</p>
        <a name="abarre"></a>
        <p> A. BARRE' - A. Laubin's &ldquo;second&ndash;line&rdquo; of instruments.
                   Made to A. Laubin's specifications, finished by 
                   William Glover, voiced by Al Laubin.
                   Good oboes for advanced students/
                   advanced amateurs. Somewhat bright
                   &#40;&ldquo;sprightly&#41;&ldquo; sound.  Some "ethereal,"
                    some very good, some "OK," some indifferent.
                   One of the best oboes ergonomically for oboists
                   with small hands.
</p>

        <a name="bhosys"></a>
        <p> BHOSYS (stencil) - Some "OK," some indifferent,
                      some truly not so good at all.
                      Stencil instruments, mostly Malerne.
</p>
        <a name="buffet"></a>
        <p> BUFFET - "Orfeo" excellent instrument.  
           Has solid metal tenon on upper joint
           composite material- cracking (rare) still possible
       "Virtuoso" Composite or wood.  Excellent
          instrument.  Different bore from
          the "Orfeo"  Lacking left C# - in my estimation
          an oboe with this level of mechanical sophistication
          should truly have a left C# key.  Also, the "natural C"
          touch seems far too tiny to be of much use.<br>
The most recent wood professional model 3613 oboes tend  
       to be excellent. Exquisite key-work.  Impeccable   
       scale.  Lacking in the complexity, "character" department.<br>
      The "composite" Buffet Greenline 3613 is, in 
        my estimation, an unabashed "reed trumpet," extremely 
       "brassy" sounding, lacking subtlety altogether. 
        However, I did find one example at the 2011 IDRS 
        convention that I liked.  Perhaps best to try a bunch...
        The  "Greenline" oboes can (and do) crack! Not possible     
        to repair if cracked, except to have a new joint made   
        at great expense if not still under warranty.<br>
        AVOID any of the Buffet "student" model
        and "modified Conservatory" oboes - <em>dreadful</em>!<br>
        The "Buffet" oboes from the 1960s and 1970s
         were in fact made by  Marigaux- even having the
         Marigaux serial numbers- some good- some excellent 
         oboes.  Same as the "King-Marigaux" oboes.
</p>
        <a name="bulgheroni"></a>
        <p> BULGHERONI - <em>First class maker.</em> 
               The "Opera" model by Bulgheroni is easily on a 
               par with Loree.  For me, the "Opera" model
               on display at IDRS 2011 was THE best oboe 
               of all.  I bought it on the spot.<br>
               The Violetwood version of the Opera model  is 
              <em>sensational</em>.<br>
              A new model -"MUSA"- is receiving
             rave reviews.  On a par with Loree Royale
               model, though I prefer the MUSA.

        <!-- #EndLibraryItem --><a name="cabart"></a>
        <p> CABART - Prolific maker from the early 20th century
                    to 1974 when bought out by Loree.  Wildly 
                    inconsistent maker.  I truly admire some of the
                    ring system oboes by Cabart from the 1920s 
                    through 1940s. Sumptuous, "penetrating,"
                    lush, "haunting" sound.  I like some of the 
                    1960s- to mid 1970s Cabart plateau models
                    as well. The keywork is not especially
                    well crafted, though it is adequate.</p>
        <a name="cabartloree"></a>
        <p> CABART 74 (Loree Cabart 74) - Full system oboe, though lacking split ring
                    D key.  Good student oboe, though
                    for sure overpriced with respect to playing 
                    characteristics.  For about the same price, a   
                    Bulgheroni FULL Conservatory system 
                    professional oboe ("Artist" model) can be obtained.
</p>
        <a name="chauvet"></a>
        <p> CHAUVET - Excellent maker.  Imported and sold by 
                   Laubin in the 1950s- serial numbers: numbers only.
                   Ben Storch took over the importation of
                   Chauvet instruments from the late 1950s to the
                   mid 1960s- serial numbers: "BW" followed by
                   numbers.  Ben re-voiced the "BW" oboes to his
                   own  specifications.               
                   From the c. 1964 to the mid 1970s the Chauvet line was imported by Linx and Long in  
                   Manhattan - serial numbers:  "AC" followed by 
                   numbers. The pre- Storch Chauvet oboes - not   
                   memorable.  Some of the Ben Storch "BW" series 
                   Chauvet oboes may be described as first class, 
                   especially from about serial number BW100 to   
                   about BW330.  I played on a sublime Chauvet 
                 "BW" as a primary instrument for some years, until
                   I discovered Hiniker oboes.  The AC Chauvet
                   oboes- not  as desirable as the BW oboes, though at     
                   times very good. Usually the "AC" oboes seem 
                   brighter in  timbre. The BW series Chauvet oboe is 
                   darker in timbre than almost any of the other 
                   French oboes, comparable to the "thick wall" late 
                  "B" series Loree oboes model, or the present day 
                   Loree "Royale" model.  Warren Sutherland used  
                   Chauvet BW oboes throughout most of his career 
                   as princpal oboe of the Indianopolis Symphony and  
                   Tucson Symphony. The Chauvet oboe 
                   was very well made.  It is not uncommon to find 
                   Chauvet oboe still playing well even after 40 years 
                   of school/university use.</p>

        <p> CHUDNOW, MARK - Some of the "Sierra" oboes can be exquisite. I especially like the exotic wood examples
       such as Rosewood. Some Chudnow oboe marked "MCW" have full Conservatory system, some have "modified" Conservatory system.

        <a name="covey"></a>
        <p> COVEY - Excellent maker.  Exquisite design and
                   artisanship of keywork.  I find the spacing 
                   between the low D (split ring D) and the low
                   C touch to be too close in spacing (by 2mm) for        
                   all but an oboist having very small hands, thus
                   ergonomically uncomfortable for oboists having
                   medium to large hands. The "Covey" sound
                   is gorgeous, though I have found that some
                   of the pre- 2004 Covey oboes I have played have a    
                   scale that I would characterize as being overly   
                 "flexible"- the pitch centers simply do not seem to   
                  "lock in." And I also find some of the older  Covey 
                   oboes seem to be difficult to finesse the transition 
                   between dynamics - seem to want to only play <em>mf</em>.<br>
                   The newest Covey oboes made post (say) 2008 by
                   Ginger Ramsey, especially of Honduran Rosewood,
                   I find <em>extremely</em> appealing...

        <p> DECKER - <em>A first class maker</em>.  Rare, only about 
                   25 oboes to date. Most made of Boxwood. Not 
                   presently making oboes.  Instrument is perhaps
                   best suited for chamber music, not orchestral use.

        <p> FOSSATI - Oboes made  pre- mid 2008, I have not been
                   impressed at all.  However, since mid- 2008, Fossati   
                   has completely redesigned the acoustics, and the 
                   result is a positively first class instrument. The  
                   new "MB" model is well worth 
                   comparing to (say) Loree, Howarth, Covey, Marigaux,  Bulgheroni.
                   The two other Fossati models ("Artiste" and
                   "Soloiste") also merit a try.

        <p> FOX - Fox  very good-excellent maker.
      Models 333, 330, 300 are well suited for school use.
    "Sayen"  excellent instrument, worthy of professional use.
    "Fox-Laubin"  I have tried about a half dozen so far - no comment at present.
      The key fitting accomplished by Fox is of the first order.</p>

        <p> GORDET - Ben Storch's trade name. </p>
        
        <a name="ggordet"></a>
        <p> "GERMAN" GORDET - MADE BY KREUL - The darkest sound
                   in the realm of oboe.  Physically, the heaviest of 
                   oboes. Massive, with heavy pattern, very hard alloy 
                   keywork.  Often will play best if a Covey bell is 
                   employed. Best suited for an oboist having large 
                   hands. Often excellent oboes. Very "forgiving,"
                   locks in on pitch centers, easy to make reeds for,
                   difficult to play a "bad note."<br>
                   Will withstand many decades of school use.
                   Note: a scant few of the "Gordet" German
                   model oboes will be the "standard" medium wall
                   thickness Hans Kreul instruments.  The keywork
                   at a glance will appear to be the same on both
                   the heavy wall and the standard models, though
                   in fact the "heavy wall" instrument keywork
                   is heavier- "overwrought" and "built like
                   a bank vault."  Personally, I prefer the "standard"
                   Kreul oboe, as it is not unrelentingly (and 
                   hopelessly)  "dark"- the standard Kreul at least has 
                   a glimmer of "bright" element to the sound.                 
 </p>

        <a name="fgordet"></a>
        <p> "FRENCH" GORDET - Not many "French model" Gordet oboes
                   were made.  Some very few  by
                   Chauvet, most by Malerne.
                   Mostly indifferent, mediocre instruments.

        <a name="igordet"></a>
        <p> "ITALIAN" GORDET - Made by Bulgheroni.  
                    Usually very good-excellent instruments.  
                    The (very rare) all plastic Italian Gordet is
                    one of the best sounding of all plastic oboes
                    extant. Excellent value on the second hand 
                    market with respect to value for money.

 </p>   
    
        <a name="hgordet"></a>

        <p> HINIKER - MINNESOTA - In my estimation, the best of the
                 best. The <em>ULTIMATE</em> professional oboe.
                 Without peer in the realm of oboe. 
                 The Snakewood Hiniker oboe is THE single finest 
                 (and most appealing) oboe I have <em>ever</em> played.
                 Hiniker oboes made after 2008 all have P.E.T
                 polymer sleeve liners in the upper joint.
                 The Hiniker clear Acrylic oboe is without peer
                 in the realm of oboes entirely of synthetic, and 
                 impossible to distinguish the sound from an all  
                 Hiniker oboe made of African Blackwood. 
                 And the Hiniker oboe in Snakewood is, in my estimation, without peer in the realm of oboe.
				 Tom Hiniker's attention to detail is
                 without equal in the realm of oboe making.
                 The ergonomics of the keywork is second to none.
                 L--o--n--g waiting list.  A second hand Hiniker oboe   
                 will often realize a higher price than new.
</p>
        <a name="heckel"></a>
        <p> HECKEL - Excellent maker, though Heckel has not made oboes
                 since 1964.  Many of the older Heckel oboes not
                 pitched at A=440 !
</p>
        <a name="howarth"></a>
        <p> HOWARTH - <em>First class maker</em>, beautiful oboes in every
                 respect. The S5 XL has a smooth, velvety, "dark" 
                 sound. The "S5"- has a  "brighter" timbre than the 
                 S5, and the "S6" is in fact "bright."
                 The Howarth S5 XL in Cocobolo is highly 
                 recommended. Cooper Wright's own personal oboe, 
                 a Howarth Cocobolo S5 XL circa 2008, having a 
                 unique experimental bore, and some post factory 
                 re-tuning/voicing, is one of <em>the</em> most appealing oboes I 
                 have <em>ever</em> played. The design execution of the
                 keywork is first rate. Some Howarth oboes may need  
                 additional tuning to suit, though any perceived  
                 anomalies tend to be minimal and fixable. Used
                 Howarth oboes, either S5 XL or 
                 S5 will be a most excellent value for money.

        <p> HULLER - No information available at present.  Germany.</p>
        <a name="jarde"></a>
        <p> JARDE' - Good to (at times) excellent maker.  The
             "quintessential" French oboe. Circa 1950s to the
               1980s.  A "Ralph Gomberg model "Jarde'
               exists, though I do not know how it may differ
               from the standard Jarde' professional oboe.
               Some excellent, some good, some indifferent.
               I have had excellent results having Jarde' oboes 
               being re-voiced by a master artisan, such as 
               David Teitelbaum.  Beware - many fake "Jarde'" oboes
			   were made by Orsi, and possibly Santoni.
</p>
        <a name="josef"></a>
        <p> JOSEF - Model GS-2 20th (top of the line) is excellent,  
         especially examples made of Mopani wood.</p>
		 
        <a name="armstrong"></a>
        <p> KGE (Armstrong/Ward) - Excellent oboes overall.
                     I would look at the all synthetic "Acolyte" 
                    model as an excellent value as a professional    
                    model oboe for a student or amateur, or a
                    professional looking for an instrument for
                    outdoor use.</p>

		<a name="kholert"></a>
        <p> KHOLERT - Kholert made some "full" Conservatory system
                oboes, though missing a split ring D.  A wildly
                inconsistent maker.  I have had a well voiced Kholert 
                oboe with a penetrating, haunting, semi-dark sound.
                I have had a (very rare) Kohlert sax-oboe that was 
                as good as the best Loree sax-oboe. Usually best to 
                avoid Kohlert instruments.
 </p>
        <a name="kreul"></a>
        <p> KREUL - A first class maker. Stencils: Kreul/Mirafone,
                Gordet "German" model, Lucerne, Eneg. Note: some 
                Lucerne stencils NOT by Kreul.  The Kreul oboes
                have a beautiful,  sumptuous, dark sound brimming 
                with personality. Very "forgiving" to play and locks 
                in on pitch centers. Built to "withstand nuclear 
                attack." Keywork is of a much harder alloy than the 
                usual French oboes.  Ergonomically best for 
                persons with having large hands. The "German 
                model" Gordet/Kreul  and "Lucerne" stencil is in fact 
                a different instrument from the "standard" Kreul 
                though at first glance nearly identical in appearance.
                The Gordet/Kreul and Lucerne/Kreul will be much 
                heavier physically than the standard Kreul or
                Kreul/Mirafone, with much thicker wall diameter. 
                The Gordet/Kreul and the Lucerne/Kreul produce 
                the "darkest" oboe timbre of any make I know of.
                The "standard" Kreul oboe, though somewhat   
               "dark" sounding, still has an element of brightness.   
                I admire Kreul oboes, though I prefer the usual Hans  
                Kreul and Hans Kreul/Mirafone to the Gordet and 
              "Lucerne" Kreul models. It is possible on occasion to 
                find a "Kreul" (or "Hans Kreul")  oboe this is in fact  
                the same model as the heavy "Gordet" or
                Lucerne/Kreul.  Conversely, it is on rare occasion
                possible to find a German Kreul "Gordet" oboe that   
                is in fact the lighter weight  "standard" Kreul model.  
                Excellent value for money. Kreul radically redesigned   
                the keywork patterns in the 1990s- most of the key 
                touches became flat, in stark contrast to the earlier 
              "domed" touch surfaces- "flat keyboard" effect- takes
                time to become accustomed to the flat surfaces.
                Sadly, Kreul ceased production in the late 1990s.

 </p>
        <a name="laubin"></a>
        <p> LAUBIN - Legenday maker.  I especially like the 
              Al Laubin oboes made between 1958 and 1972.
              I find some of the late model Paul Laubin oboes to be
              sensational, with special mention to the Rosewood 
              oboes made in the mid to late 1990s. New from the 
              factory, Laubin oboes have about 50% skin pads. In 
              my estimation it is best simply to replace all skin pads
              cork. The Laubin oboe has a distinctly different 
              sound from the Loree oboes. Smooth, dark,
              slightly "covered" sound, with a "glint"
              of oboe d'amore timbre.
              Laubin oboes made within the past few decades have   
              half length (on rare occasion full length) polymer 
              sleeves in the upper joint. The resale value of a
              fine Laubin oboe of any vintage is very high in 
              comparison to most any other make except Hiniker.

        <a name="larilee"></a>
        <p> LARILEE - I began playing on a Larilee "full
               Conservatory, professional model" oboe.  The tone 
               was "extra bright."  The keywork and pad-work was
               of the most marginal quality.  However, the oboe
               was well voiced and played easily. Some of the
                Larilees oboes "sing," while others can be unbearably
               "stuffy." The keywork is extremely "bendy" and all 
                too easily knocked out of adjustment.  A repairman's 
                worst nightmare.  Best to avoid...

        <a name="lesher"></a>
        <p> LESHER - Lesher made some "full Consevatory"
              oboes. Some made before the buyout by Selmer
              play well, though the keywork is of marginal
              quality. Best to avoid.
</p>
        <a name="linton"></a>
        <p>LINTON - AVOID, with the sole exception of the (rare)
              "ZRL" (made in USA) FULL Conservatory system, 
                professional model oboe.
               The "ZRL" in  plastic is in my estimation <em>far</em> superior 
               to the usual Buffet, Yamaha, Selmer intermediate 
               oboes.  The sound of the plastic ZRL is rather bright,    
               though not overly so.  The wood ZRL has element of   
               bright and dark.  The engineering of the keywork is  
               not on a par with say Fox, though it is for sure    
               functional, and good ergonomically.  ZRL is an
               excellent value on the second hand market.
               Linton also had a line of oboes called 
              "Linton Paris" made by Cabart. 
               Worth a look if you can find an example having the
               FULL complement of professional model keywork.

                   see Lars Kirmser serial number pages.
                   About 80% of professional oboists in the US
                   play Loree  instruments.  At present, Loree is 
                   making 3 different styles of instrument bore:
                   "regular" bore, "ak" & "dm" /"German" bore.
                    Loree makes all bore available in two models:
                  "Standard" and the premium "Royale."
                   The "regular" bore oboe is an "all 
                   around" instrument, excellent for most any
                   musical endeavor.  The "ak" bore oboe (introduced
                   in the late 1980s) is designed for maximum
                   projection in an orchestral setting.  Personally,
                   I find the sound of the "ak" oboe to be "brash"
                   and overly "aggressive" - a "reed trumpet"  
                   perhaps.  Sweetness and lyrical subtlety seem 
                   missing to great extent,  though once in a while a   
                   will come across an "ak" with a tinge of sweetness,
                   especially the early "ak" oboes from H-J series.  
                   I am very partial to the "dm" bore oboe.
                   The "dm" seems to have more "sparkle" and
                 "character" than the "regular" bore, with still
                   an element of sweetness.  I do not find the "dm
                   bore to be in "darker" in sound than the "regular"
                   or "ak" instruments.  I find that the "regular"                                
                   and "dm" bore seem to have plenty sufficient 
                   projection for orchestral solo playing.  
                   To me, the "late model" Loree oboes have a very 
                   "pretty" sound, though lacking "core" "depth" and   
                  "complexity" to the sound, skating over the surface 
                   of the "acoustical pond." </p>

                  <p>
                  The Royale is a  "thick wall" instrument, and thus 
                  has a "darker" sound than the "standard" Loree. 
                  My experience has been that oboists often
                  become bored with the "duller" sound of the Royale 
                  oboes.  Some of the late "B" series oboes (late 1960s) 
                  were  "thick wall" instruments, made to compete 
                  with the "dark" Kreul/Lucerne and German Gordet
                  oboes ("thick wall") that were in great favor
                  at the time.</p>
                      <p>My favorite Loree vintages:<br>
                
                 "Classic C" series  late 1960s, early 1970s
                              lyrical, with a most appealing "core"
                              to the sound.  Paul Covey remarked:
                            "The Loree C series is unlike anything else
                              Loree has ever made." 
                              According to Tom Hiniker, the C series  oboes 
                              have more undercutting of the tones holes 
                              than the B series oboes. Expect to pay   
                              premium prices for a fine examples of a
                              Loree C series.
                              <br>
                  
                  "Classic B" series circa 1960-1969
                      a most appealing "majesty" and 
                      core" to the sound.
                      Expect to pay premium prices for B series  
                      oboes, especially serial numbers BK-BP.  
                      The (rare) late B series oboes with the heavy 
                      wall- much sought after- very "dark" sound </p>
                      
                      <p><strong>BEWARE</strong>: many <strong>FAKE</strong> B series "Loree" oboes exist, also known as "Chiassarini Fakes"- made in fact by Malerne.</p>
                
                      <p>Mid to late "H" series  (mid 1980s), and I, and J.
                      Some exceedingly "lyrical" and reminiscent of
                      B and C series oboes.</p>
              
                   <p>"A" series  (1930 to 1959)  Utterly sweet !
                   Some professionals even today only play 
                   A series oboes, especially AR, AS serial numbers.</p>

                   <p>Some (though not all!) <em>early</em> D series oboes seems to 
                   be on a par with the C series.
                   It is also possible to find some appealing 
                   E series oboes, though beware of voicing anomalies
                   such as stuffy, fuzzy, stuffy E</p>
           
                   <p>Oboes from the mid-late 1920s- say "CC" through 
                            "ZZ"- Ideal for playing Bach...</p>
                 
                <p>"dm" bore oboes, especially "I" series                
                "synthetic" oboes, all plastic- pre-H series- practically 
                  impossible to  discern any difference in tone from 
                  the wood oboes.  Loree seems to have used [so far] 
                  three different types of polymer to make their 
                  synthetic oboes. At first (from about CC [1969] to 
                  about 1980) Loree used a polymer, "mottled"  grey 
                  in color, that was different from any other polymer 
                  ever used by any other maker. Hard to find on the
                  second hand market and expensive.  Perhaps only 
                  about 40 such oboes exist.
                  Next, Loree used a gray colored polymer.
                  The solid gray may not be as desirable acoustically 
                  as the earlier mottled gray/white polymer oboes.</p> 
                  <p>
                  The H series and newer synthetic Loree oboes
                   employ a polymer jet-black in color- likely
                   Acrylic. I find that this black polymer does not 
                   have the "warmth" or "core" to the sound I 
                   find in the earlier instruments made of the
                   mottled gray polymer. However, in recent years,   
                   Loree seems to have gone back to using the gray 
                   colored polymer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   AVOID:  The F and G series
					Loree oboes. Far too many F and G series Loree oboe     
					seem to been endowed with intractable voicing
					anomalies...

        <a name="lym"></a>
        <p> LYM - The Lym oboes (1950s-1960s) seem to be based 
                  somewhat on the design of the post war "A" series 
                  Loree oboes.  In the 1960s, the Lym oboe was 
                  favored by many studio musicians in Los Angeles .
                  Beautifully crafted.  Some play exquisitely,
                  though others seem to have minor voicing 
                  anomalies. Sweet, facile, lyrical, heaps of character 
                  and complexity to the sound.  Ideal for playing 
                  Bach.  I am extremely fond of Lym oboes. </p>

        <a name="malerne"></a>
        <p> MALERNE - Usually best to simply AVOID Malerne oboes.
                  Very inconsistent, though I have
                  found one or two examples that
                  had a huge, singing tone, almost reminiscent
                  of a late model Loree "ak" bore oboe.
                  The keywork of the later Malerne oboes
                  is "clunky" in the extreme. </p>
        <a name="marigaux"></a>
        <p> MARIGAUX- Excellent maker overall.  Some of the
                    Marigaux oboes (S-M-L, Strasser, or Marigaux)  
                    were marketed by the King Musical Instrument
                    Company back in the 1960 and 1970s.
                    Well made, usually having  good to excellent 
                    playing characteristics. "Penetrating" and
                    somewhat "bright" sound.  Some of the  mid 1990s 
                    model Marigaux oboes I find appealing.
                    The newest model (M2) seems to have a "pretty
                    sound," though lacking in complexity. </p>
                    <p>I am especially fond of the clear Acrylic"Altuglas" 
                    oboe with gold plate keywork - lovely sound.
                    Truly expensive!  Ergonomically
                    comfortable instruments. </p>
        <a name="tmarkardt"></a>
        <p> T.MARKARDT - Germany. 
                    A very good, and, at times, a most excellent maker.
                    Automatic octaves.</p>
        <a name="mignot"></a>
        <p> MIGNOT - I have owned a Mignot.  Exceedingly well
                     made, and it played well. However, it did not 
                     seem to "lock into" pitch centers.  Rare.</p>
        <a name="moennig"></a>
        <p> MOENNIG - (Germany) Pre-2008 -good, though the keywork is     
                   "so-so"...  The new Moenning oboes well worth a 
                    look, though they seem to have a "bright" sound.</p>

        <p>ORSI - Best to avoid the oboes. </p>
        <a name="otley"></a>
        <p>OTLEY (MDK) - UK   out of business in the 1980s ?
               Very well made.  Large bore.  Keywork design is
               nearly "post modern." BIG sound.
               Free blowing.  Comparable to Marigaux, Howarth. 
               Worth a look...</p>

        <p> PATRICOLA - To date I have not been impressed by this
                   maker... My advice: <em>Avoid!</em>
                   However, a few players seem to favor/
                   like Patricola.  I have yet to find even one example
                   so far to be appealing in any respect.</p>

             Very well made, good voicing. 
              Sweet, lyrical.</p>
        <a name="puchner"></a>
        <p> PUCHNER - (Germany)  Newly redesigned acoustically 2008.  One 
                of the two Puchner oboes shown at the 2008 IDRS 
                convention was absolutely "ethereal" in every respect.</p>
        <a name="rigoutat"></a>
        <p> RIGOUTAT - Very good to excellent maker overall.  Played 
                 extensively throughout Europe. I especially like the 
                oboes from the 1980s, before the introduction of the 
                (dismal) "Evolution,"  "Symphony," models- best to  
                 avoid.  Low resale value.
                 The "Expression," can be very good, at times "just 
                 so."  The newest model called "J" can be sublime.  
                 The "J" seems  to have a timbre reminiscent of a 
                 Laubin oboe.  May need some minor touches to the 
                 voicing to have it "just so" for American scraped 
                 reeds. The finish details at the "sub-atomic" level not 
                 up to the same standard as Hiniker, Howarth, Loree,
                 Bulgheroni, Marigaux.<br>                  
                 The Rigoutat oboes from the late 1950s will 
                 on occasion be an excellent value.</p>
        <a name="arobert"></a>
        <p> A. ROBERT - A good maker, though inconsistent.  Loree's  
                     main competition in France before WWII.  The 
                     Robert oboes seem to be a lot like the "A" series 
                     Loree oboes. Often recommended for oboists with
                     small hands. Post-war (WWII) "Robert" oboes
					were made by by Malerne and other makers and     
					marketed under the "Robert" name.
</p>
        <a name="santoni"></a>
        <p> SANTONI - AVOID.  Pare, Italy. </p>
        <a name="tsparkes"></a>
        <p> T. SPARKES - (Australia) Artist/artisan maker, often 
           makes oboes out of exotic woods, such as "Mulgawood"
           native to the Australian desert.  Tom also uses
           stainless steel for the mechanical elements of his oboes.
           A good (though not "great") sounding oboe. The design 
           of the keywork is  beyond "post modern" - not  
           comfortable, and the spacing between the key touches on 
           the lower joint is difficult - too far apart. </p>

                 841 for sale I  thought to be very good.
                 The engineering of the keywork is (in my opinion)
                 nowhere near on a par with say Loree, Bulgheroni,
                 Howarth, Covey, Hiniker.</p>

        <p> STUDENT OBOES - If you must buy an oboe with less than FULLEST
Conservatory system, some recommendations for "modified Conservatory" oboes:<br>
NEW:   Bulgheroni  FB091- the best student oboe, value for the money "MCW"  (Bulgheroni/Chudnow). Howarth  S20, S40  wood, Fox 330  "OK" (plastic)
<br>
USED: as above, plus:  Kreul, Kreul/Mirafone.  The Kreul Mirafone student instruments play as
         well as the Kreul professional model instruments.
         I have often had a "student" model Kreul oboe that I 
         wished had the full complement of keys.
         A "best value" for money, without a doubt.
         Also: Linton "ZRL"  wood FULL Conservatory, 
           professional model , though the plastic ZRL is very good.</p>

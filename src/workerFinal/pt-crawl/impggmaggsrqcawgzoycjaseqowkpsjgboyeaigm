Environmental concerns mean that saving in airfares and carbon emissions will make it an increasingly attractive option. In many ways, the pandemic has consolidated a process that was already underway, with over 100 advance meetings taking place before the G20 summit.

We have found detrimental effects on sleep and physical health, and on feelings of fatigue, stress, time stress &ndash; which is the concern of running out of time or not being able to complete tasks at the right time - and mental health. The knock-on effects of this are substantial.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProfessor Costa-i-Font&rsquo;s findings corroborate mounting evidence that the effects on health of the spring transition to DST are broad and at times severe. On the days following the spring DST transition, for example, there is an increased likelihood of a heart attack, the overall number of hospitalisations increases, and the number of doctor visits also climbs. Overall, participants in the study were also found to be more likely to report feeling &ldquo;run-down&rdquo; and &ldquo;less energetic&rdquo; in the days after the clock change.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of wellbeing, the study demonstrates that the DST transition increases people's feeling of being rushed for time, and respondents are also more likely to say that they &ldquo;barely cope with things&rdquo; one day after the DST transition. The number of hours spent on leisure decreases by roughly 10 minutes following the transition and findings suggests that the spring transition into DST decreases life satisfaction by around 1.44 per cent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENeither is the outlook positive when it comes to economic productivity. As Professor Costa-i-Font notes, &ldquo;we find that the number of hours worked increases by roughly 40 minutes on Mondays following the transition, while the time when a respondent starts working remains the same. This suggests that respondents are running on at least one hour less sleep that first day, and their individual productivity is affected as a result.&rdquo; In societies where sleep quality may also be pushed to the limits, the loss of even just one hour during the transition leads to compounding effects over the first six days of the transition, according to Professor Costa-i-Font.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETranslated into monetary terms, the results are even more startling, as Professor Costa-i-Font explains: &ldquo;We calculated the costs of each of these impacts, and weighed them up against any known benefits of the DST. Our cost-benefit analysis reveals that ending DST would be associated with welfare gains equivalent to an income gain of roughly 754 euros per capita per year.&rdquo;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"quote","value":{"text":"The number of hours worked increases by roughly 40 minutes on Mondays following the transition [to daylight saving time].

Questions spanned life satisfaction, sleep satisfaction, childcare, physical and emotional health, wellbeing, work, leisure and time management.

States will need to establish a standard time, choosing between winter or summer time, and will need to decide how to manage time between neighbours and trade partners. The European Union, for example, is hoping to find a way to allow member states to choose their own standard time, without creating a patchwork of time zones across the continent &ndash; no mean feat when countries seem to have opposing preferences for a permanent winter or summer time.

Games like StreetHunt and Strollhunt which gamify city exploration are popular examples.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn&rsquo;t to say that such games don&rsquo;t have any drawbacks, and a common criticism of mobile games is that they can be addictive. Dr Cheng agrees that location-based games, like any other games, can have this impact on a subset of players but that, on a regional level, they have been found to improve local trends in mental health. He highlights several mechanisms that game companies can employ to ward against addiction, such as the use of warnings advising against further use after a cut-off time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing forwards, Dr Cheng plans to undertake more in-depth research on the relationship between technology and health.

However, the soldiers themselves very rarely articulated their experiences in the way that one might expect, given what we know of their circumstances,&rdquo; he says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Before this research, I had always assumed that crisis was an event &ndash; a thing that you encountered. But as I started my research, it became clear that crisis can be experienced as two things: a crisis can be acute (a moment that we must respond to), but crises can also be chronic (situations or experiences which we can't do anything to change, at least in the short term). These two forms of crisis require very different responses and coping mechanisms, so what I became primarily interested in is: what does it mean to experience a crisis, and how do people get through these times?&rdquo;   \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENavigating an acute crisis requires having the skills, knowledge or necessary instincts to be able to respond in the most effective manner. Here, strong training will have been vital to helping soldiers cope with the harrowing experiences of battle. Dr Mayhew explains: &ldquo;Take, for example, being attacked by gas shells. In this case the military has to have imbued its soldiers with the knowledge and skills &ndash; knowing how to put on a gas mask without panicking &ndash; that will allow them to respond in an adequate and effective manner.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECoping with a chronic, longer-term crisis &ndash; such as living through the most catastrophic war to date &ndash; however, requires a different type of response, one less dependent on input from an external source like the army and more reliant on an individual&rsquo;s &ldquo;ability to create agency within those experiences and adopt mechanisms that will both develop and maintain high morale and also try to make sense of their experiences.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDr Mayhew continues: &ldquo;The way soldiers responded to being at the Front tells us a lot about human adaptability and our ability to build resilience by accepting the world around us and normalising whatever it is we&rsquo;re experiencing.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"quote","value":{"text":"The way soldiers responded to being at the Front tells us a lot about human adaptability and our ability to build resilience.

Instead of soldiers focusing on the discomfort and pain of their daily life, Dr Mayhew identifies several psychological methods that helped soldiers get through each day.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;I look at soldiers&rsquo; processes of familiarisation and normalisation and how, despite the Western Front being an alien and often traumatic physical experience, they also see it as a kind of canvas for their lives,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;They normalise even the most destructive features of it and imbue it with a lot of meaning and familiarity. I argue that this acclimatisation is crucial in helping them cope.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHope is also of supreme importance to morale, Dr Mayhew finds. &ldquo;Hope is really the central point that morale and endurance pivot around. It was essential that soldiers were able to conceive of a productive future that they were working towards. This underpinned their ability (and willingness) to endure the most horrific of things,&rdquo; he says. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHope is a complex cognitive function, boosting morale not just at times of victory, but also during times of great threat, says Dr Mayhew. He points to events of March 1918, which saw the Germans taking the offensive following a period on the defensive in Belgium and France: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s suddenly a chance that the Allies might lose the war, and this seems to re-engage the English troops. They don&rsquo;t want that, and this creates new impetus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Seeing the Germans successfully breaching the Allied lines paradoxically gives them renewed hope that their turn will also come. So in this way we can see even a negative experience can become something that instils faith and creates hope in change.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"quote","value":{"text":"Even a negative experience can become something that instils faith and creates hope in change.

For officers, it was sometimes more broad-ranging, with a sense of fighting for British institutions or notions of Empire.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis can be explained, in part, by the way the army interacted with those of different ranks. \"At this time, officers are still assumed to be from the upper echelons of British society. They get a King&rsquo;s Commission imbued with all of these almost timeless ideas of infinite duty and honour, and they genuinely feel this responsibility, not just to the monarchy, or the nation, but to their men,&rdquo; he explains. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThose lower down the ranks did not have such a connection to state and country, partly, Dr Mayhew argues, because of the way the army defined their duties. Their relationship with the military was more clinical, setting out codes of conduct and the requirement to give back all their kit and army possessions when they finished. As a result, these infantrymen were more likely to view their wartime service as something finite &ndash; a duty that would end once one had &ldquo;done one&rsquo;s bit&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite this, this concept of fighting for their homeland resonated across all ranks and was key to maintaining morale. &ldquo;Everyone had a very personalised sense of what home was, but the thing I find that underpins their experiences is that they all believe they're defending their homeland, and that concept was very resilient to change,&rdquo; Dr Mayhew says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhat soldiers of the Great War can teach us &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile understanding how societies navigated challenges in the past can help us think about how to respond to and overcome future crises, Dr Mayhew&rsquo;s findings also provide suggestions as to why, as a species, we are often better at adapting to crises than creating the change needed to avoid them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"The classic statement is the past is a foreign land. But at its heart, history is about how people, institutions, the state and global society respond to crises. However society has changed, there are still commonalities (across both time and space) in the way that individuals and communities have navigated crises. Some suggest crisis is a product of modernity, but one could argue it has always accompanied the human story,&rdquo; he concludes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It's both hopeful and terrifying to consider just how adaptable humans are to the world around them and how easy it is for us to normalise crisis. I think that helps explain why humans have been so successful, and why we, to this day, still migrate across oceans (and endure great dangers and traumas) to try and create a better future for ourselves. But it also points to why it's so difficult for us to respond to things like climate change, because we are so good at adapting and so relentlessly hopeful &ndash; even when that hope might be misplaced. And while that is hugely helpful in getting us through disasters, it maybe isn't so helpful when we need to engineer change in the face of the environmental

He notes: &ldquo;In the 18th century this lasted about two years but has increased since World War II to about 14 years. Growth periods have become much longer over time and the gap between recessions has become much bigger.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDr Lennard believes there are two reasons for this change. Firstly, our economy is no longer heavily vulnerable to good and bad harvests which can be very volatile. Secondly, economic policy now plays a much more prominent role in stabilising the economy, with policymakers having the power to make a big difference.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, with economic policy having a significant impact, can we use it to avoid recessions completely?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDr Lennard doesn&rsquo;t think so. &ldquo;To draw an analogy, you could think about managing the economy a bit like managing your health,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;There are good practices you can adopt to put off visits to the doctor and, likewise, you can implement prudent economic policy. However, one day, something is going to come up and a doctor&rsquo;s visit will be necessary. The goal is to minimise the severity and frequency of these bad events rather than avoid them forever.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EMultiple economic shocks\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the question of how policymakers can help manage the recession we are currently facing, Dr Lennard acknowledges this will be particularly problematic. Traditionally, recessions are caused by a single event. This one, however, is the result of three big shocks to the economy &ndash; the 2022 energy crisis, the impact of COVID-19, and Brexit.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"quote","value":{"text":"One thing I hadn’t anticipated while doing this research is that public health crises were a cause of recessions long before COVID-19.

It may be that fiscal policy has to do one job with targeted support to vulnerable households to protect their incomes and monetary policy must do the other job of fighting inflation. But it&rsquo;s a bit like having one foot on the accelerator and another on the brake.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat history has taught us though, is that strong coherent policy and managing expectations can help us navigate even the most turbulent of economic times. &ldquo;Our expectations for the future can govern our behaviour today,&rdquo; explains Dr Lennard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA key example can be drawn from the 1930s where there were deflationary expectations &ndash; as households and companies expected prices to continue falling, they perpetually postponed consumption and investment in anticipation of cheaper prices in the future causing severe damage to the economy. &ldquo;Policymakers in the US and, to a lesser-extent, the UK, had to reverse these expectations through clearly-communicated bold and coherent policy,&rdquo; he explains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EPublic health and the economy\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, this also isn&rsquo;t the first time a public health crisis has played a significant role in causing a recession. &ldquo;One thing I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated while doing this research is that public health crises were a cause of recessions long before COVID-19. Going through the historical records, there were at least three recessions caused by public health crises in the 18th century. In the UK, the clearest example is the recession of 1737 where there was an epidemic of colds and fevers,&rdquo; says Dr Lennard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne historical source from the time reads that &ldquo;there was a general distemper of violent coughs and colds all over the nation, of which many died&rdquo; (Harland, 1851). Another cites that the people of Plymouth were struck with &ldquo;violent swelling of the face, the parotids and maxillary [salivary] glands, followed by an immense discharge of an exceedingly acrid pituita from the mouth and nose; toothache and, in some, hemicrania; &lsquo;in multitudes,&rsquo; wandering rheumatic pains; in others violent sciatics; in some griping of the bowels&rdquo; (Creighton, 1894). This &ldquo;epidemic of colds and fever &ndash; probably influenza &ndash; may have reduced industrial activity in the country generally&rdquo; (Ashton, 1959).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the flu of 1918 to 1920 (sometimes called the Spanish flu) is often thought to have had a big impact on the economy, Dr Lennard believes more research is needed in this area. While the UK suffered its most severe recession in modern history between 1919 and 1921, like the recession we face today, a lot was going on at the time. Factors including the impact of World War I and the separation of Ireland from the UK have made it hard for historians to isolate the effect of the flu on the economy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd just how we look to past recessions for answers, it is very possible the historians of tomorrow will look back at the recession of 2023 to glean lessons

Decisions such as whether you receive state support, are successful in a job application or have a visa approved. These algorithms can be opaque and discriminatory, leaving us with little knowledge about how a decision was made. And, like historical colonialism, the effects are usually felt most strongly by those who are already vulnerable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is before we get on to the damage data collection can do to the environment.

In the UK, members of racialised communities regularly endure increased police presence, higher rates of stop and search and higher arrest rates. In the year before the pandemic, for example, black people were nearly ten times more likely than white counterparts to be stopped and searched. During the pandemic, the problem expanded.

The researchers then coded which reports discussed climate change between 2000 and 2018 and identified the staff involved in the drafting of each report.

He points to the &ldquo;Bridgetown initiative&rdquo; as a pertinent example. Spearheaded by Barbados, the initiative looks at how legacy institutions like the IMF and World Bank, which have enormous financial resources and expertise, can be repurposed to help countries become more resilient to climate impacts.

At the Middle East Centre, the research I am conducting draws attention to the importance of using the right terminology in describing bilateral relations.

The research I am carrying out explores deeper lines of convergence. By casting a wider analytical net, I identify a fundamental connective tissue that binds Moscow and Tehran.

Importantly, I want to emphasise that our experiment does not allow us to rigorously compare the direct digital approach with other methods, and there certainly is no one-size fits all solution, but our evidence does indicate that the all-digital approach is viable and effective.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERestricting the cash-out option and requiring the women to pay for items using the app also reduced the potential that they could be physically coerced into giving up the funds, or using them in a way they did not wish to. Over 90 per cent of those involved in the trial reported that they alone made the decision over how to spend the money, says Dr Callen, indicating that digital payments could also be a way to give, at least some, autonomy to marginalised groups like the Afghan women involved here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EDigital aid payments are not a panacea\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the project produced positive findings, Dr Callen cautions that mobile money is not a silver-bullet to the issues of delivering effective humanitarian aid.

Another potential issue is that governments could just shut down the app altogether, or tax the app directly and not allow them to channel financial payments.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the need to ensure that enough merchants will accept the digital vouchers as payment to make it viable, and that the training that enabled the women to use the app is sustainable and safe - something increasingly difficult to predict as the Taliban continue to impose strict restrictions on the movements and freedoms of women and girls.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;We found that the best way to train the women to use the digital voucher was to do it in a group setting, so this would usually involve bringing 50 or so women together at a community centre,&rdquo; says Dr Callen. &ldquo;But this is something that draws a lot of attention. We didn't encounter any problems, but you definitely had to let the local authorities know that this was going to be happening.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;So there are challenges. Afghanistan is probably the most challenging place to work with women in the world right now, and it would take some thinking and innovations beyond what we&rsquo;ve done so far, but there are models of doing this where you could enrol somebody without them having to come to a centralised location or even leave home.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA quick and easy rollout might not be viable, but with the programme showing that there are clear gains to be made from using direct mobile payments, Dr Callen hopes that greater use can be made of the opportunities digital technologies provide.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;This needs a certain ecosystem to work,&rdquo; he concludes. &ldquo;There are undoubtedly still many areas around the world where traditional aid methods would be more appropriate. But I think there's a large chunk of territory where something like this could work. Given that it&rsquo;s cost effective and seems to provide at least some additional resilience against corruption that more traditional approaches don't have, I think it does make sense to use this method where we can.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDr Michael Callen was speaking to Jess Winterstein, Deputy \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EH\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eead of \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EM\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eedia \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003ER\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eelations at LSE. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImage: Michael Callen\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"subscribeCTA","value":{"button":{"link":{"entryTitle":"Research for the World newsletter sign up","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"c1172d9b-6099-482e-abe5-64edf41c84b8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"link","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}},"text":"Subscribe"},"link":{"entryTitle":"Research for the World newsletter sign up","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"c1172d9b-6099-482e-abe5-64edf41c84b8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"link","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}},"description":"\u003Cp\u003ESign up to receive our newsletter: a bi-monthly digest of the latest social science research articles, podcasts and videos from LSE\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","title":"Interested in research like this?"}}],"thumbnailImageVertical":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"23_0264 digital humanitarian aid afghan women vertical","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"64454610-b807-4f6c-b191-428eabe8b8b4","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fresearch-image-library\u002Farticle-vertical-images-thumb\u002F23-0264-digital-humanitarian-aid-afghan-women-vertical.x91076d22.jpg"}}},"readingTime":"6 min read","thumbnailImageHorizontal":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"23_0264 digital humanitarian aid afghan women meta","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"26d19f1a-1603-4113-862e-9a654fc16b88","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fresearch-image-library\u002Farticle-horizontal-images-thumb\u002F23-0264-digital-humanitarian-aid-afghan-women-meta.x3ce96692.jpg"}}},"featuredAcademic":[{"entryTitle":"Michael Callen","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"98025179-bd9f-403e-b75d-31ed4d7a671f","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"person","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fresearch\u002Fresearch-for-the-world\u002Fprofiles\u002Fmichael-callen"}}],"relatedArticles":[{"entry":{"entryTitle":"Can asset transfers help women in extreme poverty?","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"84540b09-084a-4962-97f6-b562fe75a9b5","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fresearch\u002Fresearch-for-the-world\u002Feconomics\u002Fcan-asset-transfers-help-women-in-extreme-poverty"}},"linkURL":null,"articleDate":null,"linkText":null,"articleReadingTime":null},{"entry":{"entryTitle":"Why do people stay poor?","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"5a3a0611-1095-409d-9e61-66675cf0d172","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fresearch\u002Fresearch-for-the-world\u002Feconomics\u002Fwhy-do-people-stay-poor"}},"linkURL":null,"articleDate":null,"linkText":null,"articleReadingTime":null},{"entry":{"entryTitle":"How do we achieve durable peace in situations of persisting conflicts?

The first narrative &ndash; the one that is very embedded in society &ndash; understands motherhood as a linear process.

However, the difficulty felt in managing these tensions varied widely depending on local laws, culture and social expectations. In some countries where little to no maternity support is available, such as in some African countries, it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for women not to return to work at all.

The landlocked central European country is culturally similar to its large neighbour Germany, and similarly conservative in terms of social norms around how domestic life should be managed.

Present day Austria is relatively generous to new parents who are currently entitled to up to 35 months of taxpayer-funded Shared Parental Leave, alongside two years of job protection. Austrian parents also have access to heavily subsidised childcare places. In Austria, around a quarter of children under the age of three, and 90 per cent of children aged between three and five, attend formal childcare settings such as nurseries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProfessor Landais says: &ldquo;We focused on all changes in family policies since the 1960s, with the data enabling us to study how they interacted as a package towards women&rsquo;s careers.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of his analysis, Professor Landais found that that the combined family policies in Austria have had very little effect on reducing gender inequality between men and women.

Confidence culture mandates individual solutions to collective problems and flattens out important intersections of identity, and so self-help, self-love, and self-improvement messages in female-focused advertising campaigns have intensified as broader social inequalities have deepened.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is neither a coincidence, or without consequence, says Professor Gill: “We often see confidence culture and woke-washing converge in corporate advertising. In campaigns which foreground body confidence and self-love, these often also purport to have more diverse representations.

Rather, it provides a limited and formulaic toolkit for survival in a society that critically underserves women. However, this does not mean that the fruits of confidence culture have not been incredibly valuable, heartfelt, and life-changing for many women.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProfessors Orgad and Gill are ambivalent in this respect: “Confidence culture is powerful, it's seductive, it's appealing, and as women, as researchers, and as human beings – we don't exist outside of it.

This is obviously unacceptable, and indeed the report does say that these studies provide conclusive evidence of bias in hiring and that this needs to be investigated further.

Or it could include psychological studies on how people deliberate and come to decisions in more general circumstances.

Literally translated, s\u003Cem\u003Euujua acatiha\u003C\u002Fem\u003E means to defend or forgive the heart-soul (of another), although I find it helpful to translate as &ldquo;defence-respect&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the Urarina, feeling and displaying defence-respect generally means assuming a responsibility of care for someone, as an active commitment, while maintaining an appropriate distance. It&rsquo;s an attitude, but also a skill and political concept, because it lies at the heart of the Urarina arts of diplomacy and civility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas the Western concept of respect is founded in a universalist conception of dignity and common humanity &ndash; people are worthy of respect simply because they&rsquo;re autonomous human beings &ndash; the Urarina concept acknowledges not their fundamental sameness to oneself, but their very difference or otherness, and the ways in which that person is in some deep sense unknowable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, the Urarina steadfastly refuse to explicitly put themselves in someone else&rsquo;s shoes. To be respectful towards others, they downplay knowledge of their mental states; refusing to compare specific individuals to one another or give any form of appraisal of their relative aptitudes or skills. There&rsquo;s a kind of evaluative abstinence in play in turning a blind eye to peoples&rsquo; faults, but also their merits, which in practice turns out to be a very powerful way of asserting equality.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"image","value":{"altText":"An Urarina home","transformations":null,"caption":"Image: An Urarina home in the Amazonian rainforest.","asset":{"entryTitle":"Walker_Jan_article2","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"21c38c85-ee46-4824-a3cc-95ffbad71c10","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fresearch-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002Fwalker-jan-article2.x2ba25f3a.jpg"}}}},{"type":"content","value":"\u003Cp\u003EOf course this is not the only emotion that helps us understand Urarina&rsquo;s sense of justice. \u003Cem\u003ECoehija\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (shame\u002Fembarrassment), \u003Cem\u003Ecaichaojoaa \u003C\u002Fem\u003E(pity\u002Fcompassion); and \u003Cem\u003Eobaica\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (rage\u002Fvengeance) also play key roles in Urarina everyday life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI argue that these emotions are the emotional core of a distinctly Amazonian sense of justice: a set of embodied, emotional dispositions that underwrite and maintain the particular form of cooperation that is the \u003Cem\u003Elauri\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, or kin group. But this is only part of the story.

In the past, there were few if any mechanisms for resolving disputes, other than the departure and relocation of one or both parties. Today, a more sedentary lifestyle has forced people to figure out new ways of resolving conflicts. For example, minor misdemeanours can now be &ldquo;punished&rdquo; by locking people up in a small prison cell for a set number of hours.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn tandem with this shift has been a rise in prominence of a new way of speaking about what matters, or is worthwhile, often framed in terms of rights, duties, and other general principles such as equality or fairness. At the same time, a younger, more modern generation of leaders speak about such topics as Urarina peoples&rsquo; equal &ldquo;rights&rdquo; under &ldquo;the law&rdquo;. These same leaders speak often about the need for all community members to &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo;, to &ldquo;work together&rdquo; and contribute &ldquo;equally&rdquo; to common projects, such as the upkeep of the school, for the advancement of the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll this appears to stand in tension with the system of moral emotions, based on the \u003Cem\u003Elauri\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, or small kin group.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how can we make sense of this?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EMoralities of cooperation\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI argue that this can be understood through examining the way the changes in Urarina communities have impacted the way individuals need to cooperate. In the context of small, relatively tight-knit kin groups, Urarina peoples&rsquo; moral and ethical lives play out through a specific set of embodied emotional dispositions that result in a particular way of getting on with others. It's focused on the management of personal boundaries, and very effectively prevents the build-up of hierarchy or coercion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut as people are compelled to establish wider networks of cooperation - in this case by forming stable communities for the first time - a new set of skills is needed. A more abstract moral discourse emerges as a way of framing other people as neither friends nor enemies, necessarily, but simply fellow citizens. Equality emerges as a formal principle, but based more on &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; than &ldquo;respect&rdquo;, as emotional responsiveness to others gives way to reason and calculation. At the same time, in practice, society grows more unequal, and new forms of coercion emerge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a time of escalating inequality and ecological crisis, anthropology has an important role to play in expanding our moral and political imaginations. Embodied, emotional dispositions alone cannot readily solve problems of complex, large-scale coordination. But the Urarina example shows us that emotions are not incompatible with justice. In fact, only by cultivating appropriate emotions can we hope to achieve a more just society.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImages: Harry Walker\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"subscribeCTA","value":{"button":{"link":{"entryTitle":"Research for the World newsletter sign up","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"c1172d9b-6099-482e-abe5-64edf41c84b8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"link","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}},"text":"Subscribe"},"link":{"entryTitle":"Research for the World newsletter sign up","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"c1172d9b-6099-482e-abe5-64edf41c84b8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"link","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}},"description":"\u003Cp\u003ESign up to receive our newsletter: a bi-monthly digest of the latest social science research articles, podcasts and videos from LSE\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","title":"Interested in research like this?"}}],"thumbnailImageVertical":null,"readingTime":"9 min read","thumbnailImageHorizontal":null,"featuredAcademic":[{"entryTitle":"Harry Walker","entryDescription":null,"entryThumbnail":null,"sys":{"id":"224d202f-b452-45ce-a44d-945471a816bb","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"person","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fresearch\u002Fresearch-for-the-world\u002Fprofiles\u002Fharry-walker"}}],"relatedArticles":[{"entry":{"entryTitle":"Citizens of nowhere?

With travel impossible, Dr Marzi made the decision to shift to a completely remote, participatory video design, with the women taking sole responsibility for filming, using smart phones.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It required a lot of commitment and we had no clue how it would end,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But I was also in a very rare position as an academic, which was to be able to test and trial something new, with no idea what the outcome might be and a risk to fail.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"quote","value":{"text":"The beauty of the remote participatory aspect is that it gave the women a lot of power over what they filmed - much more so than if we had been there to facilitate the project in person."}},{"type":"content","value":"\u003Ch2\u003EHarnessing the positives of remote working\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team&rsquo;s first job was to recruit women for the project. Using WhatsApp, 14 were recruited, of which 12 saw through the project from start to finish.

I think this is one of the big strengths of this new method we have developed. The beauty of the remote participatory aspect is that it gave the women a lot of power over what they filmed - much more so than if we had been there to facilitate the project in person.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EParticipant women were also in control of the editorial decision making process which helped increase the women&rsquo;s confidence as they worked to tell their stories, Dr Marzi believes, and the project has also helped improve their practical skills. Women who, in May 2020, were technical novices, are now frequently connecting through Zoom, making sophisticated filmmaking choices.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDr Marzi stresses that every step of the process has been completely collaborative, with the women choosing exactly what shots to include and how to edit their footage together. &ldquo;One of the huge positives of this new methodology is that it has really empowered the women filming their own experiences,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We really tried to make the remote-aspect work for us in this way, so we called them directors and gave them complete control over what footage would go into the film.

The landlocked central European country is culturally similar to its large neighbour Germany, and similarly conservative in terms of social norms around how domestic life should be managed.

Austrian parents also have access to heavily subsidised childcare places.

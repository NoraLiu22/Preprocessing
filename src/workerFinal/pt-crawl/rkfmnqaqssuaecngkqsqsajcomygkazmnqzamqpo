              <p>I would like to now take you into a didgeridoo lesson. The didgeridoo 
              is also known by the name of Yidaki, which is a word that the Yolungu 
              people use in the northern parts of Australia. The first step that 
              I would like to take you through is getting the didge sound. We 
              must remember that the didgeridoo is one of the oldest wind instruments 
              in the world and therefore it is a very simple instrument to play.

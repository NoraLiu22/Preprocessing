<h1><a name="Heading4"></a><b>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction In The Church Of The Province Of
Aotearoa, New Zealand And Polynesia</b></h1>

<p><b>NOEL COX</b><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[*]</a></p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading7"></a><b>I	INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
<p>This paper is an exploration of the legal relationship between Church and
State in twenty-first century New Zealand, taking as its
example the Anglican
Church.</p>
<p>We begin with a look at the sources of fundamental authority within the
Church, especially divine law as a superior source of law.
 This is followed by
a brief look at the history and origins of canon law, the spiritual law of the
Church.  The legal position of
the Church within the wider legal system is then
examined, in its original English setting.  The internal governance of the
Church
of England is then reviewed.  The next step is an examination of the
possible models, of disestablished Churches, and non-established
Churches, which
might be said to describe the situation of the Church in New Zealand.  The
doctrine of consensual compact, the secular
legal basis for Church law, is then
examined, along with the applicability of pre-existing canonical systems.  Some
aspects of secular
legislation impinging on the Church is then reviewed.  In
conclusion, it is asked whether the concept of separation of Church and
State,
so influential in many parts of the world, has been overstated in this country. 
It is postulated that this separation is
alien to both the secular and spiritual
laws.  The true situation is an imperfect separation, but one which reflects the
historical
evolution of the English Church, particularly but not exclusively
post-Reformation. </p>
<p>The Church is neither established nor disestablished.  The Anglican Church in
New Zealand may be classified broadly as quasi-established
in the sense that
whilst having the status of contractual societies, there are close legal links
between the Church and State, the
authority of internal Church law rests at
least in part upon the existence of secular legislation, and secular legislation
expressly
and directly regulates some of the temporal affairs of the Church.
</p>
<p>The Church of the Province of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, is a
provincial Church of the world-wide Anglican Communion.  It
inherited the basic
tenets and structure of the Church of England when that Church arrived in New
Zealand during the nineteenth century,
and has modified these to suit local
conditions.</p>
<p>The framework within which the Church operates may be characterised by two
factors.  First, it is non-established in that it is not
formally recognised or
supported by the State, nor does it enjoy a privileged
position.<a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a>  Secondly, although it has adopted
the principle of partnership between Maori and non-Maori (so that parallel
hierarchies have been
established), the Church is a constituent member of the
Anglican Communion, with the continuity which that
implies.<a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></p>
<p>As a basic principle within the Anglican Communion, the exercise of
legislative power is confined to national, provincial, or diocesan
assemblies. 
The Churches are distinguished by their autonomy; the Catholic and Apostolic
faith and order as set forth in the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>; their
particular or national form; and the lack of a central legislative and executive
authority but mutual loyalty sustained through
the common counsel of bishops in
conference.<a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a>  But the Churches vary in the
degree to which they have adopted, or preserved, the
&#8216;establishment&#8217;, or nexus of Church
and State.  The Anglican Church
in New Zealand occupies a unique position in New Zealand society, in part
because of the close links
between Church and Maori. This in turn had its effect
upon the 'establishment' of the Church. </p>
<p>In New Zealand, the Anglican Church has also often taken a leading role in
promoting recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi, with its
principle of
partnership between Maori and Pakeha.<a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a> 
Orthodox theory holds that the Treaty of Waitangi has socio-political, not legal
force, as it was not a treaty recognised by international
law.<a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[4]</a>  It therefore has effect only so far as
legal recognition has been specifically accorded
it.<a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[4]</a>  At some time, however, either the courts
or Parliament may have to give the Treaty legal recognition as part of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of New Zealand.<a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[5]</a>  But already the
Treaty of Waitangi, as a principle of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, is now all but
entrenched, if only because it is regarded by Maori generally as a sort of
&#8216;holy writ&#8217;.<a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[6]</a>  The Church at least
has emphasised it, though not at the expense of losing its apostolic and
catholic character. </p>
<p>The legal, jurisdictional form of the Anglican Church is less apparent than
it is in the Roman Catholic Church. But it is no less
certain that the legal
form of the Church of England has been important in its evolution.  In broad
terms, the authority of the Church
is not man-made law, but law derived of God,
or divine law as revealed to mankind- the canon law of the Church.  Yet much of
the
law governing the Church is to be found in secular statutes and court
decisions, in accordance with the relationship between Church
and State since
the Reformation in England.</p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading24"></a><b>II	FUNDAMENTAL AUTHORITY: CHURCH LAW, THEOLOGY, AND
DIVINE LAW</b></h2>
<p>God, in creating mankind, ordered it to subdue the earth and to exercise
dominion over the earth.<a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[7]</a>  Mankind, in
attempting to establish separate dominion and autonomous jurisdiction over the
earth,<a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[8]</a> fell into sin and death.  Biblical
law is a covenant, a plan for dominion under
God,<a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[9]</a> and is based on revelation.  Civil law
cannot be separated from Biblical law, for the Biblical doctrine of law includes
all law,
civil, ecclesiastical, societal, familial, and all other forms of law. 
Even laws made by secular authorities are in a sense laws
of God.</p>
<p>Law is in any culture religious in origin. Law governs mankind and society,
because it establishes and declares the meaning of justice
and righteousness,
therefore law is inescapably religious, in that it establishes in practical
fashion the ultimate concerns of a
culture.  Accordingly, a fundamental and
necessary premise in any and every study of law must be, first, a recognition of
this religious
nature of law. Second, in any culture the source of law is the
god of that society.  Modern humanism, the religion of the State,
locates law in
the State and thus makes the State, or the people as they find expression in the
State, the god of the system.<a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[10]</a>  Third, in
any society, any change of law is an explicit or implicit change of religion. 
Nothing more clearly reveals, in fact,
the religious change in a society than a
legal revolution.  When the legal foundations shift from Biblical law to
humanism, it means
that the society now draws its vitality and power from
humanism, not from Christian theism.<a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[11]</a>  This
means that the laws enacted by secular authorities can only with difficulty be
seen as truly being the laws of God.</p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading32"></a><b>III	DIVINE LAW AS A SUPERIOR SOURCE</b></h2>
<p>Law is not law if it lacks the power to bind, to compel, and to punish. 
While it is a fallacy to define law simply as compulsion
or coercion, it is also
a serious error to define law without recognising that coercion is basic to it. 
To separate power from law
is to deny it the status of
law.<a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[12]</a></p>
<p>Power is a religious concept, and the god or gods of any system of thought
have been the sources of power for that system.  The monarch
or ruler has a
religious significance precisely because of his power.  When the democratic
State gains power, it too arrogates to
itself religious claims and prerogatives.
Power is jealously guarded in the anti-Christian State, and any division of
powers in the
State, designed to limit its power and prevent its concentration,
is bitterly contested.<a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[13]</a>  It is not a
coincidence that the conflict between Church and State came to a head in the
sixteenth century, at a time when the modern
State began to succeed in its
claims to a monopoly of mans&#8217;
allegiance.<a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[14]</a></p>
<p>The law, both criminal and civil, claims to be able to speak about morality
and immorality generally.  Where does it get its authority
to do this and how
does it settle the moral principles which it enforces?  Undoubtedly, as a matter
of history, it derives both from
Christian teaching.  The law, however, can no
longer rely on doctrine in which citizens are entitled to disbelieve.  It is
necessary
therefore to look for some other
source.<a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[15]</a></p>
<p>The legal crisis is due to the fact that the law of Western civilisation has
been Christian law, but its faith is increasingly humanist.
 The old law is
therefore neither fully understood, nor obeyed, nor
enforced.<a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[16]</a>  But in a society where the
Church has ceased to be, or never was, the Church of the people, but rather a
voluntary association,
questions of the divine nature of law remain important
within the Church. Fundamental questions of competence are perhaps more
vigorously
fought in these circumstances, for the extent (or existence) of
unalterable tenets or laws are disputed.<a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[17]</a> 
Whether the Church itself should make all its own laws, whether and to what
extent these laws are immutable, and whether the Church
should utilise secular
laws, remain vitally important, yet difficult to
resolve.<a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[18]</a></p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading44"></a><b>IV	HISTORY AND ORIGINS OF CANON LAW</b></h2>
<p>Just what, then, are the laws which govern the Church?  Ecclesiastical law
may be defined as so much of the laws of New Zealand concerned
with the
regulation of the affairs of the Church of England, and the internal or domestic
laws of the Church, inapplicable to non-members.
 The sources of this law may be
found first, in theology (the <i>Bible</i>, patristic writings, opinions of
other authors, pronouncements of Lambeth Conferences, liturgical formularies);
secondly, the canons
of the Church; thirdly, the common law; fourthly, the
statute law so far as it impinges on ecclesiastical governance; and fifthly,
subordinate legislation, whether by secular or spiritual
agency.<a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[19]</a></p>
<p>This is consistent with a long tradition.  Until the middle of the nineteenth
century the ecclesiastical law in England was not regarded
as an isolated
system, but as a part, albeit with its own particular rules, of a much greater
system, and one which might be illuminated
and assisted by works of canonists in
other lands.<a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[20]</a>  Both theology and history
demonstrate the ecclesiological nature of canon law.  Ombres argues, from the
Roman Catholic point of
view, that canon law issuing from an ecumenically minded
ecclesiology will be both convergent and
provisional.<a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[21]</a></p>
<p>Sources of ecclesiastical regulation in the Anglican Communion is normally
defined and found in a single document.<a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[22]</a> 
Ecclesiastical law is &#8216;the law relating to any matter concerning the
Church of England administration and enforced in any
court&#8217;,
ecclesiastical or temporal, and &#8216;law administered by ecclesiastical courts
and persons&#8217;.<a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[23]</a> &#8216;Ecclesiastical
law is not foreign law.  It is part of the general law of
England&#8217;.<a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[24]</a>  Formal laws include Acts
of Parliament, by-laws, rules and regulations, ordinances, resolutions, decrees,
liturgical rubrics.  Alongside
the formal laws exist less formal and sometimes
unwritten sources: customs or traditions,<a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[25]</a>
decisions of Church courts, &#8216;principles of canon
law&#8217;,<a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[26]</a> for some, the English canons
ecclesiastical 1603, or pre-Reformation Roman Catholic canon law.  Alongside
laws properly so-called,
Churches are regulated by quasi-legislation, informal
administrative rules designed to supplement the formal law:
&#8216;directions&#8217;,
&#8216;guidelines&#8217;, &#8216;codes of
practice&#8217; or &#8216;policy
documents&#8217;.<a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[27]</a></p>
<p>Historically, canon law meant something very different from what it now
represents.<a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[28]</a> The distinction between
ecclesiastical law and canon law depends upon the relationship of the Church and
the secular government.
 As a general rule, ecclesiastical law relates to the
Church but is made for the Church by the
State,<a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[29]</a> canon law is made for the Church by
the Church itself.<a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[30]</a>  More accurately
perhaps, ecclesiastical law may be taken to include both canon law, laws made by
the Church which are not canon
laws, and laws made by the State for the Church. 
Canon law has validity only within the framework of its principal and parent,
the
divine law.  Thus the Church can only make rules relating to the details,
not the essential nature, of the law.<a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[31]</a> Other
laws may be informed with theological principles, but are not bound by the
limitations imposed by divine law.</p>
<p>It is important that the theological root of the canon law is sound.  The
canonist can never be simply a lawyer, he or she must always
be in some measure
a theologian, and will frequently require the assistance of
historians.<a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[32]</a>  One of the fundamental tasks
of the canonist is to subject the rules of canon law to a rigorous examination
against the basic Christian
theological
doctrines.<a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[33]</a> </p>
<p>The history of the canon law is beyond the scope of this study, but a brief
outline may prove instructive.  Local custom, varied or
controlled by local
episcopal regulation, soon built up a series of elastic and rudimentary systems.
Later, local councils and General
Councils issued canons of more general
application and, with the growth of papal authority, the decretals of popes
assumed an ever-growing
importance. These decretals were later incorporated into
codes.<a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[34]</a>  Canon law drew from Roman civil law
for the training of its lawyers, and its procedure, and for much of its
jurisprudential concepts
and language.  For its substantive law, however, it
looked to the general codes, canons and decretals and to the ordinances of
provinces
and of dioceses.<a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[35]</a></p>
<p>The late twentieth century was a time of codification for the Roman Catholic
Church.  The Latin Church obtained first the 1917 and
then the 1983 Codes of
Canon Law.  A Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches was granted in 1990 for
the twenty-one Churches in full
communion with Rome.  The existence of different
codes gives prominence to the plurality of constituent Churches, and it also
discourages
mistaking the Latin Church for the universal Catholic
Church.<a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[36]</a>  The retrieval of a common and
formative heritage means that the study of the shared canonical past, a part of
the more general theological
and ecclesiological heritage, is to be pursued for
more than antiquarian or scholarly ends.  The retrieval of a common memory
contributes
to shaping our present Christian
identity.<a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[37]</a></p>
<p>The decree on ecumenism of the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) taught that
those who believe in Christ and have been truly baptised
are in some kind of
communion with the Roman Catholic Church, even though this communion is
imperfect.<a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[38]</a>  The ecumenical hope being
expressed is not that one standardised canonical system will emerge from the
reunion of Christians.  It
is likely and desirable that each Christian
denomination would retain some of its canonical traditions after
reunion.<a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[39]</a> Canonists must be comparatively
minded.<a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[40]</a>  The laws of the Church of the
Province of New Zealand include ecclesiastical laws and canon laws, the latter
of which at least reflect
a joint, common legal and theological heritage with
Rome.</p>
<p>Canon law shares some of the characteristics of secular law and some of
theology. If canon law is seen as simply the set of norms
of a human society,
then it will change according to social and political pressures and
circumstances.  If canon law is seen as theological,
because it has supernatural
sources and aims, then it will be created, understood, and practised in
specifically Christian ways.<a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[41]</a></p>
<p>In an age which has been marked by the triumph of humanism, it is not
surprising that the Church too has come to be influenced by
this approach.  The
scope of the divine, unalterable law has been
narrowed.<a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[42]</a>  Indeed, with the triumph of
secular Parliament over the spiritual Convocation as a consequence of the
Reformation in England, and
the resultant legislative weakness of the English
Church, this is hardly surprising.  The Anglican Communion has only slowly
emerged
from the shadow cast by the royal supremacy, and still suffers from a
relative jurisprudential weakness compared to the fullness
of the Roman Catholic
canon law.</p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading79"></a><b>V	THE LEGAL POSITION OF THE CHURCH</b></h2>
<p>It was early established, as a principle of imperial constitutional law, that
settled colonies took English law.<a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[43]</a>  The
laws of New Zealand are based upon the reception of English laws in the middle
of the last century, when it was first settled
as a
colony.<a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[44]</a>  The <i>English Laws Act 1858
</i>(NZ)<a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[45]</a> provided that the laws of England,
as existing on 14 January 1840, were deemed to be in force in New
Zealand.<a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[46]</a>  They were, however, only to be in
force so far as applicable to the circumstances of the colony.  The principle of
this Act has
been followed in all relevant legislation passed by the New Zealand
Parliament since then. </p>
<p>It has been established that New Zealand acquired English law as it existed
at the time of settlement.  But it was only those laws
which were applicable to
their new situation and to the condition of a new
colony.<a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[4]</a>  It is not always easy to apply the
test.<a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[48]</a>  English laws which are to be
explained merely by English social or political conditions have no application
in a colony,<a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[49]</a> yet the courts have generally
applied the land law, which has a feudal origin. </p>
<p>The test of course requires an evaluation of the applicability of laws at the
time the colony was settled, and not at the time the
court considers the
question. In practice few areas of the laws of England have been found to be
inapplicable.  The ecclesiastical
law is however inapplicable, largely because:
</p>
<blockquote>
The ... Church of England ... is not a part of the constitution in any colonial
settlement, nor can its authorities or those who
bear office in it claim to be
recognised by the law of the colony otherwise than as the members of a voluntary
association.<br>
It cannot be said that any Ecclesiastical tribunal or jurisdiction is required
in any Colony or Settlement where there is no Established
Church, and in the
case of a settled colony the Ecclesiastical Law of England cannot, for the same
reason be treated as part of the
law which the settlers carried with them from
the Mother-country.<a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[50]</a></blockquote><p>The
ecclesiastical law is a part of the laws of England, but not part of the common
law.<a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[51]</a> More importantly, an established
Church is, by its very essence, of a territorial nature, and requires to be
expressly transplanted
from its native soil.  The law of the Church in New
Zealand defines its nature as a constituent member of the Anglican Communion,
a
Fellowship within the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic
Church.<a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[52]</a> A secular court in 1857 decided
that a Bishop in New Zealand was a Bishop in the Church of God, but not a Bishop
of the Church of
England.<a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[53]</a>  It is a
regional, rather than a purely national Church, with a strong sense of
mission.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the Church in New Zealand is highly programmatic,
presenting probably the most comprehensive statement embracing all of these
ideas.  The mission of the Church includes: &#8216;proclaiming the Gospel of
Jesus Christ&#8217;; teaching, baptising and nurturing
believers within
eucharistic communities; responding to human needs by loving service; seeking
&#8216;to transform unjust structures
of society, caring for God&#8217;s
creation, and establishing the values of the Kingdom&#8217;; the Church must
advance its mission,
safeguard and develop its doctrine and order its
affairs.<a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[54]</a>  In order to carry out its mission
on earth, the Church requires rules, codes and laws for its members.  Further
laws regulate its
relations with the State and with non-members.  The sources of
these laws are markedly different in countries which have established
Churches,
yet even in New Zealand the Church and State are not completely separated.</p>
<p>The respective roles of Church and State in modern society is markedly
different to the historic roles.  Today, rulers protect individual
freedom of
choice.  No longer is the ruler the arbiter and defender of his or her
people&#8217;s faith, he or she is more a defender
of faith in the
abstract.<a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[55]</a>  This leaves the relationship
between Church and State at times difficult.</p>
<p>Internal law usually claim ecclesiastical autonomy, and generally based on
principles of freedom and equality of religions.  Churches
may be classified as
established, quasi-established,<a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[56]</a>
disestablished, or non-established.  All but the first are based on the almost
global principle of consensual compact.  Though the
Church in New Zealand may be
broadly regarded as non-established, yet for several reasons this fails to
explain the true nature of
the Church in this country.</p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading110"></a><b>VI	THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND: LAW AND
QUASI-LEGISLATION</b></h2>
<p>The Church in New Zealand may be classified broadly as quasi-established, in
the sense that whilst having the status of contractual
societies, there are
close legal links between the Church and State.  The authority of internal
Church law rests, at least in part,
upon the existence of secular legislation,
and secular legislation expressly and directly regulates some of the temporal
affairs
of the Church.<a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[57]</a>  Several
parliamentary statutes &#8216;declare and define the Powers of the General Synod
of the Church of the Province of New Zealand&#8217;,
they govern the alteration
of the formularies of the Church, and they regulate its trust property, its
missionary diocese and its
clergy pensions funds.  The Church exists as a
consensual society and the secular courts may intervene to effect compliance by
the
Church with its own internal law and with State law applicable to the
Church.<a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[58]</a></p>
<p>With respect to its fundamental provisions, &#8216;it shall not be within the
power of the General Synod, or of any Diocesan synod,
to alter, revoke, add to,
or diminish any of the same&#8217;.<a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[59]</a>  In New
Zealand this law is fundamental in the sense that it is unalterable by the
Church acting alone. In respect of those laws
which the Church may change, the
right to propose legislation is confined to the
legislature.<a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[60]</a>  The second part of the
legislative process is ratification or adoption by the
assembly.<a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[61]</a>  The third stage is referral to
the diocese.  The next stage is confirmation on notice.  A simple majority of
diocese is required.<a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[62]</a>  The last stage is
promulgation, in a legislative process which is a copy, deliberate or
subconscious, of the secular parliamentary
process.</p>
<p>Internally, the Church can exercise coercive power or <i>imperium</i>, as
well as persuasive power or <i>dominium</i>, often derived from secular
authority.  The <i>imperium</i> includes Acts of Parliament, statutory
regulations, canons and synodical orders.  The <i>dominium</i> includes policy
documents, regulations, directives, codes of practice, circulars, guidance and
guidebooks.<a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[63]</a>  These have only moral or
persuasive force,<a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[64]</a> and do not depend upon
secular authority. </p>
<p>Courts have three basic principles to determine whether any quasi-legislation
enacted by the Church has legal force.  First, the Church&#8217;s
legitimacy. 
If a line of authority extending back to Parliament can be traced the courts are
liable to give it greater weight or
authority, particularly if it is published.
Secondly, if the issuing body intended it to bind that body or its addressee, it
will
be held by the courts to bind; intention to bind may be presumed from the
language used, if for example it is expressed in clear
and mandatory terms.
Thirdly, it will bind if capable of
enforcement.<a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[65]</a>  These courts are of course
the royal courts, the secular courts of general jurisdiction.  Their involvement
in ecclesiastical law
derives from the history of the Church in England, and in
particular, the Reformation.</p>
<p>The Preface to the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1562 is a royal declaration.  This
states that:</p>
<blockquote>
Being by God&#8217;s Ordinance, according to Our just Title, Defender of the
Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church, within these
Our Dominions, We hold it
most agreeable to this Our Kingly Office, and Our own religious zeal, to
conserve and maintain the Church
committed to Our Charge, in Unity of true
Religion, and in the Bond of Peace ... We have therefore, upon mature
Deliberation, and
with the Advice of so many of Our Bishops as might
conveniently be called together, thought fit to make this Declaration following
... That We are Supreme Governor of the Church of England
...</blockquote><p>Article 37 makes this claim to royal supremacy clearer:</p>
<blockquote>
The King&#8217;s majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and
other of his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government
of all Estates of this
Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth appertain,
and is not, nor ought to be,
subject to any foreign jurisdiction ... We give not
to our Princes the ministering either of God&#8217;s Word, or of the Sacraments
... but that only prerogative, which we see to have been given always to all
Godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that
is, that they should rule
all estates and degrees committed to their change by God, whether they be
Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and
restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and
evildoers ... The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of
England.</blockquote><p>The Queen is not now regarded in the Church of the
Province of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia as Supreme Governor of the
Church
of England, a position she still enjoys in England (though not in
Wales).<a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[66]</a>  For this reason, prayers are no
longer customarily said for the Queen and members of the royal
family,<a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[67]</a> though it might have been expected
that the Church would continue to show due regard for the secular Sovereign of
New Zealand.<a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[68]</a>  Yet the sixteenth century
reiteration of royal <i>imperium</i> over matters religious as well as secular
was to have a continuing effect upon the law of the Church, effects which may
still be
seen in twenty-first century New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Sovereign&#8217;s office of Supreme Governor of the Church of England is
to be distinguished from the title of Defender of the
Faith, which dates from
1521. In that year Pope Leo X conferred upon King Henry VIII the title of
<i>Fidei Defensor</i>.  In spite of its papal origin, the title was settled on
the King and his successors in perpetuity by Act of Parliament in
1543.<a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[69]</a></p>
<p>Since 1974 the royal style in use in New Zealand has been &#8216;Elizabeth
the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of New Zealand and
Her other Realms and
Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the
Faith&#8217;.<a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[70]</a>  The original draft of the
Royal Titles Bill 1974 removed the style of Defender of the Faith, on the
grounds that it had no historical
or legal place in New Zealand, there being no
established Church.  The National Party caucus, however, had reservations, and
considered
that the style meant much more to some people in New Zealand, who
regarded the Queen as the defender and upholder of the Christian
faith.  The
matter was discussed with the Prime Minister, and after consultation with the
Queen it was decided to retain the title
in New
Zealand.<a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[71]</a></p>
<p>The juristic theory of territorial sovereignty, with the King being supreme
ruler within the confines of his kingdom, originated as
two distinct concepts. 
The King owned no superior in temporal matters, and within his kingdom the King
was emperor.<a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[72]</a>  The Holy Roman Emperor had
legal supremacy throughout the West, or he did
not.<a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[73]</a>  If the former, theories of the
sovereignty of kings were not needed, for they had merely <i>de facto</i> power.
Sovereignty remained essentially <i>de jure</i>
authority.<a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[74]</a></p>
<p><i>Imperium et regnum</i> (imperial and royal power) was a favourite theme of
nineteenth and early twentieth century historiography.  But medieval jurists
cared not whether the emperor had jurisdiction and authority over kings and
princes, but focused on his power to usurp the rights
of his subjects.  Whether
this power was <i>de facto</i> or <i>de jure</i> was
unimportant.<a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[75]</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bartolus and Baldus led the way towards recognition of a legal sovereignty of
kings.  The emperor had a genuine <i>de jure</i> sovereignty within the
<i>terrae imperii</i>, the confines of the empire alone.  Other powers could
obtain true sovereignty on a purely <i>de facto</i> basis.  But this was not
merely power without legitimacy.<a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[76]</a>  Indeed,
because the monarch represented God&#8217;s ministry of justice, and because he
ruled as the vicegerent of Christ the King,
the office of the monarch, was seen
as a holy office.<a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[77]</a></p>
<p>In the later Middle Ages, it was believed that England was an independent
sovereign monarchy answerable only to God - in medieval
parlance an empire,
self-contained and sovereign.<a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[78]</a>  The focusing
of the Crown&#8217;s activities almost exclusively on the realm of England after
1216 encouraged such thinking. Nor
were the claims of the papacy especially
welcome.<a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[79]</a></p>
<p>Sir John Fortescue remarked that &#8216;from of old English kings have
reigned independently, and acknowledged no superior on earth
in things
temporal&#8217;.<a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[80]</a>  This was a fundamental
feature of English monarchy by the fifteenth century, based on precepts of Roman
law.<a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[81]</a>  They rejected a Holy Roman Empire
that had been narrowly German for several centuries, and the temporal authority
of the Pope. The
French had asserted their own empire for very similar reasons
by 1200.  The English canonists Alanus and Ricardens Angelicus, and
a Spaniard,
Vincentius Hispanus, articulated unambiguous statements of royal independence
from the emperor in the early thirteenth
century.<a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[82]</a>  <i>Regno suo est </i>became
commonplace in the mid-thirteenth
century.<a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[83]</a></p>
<p>Spiritual courts, separate from the secular, existed in England from shortly
after the Norman Conquest.<a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[84]</a>  This process of
separation seems to have occurred around
1072-76,<a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[85]</a> although it seems to have not been
a deliberate move but rather the effect of the increasing sophistication of the
legal system in
late Saxon England.<a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[86]</a>  But
precise identification of courts was still not easy, even at the end of the
reign of Henry I. <i>Leges Henrici Primi </i>(c.1118) does not distinguish
between a tribunal to try lay, and a tribunal to try ecclesiastical,
cases.<a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[87]</a>  Ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the
immediate post-Conquest period was, however, primarily over moral
offences.<a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[88]</a>  In subsequent centuries, the
jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was gradually
enlarged,<a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[89]</a> and was eventually to cover such
important aspects of what is now predominantly secular law such as
marriage,<a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[90]</a>
divorce,<a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[91]</a> and
succession.<a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[92]</a>  Although the Church courts
were to lose most of this jurisdiction to the secular courts in the nineteenth
century, the influence
of the Courts-Christian upon the development of the law
in these areas cannot easily be
exaggerated.<a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[93]</a></p>
<p>In theory at least the Courts-Christian and the King&#8217;s courts were
supreme within their own fields.  Medieval jurists were accustomed
to what we
might call shared sovereignty, and saw nothing amiss with the Pope having a
concurrent jurisdiction with temporal
sovereigns,<a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[94]</a> nor with the Church exercising
concurrent jurisdiction with the King.  In accordance with this principle,
espoused in particular
by the Bologna school of
canonists,<a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[95]</a> the Church courts were, and
remain, as unfettered within their jurisdiction as the temporal courts within
theirs.<a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[96]</a>  As a general principle, no appeals
lay from an ecclesiastical court to a secular
court.<a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[97]</a>  Appeal from the courts of the
archbishops lay to the patriarch, in the west the Bishop of Rome.  The right of
English litigants
to appeal to the Pope dates from at least the time of King
Stephen,<a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[98]</a> and probably
before.<a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[99]</a></p>
<p>Such appeals were heard either by the Pope himself, from the time of Pope
Gregory VII by his permanent legates, or by special delegates
appointed to hear
a particular cause.<a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[100]</a>  An appeal to the
papacy might omit some preliminary steps, <i>omisso medio</i>. Any appeal heard
by a subordinate could be appealed to the Pope himself, and even appealed from
the Pope to the Pope &#8216;better
informed&#8217;.<a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[101]</a></p>
<p>Partly because of the <i>omisso medio</i>, but also due to the increasing
jealously of the common law courts, the right to appeal to Rome was in England
long subject to restrictions
by the King.  For, although the Church courts were
supreme within their jurisdiction, precisely what that jurisdiction was could
be
the subject of dispute. Nor were the courts immune from contemporary political
controversies, particularly those concerned with
the respective roles of Church
and State.<a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[102]</a>  Attempts were made to limit
appeals to Rome, as well as original trials by papal
delegates.<a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[103]</a>  But appeals continued
nevertheless, perhaps with the King&#8217;s licence. </p>
<p>The bulk of medieval canonists acknowledged the significance of the role of
the sacred college of cardinals, but nevertheless rejected
the view that the
Pope could not act, except in minor matters, without their approval.  The common
opinion of the doctors of canon
law was that the Pope had the power to legislate
for the universal Church. even without the
cardinals.<a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[104]</a>  Contrary views were not,
however, unknown, and in the fifteenth century those of Johannes Monachus,
himself a cardinal, were particularly
powerful.  These stressed the
<i>plenitudio </i>of the Pope, but only with the consent of the
cardinals.<a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[105]</a>  Monarchus maintained that
the position of the Pope was akin to that enjoyed by the Bishop in relation to
his cathedral chapter.<a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[106]</a>  By discrediting
the claims of the papacy to universal ecclesiastical hegemony, the Reformation
left the field open for the secular
rulers to claim that they alone were
answerable before God for the good government of their respective kingdoms, and
that neither
outside influences, such as the Church, nor the wishes of their
subjects within their realm had any part to play in
government.<a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[107]</a></p>
<p>Prior to the Reformation, the Church had a parallel system of laws and its
own courts.  The <i>Act of Supremacy 1558</i> (Eng) was enacted &#8216;for
restoring to the Crown the ancient jurisdiction over the State ecclesiastical
and spiritual&#8217;,
and in this the sense is of &#8216;order&#8217; or
&#8216;estate&#8217;.  &#8216;The supreme executive power of this
kingdom&#8217;,
as Blackstone stated, was vested in the
King.<a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[108]</a>  He was &#8216;supreme Head in
earth of the Church of England&#8217;.<a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[109]</a> 
That they were supreme head did not mean that they had any spiritual function or
status.  The King could not be regarded as an ecclesiastical
person <i>per
se</i>.<a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[110]</a> </p>
<p>After the Reformation the secular Parliament made laws for the Church, and
secular courts increasingly came to apply the law. If the
supreme government of
the Church lay with the King, in practice it meant the subordination of Church
laws to secular laws. In its
most extreme form, in England, this meant
Parliament made all laws, and convocation long lay
dormant.<a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[111]</a>  In New Zealand, it means that
much of the administrative machinery of the Church is dependent on secular
legislation, for practical,
technical reasons.  Yet it also means that the
Church is unable to alter its basic theological principles without the approval
of
Parliament, as it has chosen to state those principles in an Act of
Parliament. <a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[112]</a></p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading194"></a><b>VII	DISESTABLISHED AND NON-ESTABLISHED CHURCHES AND
THE DOCTRINE OF CONSENSUAL COMPACT</b></h2>
<p>The Church of England remains established in England.  Some of the Churches
of the British Isles,<a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[113]</a> and those of the
West Indies,<a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[114]</a> and
India<a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[115]</a> have been disestablished.  Since
the Church was never formally established in New Zealand, though it was
influential in the early
settlement
movement,<a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[116]</a> this category need not detain
us longer.</p>
<p>Most Churches are non-established, in that they are not formally recognised
or supported by the State, do not enjoy a privileged position,
and were never in
that position.  This is based upon the principles which governed the status of
the dissenters in England.  The
courts would not intervene unless a justiciable
right was at stake. Secondly, a trust for a religious body was enforceable as
any
charitable trust. Thirdly, members of such a Church were bound by contract
to one another.  In such a situation internal rules have
under secular law the
status of terms of a contract, enforceable as a matter of private
law.<a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[117]</a>  To these principles a fourth was
added. If a Church was at one time established, and its affairs regulated by
law, its members and
the trustees of its property would be deemed to have agreed
to use the applicable legal rules among themselves when the Church was
disestablished or carried into a new
country.<a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[118]</a>  In its purest form
establishment meant mutual recognition of Church law and secular law, and equal
validity within their respective
spheres.  This cannot apply where the Church is
based on voluntary membership alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The doctrine of consensual compact has been applied in New
Zealand.<a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[119]</a>  A fundamental consequence of
this doctrine is that internal Church rules are inferior to secular law in case
of inconsistency.<a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[120]</a>  In turn, challenges
to the validity of internal Church law, on both substantive and procedural
grounds, may be entertained by secular
courts.<a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[121]</a>  The relationship between Church
and State has been two-way, with the Church influencing secular law. For this
reason the Churches
are not simply in the same position of voluntary
associations such as unincorporated clubs, or incorporated societies.  Yet not
all
Churches are the same.  Those which retain in large measure the historic
canon law preserve also some of the historic nexus with
the secular State. </p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading208"></a><b>VIII 	THE APPLICABILITY OF PRE-EXISTING CANONICAL
SYSTEMS</b></h2>
<p>In the Episcopal Church of the United States of America (ECUSA) English
ecclesiastical law continues for some purposes
only,<a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[122]</a> but it does not generally apply in
Australia.<a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[123]</a>  Since they are consensual
bodies, these laws are not automatically enforceable.  Various devices are
employed by Churches to ensure
the binding effect of Church laws and the rights
and duties distributed by them, devices which may be applied to clergy, lay
officers
or the lay members generally: overriding principles containing general
statements that the law of the Church is binding; declarations,
promises or
oaths by which an undertaking is made to assent to or conform to the law of the
Church or the decisions of its
tribunals;<a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[124]</a> provisions requiring
compliance with executive directions (typified with the doctrine of canonical
obedience). </p>
<p>Unlike in England, in most of the overseas Churches canon law is binding on
the laity.<a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[125]</a>  Though Maitland argued that
the <i>decretals</i> were binding, Kemp countered that this view was
anachronistic.<a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[126]</a>  The modern view of the
1603 canons was similarly limited.<a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[127]</a>  The
starting point was <i>Middleton v
Crofts</i>,<a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[128]</a> a proceeding for marrying
without banns or licence.  The secular court held that the canons did not bind
the laity, as Parliament
did not confirm them.  A canon would, however, be
binding if it was declaratory of &#8216;the ancient usage and law of the
Church.&#8217;<a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[129]</a>  This latter point
appears to conflict with contemporary views, however, and may no longer be good
law.<a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[130]</a></p>
<p>Church of the Province of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, is an
autonomous branch of the universal Catholic Church, as well as
a provincial
Church of the world-wide Anglican Communion.  At the top of it comes the Queen
in Parliament, &#8216;over all persons
in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as
temporal, throughout her dominions supreme&#8217;, for Parliament can legislate
for the
Church as it can for anyone.  This is a consequence of the Reformation,
and it is a fact which the Church has little choice but to
accept, for even
consensual associations are subject to the secular power, even if &#8216;the ...
Church of England ... is not a
part of the constitution in any colonial
settlement&#8217;.<a name="fnB134" href="#fn134">[131]</a>  Equally important,
the Church in this country has chosen, for pragmatic reasons, a model of
government which appears to emphasise
the links of Church and State on the
English model.  The Roman Catholic Church relies to a lesser extent upon secular
legislation,<a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[132]</a> in part because of its
post-Reformation tradition as a non-established Church in England, and in part
because of its more fully developed
canon law and active judiciary.</p>
<p>The Church, however constituted, cannot avoid the consequences of the triumph
of secular power.  Gone are the days of parallel legal
systems and courts,
though ironically the Church of England in England has, since 1919, enjoyed a
considerable measure of independence,
as the Measures of the General Synod have
the full force of an Act of
Parliament.<a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[133]</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading229"></a><b>IX	THE TREATMENT OF THE ANGLICAN CHURCH IN
STATUTE</b></h2>
<p>The <i>New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990</i> (NZ) recognises that everyone
has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and belief, including
the right to adopt
and hold opinions without
interference.<a name="fnB137" href="#fn137">[134]</a>  It also provides that
everyone has the right to manifest his or her religion or belief either
individually or in community with
others, in worship, observance, practice, or
teachings, and either in public or in
private.<a name="fnB138" href="#fn138">[135]</a>  The Church is bound by the
provision of this Act just as any natural or artificial person is.  Thus it is
both precluded from imposing
its doctrine or practices upon unwilling subjects,
but is equally protected against suppression. </p>
<p>The provisions of the laws of the Church are without contractual force and
are not justiciable in a civil court,<a name="fnB139" href="#fn139">[136]</a>
except to the extent that they be involved in a matter concerning church
property governed by statute.<a name="fnB140" href="#fn140">[137]</a>  But there
are a great number of statutes which regulate aspects of the Church&#8217;s life
and work in New Zealand.<a name="fnB141" href="#fn141">[138]</a> Many of these
are concerned with the property which the Church acquired since the nineteenth
century, and are similar to many others
enacted for the benefit of particular
churches or other organisations.</p>
<p>The Church is not exempt from regulation by general legislation.  The Church
is therefore bound by the prohibition on discrimination
on the grounds of
religious belief. It is also unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sex, or
on a number of other grounds, in
employment, the provision of goods or services,
access to public facilities housing, and education.  It is unlawful for an
employer,
or any person acting or purporting to act on the employer&#8217;s
behalf, to refuse or omit to employ a qualified applicant by reason
of the
applicant&#8217;s religious or ethical
belief.<a name="fnB142" href="#fn142">[139]</a>  But the <i>Human Rights Act
1993</i> (NZ) allows for the different treatment of people based on sex where
the discrimination is for the purpose of an organised religion
and is required
to comply with the doctrines, rules, or established customs of the
religion.<a name="fnB143" href="#fn143">[140]</a>  'Religion' is, however,
defined widely.<a name="fnB144" href="#fn144">[141]</a></p>
<p>Ministers of religion<a name="fnB145" href="#fn145">[142]</a> are prohibited
by statute from disclosing in any proceeding a confession that was made to the
minister in his or her professional
character, except with the consent of the
person who made the confession.<a name="fnB146" href="#fn146">[143]</a>  Any
communication made for criminal purposes is, however, not
privileged.<a name="fnB147" href="#fn147">[144]</a>  Whilst only a minority of
marriages are today conducted in a church, the names of ministers of religion
that have been sent to the
Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages by
any of the religious bodies referred to in the <i>Marriage Act 1955</i> are
entered in the list of marriage
celebrants.<a name="fnB148" href="#fn148">[145]</a></p>
<p>It can be seen that the Anglican Church, and to a lesser extent other
religious denominations, enjoys a special legal status in New
Zealand.  It is
not an established church- though the Church of England took a leading role in
early settlement of this country,
but it does, often in common with other
recognised Churches, enjoy certain legal rights not enjoyed by other corporate
bodies.  Many
of these statutes owe their origins to the extensive grants of
land to the Church of England during the nineteenth century, particularly
in the
province of Canterbury.<a name="fnB149" href="#fn149">[146]</a>  More recently,
provision has been made for the better management of land given by Maori, or for
the benefit of Maori.</p>
<h2 align="center">
<a name="Heading248"></a><b>X	CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p>The concept of separation of Church and State, so influential in many parts
of the world, never really had any relevance in this country.
 Belief in this
separation is alien to both the secular and spiritual laws.  Civil law cannot be
separated from Biblical law, for
the Biblical doctrine of law includes all law,
civil, ecclesiastical, societal, familial, and all other forms of law.  The law
of
Western civilisation has historically been Christian law, and the nexus
remains crucial, for both Church and State.  The ecclesiastical
law of the
Church of the Province of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia is partly created
by the State.  The laws of the Church
are made by the Church itself, and its
members are bound to one another by consensual compact.  But several
parliamentary statutes
&#8216;declare and define the Powers of the General Synod
of the Church of the Province of New Zealand&#8217;, they govern the alteration
of the formularies of the Church. </p>
<p>The Church is neither established nor disestablished, but rather the Anglican
Church in New Zealand may be classified broadly as quasi-established
in the
sense that whilst having the status of contractual societies, there are close
legal links between the Church and State, the
authority of internal Church law
rests at least in part upon the existence of secular legislation, and secular
legislation expressly
and directly regulates some of the temporal affairs of the
Church.  The result is that although the Church is free to regulate its
own
doctrinal and liturgical laws, it is not purely a voluntary association, unknown
to the law.  While this means that certain of
the formularies of the Church may
not be altered without parliamentary approval, this is not necessarily a bad
thing, for it imposes
upon the Church an external check, something which the
Anglican Communion cannot do, and which had been lacking since the
Reformation.</p>

<br><a name="fn54" href="#fnB54">[51]</a> The ecclesiastical law of England
consists of the general principles of the <i>ius commune ecclesiasticum
</i>(<i>Ever v Owen</i> Godbolt&#8217;s Report 432 (Whitlock J)); foreign
particular constitutions received by English councils or so recognised by
English
courts (secular or spiritual) as to become part of the ecclesiastical
custom of the realm; and the constitutions and canons of English
synods. The
<i>Submission of the Clergy Act 1533</i> (25 Hen VIII c 19) (Eng) provided that
only the canon law as it then stood was to bind the clergy and laity, and only
so far as it
was not contrary to common and statute law, excepting only the
papal authority to alter the canon law, a power which ended later
in 1533, when
it was enacted that England was &#8216;an Empire governed by one supreme head
and king&#8217; (<i>Appointment of Bishops Act 1533</i> (25 Hen VIII c 20)
(Eng)). New canon law could only be created by Act of Parliament, and now by
Measure, under the <i>Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919</i> (9 and 10
Geo V c 76) (UK). Any canon is binding on clergy in ecclesiastical matters:

to be a canon or prebendary of St David&#8217;s Cathedral, Pembrokeshire, Wales.
This is, however, clearly
the result of confusion between ownership of the
temporality and personal spiritual authority. In some respects however the
Sovereign
remains a quasi-religious person. This is seen in the ceremonial of
the coronation- particularly the anointing, and in the royal
robes and
vestments.<br>The <i>colobium sindonis</i>, a loose, sleeveless gown of white
linen-lawn cambric, is symbolic of the derivation of royal authority from the
people, being once
worn by all classes of people, and is in form similar to a
clerics alb or surplice, or a Bishop&#8217;s rochet. It is thought to
be derived
from the robes of the Church rather than from those of the emperors, although
they also wore the <i>colobium sindonis</i>. <br>The royal stole was derived
from the &#955;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#963;, (loros) a jewelled scarf of the eastern
emperors. This originated
as the <i>stola </i>worn by noble ladies in the early
Roman Empire. Senators and consuls were required to wear a coloured pall or
scarf over the alb and
<i>paenula</i> by the sumptuary Codex of Theodosius
(382). Shortly afterwards it became a distinctive badge of episcopal status. The
<i>Liber Regalis</i> (1307) requires its use although it has only been used
since James I. <br>The <i>supertunica </i>is a long coat of cloth-of-gold,
reaching to the ankles, and lined with rose-coloured silk, having wide flowing
sleeves. The <i>supertunica</i> is derived from the full dress uniform of a
consul, and the later &#963;&#945;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#963; (<i>sakkos</i>) of
the Byzantine emperor. As it has, however, been worn since at least the time of
Edward the Confessor, and the &#963;&#945;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#963;
was only
appropriated by the patriarchs in the twelfth century, the extent to which it
was in origin a sacerdotal robe is disputed.
The
&#963;&#945;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#963; was originally a penitential garment, and
became a peculiarly solemn vestment for patriarchs
in the thirteenth century,
and for all archbishops by the fifteenth century.

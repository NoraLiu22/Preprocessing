<P><BR>
The family Mydidae (also spelled Mydasidae and Mydaidae)** is a small but
worldwide family of brachycerous flies of medium to large size bearing a
superficial resemblance to some wasps. Adults of extant forms can be found
in hot areas resting in sunshine or visiting flowers. Immatures have been
found feeding on larvae of scarabs and other beetles.<BR>
<BR>
Only one record of this family is known from the fossil record.<BR>

**  The derivation of the name <I>Mydas</I> Fabricius, the type genus upon
which the family-group name is based, is open to question and has resulted
in various familial spellings (see note by Evenhuis <I>in</I> Daniels, 1989:
322).<BR>

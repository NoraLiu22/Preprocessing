After such period, we will automatically renew your subscription for a new term as described at the time you accepted the offer, charged to the payment mechanism you authorized at the time of your offer acceptance (which may be a credit or debit card, or third party payment device such as Paypal) until you tell us to stop.

      <h4>Embedded Video Links.</h4>
      <p>Certain pages of the Web Site may provide the functionality for you to “embed” videos appearing on the page on other web sites or blog pages (together with the Player, as defined herein, the “Embedded Video”). The functionality is provided
        by giving you the necessary HTML code to include on such page to make that Embedded Video appear. If you include the HTML on a web or blog page, the actual video stream for the Embedded Video will be served from our servers but the Embedded
        Video may be rendered to the visitor of that page as part of that page. If you elect to embed video on a page, you agree as follows: (i) you will not alter, in any respect, the Embedded Video (including without limitation the content, format,
        and length, and the advertising associated therewith) from how it is served from our servers; (ii) you will not facilitate access to the Embedded Video through any video player or other tool other than the video player that is provided by us
        when the Embedded Video appears (the “Player”); (iii) you may use the Embedded Video on an advertising-supported page provided that: (a) the Embedded Video shall not be included in, or used as part of, a service that sells access to video
        content; (b) you shall not insert advertising, sponsorship, or promotional messages in, or immediately adjacent to, the Embedded Video or Player; and (c) to the extent you sell any advertising, sponsorship, or promotional material to appear
        on the same page that includes the Embedded Video, the page must include other content not provided by us which is a sufficient basis for such sales. You may not block, inhibit, build upon or disable any portion of the Player, including
        without limitation links back to our site. You understand and agree that all measured metrics related to the access and viewing of the Embedded Video shall be credited to the Web Site. Without limitation of any provision of these Terms of
        Use, we shall have no liability to you for any reason with respect to your use of Embedded Video, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, and our directors, officers, employees and agents and those of our affiliates, from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising in any way from your use of the Embedded Video.</p>

      <h4>Dispute Resolution: Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes, Waiver of Class Arbitration. </h4><p> 
<b>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</b>: Except as noted below, any and all disputes, controversies, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and us (including, but not limited to, disputes related in any way to the interpretation and scope of this Section 24, these Terms and Conditions generally, our Privacy Policy, and your use of the Web Site and Web Site Services) shall be settled exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration (“Arbitration”). THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, PROCEDURES FOR ARBITRATION ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN LITIGATION RULES IN COURT, AND REVIEW BY A COURT IS LIMITED.<br/><br/>

<b>AAA Rules and Procedures.</b>  Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before one commercial arbitrator. The conduct of the Arbitration shall be subject to AAA’s then-current rules and procedures for commercial arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, the then-current supplementary rules and procedures for consumer-related disputes (collectively, “Arbitration Rules and Procedures”). YOU SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT YOU ARE BOUND TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES IN ARBITRATION, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. Payment of Arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA’s fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case we will pay as much of your Arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. We also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for all Arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision or remedy under the governing law that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses.<br/><br/>

<b>Information on AAA </b>, its Rules and Procedures, and how to start arbitration can be found at http://www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.<br/><br/>

<b>Exception.</b>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the dispute arises from a violation of your or our intellectual property rights in any manner, both parties agree that the non-infringing party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a state or federal court consistent with the Governing Law and Jurisdiction subsections below, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Additionally, you or we may take the dispute to small claims court if the dispute qualifies for small claims court.<br/><br/>

<b>Waiver of Class Arbitration:</b> To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. You further acknowledge and agree that any arbitrator assigned to a dispute shall not, and lacks the authority to, conduct class arbitration or award class-wide relief and that such arbitrator shall only hear your individual dispute. You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly waiving any right to participate as a representative of any class of claimants pertaining to any dispute subject to Arbitration, such that you shall not be entitled to arbitrate any dispute as a representative plaintiff or claimant, class representative, class member, or private attorney general.<br/><br/>

<b>Governing Law:</b> These Terms and Conditions and all disputes between the parties shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York between New York residents, without regard to any conflict-of-law provisions which result in the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. Further, in any Arbitration, both parties agree the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized under New York law.<br/><br/>

<b>Enforcement of Arbitration Award:</b> The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br/><br/>

<b>Severability:</b> If any portion of this Dispute Resolution section (with the exception of the Waiver of Class Arbitration subsection) is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be severed and removed from these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining portions (including the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection) shall remain binding on you and us. If any arbitrator deems the Waiver of Class Arbitration subsection to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection shall be null and void. Under such circumstances, you expressly acknowledge and agree that the Governing Law and Jurisdiction subsections apply to any disputes between you and us, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<br/><br/>

<b>Jurisdiction:</b> If, in any dispute, this Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, notwithstanding the Severability subsection above, or null and void by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, or if the dispute seeks injunctive remedies arising from a violation of your or our intellectual property rights, the dispute shall be resolved by a state or federal court located in New York County, New York, USA. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such New York state or federal courts for the purposes of litigating any such dispute. This subsection does not apply disputes made in small claims court.

We also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for all Arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys\u0026#8217; fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision or remedy under the governing law that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys\u0026#8217; fees and expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eInformation on AAA \u003c/b\u003e, its Rules and Procedures, and how to start arbitration can be found at http://www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eException.\u003c/b\u003e  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the dispute arises from a violation of your or our intellectual property rights in any manner, both parties agree that the non-infringing party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a state or federal court consistent with the Governing Law and Jurisdiction subsections below, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Additionally, you or we may take the dispute to small claims court if the dispute qualifies for small claims court.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eWaiver of Class Arbitration:\u003c/b\u003e To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. You further acknowledge and agree that any arbitrator assigned to a dispute shall not, and lacks the authority to, conduct class arbitration or award class-wide relief and that such arbitrator shall only hear your individual dispute. You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly waiving any right to participate as a representative of any class of claimants pertaining to any dispute subject to Arbitration, such that you shall not be entitled to arbitrate any dispute as a representative plaintiff or claimant, class representative, class member, or private attorney general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eGoverning Law:\u003c/b\u003e These Terms and Conditions and all disputes between the parties shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York between New York residents, without regard to any conflict-of-law provisions which result in the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. Further, in any Arbitration, both parties agree the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized under New York law.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eEnforcement of Arbitration Award:\u003c/b\u003e The arbitrator\u0026#8217;s award shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eSeverability:\u003c/b\u003e If any portion of this Dispute Resolution section (with the exception of the Waiver of Class Arbitration subsection) is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be severed and removed from these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining portions (including the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection) shall remain binding on you and us. If any arbitrator deems the Waiver of Class Arbitration subsection to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection shall be null and void. Under such circumstances, you expressly acknowledge and agree that the Governing Law and Jurisdiction subsections apply to any disputes between you and us, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eJurisdiction:\u003c/b\u003e If, in any dispute, this Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, notwithstanding the Severability subsection above, or null and void by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, or if the dispute seeks injunctive remedies arising from a violation of your or our intellectual property rights, the dispute shall be resolved by a state or federal court located in New York County, New York, USA. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such New York state or federal courts for the purposes of litigating any such dispute. This subsection does not apply disputes made in small claims court.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n      \u003ch4\u003eSupplemental Terms.\u003c/h4\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eGetty Images Notice:\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eGetty Images still images and visual representations (including, without limitation, from Getty Images wholly-owned Sport, MLB, NHLI, AFP Sport, and Bongarts Sports) may not be republished, retransmitted, reproduced, downloaded or otherwise\n        used, except for downloading for personal, non-commercial use.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eS\u0026amp;P \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/company/dow/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDow\u003c/a\u003e Jones Notice:\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is proprietary to and is calculated, distributed and marketed by DJI Opco, a subsidiary of S\u0026amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC and have been licensed for use to S\u0026amp;P Opco, LLC .
